tutorial on object oriented PHP in this
tutorial I'm basically going to cover
everything you'd ever want to know about
object oriented side of PHP and I have a
lot to do so let's get into it okay so
what I'm going to be using in this
tutorial is Komodo you can use a basic
text editor but I just decided to use
this because it's free and just to give
you another idea what you can develop
PHP with and you can find it at Komodo
IDE com download forward slash number
sign edit and I also have it in the
description now before we start I
thought I would very quickly cover
exactly or at least roughly what
object-oriented programming means now if
we have a basic class man what that's
gonna mean is all men have attributes
like the man you'd see here he might
have black hair his name might be Bob
you might have an array of ties shirts
pants and shoes and we also all have
abilities or functions or operations
that we can perform like every man can
talk walk run throw eat and work now
object-oriented programming allows us to
model real world objects inside of
things called classes they are the
blueprints for creating objects and
inside of those classes we're going to
define the attributes and the functions
or methods that those objects can do and
that is the basics of what it means to
be a class on what a class does and what
an object is we model real world objects
in object-oriented programming that's
why it's so awesome so what is
inheritance well let's say we have an
object that is called man and we want to
create a more specific version of a man
called Mark well what we're going to do
is mark is going to inherit all the
attributes and functions that are in the
man class and then we can build or
change those attributes and functions in
the mark class and that is basically
what inherence is an overriding just
means that we would go in and say
override a function so that a function
doesn't do what it previously had done
now when I refer to functions they are
also referred to as methods and
operations but they are basically
functions some people might disagree
with me saying that but either way just
to keep this basic you can think of
methods functions and operations as
being
the same things so what is polymorphism
aside from being a big word well like we
just saw there mark inherited all the
attributes and all of the functions or
methods from the man class whenever he
created the mark class now if he goes
into the walk method and instead of just
printing out walk he and said says he
wants to print out walk fast
whenever Java sees that it is getting a
man object that is trying to walk it is
going to print out walk to the screen
and whenever it sees the mark class it's
going to say oh you inherited the walk
method from the man class we're going to
go in and make certain that you didn't
change the walk method in any way job is
going to see that we instead want to
walk fast with the mark object and hence
it's automatically going to print that
out now polymorphism can get a lot more
complicated from there but that is just
a basic gist or something just to
understand and you'll understand a lot
of how the polymorphism works and that
brings us to interfaces what is an
interface well basically when our class
mark decides that it wants to implement
an interface what it's in essence doing
is signing a contract that says I the
mark class promised to implement any
methods or functions that are in the
interface and I'm going to show you
examples all these different things
right now okay so this time I have
Komodo on the left and I have Google
Chrome on the right and I have my server
set up in localhost and I'm just going
to execute things first thing I'm going
to do is come in and create a class well
all you do is type in class and in this
situation I'm going to type animal and
that is going to be it I'm going to make
some changes to it later of course and
then inside of this what I'm going to do
is I'm going to define the attributes
that I want my animal to have well the
very first I'm going to do is I'm going
to type protect it in here and there are
different ways to categorize both
methods as well as attributes you can
have protected you can have public and
you can have private now private means
that only methods or functions in the
class can access and change this data
public means that any
can directly access and change the
values for these attributes and
protected is just like private meaning
that only methods in the class can
access and change this data however when
we create a subclass like we did mark
from man the subclass is going to still
be able to change the value for this
attribute so I want the protection of
private but I also want subclasses to be
able to inherit all this data so if it
was private couldn't do that just stick
around here you'll get it so I'm going
to create a couple protected attributes
and let's say that all our animals are
going to have names and all I'm doing
here is defining the attributes we have
and let's also say that each of these
animals is going to have a favorite food
my favorite name favorite food protected
again they're all going to make a
specific sound and they are all going to
have a specific ID number this brings us
on to the next thing I want to talk
about which are static attributes and
this time I'm going to make this public
so anybody can access this and let's say
that every time I create a new animal
object I want to automatically increment
the number of animals it's going to
start off at 0 because we haven't made
any animals yet and what static
ultimately means is that every object of
the type animal that is ever created
they are all going to share number of
animals so if this number goes up to one
it's going to go up to one for every
other animal object that is created and
if you ever want to access a static
value and make a change to it I'm going
to show you how to do this later
you're just going to type in the class
name with two colons and then number of
animals and then you could go and add
one to this or do whatever I'm going to
actually show you this in an example in
a second another thing we can have
inside of here are constants and there's
a constant and let's just say I want to
put Pi in here for some bizarro reason
so I'm just going to put in 3.14159 and
there we go in a constant just means
that it's going to be constant and it's
never going to change its value if you
want to refer to that once again you're
going to type in the animal class name
or the class name two colons and then PI
in this situation that's going to
you access to that and once again I'm
going to show you that in a second now
you're going to define functions inside
of classes just like you to find
functions in anything so let's say I
want to create a function that is going
to return the name this is a situation
in which we have something called
encapsulation not complicated remember
when we talked about private and
protected and public well by marking
these as protected or private
we are encapsulating or protecting that
data we were saying that we don't want
anybody to come in here and willy-nilly
be able to change the data we're going
to say instead is if they want to get
the name for my animal they're going to
have to call to get name function and
when they do we're going to return it
and we encapsulate or protect data so
that they can not go in there and do
things like change the name of my animal
to a number or something nonsensical
okay
just to protect the data and as you can
see right here if we want to refer to an
attribute inside of a class what we do
is we type into this meaning this
specific object and we want the name
that is stored for that specific object
this is basically used as a generic way
to say that we want the name for
whatever the current object we are using
because it's not going to be able to
address the object by name so we just
use this
now another functions that is very
useful is called a constructor and two
can create that we just type in
construct with two underscores in front
of it and then what this guy is going to
do is initialize things or set some
values whenever we create every animal
well what do you think would be a good
value to change well we're going to need
an ID for our animal that's going to be
random and unique and we're going to
have to increment the number of animals
when we create a new animal object so if
we want to create ourselves a new ID we
want to refer to our ID for our animal
object that we created we just go this
again with that little arrow and then we
go Rand and then we want to Janet
generate a random number let's say
between 100 and 1 million we would just
do that and there we go so now each
animal that we create is going to sort
of have
random number and let's say that we want
to echo out to the scream the ID this
like that ID and then we'll put some
text in here has been assigned and then
we'll throw a break statement in there
at the end with a semicolon of course
and now I'm going to show you how to
access the static attribute that I
talked about before we're just going to
type in animal two colons and then we're
going to type in number of animals and
we are going to increment it because we
created a new animal object another
thing we have available to us is what's
called a destructor now let's just put
public in front of that and two
underscores and destruct now the
destructor is going to be called when
all references to an object have been
unset so if there's some housekeeping
you want to do whenever an object is
deleted you could do so in this
situation what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to print out to the screen
that the object has been deleted is
being destroyed of course you would
never use this but in your website but
whatever
put a little frowny face there and there
we go now remember up here where we were
creating the get name function so that
we could get the value of name for our
different functions well PHP actually
provides a shortcut way to be able to
create what are called getters and
setters Gators are going to get you the
value of these attributes and setters
are going to set the values and because
they're protected that means we need to
use a function to change these values
and get these attributes and these
little handy dandy things are called
magic setters and getters and these are
actually magic methods as well anything
with an underscore is a magic method so
if we want to define a function inside
of the sky that is going to be able to
get anything from the type in function
and then we're going to type in git and
we're going to pass the name of the
attribute that we want to get to this
function whenever it's called and if we
want to print something out to the
screen just to show that something's
going on here we could do something like
asked for name which is going to be the
attribute they're asking for and a break
statement again and then if we want to
return it the attribute we can just come
in here and go this and the name that
was passed inside of here so we're going
to put a dollar sign and name because it
would get confused otherwise it would
think this was the name we're looking
for this is going to return whatever
attribute is passed in here and I'm
going to show
examples of all these here in a second
now if we want to set the value this
time I'm going to do something a little
bit more complicated just to do
something a little bit more complicated
I'm going to check that the attribute
that they sent in here was actually a
valid attribute now with this you're
going to pass in the attribute name and
the new value that you want to set for
set attribute and let's say I want to
check that the name they passed in is
actually a valid attribute one thing I
could do is use a switch statement here
and then I can come in here and go case
and I'm just like I said I'm just doing
this to show you how to do it then we
could come in here and say if it's name
while we know name exists so set name to
whatever the value is and then we can do
pretty much the same thing well we're
going to throw in a break statement also
there we go
and we could do the same thing with
favorite food do the same thing with
sound what's the set the sound for my
animal and then finally if it's none of
those attributes what I'm going to say
is I'm just gonna echo out to the screen
name not found and then after all that's
done I get out of my switch statement I
can come down here and just to print
something out on the screen I could
print out set name to value so there
that is and that is how the little magic
methods for setting and getting or or
used and like I said before inheritance
occurs whenever you create a new class
by extending another one and like I said
we're going to inherit all the
attributes and methods that are defined
in the superclass animal in this
situation is a superclass inside of the
subclass so what we're going to do is
we're going to create a new class and
it's going to be called dog and if we
want to inherit everything from animal
we're going to type in extends and then
animal later on I'll cover interfaces
now let's jump up here and let's create
a function that we are just going to
override so we'll create a function
called run inside of our animal class
we're in the animal class right now and
let's say this one goes echo this name
runs no throw break statement in there
and then we'll actually just copy this
because we're going to override it and
as you can tell I don't need to put the
attributes inside a dog that are in
animal they're automatically gare so
name is already inside of this and let's
say that our dogs run like crazy and
that's how you override a method so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
jump outside of the dog and
animal class and start creating them and
you can watch everything sort of execute
here over inside of Chrome so I'm
outside of both of the classes and if I
want to define a new animal I just go
animal and let's say I want to say
animal one is equal to new animal and
there we go and the constructor this guy
right here is going to be called
whenever I create this new animal and I
could also pass in attributes for the
constructor but I decided not to do that
now what I'm going to do is come in and
set the attributes for my new animal
object I created and I'm just going to
type in name and I'm going to give it
the name of spot and then I'm also going
to set favorite food equal to meat and
then I'm going to set the sound that my
animal makes to ruff now if I want to
print out all this new data onto our
screen I could do something like echo
animal one name says and then call the
sound for my animal and then go down to
the next line and we'll say something
like give me some and then would say
favorite food and then let's say we also
want to print out the ID number here my
ID is put another period and all the
code is of course available on a link in
the description and then if I want to
print out the ID I just go ID and then
if I also want to print out the total
animals that have been created go total
animals is equal to and then if I want
to call that static value number of
animals remember I just type in the
class name colon colon number of animals
put another period inside of there throw
two break statements in there and there
we go
now I can go over inside of chrome and
execute this and you're going to see
that the ID number has been assigned the
name of spot has been assigned favorite
foods meat sound is rough I called the
Gator to get the name the sound and the
favorite food and then it printed out
all of that information on the screen
and then you can also see here that spot
was destroyed after the object was no
longer needed this is the destructor
function right there if I want to come
in here and also print out the favorite
number just to show you how to print a
constant from a class favorite number
again just type in the class name and
pie and we'll throw in a break statement
and there you can see favorite number
printed out as well now I'm going to do
exactly the same thing except I'm
use the dog class I'm going to come in
here and just copy all this because
there's not much I need to change paste
that in there and I'm going to change
this to animal too and it's going to be
of type dog change that to to change
that too to change that to two two two
two two and I can change this to dog and
it's still going to be able to get it
and I'm just going to come in here and
change the attributes and it change this
to Grover I'm going to change this to
mushrooms just to be weird and I'm going
to change this to Gurr
save it come over here execute and there
you can see we created a new ID number
the name is set to grow over all those
things are working
Grover says gir give me some mushrooms
my ID is blah blah blah blah blah one
thing you might find weird hero is
animals shows up as to there are still
two animals created and even though
we're referring to a dog in this
situation it is still going to increment
the numbers because it ultimately calls
the constructor inside of the animal
class now the next thing to talk about
here is we went in here and we overrode
the run class so here we have runs for
our animal class and here we have runs
like crazy for our dogs class so I'm
going to show you exactly how that works
come in here and just go animal one and
if we want to run a method inside of
here we just type in whatever the
object's name is and then whatever we
want to run an animal to in this
situation and run and when we execute
you're going to say spot runs and Grover
runs like crazy and you can also see
here Grover's destroyed spot is
destroyed now what would happen if we
want to actually come into our animal
class and define a function that we
don't want to allow these subclasses to
override well we're in the animal class
right now it's actually quite easy we
just type in final and then if they try
to override it in the dog class well
it's just going to throw up a whole
bunch of errors so I'm gonna allow it to
happen so let's say we create a function
called what is good and all it says is
running is good and once again if we
wanted to execute this we would have to
come in here and just say what is good
again we're going to use the same
whatever the objects name is why don't
we could just do this what is good and
you can see running as good as right
there so even though it's just an animal
of course it's going to run inside of
dog class because it inherited that
another thing we could do is you see
here where we're printing out all this
information well let's say we wanted
this information to automatically be
printed out anytime the user said echo
and then followed by the name of our
object well we could do that what we're
going to do is we're just going to come
in here and copy this and then we're
going to go up into our animal class we
go right here and we're going to use
another magic method and this one's
going to be called two string and all
two string does is it defines inside of
here what happens whenever the user says
I want to print some information out on
the screen whenever somebody goes echo
and follows that up with the name of the
object all you're going to do is type in
return they're going to print out what
you want to show up except you're going
to want to change all of these specific
object names to this just change these
to this this this and then here we're
going to change this to animal of course
and everything else can stay the same
and then you could do something like
echo animal one just type in the
object's name save it execute and there
you can see it printed out on the screen
right there
now remember when I talked about
interfaces and interfaces are just a
contract that says that any class that
implements an interface must define the
functions that are inside of the
interface and this is a way for us to
take advantage of polymorphism so we're
going to do here is define an interface
by going in typing interface and let's
say we want to say singable we want to
give our animals the ability to sing and
we're going to come in here and find the
function but we don't say what the
function does we just leave it like that
and what that means is when we go into
say our dog class and say implements and
then singable that it is going to force
us to define sing inside of it so we're
going to say function sing and if you
don't define anything a function is
automatically public and we're gonna say
echo this name sings then we'll do
something like or gegege semicolon at
the end and then we're going to do
exactly the same thing with our animal
class so come up here and the great
thing about using interfaces is you can
only ever extend one object but you can
implement an
rending array of interfaces so that's
why they are very useful so singable
it's going to say we have to create the
sync class insider here or the sing
method there we go and there we are and
then we're just bow-wow-wow
then if we come down here and go animal
1 or animal 2 or whatever and call sing
it is going to print that out on our
screen so there's an example using an
interface another example of
polymorphism is here where we're going
to be able to define functions that are
going to be able to accept classes that
extend a specific class or a specific
interface
here's polymorphism in action again so
this is outside of any of the classes
we're going to come in here and we're
going to type in function and then we
could say something like make them sing
and then we could say singable because
both the animal and the dog objects are
both of type singable and you can just
type in singing animal here and then we
could just type in singing animal and
call sang and it's automatically going
to execute the right sing in the right
animal even though it doesn't say here
that it's a animal type or of dog type
it says it's off singable type so we'll
be able to just come in here and go make
them sing and pass in animal 1 or animal
2 and when we execute it's going to
automatically have the right animal st.
say there you go
and of course since you can do this with
the different classes that implement the
different interfaces of course you're
also going to be able to do it with a
dog class because it extends the animal
class so here what we're going to do is
go function sing animal you can see
there it's animal type singing animal
once again this is outside of any of the
classes and I'm just going to copy this
up here so I'm gonna type it out again
and once again I'm gonna be able to go
sing animal sing animal I know let's
just copy these there you go execute and
you can see it prints out the right
things even though all I cited here was
that I was passing animal objects okay
polymorphism in action another type of
function you're going to have inside of
PHP is what are called static functions
now static functions or methods can be
called without the need to instantiate
or create an object sounds like a big
word but they're not really that's what
it means when somebody says instantiate
that means they just created an object
let's just go into the animal class
again
and I'm going to type in static
beginning this belongs to the class add
these and let's say that I wanted to
accept number one and a number two as
like a utility function that doesn't
really make sense that my animals will
be able to add but I wanted to have this
in here for some bizarro reason this is
terrible form by the way but I'm just
doing this just to show you what a
static function is number one plus
number two through a break statement in
there and now what I can do is come down
inside of here and do something like
echo three plus five is equal to and if
I want to call that static function I
just go animal which is where it resides
and then I call add these and then let's
say I pass in three and five and then if
I execute it you can see three plus five
is equal to eight that's a static
function and now run through a bunch of
other different things you can do with
PHP you can check the class type so
let's say something like is it an animal
we want to check if it's an animal you
would go and put something like animal
two and then instance all and we'll say
animal and yes indeed
it'll - even though it's a dog object is
an instance of the animal object type
and then we'll say that we want to
assign true if it is or false if it
isn't and you could go in here and put
other different things inside of here
and check the class type on your own
echo do something like it is that animal
I'm using single quotes here so I can
actually type in animal two in this
situation with the dollar sign is an
animal very statement it is true that
animal two is an animal say it printed
right there another thing we could do is
clone which is make a clone of an object
and you could actually inside of your
class define the things that you want to
be copied over to any clones and you
would just create a function inside of
it with the magic to underscores with
clone after it and then that would be
called anytime something was cloned but
just to keep this nice and short I'm
just going to show you how to create a
clone so let's go animal clone is equal
to and then you would just type clone
and then you'd go animal one now we just
create a copy of it another thing you
can do is define what are called
abstract classes and also abstract
methods now an abstract class
and not be instantiated it cannot have
an object be creative type whatever the
abstract class is but instead it forces
classes that implement it to override
every abstract method that exists inside
of it you want to create an abstract
class you just type in abstract class
and then whatever you want it to be
called and then inside of it you're
going to define all of the different
methods or functions that must be used
by any class that implements this
abstract class so it's just random
function and it could have an attribute
in it or it could have whatever so
there's an abstract class and then you
could also use something that I almost
never used which is call inside of a
class and if it is defined inside of a
class what this is going to do is
provide method overloading but since PHP
isn't strongly typed there's really no
reason to use it now I just wanted to
briefly give you an idea I mean I
covered pretty much everything but I
wanted to give you an idea of how this
is used and how this is used in things
like well I'm going to show you this
this is very simple let's say I wanted
to create a way to very quickly be able
to or very easily be able to define the
title description keywords and author
for my website and also provide ways to
get those titles and also provide ways
to create the opening part of my HTML
document and like I said I'm dumbing
this down a lot ok so I would go in and
define all these functions and all this
information I then inside my website
could just do this I would say require
and site info dot Inc is the name of
this file right here I could just come
in here and very quickly whip out a site
ok now things normally aren't done that
way because you're normally pulling data
from databases and setting things up
right so what I decided to do is go into
WordPress and I did a ton of tutorials
and this is how WordPress and every
customer management system works this is
it
so you can see here I'm including data
that I want to use or functions I want
to execute and you can see right here I
have things like git header this is
WordPress and this is automatically
going to pull that information from this
file and you can see right here that
this is going to call a function and
it's going to do all kinds of customized
things using PHP right inside of your
web page
okay so that is just a rundown of
object-oriented programming in general I
covered this stuff in my wordpress
