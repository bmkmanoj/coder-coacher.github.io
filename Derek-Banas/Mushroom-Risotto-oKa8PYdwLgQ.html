another cooking tutorial today I'm gonna
show you how to make risotto because I
had to pull out recently and you guys
said you wanted to see risotto here
first off I'm gonna teach you something
about cooking this is what's called a
mirepoix it's two parts onion one part
celery one part carrots and sometimes
you can use garlic with that and that's
another type of New York law so that's
what that fancy term is and I'm gonna
make a mushroom soda and just hack up
everything
okay so there's all of my diced
vegetables now since it's a mushroom
risotto I have to cut up the mushrooms
and I promise if I ever cut myself I'll
actually videotape it whether you want
to say it or not
okay so got everything all chopped up
this is my mushrooms I'm gonna keep
these separate and then I'm gonna throw
this into a skillet on high with a
tablespoon of olive oil like I said it's
about a half a cup of onions quarter cup
of carrots and a quarter cup of celery
and this is 8 ounces of mushrooms need
that because it's a mushroom risotto but
I'm gonna hold off on putting the
mushrooms in until I first put the
aromatics in which is this here's my pan
I'm gonna put in about one tablespoon of
olive oil I'm gonna mix this out a
little bit and then I'm gonna add my
onions and my carrots and my celery and
I'll stir these around a bit get them
cooking for about two minutes and about
a minute in I'm gonna hit it with rocks
and place one two tablespoons of garlic
reason I did that is the door that cooks
up a little bit quicker so it's tiny and
I don't mind that we'll be in an odd
sort of size kind of think it gives it a
country sort of earthy feel okay we're
two minutes in now I'm gonna hit it with
two cups of the risotto right and the
reason why people think risotto is so
hard to make is because it's soft
running outside than it is on the inside
that means that you need to get it
covered with oil whenever you put it
inside there but like you see there's
only a few tablespoons of oil normally
people put butter in if you want to do
that you're more than welcome to put
butter into it and you have to start and
stir it and stir it another reason why
people think risotto is hard to cook
it's a little labor-intensive that's
definitely not hard to cook you know how
to start and right whenever it starts to
get translucent I don't know if you can
tell her life as you can sort of feel
like you can see it it looks like you
can see through it at that point in time
I'm gonna hit it with that means it's
ready to really start sucking up on the
stuff that's in the opinion put it in
about a half a cup of white wine
and all the alcohols gonna burn surely
there forever smells really good then
meanwhile another pan I'm gonna start
cooking up the mushrooms stir stir stir
stir stir and then I have dried porcini
mushrooms and kind of the expensive type
of mushrooms they're cheap because I've
dried here I had these sitting in hot
water for about an hour I'm gonna chop
those up and throw them in there that'll
give it a real big flavor boost throw
some in there here's the reserved liquid
from the mushrooms give it a real major
mushroom flavor they're only in the
mushrooms being Wow in another pan this
pan cooking up the mushroom that I got
up before and to make sure that I keep
stirring this
then while that is cooking or the two
things are cooking I'm going to grade up
one and a half cups of Parmesan Reggiano
cheese for regular Parmesan cheese just
parmigiano-reggiano taste it a little
bit better I had to walk better I'm
about five minutes in here and I've
switched over to chicken stock and it's
homemade chicken stock but you can use
regular chicken stock if that's all you
have I just can't eat chicken Sophos I'm
allergic to MSG so five minutes in you
know when I put the mushrooms in there
take them out of that pan put them into
this thing you want to keep inducing
additional layers of flavor to this
risotto rice because that's what makes
it good and just keep it from sticking
on the bottom as best as you can and
continue stirring and keeping it from
sticking on the bottom over and over and
over again whenever it feels like it's
starting to get dried out add an
additional cup of chicken stock and just
continue going at it and adds more
chicken stock
in stir it up I'm now at exactly 15
minutes in the risotto just tastes good
to me
the texture at this point in time I like
asparagus in it but I didn't with the
whole thing tastes like asparagus so the
very last thing I'm gonna add here is
asparagus except for one and a half cups
of parmesan or corners on a Reggiano
cheese and all I did there was just for
15 minutes straight I stirred it
whenever it started to feel dried out I
went and dumped in more sauce when I put
the Parmesan cheese in I shut off the
heat it was on high the whole entire
time it's at 15 minutes after it the
rice hit the pan it is in essence done
you ever take a couple minutes depending
upon burners being different and then I
just stir that in and this is decadent
this is like one of the most
unbelievable things will ever eat if
you've never eaten risotto try it most
restaurants mess it up they normally
overcook it which is probably more like
it's been sitting on the oven heating or
warming or sitting in the oven heating
and warming all day
homemade risotto is hard to beat do you
