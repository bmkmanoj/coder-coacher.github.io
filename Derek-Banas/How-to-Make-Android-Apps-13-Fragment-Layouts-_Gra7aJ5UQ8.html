13 of my tutorial on how to make Android
apps in this part of the tutorial we are
going to finish up the application we
started in part 12 so definitely watch
that if you haven't seen it yet I'll
provide a link to it in the description
under the video and what we're going to
do is focus in on getting the details
activity to work as well as the details
fragment to work and then we're going to
set up our new activity in the Android
manifest don't remember from last time
which I'm sure you do what we have here
is when we're in portrait mode whenever
we click on one of these superhero names
we're going to automatically launch a
details activity which is going to
replace this activity over here which we
made previously and when we're in
horizontal mode when one of these items
is clicked on this information is going
to be updated using the details fragment
let's jump in start writing some code
alright so most of the complicated stuff
was done in the last tutorial but
there's a couple other things we need to
do here so the very first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to go in and
create a new Java class and I'm going to
call this guy details activity and of
quarter sets Java file and here it is
I'm just going to step through here
piece by piece and create everything
that we're going to need so the first
thing I'm going to do is this is an
activity so it's going to extend
activity just like that and
automatically updated our libraries and
then I'm going to come in here and
create a couple different things so it's
just right click and go to generate and
then let's go to override methods and
what we're going to look for here is on
create so this is going to be fired
whenever the activity is created we can
leave this here of course and the very
first thing we're going to do whenever
this is created is check to make sure
the device is in landscape mode and if
it is we are going to shut down this
activity because this activity is only
meant to be here whenever we are not in
landscape mode when we're in portrait
mode and we're going to do that by going
for get configuration and then checking
for the orientation and then checking if
it is equal to configuration dot
orientation landscape and like I said in
that situation which we are in landscape
mode we're going to call finish we
is going to effectively kill our
activity and then we're going to put in
return done now if we did not kill our
activity then we're going to be down in
this part right here and the very first
thing we're going to do is try to figure
out what type of detailed information
we're supposed to put inside of here and
we're going to find that by calling
Saved instance state and checking if it
is equal to null and if it is what we're
going to need to do is create the
details fragment so details fragment
which is the class we haven't created
yet actually when we jump over and
create it so details is equal to new
details fragment so let's go and create
details fragment come over here right
click new Java class and details
fragment of course this is going to be
used whenever we are in horizontal mode
and this is going to extend fragment
this is going to be a little bit longer
than normal and the first thing we're
going to do here is we're going to jump
into the titles fragment Java right here
and you're going to see right here where
we created the details fragment by
calling new instance so we're going to
have to go in and create that and of
course it's passed the proper index so
the proper hero data is shown back into
details fragment and we're going to go
public static details fragment and one
thing I want to make you guys aware of
that doesn't run necessarily after this
tutorial is I've been having a problem
lately where a lot of people think I'm
not answering their comments and the
reason why is if you are not on Google+
and you leave a comment on YouTube
chances are I will not see it or I will
not be able to respond to it actually
the second one I won't be able to
respond to it so just want to make that
100% clear okay so it's passed the index
data inside of here and then we have to
come in and create our details fragment
of course it helps but right new details
fragment then of course like we were
talking about before bundles are going
to be used to pass data and we're going
to be using the key named index in this
situation that's how we're going to know
what type of superhero data to put on
our screen so create that bundle and
then args dot put int and we're going to
say this is index and then we're going
to put whatever the index is in this
situation and then we're going to assign
the key value to this fragment or
to be doing a lot more with bundles here
as the tutorial continues so if there
are in any way confusing don't worry
about it you will get used to them
because we'll use them over and over
again okay so we have that fragment
created for us here and we have index in
there for the key and we're assigning
everything properly another thing we're
going to want to do is provide an easy
way for us to come in here and get the
index that we're going to be using get
shown index and whenever that's called
all we're going to have to do is just go
get arguments and get int and then we
just provide the index key and 0 and
that's all we're gonna have to do for
that now we need to handle on create
view in which the layout inflator is
going to put our fragment on the screen
so we'll just come in here and go
generate override methods and inside of
the fragment class you're going to see
on create view and there this is and
like we've talked about before the
layout inflator is just going to put a
fragment on the screen the view group is
going to be a view that you want to
attach the fragment to and of course the
bundle way over here is going to have
the keys and the values that we want to
be able to pass between activities we're
just going to rid of this return
statement right here and we're going to
come in here and the very first thing
we're to do is create a scroll view so
that we'll be able to put our hero data
in it and then users will be able to
scroll through it so we're just going to
say scroll you call this scroller is
equal to new scroll view we're going to
have to pass a context so that with
resources that we're going to need are
going to be available so just go get
activity use that a lot and then we're
going to put a textview inside of it
which is going to hold all of our hero
data so we have to come in here and
create that for ourselves and again we
have to give a context that's going to
provide access to all of the data that
we're going to need to be able to create
this and then this is a new win we're
going to apply padding to our textview
in a completely different way so first
we're going to create an INT give it the
name of padding we're going to cast this
into an integer and I'm the next page
and then we're going to go typed value
and a type value is going to be able to
hold multiple dimension values which can
be assigned dynamically inside of code
just like we're doing it right here
again something we're going to use a
whole bunch times so if you don't quite
get it just holds a bunch of dimension
data and we're going to go
type value and I'm going to have to type
this out because I can't see it because
the text is so big so when you go
complex unit D IP and what we're doing
here is just defining the unit type that
we're going to use and this is of course
is device-independent pixels and then go
down to the next line and we're going to
define our padding right here in this
situation which is going to be four and
then we're going to get the specific
display data for the device that this is
going to be running on get resources and
then we're going to say get display
matrix then close that off that's just a
nice way to be able to define dimensions
using a specific unit specific padding
and the device itself that is running
the application and then we just come in
here to our textview and we can set our
padding and in this situation we'll just
say padding padding padding and padding
and there it is and now that we have the
padding set up for our textview we can
just add our text view to our scroller
and then we're going to take whatever
the currently selected hero's name is
and put their specific data inside of it
so we're just going to go superhero info
and we're going to call specifically
history which is the name of the array
and the superhero info class that we set
up in a last tutorial and we're going to
go get shown index and we got it and
then we say return scroller which is the
scroller it's going to contain our
textview and that's it we're done with
that and now we can jump back over into
the details activity and finish this guy
up so here we got our details fragment
ready to go because we know we are in
horizontal mode and now I just need to
get the bundle of key value pairs which
is just one which is going to be the
index that we want to use and sign them
to the details fragment so I'm going to
go details and set arguments get intent
and get extras is how we get access to
that information then we want to go and
get our fragment manager and state we
want to begin our transactions with this
fragment and then we need to define we
want to specifically use the details
fragment in this situation it shut down
to the next line
plugging details in there and then
commit oh and come over here and type in
ID there we go all set now we had a
little bit of an error over here in the
titles fragment
you might have to update that we have to
come in here and go get shown index now
that's fixed all those errors went away
and the only thing left for us to do is
to update our Android manifest with our
new activity that we just created so
it's open add up as well and to define
our new activity that we want to use
just go inside of the manifest go right
after the first activity the main
activity that we have defined inside of
here get myself a little bit more space
so we'll be able to see everything here
all at one time and this is just another
activity and we're going to use the
details activity that we just created
and we're going to call label and find
our app name then we can close that off
and then define an intent filter and I'm
going to get more into intense in the
very next tutorial
just keep simple Android name Android
and the next thing up since I've covered
fragments pretty thoroughly here of
course we're going to come back to
fragments again and again especially
when I start making some real apps it's
just to find that as a view and of
course whoops forgot to do this just
close this off alright so there's a
whole bunch of pretty interesting and
pretty fully colored ways of working
with fragments in the next part of the
tutorial I'm going to go heavily into
intense and of course I'm going to cover
more in fragments whenever we start
making regular applications please leave
your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
