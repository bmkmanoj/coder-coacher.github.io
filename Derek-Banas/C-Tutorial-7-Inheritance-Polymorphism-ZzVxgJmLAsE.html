my C sharp video tutorial in this part
of the tutorial we're going to cover
protected inheritance delegates
superclasses polymorphism virtual
override inter classes and a whole bunch
more like always all the code as well as
a transcript of this video is available
in the description underneath this video
and I have a lot to do so let's get into
it okay so here I am in Visual Studio if
you are on a Mac you can use the MER in
exactly the same way everything is
exactly the same alright so what we're
going to do here is we're going to get
more deep very deep into how
object-oriented programming works inside
of c-sharp first thing I want to cover
is we're going to talk about inheritance
but let's say that we do not want a
subclass to be able to inherit from our
class how do we do that well we just
type in sealed and that will keep it
from inheriting and by inheritance I
mean that a class can come along and
inherit all of the fields and methods
from our animal class in this situation
so let's come in here and start adding
some things so I'm going to very first
off I'm going to go private string and
name I'm going to give a name for my
animal and then I'm going to go
protected string and sounds and by
marking this as protected that means
that this field data can be changed by a
subclass directly and I'm going to show
you exactly how that would work in an
example here as the tutorial continues
to just remember that sound is protected
while name is private I'm then going to
come in and I'm going to define a method
and later on and make this virtual but
right now I'm going to make it void
don't worry if you don't know what
virtual means by the end of this
tutorial you shall so let's just come in
here and say make sound and what I want
this to do is to output some information
on the screen in regards to the name and
the sounds this animal makes and in this
situation I want to use interpolation
with the string that's going to be
output you're going to see what that
means so I'm going to be able to go and
put a dollar sign here and then instead
of coming in and going 0 like I did
previously I can actually come in and
instead type in name and then commit
and say says and I can type in sound and
I'm going to create those properties
here in a second so you don't have to
use the zeros in the ones as long as you
put the dollar sign right there and
sometimes that's convenient and
sometimes it's not convenient now let's
come in here and we will create our
constructor and then we'll create our
name and sound properties as well so
we'll go in and say public animal and we
want this to call a constructor that is
going to receive more than one parameter
so we're going to go this and then I'm
going to say that my default is going to
be no name as well as no sound and we
covered that in the last part of the
tutorial and then we just put our little
curly brackets there and everything's
great and this is just giving me an
error because that hasn't been created
yet so let's go in continue creating
constructors we can also come in and go
public animal and handle a situation in
which only one parameter is passed in so
here we'll say string and name once
again we're going to come in and say
this and here we will pass the name and
then we will also pass no sound to the
other constructor close it with the
curly brackets and now we can create the
constructor that is going to accept both
of us so we'll say animal once again and
we'll say string and name and then
string and sound right like that
and now this is going to be able to
properly assign the and once again I'm
going to call the property that hasn't
been created yet let's see up it's not
let me do it so what I'm going to have
to do is come down here and actually
create these properties so I'm going to
go in and I'm going to say public string
and name then inside of it I'm going to
do a getter and it is just going to
return whatever the value for name is
set s and then I can also come in and do
a setter for this and this is going to
be more specific what we're going to say
here again is that we're not going to
accept something if the name contains a
digits we have something against numbers
as names for our animals we'll go any
and this is going to check every single
value inside of this string to see if it
contains a digit we'll be doing some
more cool things with things like any
here very soon
make sure that we come in here and go
any and then surround that like that and
in the situation in which we do not
contain a or which we do contain a
digits we're going to say that we want
to just give it the name of no name and
otherwise we can come out of here and
say name is going to be equal to value
remember whenever we are dealing with
setters that are going to be
auto-generated like this with properties
that the value that is assigned and with
the setter to name is going to be given
the default name of values so you always
have to use value in that situation now
we're basically going to do the same
type of stuff here with our sound
properties so let's just come in here
and do this and let's change this to
sounds here we'll say return sound and
just because sound is protected we do
not need to come in here and change
anything with it or do anything
different with it and here we're going
to say if and get rid of that let's say
we want to keep the maximum size to be
less than 10 so we'll say value and
length and greater than 10 in that
situation we're just going to assign no
sound to it and otherwise make sure we
have is that the sound of course and
then otherwise we're going to go and
assign the value that was passed in to
sounds okay and now that we have that
set up our constructor up here is going
to allow us to type in names so we'll go
in here and we'll type in name like that
and we'll assign it to whatever the name
was passed in and we'll also be able to
come in to sounds in us on the sound
value that was passed in now we have our
animal class defined and now I want to
go in here and start working with our
dog class and you can see right here if
you want to inherit all of the
properties as well as methods that are
assigned to animal all you have to do is
put a colon and animal pretty simple
stuff it's very important to be aware
that you can not inherit from multiple
classes I'll get into ways of getting
around that later on but in this way
right here you couldn't do something
like animal and
person if you wanted to do a man-dog or
something like that okay so we'll get
into that later on now it's very
important whenever you commit here not
only can you go and inherit all the
properties and methods from animal
you're also going to be able to add
additional properties or fields so let's
say that we want our dogs to have the
ability to have multiple sounds we can
come in and go public string and we're
going to go sound to and to keep this
simple I'm just going to go and have it
generate the getters and setters and
then I'm also going to come in and
define a default if they decide that
they do not want to pass any values
inside of there okay so pretty cool
stuff the thing that's important is
we're going to be able to overwrite
methods and I'm going to show you two
ways of doing this one way is to do new
and then type in void and then make
sounds and that's one way to overwrite
it I'm going to show you another way
here in a moment like I said and in this
situation it's a console and right line
and then I'm going to use string
interpolation once again and I'm going
to do basically the same thing I'm going
to type in name like that and as you can
see it's not giving me an error because
it's getting the name from the animal
class we created earlier and I'm going
to say says and there we go sounds and
then I'm also going to go and output
sounds - which is the other property
that we use is just defined inside of
there alright so you have that all set
up so the thing that's important is that
we will be able to define constructors
inside of our new ant dog class and at
the same time call our animal class to
initialize values inside of it so how we
would do that is just go public and dog
and say that we want to receive a string
name equal to let's go and give it a
default value of no name and then inside
of it will go string and sound equal to
no sounds or actually let's go and do
this inside of the other guy inside of
the main definitions let's cut that out
of there right there
come down here paste that in there
there's no sound and then let's also
come in and do the same thing with sound
too so those
and we'll call this sound to is equal to
no sound - alright so if you want to
call the superclass or the animal class
in this situation the class we inherited
from and have it go and initialize
everything for us what we're going to do
here is we're going to get rid of that
first off come down inside here and then
we were going to say base and TAS in
name and sounds remember it can't accept
sound - so we're not going to pass that
and then after that inside of our curly
brackets we can then assigned the value
for sound so so sound - like that so we
use base to call the super class animal
constructor to have it handle the values
for name and sound and then we handle
whatever is different about this class
inside of that constructor now that we
have both of those set up let's jump
over into program dot dot CS and start
playing around with these new objects we
created alright so here we are inside of
main and I want to go and create an
animal type and I'm going to call it
whiskers is equal to new animal and then
I can define the properties inside of it
so I'm going to say name is equal to
whiskers and of course put quotes around
this because it is a string and then
after that I can also come in and define
my sounds equal to meow and then make
sure you put your little semicolon right
there after that likewise I'm going to
be able to come in here and let's do the
same thing let's go and create a
different one here I'm going to type in
dog however instead of animal and if you
need more time with a slide to type
stuff in just hit the pause button I
like to use the pause button here it
gets lonely on YouTube and then I can go
a new dog like that and then I can go
name and let's have the name of course
be Grover and then let's have the sound
be wolf and then remember I also have a
sound too inside of my dog class and
let's just have that be ger just like
that okay so pretty easy stuff
so now let's test out and see what
happens here in this situation I also
want to cover how we can change remember
we've came down inside of animal we have
this marked as protected I want to show
you how we can go
and change that so must say Grover and
then sound and then let's change this to
wolf like that bigjon wolf and you're
going to say it didn't throw an error
because it's marked as protected and you
were able to go in and change protected
variables directly and then I'm going to
come in and call for the make sounds
methods and we can see how they differ
between the two of these there's Grover
and Grover's make sounds and we can run
it and as you can see whisker says meow
Grover says wolf and grrrrrr and you can
also note here that the wolf changed
because I was able to go in there and
directly change it because it was marked
as protected all right now something
else let's jump over into animal
something else that's important to
understand is inheritance has a is a
relationship so what I mean by is a is a
dog is a animal Wow what is called
aggregation or a delegate represents a
has a relationship so let's say that we
would like to have some information
create another class that is going to
define an object that is going to be
stored in our animal class that is a has
a dog or an animal has identification
information so let's actually jump into
animal ID info dot CS that's what it's
called and you can see it's right there
as well and we'll come in here and just
define a couple different things so I'm
going to say there's an int that
represents an ID number and we're going
to auto-generate
the getters and the setters for that and
give it a default value of zero and also
what we're going to do inside of here is
create a string that is going to
represent an owner for the animal if we
have one and that's going to be a getter
and setter as well and the default value
is going to be no owner all right so
there we are and there we are so there
we went and created animal ID info and
now what we're going to do is show how
is it how we can have a has a
representation inside of a class so jump
back over into animal I'm going to jump
in right here after I define those two
fields and I'm going to say protected
animal I
the info you can see it popped up right
inside of there and then I can go animal
ID info once again is equal to no animal
ID info and it doesn't receive anything
it just uses a default constructor so
that's all great now what I'm going to
be able to do is come in and say public
void set animal ID info and have it
receive an identification number as well
as a strength that is going to represent
the owner for this animal and want to
pay reference to it and you just go
animal ID info like that and ID number
like this and pass in the new
identification number for this guy and
we'll just copy this as well and then
we'll also be able to come in here and
define the owner for our animal and I'm
not doing any checks here but of course
you could and you probably should and
make sure that this is uppercase okay so
we have that set we can also then come
in and create a method that is going to
pull that information out of there so we
can say public and void and get animal
ID info and doesn't receive any
parameters and then what it is going to
do is just output on our screen for us
the information that we have in regards
to that so we're going to come in and
we're going to say name pay reference or
our animal that we have here has the ID
o and then if we want to reference that
animal ID info guy we can just do that
right there and then type in ID number
and is owned by once again come in
animal ID info and in this situation go
and get the owner of set animal print
all that information out on our screen
and everything a little peachy jump back
in program dot C s and let's test this
out just to show that indeed we have set
that up properly so here we're going to
say whiskers and set animal ID info like
that and it will pass in a number let's
say
one two three four five and then we'll
pass in an owner and say Sally Smith
owns that animal and then show also we
can do the same thing for our dog
because it automatically inherited all
that so set animal ID info once again
I'm gonna sit one two three four six and
then we're going to say Paul Brown owns
Grover with that inside of there and
then we would be able to come in here
and for both of these guys just go
whiskers for example and get and yd info
like that and then do exactly the same
thing for Grover so like this and
get-and like that and like that and if
we run it you're going to see that
whiskers had the ID one two three four
five and is owned by Sally Smith and
Grover had the idea one two three four
six and is owned by Paul Brown okay so
that's how we can use a delegate or an
aggregate or whatever you want to call
them they're basically just objects
stored inside of an object and if you
forgot what I was doing here we come
back here and you can see I defined this
animal ID info which is a reference to
this class right here and it has all
that information and it stores it inside
of the animal class alright so pretty
cool stuff and very useful stuff as you
are going to see as we do bigger and
more complex projects now I want to talk
about the concept of inter classes now
you can actually create classes inside
classes or inner classes and they are
normally used as helper classes for the
outer class because the inner class will
be able to access private members of the
outer class that surrounds it so let's
say that I would want to have an inner
class in this situation and what it's
going to do is provide me health
information on my animals so what I'm
going to do first I'm going to make sure
that I am outside of any functions right
here but still inside of the class which
I am and I'm going to go just like
anything else I can go public and class
and what I'm going to do is call this
animal health and then inside of it I am
going to create a method that is going
to return a true or false and it's
basically just going to tell me if my
animal is a healthy weight or not so
what it's going to reduce
is going to receive a double that's
going to represent the animals heights
in inches as well as a double that it
represents the animals height in weight
and I'm just doing something silly here
I don't even know that this is true
about animals just something I'm playing
with so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say if the height is divided by
the weight we're going to deem that this
animal is healthy if a couple situations
occur here if the value is greater than
or equal to 0.18 and the calculation is
less than or equal to 0.2 7 so I'm just
making a justification based off of
height what the weight of the animal
should be like I said I don't know if
it's is true actually I would guess that
it's probably not true all right so
those don't hold me by this I'm guessing
this is just something I made up so in
that situation I'm going to say return
true and otherwise if that came back as
false I am going to say else return
false okay so there we are that's a
demonstration of how we can have an
inner class and a little helper function
inside of it and add the functionality
of this class now we can jump back into
the programs ES file and we can start
messing around with this so let's come
down here right after this and let's
work with that inner class so if I want
to access the inner class what I'm going
to do here is just go animal and then
animal health reference that you by
referencing the outer class that
surrounds it I'm going to call this get
health is equal to new once again animal
dot and then animal health once again it
doesn't receive any parameters and then
from doing that what I'm going to be
able to do is let's go do a
console.writeline and I'll say is my
animal healthy and we will find out if
the animal is healthy or not
then we'll go get help and then we can
go healthy weight and then pass in 11
inches and 46 pounds and we'll find out
if our animal indeed is healthy or not
so let's run that is my animal healthy
it comes back it's true and if we come
in here and let's say my animal is 11
inches in 100
46 pounds a little bit heavy you can see
that it comes back as false okay so
there we are so there's a demonstration
of inner classes and like I said as the
tutorial continues I'm going to be doing
real-world things with these things I
just wanted to demonstrate how they work
so that whenever you see them in a big
project you're not like what is that an
intra class okay so now you know what an
inner class is and now what I want to do
is talk about something called
polymorphism now you're going to be able
to come in here and you're going to be
able to define two animal objects but
have one actually be a dog type so let's
say that you had like an array of
animals you could actually store the
different types even if it's a dog it's
a subclass of animal as an animal but
I'm going to show you how that can
sometimes cause problems and then I'm
going to show you how to solve that so
I'm going to say new animal monkey
doesn't receive any parameters and then
inside of it I'm going to say name is
equal to happy and then I'm going to say
that the sound that our monkey is going
to make is e e you know like that
alright so there we go in we created an
animal monkey object now what we want to
do is we want to create an animal object
that is actually a dog and so I'm going
to call it an animal right here I'm
going to give it the name of spot
however we are actually going to call
the dog constructor to create it and
what that means is well let's come in
here change this to spot let's change
the sounds to wolf like that and then
our dogs are going to receive another
sound sound too and what we're going to
do is we are going to find that as well
now you're going to see what's wrong
with us okay so they're both animals
however defined as animals this uses an
animal constructor this uses a dog
constructor this is not going to throw
an error but something else weird is
going to have a problem is that if you
call a function in animal it's not by
default going to call the overridden
method in dog unless that method is
marked as potentially over writable by
marking it with the keyword of
virtual so what I'm going to do here
first is I'm going to show you what
happens if we try to call make sound on
both of these so we'll just say monkey
thefts and remember we have the make
sounds method inside of there for the
the animal class I'm going to call spot
and make sounds once again for it and
we're going to see what happens all
right and you're going to see happy says
E and spot says woof okay but where's
the second sound well if we jump over
inside off dogs jump into dog here done
that and let's look for make sound you
can see it's supposed to print out both
of the sounds it doesn't however and
what we need to do is we need to mark it
so that it knows that it should allow
for it to be overridden even if this
animal object is referenced as an animal
instead of as a dog this is polymorphism
this is the ability to go and label a
class as its superclass name however I
also have it act as the subclass itself
dog and whenever it is actually a dog to
call the right method to call this
method make sound instead of calling the
animal version of make sound which is
where is it make sound right there so we
don't want to call this one we want to
call the other one how can we fix this
actually pretty simple what we need to
do is come in here and say virtual what
that's going to say is that the make
sound method inside of subclasses may
override this and in the situation in
which it does override them use those
methods instead and then we go into dog
and how do we make this make sense
instead of new like we have right there
we type in override and we do that and
if we start it and run it you're going
to see that indeed the classes now work
or the objects now work and call the
correct version of make sounds by
default so there you go guys there is
more information on object oriented
programming using c-sharp and then the
next part of the tutorial I think I'm
going to use object-oriented programming
to create a game think it's time for us
to do something a little bit more fun so
like always please leave your questions
and comments below of the last till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
