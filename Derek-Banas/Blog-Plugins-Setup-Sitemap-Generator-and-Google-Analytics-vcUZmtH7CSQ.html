going to talk about the fact that almost
everybody getting a website made today
is being ripped off and i'm going to use
Ronnie's website here Rodney's
restaurant.com website hopefully get
some heads because the web developer to
put this together for a ma certainly
isn't gonna many well if you see here
may have not noticed before I have a
tool here called the Alexa toolbar and
it tells me the google ranking for any
website that i go on if you're
interested go to alexa.com / toolbar and
click on this little button and you will
have the same tool for free just like me
but back to Ronnies restaurant first off
when a search engine comes to your
website it cannot read images so if you
have a word and it is in actuality an
image like Rodney's name here google
will never be able to read that also if
the links to everything on your website
is an image also Google cannot read that
and properly index your website so we
basically have a website that is
completely impossible to read that's bad
what's worse if you go to another
website it's called rank quest.com and
you click on a little tool called the
links view let me zoom in here and you
type in your website address and hit
spider it it will tell you exactly what
Google sees when they come to your
website well mr. Rodney Google will see
these four lines doesn't tell you much
tells you it's Rodney's website tells
you there's Easter reservations an error
on the links there is no content Google
will not be able to easily spider it's a
little way through your website and
index you properly hence nobody will
ever go to your website what else is
wrong with this website no it does not
end right there let's click on view left
click on page source if you look up here
in between these heading areas you
should have something called a
description you should have keywords
along with links and
of information what did this web
developer put on here a title that's it
a title so Google knows nothing about
your website and obviously this person's
not using keywords because there are no
words on the website all it basically is
is a bunch of images and Google cannot
read images hence will never do well
what also is his website missing
something called a sitemap XML file by
the end of this video you will have one
what is it also missing a robots.txt
file by the end of the video you also
have that ok now I'm going to show you
how to install XML sitemap generator and
just seeing us a sitemap dot XML file is
used to inform search engines what is
important on your site how often they
should visit your site and how often you
change your site and what is great about
this plug-in is it will notify
automatically all the search engines
that you tell it to every single time
you change your website in any way so
what you want to do is if you have
wordpress website you want to go to your
dashboard within your wordpress account
if you don't know what that means you
can check out the introductory wordpress
account you want to click on add new
then here you want to type in sitemap
and hit search plugins first one's going
to pop up as Google XML sitemaps you
want to click on install which is right
there and then it will install any one
click on activate plug-in and then in
your settings tab you can select Google
XML sitemaps or you can simply click on
plugins and will show you a list of all
your plugins and you want to click on
settings now this window will pop up for
you zero in here I've already generated
a sitemap brightness area you're going
to see that no sitemap has been
generated you want to click on the link
that says generate sitemap or rebuild
sitemap then what you want to do is
register over on bang so the bank knows
your website exists you want to go to
this address right here ww been calm
forward slash webmaster
this page will pop up you obviously need
to sign in whenever you do you can see
here I have five websites registered on
bang you are not going to have any more
than likely because you want to click on
add a site and this page is going to pop
up here the most important part is where
it says download XML verification file
don't you worry about what these all
this information means just follow the
steps live search site off dot XML
you're going to download that when you
click on this link then what you want to
do is jump into some ftp software this
is filezilla for example here you type
into your website address your username
and your password hit Quick Connect find
that file on your personal computer and
then upload it to your website you can
see it right here after you do that once
you cite the list which is down here
then you want to come on to this page

type in your your website address /type
map dot XML and then hit on smit and now
you are registered with bang okay now

yahoo and google set up google analytics
and create your site map and set up for
the google analytics plug-in with my
price all right now what you want to do
is go to developer dominate tml and of
course you need a goop a yahoo account
click on get an app I need the reason I
am all these pre-loaded is because
there's all kinds of information I don't

information that you see here on this
page it would be your yahoo ID and all
the information on your website then you
want to hit continue and it will give
your application ID it's a long string
of numbers and symbols you want to copy
that and then jump back into wordpress
and right down here if you look which
says notify yahoo about updates of your
blog you want to pay
it into your application ID right there
and you can see here I have a block down
then you want to scroll to the bottom of
that page again this is back in your
wordpress account I always set my
homepage to daily and my posts to daily
and then you want to hit update options
and then you have your sitemap all set
up and then jump back in here you want
to click on finished back on your head
and it will show you all of your
application IDs for everything that you
have notified yahoo about then what you
want to do is go to webmaster tools

do here especially for WordPress this
works easiest you click on this box
until you see upload an HTML file then
you want to click on this to download
that file and then you want to upload it
to your website again using a tool such
as filezilla you would upload that to
the root folder of your wordpress
account after you upload it you want to
click on verify then what you want to do
is sell google analytics is go into the
my account section within Google's that

the page it's one of the other then what
you do is you come down here there's
