tutorial on how to install a lick sir on
windows as well as on Mac OS and I'm
going to specifically be setting up
everything using the Adam text editor
and I have a lot to do so let's get into
it
okay so first I'm going to show you how
to install everything on Mac OS in the
description underneath the video I'll
have a link you can click on that go
directly to how to install everything on
windows alright so what you're gonna
want to do first is to get homebrew so
in your browser go to brew dot sh and
then what you're gonna do is you're
gonna copy this right here and you are
going to paste it into your terminal and
hit enter and it will install homebrew
and here is your terminal and what
you're gonna do is you're gonna type in
brew updates and a whole bunch of stuff
is gonna go on your screen it might be
different from what I have right here
and then after that you're gonna click
brew install elixir tour type that into
the terminal and hit enter and all of
that's going to install an elixir is an
essence installed now what we're gonna
do is setup Adams so if you don't have
Adam go to adam.com download for Mac
after you do that Adam is going to
install and then Adams going to open up
then you're going to come up here and
click on packages and command palette
and toggle whenever you do that you're
going to type in install and then come
down here where it says install packages
and themes and click on that after that
this guy's gonna open up you're gonna
type elixir and then inside of here
you're gonna click on install I already
have this installed that's the reason
why it's set up like that so click on
install and that'll be all set up then
all you need to do is just verify that
everything's been installed properly so
what you're gonna do is you're gonna
change to the directory wherever you're
going to store all of your elixir files
and inside of that directory you are
going to well first off you're gonna
create a file I called mine elixir Tut
dot e X and here is all of the code
you're gonna type in this is a simple
hello world for a lick sir then inside
of your terminal you're going to type in
ie X and hit enter after you do that
you're then going to come down and
you're going to type in C with
parenthesis and quote
and the name of your file and hit enter
after that and then to run the hello
world function that is inside here
you're gonna put a big capital m for the
module name and then followed by a dot
and hello and you should see hello world
and if you do all that elixir is set up
and you will be ready for my learn
elixir in one video tutorial which is
coming out very soon and now what I'm
gonna do is show you how to set up all
this same stuff inside of Windows
alright to install elixir on Windows
you're gonna go to a lick sir
- lang dot org forward slash install dot
HTML and then you're gonna come over
here and you're gonna click on download
and the Installer then it's gonna pop up
do you want to run it click on yes and
all that after you do that you're going
to see this welcome to the elixir setup
wizard click on next you're gonna have
this set to the latest version of elixir
I'm using 1.4.2
but they shouldn't change much from
version to version so everything should
be ok and click on next you're then
gonna see this window or something like
it just leave everything the way it is
don't check that and click on next and
then you're gonna click on install it's
going to say where your Erlang
installation is gonna be just leave
everything be the same way that it's set
up here and click on next
you're then going to have the default
installation click location for a lick
sir leave that ok don't change it and
click on next you're gonna definitely
want to make sure that all three of
these are checked and then click on next
and then finally click on install after
everything's installed it'll say that
it's all clear installed for you and
then you can click on finish now you're
going to want to go and install atom
which is going to be the text editor
we're gonna use in my learn elixir in
one video tutorial so just go to
adam.com download windows 64-bit and
then this little things gonna pop up
here on the screen it's gonna load the
spaceship until atom is ready to be run
and after it's all set up Adams gonna
automatically execute once it does
you're gonna see something like this
you're probably not gonna see this stuff
over here don't worry about it
what you're gonna do is go up here to
where it says packages click on that
come down to command palette and then
come down and click on toggle this guy
is gonna pop up you're gonna type in
install and then come down here where it
says install packages and themes and
click on that
and you're going to type in a lick sir
and then you're gonna come over here and
you're gonna click on install
everything's gonna be set up so what you
want to do is create a new project so go
to file add project folder click on that
you're then going to want to come here
and click on new folder and you're gonna
want to put it somewhere that makes
sense like your Derrick Manas directory
of course I'm joking you probably don't
have a Derrick bass directory but put it
in your users documents somewhere I
click on new folder you're probably
gonna want to call this elixir so that
you know what it is setup for and then
you're gonna want to come down here and
click on select folder now you're gonna
want to create an elixir file so right
click on the elixir folder you just
created and click on new file then up
inside of this thing you should call
this elixir Tut e^x just to make sure
they're everything's set up properly and
then hit enter after you do you're gonna
want to type in this elixir HelloWorld
program here just to verify that
everything is all set up over here on
the right side I went and changed to the
documents directory for myself and you
want to do exactly the same thing inside
of this to this guy that opens up you're
gonna type in ie X and hit enter you of
course are gonna want to save this file
if you don't save this file it's not
gonna work so save that file and then
you're gonna come in here and you're
gonna type in C parenthesis with double
quotes and the name of your file inside
of there and hit enter and then you're
gonna follow it with the module name
which is M you can see it's right there
and in a period and Hello which is gonna
execute this specific function so there
you go elixir is all setup whether
you're on Mac OS or you're on Windows
and you can prepare for my learn elixir
in one video which will be up in a few
days
