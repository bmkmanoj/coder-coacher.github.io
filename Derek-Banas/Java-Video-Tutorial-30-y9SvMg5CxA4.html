30 of my Java video tutorial series and
in this tutorial because you guys have
asked for it I'm going to show you how
to do pretty much everything with swing
components and create this extremely
convoluted looking layout that you see
here and show you a whole bunch of ways
of interacting with all these components
and how to push them all together in a
neat little package so let's just get
right into it I brought in all my
different libraries that I'm going to
eat here and these were all very common
libraries of course Java arts going to
handle some of your odd components
swings going to handle the rest of them
this Java swing event here is going to
handle if I'm handling this calendar
here is going to be used so that I can
have a date spinner and then this date
library right here is also going to use
so I can get today's date and of course
we're going to extend jframe you're
always going to do that whenever you're
using swing and here I created a jlabel
jtextfield jcombobox jay spinner jay
slider jay radio button a button group
that's going to surround the radio
button so that you can only select one
at a time a Jay checkbox don't need a
button group for that because gonna be
able to select multiple ones of those
and then a Jay text area that's also
gonna have a scrollbar
so pretty much heavy things gonna be
crammed into this guy so let's get down
into it and right here is where I'm
creating my frame and saying to put it
in the center of the screen here's where
I'm handling all the close events here's
where I have a title here's where I'm
creating the jpanel that is going to go
inside of the frame and then here's
where I'm going to be adding the panel
but inside of here I need to start
putting some components inside of this
guy now what am I gonna do well I'm
gonna take the panel and I'm gonna set
the layout as a grid bag layout the
superstore of layout tools here outside
of spring of course which we're going to
get to in later later tutorials so there
are set that up now what am I going to
do well I'm gonna take my label which I
defined above named label is equal to
new and then you just type in jlabel
and then I got a define exactly what
type of text that I want to show up
inside of there and that's exactly what
I want to put there and then I'm going
to need to add the component but what I
decided to do is add the component using
a method that way I'll be able to have
everything be more tightly controlled so
let's just leave this here for now and
let's come down here and create that
method and you can see here I already
went ahead and created this listener
which we're going to talk about here
okay so scroll way down here and I want
to create a method here and I'm going to
call it private void which means it's
not going to return anything add comp it
sounds like a good name for a component
and then I'm going to need the jpanel
past that I'll be able to add things to
it I'm also going to need the component
that I want to add to the grid bag
layout and just going to call it comp
and I'm going to have the exposition
passed over I'm also going to have the Y
position passed over component width and
then I'm also going to have component
height passed over and then if you would
want to pass over the anchor that's an
int as well and you're going to see what
all these things are if you don't
remember from the last tutorial and also
we're going to pass over the fill which
is going to determine how this item is
going to be stretched or this component
is going to be stretched so there's all
that stuff so now what I'm going to need
to do well I'm gonna need to define my
grid bag constraints now I could go
ahead and type all this out but why do
that instead I'm going to jump over to
the previous tutorial per 29 I'm just
going to copy all this stuff because
this is stuff that I'm going to need to
use so let's just grab it and we'll
paste it inside of there and I do this
constantly it's building up libraries it
allows you to really easily just copy
some of your old code and reuse it over
and over again so if I'm gonna have to
make a couple different changes here for
grid X I'm going to make this this guy
right here X position and then here
we're going to make this guy Y position
and then grid width I'm going to call
that component width which was also
going to be passed here I'm going to
copy that
because I love to copy and paste and
then we're gonna put in height inside of
here and for these guys I've decided I
don't really want them to do anything
remember from the last tutorial wait X
and wait Y it sort of helps you kind of
define exactly how your components going
to layout I decide to just leave those
as 100 which means they're not going to
have much influence and then down here
for anchor we scroll way down here
remember anchor here is place and then
fill is going to be stretched remember
they're integers when they're passed
even though they have these big giant
long names whenever they are passed to a
method they're considered integers so
what am I going to do here go inside of
there I'm going to change that to place
which was passed and I'm going to change
this to stretch it's going to allow me
to really easily make a lot of changes
to components using just one method call
which is going to be nice and then at
the end here I need to go the
annal and I need to go ad and I'm going
to say I want to add my component and I
want to use the grid constraints that I
defined above there you are so now
everything is going to be all in one
area and of course make that a capital P
all right so now I'm going to be able to
call this guy called add comp and then
pass all that information over and it's
going to be really nice so let's scroll
back up to where we were which is right
here let's add the label component so
what we're going to do we're going to go
add comp and I'm going to say law panel
and you better believe I'm going to be
copy and paste in this a lot then I need
to say okay what component do I want to
send over well the name label that's
what I just created exposition I'm going
to leave it at 0 since it's going to be
the upper left-hand corner Y position 0
again 1 is going to be the X width and 1
is going to be the Y width and then we
have grid bag constraints and I'm going
to say that I want it to be positioned
in the east or to the left and then grid
bag constraints again I need to define
if it's going to be stretched or not and
I'm going to say none in that situation
which means that I'm going to really be
positioning these guys in here really
nicely don't want to have a lot of
changes and then because I know I'm
going to need this guy I'm going to copy
it most of these components aren't going
to change that much
so now after I got that set in there I'm
going to create a text field it's called
name text is equal to nu J text field
and I want it to be 30 and width and
there you go
now what I'm going to do paste this big
giant thing inside of here however I
want it to be positioned to the west or
to but up to this guy say this guy is
going to be east which means it's going
to be forced to the right the labels
gonna be forced to the right and then I
want the actual text box to be forced
over to the left side of the screen this
is going to be called name text and then
I'm just going to have its width be
exposition to just change that and
that's all I need to do and let's say I
want them to enter their Street as well
well I'm going to create a new Street
label J label and I'm going to give it a
name and then paste or guy back inside
of here again and guess what this is
going to stay east just like that that's
going to be stay the same however I want
this to show up underneath of the name
label so I'm going to change its Y
position to 1y I'll leave everything
else the same there except I'm going to
change this to Street label which is its
name and that's done so then what do I
well I'm going to need to create another
text field and this is going to be
called street text is equal to nu J text
field and I'm going to make it 30 and
width again paste this inside of here
this is going to allow me to change that
going to change this to West this guy
right here is going to change to 1
because it's gonna be in the same
position again and then I'm also going
to make this two component widths or
columns wide and then of course don't
forget to change this to street text
let's make sure I got yes name label
name label named Tex name text Street
label Street label Street text read text
great everything's lining up alright so
now I want to create some radio buttons
like I showed you in that interface in
the beginning now for a radio button I'm
going to put those into a box layout I'm
going to call it sex box is male or
female and I'm going to say box dot and
I want to create a vertical box because
I want everything to show up vertically
one under the other male I'm gonna say
male radio is equal to nu J radio button
give it a name of male and then we're
also going to have female radio is equal
to Nu J radio button of course this is
going to be female well then what I want
to do well I want to have with a radio
button that they can only select one of
these items at a time so that means I
need to group them scroll up here real
quick button group sex group okay so
it's already been defined above so I
don't have to come down here and define
it again so we're just gonna go sex
group just so you understand this is
done so that only male or female can be
selected can't select more than one
there you are and then I need to add
radio buttons to this grouping you just
do that with the add guy right here and
we're just gonna say male radio and
female radio now those are added to that
group now you need to go in and actually
add these guys to a sex box which is
going to hold the radio buttons
remember this grouping is just so that
only one can be selected at a time it
has nothing to do with how they're
displayed on the screen female radio and
then I want to add a border around this
guy and what I want to do that I'm going
to add the border the sex box dot I'm
gonna set border and I'm going to say
that I want to give it a titled border
and I want the title for this to be sex
let's throw some a colon at the end
there and then
what do I need to do my ad comp again so
for this guy I want this to be butted up
next to the textbox like you saw at the
beginning of this tutorial so I just
have to define it is West sex box is
what I'm going to be adding to it and
I'm since I want it to be to the right
of the labels as well as the text fields
I'm going to move it over three X
positions and I'm going to find that
it's two in width and that's all I need
to do to add the radio button okay so
now we have the label the text field and
this radio button that is inside of this
box over here well now what we're going
to do is create a flow layout that's
going to contain this combo box the
spinner and the slider that you see here
on the screen and I'm going to do that
is to throw that into a flow layout so
let's open a soft jump back inside of
here and then right after we created our
radio box we're gonna go jpanel and i'm
just calling this state panel I don't
know because state is the first thing in
it and I'm going to go that and then
we're going to define that it is a flow
layout set layout you can see I'm using
multiple different types of layouts
inside of this one grid bag layout and
I'm going to say that I want it to float
to the left can also do center or right
and I want ten pixels between all the
different components horizontally and
zero pixels vertically all right so we
got that all defined scroll this up so
now I'm going to define my label equal J
label and I'm just going to call it
state of course make sure that's
uppercase and now I'm going to add the
label to my new panel called State panel
there you go well I want to create my
combo box so I'm going to create a race
drink call it States is equal to and
then I'm going to load it with some
abbreviations here doesn't matter just
using these as examples and then I need
to load my combo box which is called
stateless first I have to create it J
combo box and then I'm going to say that
I want the array of strings called
States to be loaded into a state panel I
think you can see here how you
eventually will be able to just create
this ray out of your head after practice
there you are just loaded in the combo
box as well date label to equal to nu J
label and I'm going to say appointment
date for that and then just go state
panel which is my
low layout and add the label to it's a
real easy roll that off and I want to go
and get today's dates equal to new and
to do that we just call the date method
there we go got that then I'm going to
create myself a date spinner I'm gonna
set the default for today and I give it
no minimum or maximum nu J spinner and
all the code for this is all available
underneath the video date model I'm
gonna go today's date that's going to be
its default value I'm just gonna say
null null which means it's not going to
have a minimum value nor is it going to
have a maximum I'm going to go calendar
day of month and what that means is it's
going to increment by days each time
somebody clicks on the spinner that's
what that means and you could also of
course have year in here instead of day
of month but year or you could also put
month also in uppercase letters and then
we have to use the date editor which is
just an editor that's going to make it
real easy for you to display and edit
the dates which a spinner dot date ad
turn date at turn is equal to new
instead of typing to side again we call
this guy here like that
here I'm just going to define date spin
which is my little spinner got there and
I'm going to find how I want things to
show up so I'm gonna say day month year
then that's going to handle everything
else for me they're just that's gonna be
nice just that need to come in here and
go to date spin dot set editor so it
knows what to work with and then date
editor and I just need to go state panel
and add date spin and that's going to
put my spinner inside of that flow
layout then we'll create himself another
age label just say new J label and when
I type in age and I'm going to give it a
default value of 50 we're going to be
changing out here in a second state
panel dot add page label because I said
I'm going to cover pretty much
everything I'm going to create a slider
is equal to Nu J slider give it a
minimum value of one maximum value of 99
and an initial value of 50 then I want
to change the value of the label every
time the slider is changed so I need to
go listen for slider l4
Slyder what I'm going to call this and
go new listen for slider and that method
will be called every single time someone
interacts with the slider and then I'm
going to go age need to add this
listener to my slider and just go l4
slider like that you can do that same
every single time and then of course
state annal add age slider and of course
you're going to need listen for slider
you're going to need to find out which I
already did and all this is doing is
saying hey if anybody interacts with the
slider we want you to come up here and
we want you to execute whatever is in
this method so we need to come down here
it's right here listen for slider
implements change listener we went over
all this before right here the events
going to be called here it's going to
say was the slider interacted with if so
we want age label which we just created
we want to set new text inside of it and
that text is going to be age followed by
whatever the value is currently for the
slider that you just created and then
now that we have all those different
components set up inside of that flow
layout well we need to take the flow
layout and throw it onto the screen and
how are we going to do that we're going
to get this guy up here add comp select
it we will copy it again down here all
right so what do we need to change here
now I'm going to change this to east
still have this is none and then I'm
going to say I want my position X to be
1 which means 1 in so that we draw a
little bit more emphasis to the name
labels and all that stuff
want it to be 2 down from where it was
before and why is that let's go up here
to this guy say here 3 and then this is
at 0 and if we screw up a little bit
longer you're going to see that this is
at 1 so this is the last text field we
entered so this is in the Y position
well this guy's in 0 because we want to
float to the right of those text fields
so what are we going to do down here
we're going to make this 2 that's where
that's coming from and we want this a 5
and width because there's a lot of
components there and one in height
because that's what works out for it now
we're going to create some check boxes
and that's really easy to do just going
to go J check box and I want them to be
able to check whether they prefer
morning afternoon or evening correctly
those and then we're going to throw
those in a box layout again remember I'm
just on purpose trying to use as many
late
as possible really and this is going to
be create vertical box just like
flowlayout and grid bag layout grid
layout so is a box layout and I'm going
to create my check box here and this is
going to be called morning this is
afternoon and there is evening so now
what do I need to do well I need to
throw all these guys into the box that
we created this guy option box so
function box dot add morning check
afternoon check and evening check okay
they have all been thrown into the box
and then we need to create the little
border Factory let's come up here and
just grab that you can see that's here
and let's just grab all this so I'm
using the same guy that I used for my
radio buttons save myself some time
paste that in there and this is going to
be changed to option box and then this
is going to be changed to time of day in
this guy we're going to set one of
course don't forget changes to option
this is going to be one because we want
it to be one in from the left side of
that screen it's going to be three down
because the last component we put on the
screen was two down I'm going to let
this two width and one height be the
same I went this two but up to the top
and also to the left side of the screen
so what am I going to do I'm going to
call this North West
that's exactly what it does and leave
everything else to say and then finally
we have our text area and I called it
about you and say equal to nu J text
area and I want it to be six in height
and 40 in length and I want to set some
default text for it about you but I'm
not done with this text area yet I want
to make sure that if the text doesn't
fit on a line I want it to jump to the
next line and then continue putting
things out set line wrap to draw but if
you don't remember from previous
tutorials you have to also define that
you want your words to stay intact and
you just come in here and go set wrap
style to make sure your words I'll stay
intact and we're going to make this be
true as well and just to continue adding
everything we're going to add scroll
bars and it just goes J scroll pane J
scroll bar one is the name of it then
I'm gonna new J scroll pane and I want
to add those two about you the J text
area that we just created and then I
need to define how they're going to be
displayed and I'm going
say that I always want scroll bars that
are vertical just vertical scroll bars
always then I'm going to copy this have
to type all that out again paste now I
need to define if I want to have
horizontal ones and I'm going to say
horizontal scroll bar as needed and then
of course you could also have vertical
or horizontal scroll bars always or
vertical or horizontal scroll bar never
also all in uppercase letters and just
close that off and of course this is J
scroll pain not panel sorry about that
so now that we created that I'm going to
need to go to the add comp again get
this guy pasted distance out of here and
this guy I want it to be but it up to
the right side of the screen so I'm
going to change it to East I believe
this is none scroll bar one is what I'm
going to be adding to this guy and to be
adding it to the panel of course just
like before and then I want it to from
the left side of the screen for the
exposition I'm going to leave this three
I want it to be three and width and I
want it to be one in height and
everything else there is exactly the
same this is where we're going to be
adding the panel to the frame what pack
does is it's going to adjust the frame
size to best work with all of my
components and in setvisible of course
is going to make my frames show up and
if I execute that here it is there's all
the information everything laid out here
on the screen leave any questions or
comments below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
