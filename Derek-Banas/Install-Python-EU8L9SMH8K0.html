tutorial on how to install Python on
both windows as well as on Macintosh a
lot of you guys have asked me to cover
this again so I'm going to cover it with
updated software I'm and I'll show you
how to install python version 3 on
windows and mac as well as how to set it
up so that you can run code directly
inside of the atom text editor first I'm
going to show you how to install it on
Windows then I'll show you how to
install it on a Macintosh and in the
description underneath the video you can
click on it if you want to jump directly
to the Mac part otherwise let's jump in
and I'll show you how to install
everything on Windows right now ok so
the very first thing you're going to
want to do is go to python.org forward
slash get it forward slash windows if
you're on Windows of course and then
right here you're going to want to click
latest python 3 release and that's
python 3.5 but if it says something
higher than that don't worry everything
will more than likely work for you so
we're going to click on that and you're
going to see this page right here and
we're going to scroll down to the bottom
and whenever you do you're going to see
windows x86 executable installer this is
the easiest way to install it so click
on that and whenever you do you're going
to see this little option come up down
here do you want to run it say yes you
do by clicking on it and then this guy
is going to pop up and you're going to
want to make sure that you click right
here install launcher for all users and
definitely add python 3.5 to path make
sure there's checkmarks in both those
and then click on install now and then
it's going to load for a little bit and
eventually it's going to set everything
up and there you go and then you're just
going to click on close now that you
have that all set up you're going to
come over here and you're going to say
that you want to you're clicking on your
Start button this is Windows 10 by the
way and if you do and then you click on
all apps you're going to see that python
is an option inside of here and if you
click right here where it says Idol
that's going to open up the interactive
interpreter and you'll be able to code
inside of that more on that in a moment
and you can also see that python 3.5 is
installed so now what we want to do is
install the atom text editor which is
free and pretty awesome
now to do that you're just going to go
to adam.com download windows installer
and click on that again you're going to
get the option to run
you're going to click on run and it's
going to install itself and this can
take a little bit of time may take a
minute or so then after that's all
opened up then you're going to open up
your atom text editor and then over here
you're going to click on open a project
so just click on that guy and then this
is all going to open up and you're going
to click on open a project once again
this guy's going to open up and you're
going to want to open and create a brand
new folder so just right click anywhere
inside of here and then you're going to
go down to new and then folder and click
on that and then whenever you do you can
type in python code or whatever you want
to type inside of there that's what i
used and then click on select folder
then you're going to want to come up
here and get rid of all these extra
things so click on the X to get rid of
the welcome guide get rid of settings
and get rid of the welcome as well by
clicking on the X for that and untitled
what we're going to be working with here
first and now I'm going to set it up so
that you will be able to automatically
run all of your Python code inside of
the atom text editor to do so you'll go
to packages command palette and then
click on toggle and then this guy is
going to open up you're going to type
install inside of here and then you're
going to click on install packages and
themes whatever you do
type in atom - Runner make sure you put
the - inside of there and you're going
to see atom runner shows up right here
come over here and click on install and
then inside of the untitled document
you're going to type in print and
parenthesis and in hello world inside of
quotes write like this and close that
parenthesis and then you're going to
name your file python tut py and you're
going to save that and just click on
save
and you'll actually be able to run that
to check that the atom runner file works
by just holding down the Alt key and
then clicking on R to run the code and
then what we're going to do is we're
going to verify that we have python 3.5
installed on site inside of this now
like I said before it might be 3.6 or
whatever whenever you're installing it
but everything else should work exactly
the same and to verify the version we're
just going to type in import sis and
then on a new line we're going to type
in print parentheses sys dot version
underscore info and then once again
you're going to hold down the Alt key
and click on R and whenever you do
you're going to see that major three
shows up here and minor five shows up
right there and that means that you have
Python 3.5 installed on your Windows
computer and like I said before you're
going to be able to come down here to
your start window I have Windows and
Macintosh dual booted on this computer
that's why you keep seeing that show up
so if you want to come in here and run
idle just click on your Start button all
apps and then scroll down inside of here
and you will find and python 3.5 right
there and click on idol and Idol is an
interactive interpreter that's going to
allow you to go in here and
automatically write some code so we can
just do the same exact thing here again
to verify that this is working and we
could do print and then inside of here
put a little world and then whenever you
hit enter you're going to see hello
world pops up inside of there and you're
also see right here that we have the 3.5
version of python and that is how easy
it is to setup and run python on windows
now i'm going to show you how to install
everything on a macintosh okay on
macintosh we're going to go to
python.org /downloads and you're going
to click on right here where it says
download Python 3.5 point 1 and whenever
that downloads you're going to come over
here and you're going to click right
here on this arrow and click on open
whenever you do this little window is
going to open up inside here you can
read that if you'd like to I'm not going
to and I'm going to click on continue
and then we're going to click on
continue again and then continue again
and you agree yes I agree and then we're
going to click on install and it's
probably going to ask you for your
password so just type your password in
there and then it is going to go and
install everything for you and after a
little bit it's going to say the
installation was successful so click on
close and now we're going to go get Adam
once again we're going to go to adam.com
download for Mac whenever you do it's
going to come down here you're going to
click on the little downward facing
arrow you're going to click on open and
Adam is going to install it's probably
going to install in your downloads
folder and if you want to put it in your
Applications folder which is probably a
really good idea let's go and I'll show
exactly how to do that's going to go
into your main Macintosh hard drive this
guy right here and you can see right
there Macintosh hard drive and we're
going to go to the download section oh
it's going to be under my username and
downloads
there's downloads and inside of this
you're going to at the very very top
you're going to see Adam - there it is
right there and we can just right click
on that and we can copy Adam - and then
to get to your Applications folder
you're going to just click on your main
one and then click on applications and
then you can paste it inside of there
and I already have it installed inside
of here so I don't need to do that
alright so now we want to go in here and
get the run or file that's going to
automatically open up a console window
so you can see the output of your Python
application to do that we're going to
click on packages command palette and
then click on toggle and whenever you do
you're going to type in install and then
you're going to click on install
packages and themes then inside of this
window that opens up we're going to type
in Adam - Runner and you're going to see
Adam runner shows up right here and
we're going to click on install and then
we're going to type in print parentheses
quote hello world closed parentheses or
close the quote and then close the
parentheses you're going to see that
here in a second again and we're going
to save this and I called it Python tot
py and you're going to click on save and
then if you want to run and decode you
can see right here exactly how the hello
world was printed inside there you just
hold down on the control key and then
click on R to run your code and you can
see right here that it printed hello
world out on the screen just like it was
supposed to
now all Macintoshes are going to have
Python installed by default but more
than likely it's going to be Python 2.7
so what I want to do next is I want to
verify the version of python the the
atom of text editor is going to be using
right now and to do so i'm going to type
in import sis and then i'm going to type
in print parentheses sys dot version
underscore info close the parentheses
and whenever i go and run that by
holding down ctrl and clicking on are
you're going to see that it is using
version two seven don't want to do that
I want to use version 3.5 the newest
version that I have so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to
put up my terminal and you're going to
see right here and I'm going to type in
which Python 3 and it's going to tell me
the location for the version of Python 3
that I just installed and I want to
highlight and copy and paste that and if
you don't know where the terminal is
well I have the terminal down here in
this little home bar right here but if
you don't have it there you could also
go into applications and terminal is
going to be not inside here but inside
of utilities so click on utilities and
there you can see terminal is right
there so let's click on that and
terminal opened up for us and we can
increase the size of this by holding
down command and then just hitting the
plus sign a whole bunch of times and you
can see right here if I type in which
python 3 it's going to give me the exact
same answer so I want to copy and paste
this so let's go copy that
and I'm going to close the terminal out
now that I have that what I'm going to
do is I'm inside of atom I'm going to
click on atom and then I'm going to
click on config and then I'm going to
type in runner : scopes
call in on separate lines and then a
single quote Python close the single
quote : and then inside of here in
between single quotes I'm going to paste
in where my Python 3 is and then I'm
going to save this file and now if I go
and get the same exact code imports this
prints its version underscore info you
can see over here that if I go and run
that once again by holding down the
control key and clicking on our it's now
running for version 3.5 and it's going
to save it that way from there after and
once again if we want to run Idol inside
of your Macintosh it's quite easy what
you're going to do is just go idle and 3
and here is going to be the interactive
interpreter for python if you'd like to
use that and we can of course come in
here and check that that indeed is
working by going print inside of quotes
hello world close that dah-dah-dah and
there is little world and there is
version 3.5 point 1 there you go guys
that is how to install python on windows
as well as on Macintoshes and how to set
it up with atom so that you can execute
your code and console hopefully that
answers a lot of the questions that i've
been
getting otherwise please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
