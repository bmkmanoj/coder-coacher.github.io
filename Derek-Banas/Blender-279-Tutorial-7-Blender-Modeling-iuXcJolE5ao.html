7 of my blender video tutorial in this
part of the tutorial we're gonna start
actually modeling things so we're gonna
start off with something simple like a
gear and with that simple gear I'm gonna
show you how to model even more
complicated things just in a simple type
of example and then after that I'm gonna
create a three-dimensional dog which is
gonna be a lot more complicated and of
course we're gonna be creating these
different models using a combination of
loop cuts extrude scale mirroring
reference images and a whole bunch of
other different things and like always
in the description underneath the video
is a text version of every single thing
I do a cheat sheet if you would have you
and in the description underneath the
video you can find a link to that and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
alright so here we are inside a blender
very first thing we're gonna do is get
rid of that now I want to create a gear
as quickly as humanly possible so I'm
gonna go shift and a and a mesh and then
I'm gonna go cylinder if you can't see
this if you at full screen and I'm just
gonna move it up here above this plane
and I'm gonna scale it on the z-axis so
I just went and clicked on S&amp;amp;Z and I'm
gonna scale it down like about that and
over here on the left side of the screen
you can see every single thing I do both
with my mouse as well as with the
keyboard and come in here like this
and then I'm gonna scale or zoom it
alright so now what I want to do is only
have some of these faces protruding out
and some of them not so I'm going to go
and jump over into edit mode by clicking
on tab and I'm gonna deselect by
clicking on a and then I want to select
every other one of these faces well I
could go around and click on all of them
individually but that would be terrible
let's say I want to instead select every
single face around this entire object
how do I do that
well if I right click well well I mean
vertice mode so I'm gonna have to change
into faces mode clay like that alright
so I want to select every face well I
just right clicked and I got one face
that's not what I want so I'm gonna go
alt and now I went and right click to
end I selected every single face around
the entire object alright so now what I
want to do is I'm gonna unselect every
other one of those how do I do that well
I can go down here to select and go to
checkered deselect and now I got every
other one now I want to extrude these
out how do I
that while we have let's just move this
in extrude individual if I can click on
this and slowly move my mouse button out
and you can see now we're getting
ourself a gear and left-click and now it
has been sets so now what I want to do
is put a hole in the middle how do I do
that well first I got to go into object
mode so I'm going to go tab animate
object mode and I want it to be right in
the center of my object let's say I was
silly and put my 3d cursor over here and
now it's not in the center of the object
how do I get it in the center of the
object well first off I have to have the
object selected and then I wanted to go
in there so I'm gonna do that is I'm
gonna go shift and s and cursor to
selected now it's in the center of the
object perfect so I want to now create a
cylinder inside of here so I'm gonna go
shift and ain't mama first off get rid
of that and shift and a and a cylinder
way too big let's scale that down
dramatically and it's in the center
which is perfect and that looks about
right and now I'm gonna right select on
this and I'm gonna cut a hole inside of
it I'm gonna go over here to my modifier
panel and add modifier and I'm gonna go
for boolean boolean I am going to want
to get the difference which means I want
to get rid of this cylinder in the
center the thing I want to get rid of is
going to be under object so I'm gonna go
eyedropper tool over here click on the
cylinder now I got the cylinder inside
of there I'm gonna be able to go apply
and got all that I'm gonna jump over
into edit mode to get rid of the
cylinder and here is the cylinder I can
just click on any part of said cylinder
let's go and shut this off so we can see
a little bit better so I can select any
part of it and click on L that's
selected everything then I'm gonna go X
and get rid of my cylinder in the center
and there you go now you have a hole in
the center of your gear now another
thing is sometimes we want things to be
smooth let's jump over into regular
object mode
alright so everything's real nice and
sharp right now which is great but let's
say we would want to smooth it well we
could just go smooth now look little
close uh-oh now everything gets kind of
you know smoothy
alright it's not exactly the look that
we're looking for well one way that we
can correct that is using what are
called loop cuts and we're just going to
add loop cuts to this I'm gonna jump
back over into edit mode
and I'm gonna go control and are and
then we have to find where we want to
have our loop cuts and what I'm gonna do
is I'm actually going to push a roll
with my metal mouse button to create two
of them on there and I'm gonna select to
get a hold of that and I'm gonna left
click to place them now what I'm gonna
be able to do let's jump back over into
object mode you know see there's still
blurry on the edges what I can do
however is I can get every single one of
these edges make sure you have edge
select selected down here of course and
my first unselect and then I'm gonna
hold down the Alt key and right-click on
every one of those and now what I'm
gonna be able to do is move them upwards
to get our sharpness once again inside
of our little gear that we have here
okay so once again alt click on this and
I'm gonna go G I'm going to do is in the
z-axis drag it down and now if we jump
back into object mode you're going to
see that we have the sharp edges that we
were looking for all right so there is
just a whole bunch of different little
cool things that we're gonna do with our
more complicated example where we create
our dog next but just wanted to show
them in a more simplistic example and
now we can jump over and do something a
little bit more complicated okay so now
what I want to do is model 3d dog so
let's get rid of this cube right here
and we're gonna bring in a background
image that we're gonna be able to work
with so I'm just gonna left click on
that background images right here open
this up and go and I want to put it only
on the right foot axis so I'm gonna go
click on that and click on right and
then click on open and then I'm gonna
click on Sheppard's side which is the
image I want to use and then I want to
show that and as you can see once again
here is everything I'm doing over here
on the left side of the screen I'm gonna
go to 3 and I'm gonna click on 5 and
there you can see is my dog that I'm a
used to model everything on alright so
we can close this off so we don't have
that on the screen and then what we're
gonna do make sure we're in object mode
and we're gonna basically block in the
whole body and the head using a plane so
I'm going to go shift and a mesh and
plane and I want to be able to see it
it's laying on its side something to go
right I'm going to click on R + y + 90
and there is our plane we're gonna use
alright so click on G and then we're
just gonna start placing this guy inside
of here now we got to go into edit mode
so tab and then I'm gonna make sure I'm
in I have vertices selected here I'm
going to select this vertice and G and
then I'm gonna drag it into place to
basically block off the whole entire
dog's body so clicked on that with the
right mouse button go and get it into
place with G and then we're going to
click with the left mouse button to
place and do this over and over again so
you see that we're just basically just
trying to get this in here this isn't
you know professional made but you know
whenever you very first start off I
think this is a pretty good place to
start off
alright so G once again left mouse
button to set it and go and select this
again and I'm just clicking on extrude
and extrude and select this and G to
place it down now whenever you're
getting you're placing this inside of
here you're going to want to make sure
that you have a plane that basically
goes from one leg to the other and the
same for this one back here and also for
wherever you want to roughly put the
tail inside of so again when extrude
again this time I'm probably gonna go
down here to right around here where I
want my leg to be right click on that G
and let's just slowly place that in
there select this again extrude and this
time it's gonna end where the leg is
basically going to end on our model and
get this guy
place it right about here and you want
to slowly as you're coming through here
and blocking this off you want these two
to come together because they're gonna
meet at the tail section let's get this
and extrude maybe put this like that and
then select this and then bring it up
inside of here so that we are right
around the same place remember there's
the leg where I'm going to basically
block it off and select that with the
right mouse button again extrude and now
we're getting close to the tail so I'm
gonna have the top be a little bit
smaller and the bottoms be bigger get
this G and I think that'll be perfectly
fine right there select that extrude
once again and let's have that be like
right there bring this in
and we're gonna come in here pretty
close to block in our tail all right
extrude once again this guy bring it up
here because the tail is gonna come out
towards the top of course and extrude a
little bit more we're gonna sit sharper
and maybe do one more just for the heck
of it alright so there's that there's
this and bring that up okay so that's
where the tails gonna sort of be coming
out of alright so now I want to block in
the rest of the dog's body so I'm going
to ignore the ears and because they're
gonna be separate I'm gonna do like a
mirrored modifier on this to get this to
come in now this time I got more real
estate I'm going to cover with the right
side then what I mean by right side is
these guys right here then on the left
so I'm gonna sort of move them a little
bit slower and extrude and let's put it
up like that
and then bring this guy back down again
slowly wrap it around the head extrude
bring this back down again G and it's
all just something that you do by eye
it's not you know there's no ironclad
rules here and maybe like this gonna
want some different things to play with
here in the ear area just so you know
that now we're gonna be able to do loop
cuts to add more dimensions so we'll
just see how it works out and extrude
again and place it G drag that back up
inside of there just and we're wrapping
it up so you got that there G this and
now we're getting at pretty much equal
so that's good and extrude let's get it
down to right around here it's just guy
bottom I'm a dog that's two more times
will probably be enough so this and
extrude again and wrap this up where the
dog's nose is gonna roughly go okay so
we got the whole dog's body the head and
the main torso all blocked in now what I
want to do is I want to add some
thickness to it so I'm going to come out
of here on this plane and I'll select
everything and select everything and do
an extrude
and go and you just sort of like eyeball
it I'm gonna make it not too big not to
want to make it wide enough that I can
have the feet be far enough apart but
also not so wide that the face is all
stretched out and that looks pretty good
and now what I need to do is come in and
go and get face select and I'm gonna
take out all of these faces by
right-clicking so right click all of
these there we go
and I'm holding down the shift key while
I'm doing this okay got all of those X
and get rid of faces now you can see
there's like a block in the middle there
now what we're gonna need to do is jump
back over into object mode and I have
everything selected you're gonna want to
make sure that you have everything set
down the middle so you can do a mirror
select it looks like it's fine
but I want to guarantee that it is so
I'm gonna go ctrl + a and location op
see it moved and ctrl-a again rotation
control a again and scale alright so now
what I'm gonna be able to do is come
over here to our modifier that's sky
right there and the modifier I'm gonna
add is the mirror modifier and this is
gonna be so when I draw a leg on the
right it appears on the left so I'm
gonna go Mir perfect and X and and
everything's fine alright so everything
is great now what I can do is jump back
over into edit mode now whenever I draw
out of my legs one problem I have let's
jump over here is they are going to be
basically right next to each other so I
don't want that so I want to put a loop
cut down here that's gonna divide these
areas again ctrl R and let's just move
your mouse around until you get your
loop cut where you want it and sometimes
you have to move though let's escape out
of this let's move out of this let's try
it again
so ctrl R you want it to be right down
the middle of your up there you guys I
got it that's where I want it to be so
there's my loop cut and I'm gonna put it
right down the middle
alright so go back into 3 now what we're
gonna do is we need to select this face
down here and extrude it down to create
a leg so I'm gonna come in get face
right click on it go to click on 3 and
then we're just going to extrude just
like I did previously
so extrude that down and you're gonna
want to make sure that you are selecting
through the box so this guy right here
needs to be shut off otherwise you're
not going to be grabbing everything and
you're also gonna want vertices you're
not gonna want
Edge's somebody get a and then we be to
do a box select grab this G and drag
this down and again and grab this guy
and G and sort of drag it down and
you're gonna want to try to keep them at
the same level and if we look you can
see that they're coming out on both
sides of our dog back into three again
and let's go and select both of these
extrude and I'm just gonna sort of go
kind of fast here and so that you get
the gist of what's going on and then of
course you'd go in and do more add more
details if you would like and something
like that and this and G and do another
strips I'll do that
go escape if you ever make a mistake
just hit escape and it'll go back to
where it was and be and extrude
something like that and do box select
grab this guy see if I didn't have this
guy down here this sure shut off this
limit selection of visible it wouldn't
be selecting the vertices that are
behind so that's the reason why I did
that Angie and you know just a basic dog
type of foot all right so let's deselect
this bring it up here and you're gonna
see everything is laying itself out
pretty nice now of course we're gonna do
the same thing down here with this part
so again we're gonna go face select and
whoops got the wrong one that's the one
that I wanted the one on the outside
three and we're gonna do another extrude
bring this down here and make sure that
I have the vertices selected down here
not face select and go drag this G
something like that box select off those
extrude it down again ah so there you go
there's a basic type of dog leg and
let's just do an extrude it down a
little bit more just because it's a
little bit off-kilter okay so of course
I can make that a lot cleaner but you
get the gist of what I'm going for
alright so there we got our dog leg
there we got our body and now what we
need to do is come in and I'm gonna
probably work on the tail let's go and
look at the face a little bit yeah I
want to work on the tail alright so for
my tail what I want to do
is come in here and I basically want to
have this block here and that block
there be my tail area correct so let's
just go and do a face select again this
and three
extrude our tail sort of go out maybe
just a little tiny bit zoom in here a
little bit I'm gonna hold down shift key
middle mouse button and drag that over
and I'm gonna do vertices select on this
and then don't select anything box
select and G just sort of drag the tail
down into position unselect that get
this guy right here and G all right
looking good and be you know select both
of those guys and extrude once again G
maybe start to spread it out a little
bit more um G box looked sort of come
together and looking pretty good
I'm gonna just select that get this so
we can get this back down towards more
like where we wanted it to be box select
extrude G I'm repeating myself just
mainly because I want to just make sure
you understand the whole process I'm
basically just doing the same thing here
over and over again there we are and
zoom out a little bit and then we can
sort of finish off our tail that we have
here select all that G whoops no way
needs to be like that extrude and maybe
we can have it come together I think
it's getting pretty long here now all
right so get this guy and then select
and let's go get this drain it up more
towards a point go and get this guy
bring him down
whoops and select a grab G more towards
a point let's go and look and see what
we got and you can see those two are
together because it's a tail and that's
all perfectly fine alright so that looks
pretty good and then if we wanted to add
some dimensionality to our tail for
example very easy you just go control
well it's unselect everything and we can
control our we want it to be down the
middle
let's just go and put it down the middle
and we're gonna do this with the body
also so we got that there and if we want
to unselect and let's come down here and
let's just grab one side of it so we
don't have to see all that
so you just right click on just the
center of this but we want to get the
edges so I'm gonna go get the center so
click the
and shift and I'm not doing the alt
because that would select the entire
thing and now what I can do is just come
in here and add some dimensionality to
our tale say no it's three dimensional
and then we can do the same thing with a
rest of our body so the more and more
three dimensionality we want to add
let's just go a and what's to control
and R and you can see there that is now
what I can do is I can go and move my
mouse wheel to create even more and I'm
gonna do that I just move my mouse
middle up one tick and in the bottom
left hand corner you can see number of
cuts to say got that there and I can
move it in to wherever I want it to be
um before I do that I'm gonna come into
my face area that I have up inside of
here and I'm gonna do the same exact
thing with this guy so let's go and grab
and make the face a little bit thicker
so a and I'm just gonna grab the part
that I want to be thick and not the part
that I don't want to be thick so I think
like I'm gonna thicken that out a little
bit so I'm gonna grab it pull it out
oops
you know what undo that and go and
select all of these parts let's get all
of that okay that looks good and now you
can see I'm adding some three
dimensionality to the dog's face and
then of course I can go and bring the
ears out son select that and maybe we
want to bring this up like this and then
bring this out like that and that's
where the ears we're going to go and
then I can also come in here and zoom in
and right-click on the different parts
where the nose is gonna be like this
oops
and let's unselect that getting a little
bit crazy okay so got the different I'm
trying to grab just the different parts
of the nose and nothing else so it does
something like that let's see what
happens alright that's sort of coming in
together and then we can go and grab
this guy right here and bring it in a
little bit and you get the gist of what
we're doing here bring this in bring in
let's go and grab the vertice that we
have here unselect everything grab just
the vertice move the vertices in and you
can see I'm sort of pointing out the the
face of our dog and then of course we
could be able to go and extrude the ears
up just like we did previously I like
come in here and do that let's just do a
face select on this so we got that guy
and I can do and extrude and let's just
have it be a little bit and then we do a
scale on that you know what I'm going to
do I'm gonna scape on that first I'm
gonna do extrude let's bring our ears
out a little bit place that and then do
a scale on that and then bring them
together in a pointed shape we go and
then we can go and play around with how
we want the ears to go into position and
then cut an edge into there do some
controllers you know try something like
this drag that inside of there and place
it and then we can grab this guy where
we have our ears of course the more of
these loop cuts that we put inside of
there the more definition we're gonna be
able to add so we got just this guys
what we're playing with and we can bring
that in and you can see now it's forming
an ear now if I went and added more loop
cuts I'd be able to make it more rounded
ear okay so um let's go and add in a
couple more loop cuts for our body
so we'll just go unselect everything
ctrl R and let's go and add two more
onto this and put it something like that
and we'll go and add just a little bit
at a time so I'll grab all of these guys
that we have right here so basically the
whole entire body except for our tail
area and then drag that out just a
little bit and then we can go and get
the the next part
so this dragged it out a little bit more
and then we can round out the overall
body of the dog and because we're using
mirror of course anything that we do on
the left side is going to also occur on
the right side so really nice stuff and
of course you can continue doing this
over and over and over again alright and
then you can add some three
dimensionality to that you can continue
doing it over and over again and
I'm going to hold down shift key move
this over and then of course you can
thicken the legs also
so it's unselect to everything and
control arm and put that in there let's
just say that's fine I know let's go and
select the individual parts of the legs
like we did right like this and whoops
grab that one thing that I want let's go
unselect it bring it in here and drag it
out and now the legs are 3-dimensional
okay alright guys so hopefully you
enjoyed that there is a couple different
ways to model things inside of blender
and of course as its tutorial continues
I'm going to do more and more
complicated things and like always
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
