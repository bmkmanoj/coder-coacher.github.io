2 of my how to lay out a website
tutorial we're going to continue from
part one of course that's why part two
if you haven't see part one watch part
one is right here otherwise you might be
confused and this is what we got done in
part one right here we got the top bar
and the menu and fonts and a whole bunch
other different things and here is our
our ultimate goal this is what we are
going to make and in this part of
tutorial I'm going to focus in and
create this left side bar there actually
is a couple little tricks going on
inside of this guy and I'm doing this
completely out of my head I'm not I
don't own anything prepared this is just
a picture and in this tutorial I'm going
to make this picture one thing that I
know is this is in the left sidebar so I
am going to have to separate it from
everything else so right after the menu
part I'm going to create a new div I'm
going to give it an ID that is equal to
content wrapper and just like always I'm
going to close the div off and content
wrapper is actually going to be this
background here this purple I can just
come in here call this content wrapper
and we're going to make another div for
this box and another div for all these
other different things because I like
using divs now for content wrapper what
I'm going to do is I'm going to come up
here inside of the style area and
remember content wrappers and ID so I
call it content wrapper curly brace
close the curly brace and because I have
no idea what I'm doing here I do know
this background color is 47 1 F 3 7 and
I know that I want to float it to the
left side of the screen and that's all
that means float left means throw
everything to the left side of the
screen pretty much don't allow a margin
there so scroll back down to the bottom
the screen and jump into content wrapper
and we have to create our left sidebar
so I'm going to go div and there's only
going to be one sidebar
so it's an ID and then I'm going to
close off that guy put in a comment and
then inside of here this is going to be
another div and this is going to be
called left container I'm just going to
jump in here and actually create that so
there's div and there's going to be
three left containers so it's a class
instead of an ID you not understand
anything I'm saying leave a comment
below and I only get out a container and
if you can't see this you can watch to
see in full screen because it's an HD
video and all the
odhh all this HTML is underneath this
video just click the link and you can
get it now the first thing I need to do
is create this who we are that you see
here on the screen so what I'm going to
do take a wild guess I'm going to create
a div and there's more than one of these
there's one there there's one there so
what's that mean that means I'm going to
make it a class and I'm going to call it
banner title I'm going to give it an h4
tag just for the heck of it because I
normally do that and if it's not the
right size well I'll change that later
h4 and then close the div then what do I
have to do well I have to put this
picture in here plus I have to put all
this text inside of here so what am I
going to do I'm going to create a
paragraph tag class is equal to sidebar
excerpt and I got to put this image
inside of here that's right up there
right there so I'm going to go image
source is equal to and one a point at
the location which I know is images
forward slash Cindy pane and I always
give alt text because it's good to do
that and I'm just going to put Cindy
inside of there just for something and I
do know the width of this image is 73
pixels and I know the height is equal to
73 pixels and I'm going to give it an ID
equal to Cindy and then to make this
HTML strict make sure you close that off
and then I know that I'm going to have
to put some breaks underneath of this
gun throw a break inside of there then
I'm going to jump over and get some
lorem ipsum I always have this saved
over here so back into this page you
throw some lorem ipsum text inside of
there and now there's some breaks and
things like that so for that I'm going
to copy this I'm just going to eyeball
this just for now I'm just going to
leave it like that and then I'm just
going to close off this paragraph tag
reload and you can see that now the
content area is showing up here on the
screen I'm actually going to zoom in on
this but there's no background colors
and this isn't being placed right and
the excerpts not being placed right so I
got to fix all that up so where I'm
going to fix that up in the CSS code
come up here under content wrapper then
you'll start eyeballing things and see
how good we can get everything lined up
first thing I want to do is left sidebar
which surrounds everything here
I want to float it to the left let's
type in float left and as far as I know
I think that's all I'm going to need to
do with that then I have left container
and this is a class because we have
multiple undos and that's why there's a
period in front
instead of a hash now with left
container I know I want my background
color to be white and I'm gonna have to
look at the other thing to remember what
I'm trying to draw here all right so I
know that's white um border because
there's a border you probably can't see
it here I'm gonna guess that's about
three pixels solid and it's definitely
black now it has a border margin
I'm guessing again eyeballing 10 pixels
margin on the right over here I'm
guessing about three pixels and if you
wanted to find the margin on the right
only this will just override the margins
on the right side for this little
container inside here and with I have no
idea what that is I'm just gonna take a
wild guess under 75 pixels and height
again I have no idea let's say 275
pixels and padding I'm normally doing
two pixels let's see what happens when I
do that reload it it don't look too bad
except it's falling out of the bottom of
the screen which is not good so I'm
gonna have to fix that and I'm gonna fix
that really by moving these things
around and moving these things around
getting all the images in here right
left container itself didn't look too
shabby though all right so they enter
title is the who we are part the inner
title so I'm going to move that div
around and I know I want to make it
pretty much the same sort of font as I
used before so let's just grab that font
from up here paste that in there I'm
guessing the line Heights gonna be a
little bit different the background
color well it's going to be that same
purple that we have in our background
here so I'm just going to grab this guy
up here get rid of the extra color paste
that in there the color of the text is
white there's white text the width again
I have no idea let's say 90 pixels and
the height let's say 20 pixels text a
line it's definitely aligned to the
right side of the screen I'm going to
make it align right inside of that div
adding right I'm guessing might need
something it's let's leave that blank
for now position is definitely going to
be relative which means I'm going to
move it around relative to where it is
so let's go back in here and actually
look at where it is all right it's down
here so I have to move it to the right
and I have to definitely move it up and
I'm gonna guess from the left side of
the screen that it needs to move over I
don't know 70 pixels and from I want to
move it up it's say
20 pixels let's see how accurate I am oh
that's not accurate at all okay so I got
to move it up a little bit more I'm
going to make the left container just a
little bit bigger the width of this who
we are part I'm going to take that up to
96 pixels I'm going to increase the
height on it also a little bit smooth it
farther over from the left side of the
screen and of course this is going to
have to be a negative and we're getting
kind of close here now the ease butting
up next to that so one way we can fix
that is to add a little bit of padding
so let's just go padding - right and
let's give it all six pixels because it
seems like I'm happy with six pixels Hey
yep alright so now we're just going to
move it up slightly so let's change this
to twenty-one and see if we're getting
there and we are that's perfect so I got
that perfectly aligned up in the upper
right hand corner exactly where I want
it so now I going to move this picture
of Cindy around here a little bit I was
an ID and the IDS name is Cindy so again
I want to float it left just throws it
to the left side of whatever's
containing it and I got to start adding
some padding to this padding to the
right let's say four pixels bottom I'm
just guessing top you know just be fancy
up of five and padding left let's say
two pixels because they already have a
little bit of padding and let's jump
over into sidebar excerpt which is all
this text and everything here including
the image and play around with that a
little bit and I want to position it
relative to where it is now and from the
left you definitely don't want to move
it so let's just leave it at zero and
then from the top I definitely want to
move it up so let's say negative 60
pixels and see where it ends up color of
the text I decided this is going to be a
gray and the font size looks like it's
off a little bit math it's called
position wrong OOP that's looking pretty
good it's butting up into this a little
bit though and I'm having a little bit
of trouble of this I think what would
actually work better is to throw another
break statement into this and then leave
the sidebar excerpt pretty much exactly
the way it is here down here to the text
area and right after this coffee throw
in another break statement I'll say
reload
there we are that's pretty much perfect
I could take a little bit off of this
sidebar pretty much everything lines up
real nice inside of there looking pretty
good all right so now we need to go and
start
adding the featured content part of it
which is this right here
and we're going to be doing kind of the
same sort of things let's scroll down
and create what we need here first right
after end of left container we're going
to create another div and this one is
going to be called featured because
these are going to be featured posts and
a featured and I'm going to create
another div this is going to be for the
banner it's equal to banner title it's
listed as videos on the screen and then
I'm going to leave this isn't h4 because
the last one worked except this is going
to save videos close off that h4 tag
close off that dip and then I'm going to
create a another div and its class is
going to be equal to each article so
this div is going to surround each one
of these little brackets here where it
says Facebook marketing and then a
little bit of information so I'm going
to create another div and I call it
article title and I'm going to bold it
because it's bolded there and I'm just
going to type in what it says here and
then close that div and then I have to
actually put the article part in now I'm
going to put this in a paragraph tag
class is going to be equal to article
excerpt because that's what it is and
let's just grab some of this lorem ipsum
stuff up here copy paste that in there
and then of course it's going to have
the ability for the person to click to
read more I don't know why that wasn't
any image that's definitely something I
want to add each reference is equal to
and for now I'm just going to leave this
as a hash symbol which means if it's
clicked on isn't going to do anything
but it's still going to act like it is a
link click for more and I'm going to
give it the word more inside of there
I'm going to close that off an enclosed
paragraph tag off and then I need to put
in a horizontal rule well I like to use
a div and use it as a horizontal rule
because it gives me more control over
exactly how big it is and things like
that so I'm just going to type in hor Z
rule and I'm going to completely define
the way the horizontal rule works close
off that du and then I need to close off
the div for each article and of each
article and if we file save that and
reload it you can see what it's doing
it's all messed up like the other one
that's because there's no styling don't
worry about it so we're back up into the
styling area we're going to create all
this well the first thing I'm going to
style is the div that surrounds
everything and that is called featured
and I'm going to give
a background-color of white just like we
did before actually a lot of this is
going to be the same border is going to
be three pixels and it's going to be
solid and it's going to be black I'm
going to give it a margin ten pixels of
three pixels width would we figure out
it was 177 right basically I'm coffee
and everything from this guy right here
so 177 height padding let's just copy it
there we go
this height is obviously going to be
different because it's going to be
bigger but pretty much everything else
is going to be about the same if we file
save it reload it Aaron look at that
it's already coming together we're
definitely going to have to make some
height changes though but that's the big
deal each article surrounds is a div
that surrounds all of this content so
we're going to make a couple changes to
that each article position it relative
and it's definitely going to have to go
up so we'll say talk and let's just go
negative 18 don't know I'll save it
reload it all right so it's moved up
pretty good it looks pretty good I might
leave it there alright then article
excerpt is this guy so if I move
Facebook's marketing up I going to move
that up also so article excerpt I'm
going to change it to the same grey that
I use here I'm just going to copy that
gray copy so that everything looks about
same font size I change it to 10 points
because the last one was 10 points and
position it relative and let's move it
up what happens if we move it up 18 yeah
it's a little bit too close how about we
take it down some thought that would
look nice but I guess not yeah perfect
alright so we got that laid out so now
what do we got to do we got to create
our horizontal rule and I'm gonna make
my background color 471 f3 7 which is a
wiki color I want to see all of these
different things together you can go to
wiki web colors and it shows you a
gazillion colors with all this
information it's kind of cool and in my
height I always do this is Sam 2 pixels
and my width I made this 177 so I'm
going to make this 170 pixels margin
left I'm going to make that 3 pixels so
that it's kind of centered and position
it I know I'm gonna have to do this
relative but I don't know how much
because I haven't seen one screen yet so
let's reload it and it's down here let's
just see if we take it negative 10 like
we did with the excerpt file save we're
good good good and then basically we
have to create a couple more of these so
I'm gonna come over to this guy I'm
gonna go to featured because I'm gonna
have to make this div bigger and how
high I have no idea let's say it is 371
alright so we just add another hundred
pixels and then I basically just have to
copy this code right here pull up my
image so I got one two three four of
those inside of there and the div that
surrounds all these different guys is
called
each article so basically I just start
down here where it's ends each article
ends and then I jump up here to where it
is I get coffee pace there's three of
them I'll say reload pretty sharp except
I don't want this last horizontal roll
so what do I do
just delete it cool all right and then
this is too big this div that makes up
the whole entire thing if I'll say
reload it yeah too much space down here
so let's shrink that how do we do that
jump back up into featured and let's say
instead of 371 Lee knock it down to 350
reload it and that's just about perfect
alright so we have everything laid out
here so now I just need to make two of
these guys see there's one there there's
one here the only difference between
them is articles and this one says
videos so fine we're gonna scroll down
and this whole entire thing is called
featured so what I got to do I got to
come to where it says end of featured
with that div the Z this is how it helps
when you put all these comments in and I
just scroll up until I find the
beginning of featured so there's that
guy and let's say I want to put in first
do it all in a caps first featured
sidebar then all goes jump underneath of
end of feature and here want to put
another comment second featured sidebar
and this one's going to be called
articles then I'm gonna come like this
paste that in there file save it and
reload and there you can see those the
only problem is this doesn't say
articles like the other one did no
problems go up here to where it says
videos articles I'll say reload and
there you go and that's how you do the
styling for the sidebar looks pretty
nice and if we zoom out you can really
definitely see here that this is
starting to pull together and what we
have in this image is terribly close to
the original design
that we're working from please scroll
that
right there see look very very very very
similar and in the next video I'm going
to create this whole entire center part
and I'm also going to create this right
sidebar leave any questions or comments
below all of the code is underneath the
video if you want to look at this HTML
and CSS code till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
