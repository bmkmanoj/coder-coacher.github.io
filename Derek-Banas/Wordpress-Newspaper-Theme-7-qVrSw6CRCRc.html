7 of my wordpress theme tutorial where I
will teach you how to change this basic
HTML CSS file into this working
wordpress theme that you see here on the
screen well here is where I left you off
last time but by the end of this
tutorial this is what you're going to
see instead of seeing this mess here
well the first thing I'm going to do I'm
going to obviously style the menu and
I'm gonna style yeah everything inside
of here in the previous tutorial we
style this and we also style the footer
and all these other different pieces so
now I got to get in here and fix
everything else up what I'm going to do
is from my previous tutorial which I'll
provide a link to this was the basic
plain Jane easiest way to learn how to
make wordpress themes tutorial i created
this menu bar i use this every single
time I just make minor changes here and
there so I'm just going to copy that
code and I am over here inside of style
dot CSS and I'm going to paste all that
in there then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to have to change the
background as you can see there's this
background right here it looks kind of
nice I'm going to have to get all the
code for that background that is
previously done in a previous tutorial
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
to menu CSS that I used whenever I first
created this guy and I'm going to scroll
down until I come to background right
here this is the background that we use
whenever we created the CSS / HTML
version of this site so I'm going to
copy that and then I'm going to jump
over into the theme that we're currently
working on and I'm going to go and paste
those backgrounds in here so inside of
navigation right here where it says
background i'm going to highlight that
and i'm going to paste in my new
background inside of there and another
thing that I'm going to do is I'm going
to change the border on this and
basically I've so I'm doing I'm just
making a couple cosmetic changes you're
going to be amazed this is actually what
i consider beautiful about web design is
taking this ugly looking thing and all
of a sudden adding a couple lines of
code and it's beautiful so this is the
most fun part of the tutorial series for
me and it also probably is kind of fun
for you if you're really in the web
design that is then I'm going to come
down here change padding on this menu
bar 20 pixels and scroll down like I
said every single time you're
only going to be changing a couple
things with this menu bar code and
there's a link to all of this code in
the underbar this is the next place
where you're going to be changing this
code inside here for the color I'm going
to be editing the g4 FF give this like a
bluish color and this will be one of you
hover over the menu bar and after that
paste in all of my new background
styling text shadow is going to stay
exactly the same however i'm going to be
changing these borders and i also do not
need to mess around with the z-index in
a situation so I'm going to go border
dash right this is going to put a little
bit of a border on the right side of
this guy whenever somebody hovers over
it make it solid X 0 v 3 86 f i'm going
to copy that and i'm going to put a
border also on the left and it's going
to actually have this color right here
so i'm just going to copy that and paste
that inside of there and then i just
keep on scrolling down to the very
bottom here and i'm gonna have to change
the coloring on the background again for
the hover so just change it to that get
rid of that semicolon colors going to
stay the same text shatters going to
stay the same except i'm going to put in
a border bottom one pixel solid I got
that guy in there again i'm going to
copy this again except i'm going to
change this to board or top see there's
just a couple cosmetic little changes
here actually the top is going to have
this color and then this color right
here is going to be my OB 386 F again so
that's all I need to change their
another little thing that I'm going to
do here is whenever you put in the
thumbnails for your posts or your pages
or whatever very often inside of
wordpress those things get positioned
wrong so I'm going to fix that right now
I'm going to provide some styling right
here inside of my stylesheet anytime
somebody aligns an image either centered
right or left so i'm going to do that
makes a display if you don't know what
I'm talking about I click on this and
then if I click on this see how this is
this thumbnail is positioned in here and
the text is butted up next to it but
there's a little bit of a border this is
how this styling is going to come
together i'm actually going to show you
how to do that and then we'll be done
with our style dot CSS file all together
so i'm going to go margin left auto
margin right auto so that's going to
provide for a centering
option I'm going to copy that and then
I'm going to forget any time somebody
tries to a line center I'm going to
leave that exactly the same come down
here image I'm going to go in for a line
right in this situation would provide
padding around this thumbnail so that it
looks really nice I'm also going to
display it in line so that it just melds
in with everything else get rid of this
margin place up with 0 0 2 pixels 7
pixels and then padding all around the
image of four pixels that's going to be
nice i'm also going to come in here for
a line right and i'm just going to
change this to float right i'm going to
copy this gun and then do the same thing
for a line left in this situation i'm
just going to change this to 7 pixels
and if you don't know in a which i
figure if you're in a tutorial this
advanced you probably do this is top
right bottom left what I'm styling here
inside of this guy and I'm just going to
change this zero pixels and then the
padding is going to be exactly the same
I'm going to copy this guy and change
this to a line left and then change this
to float left beautiful our style dot
CSS file is all changed now what I'm
going to do is I gotta go into the
functions.php file for our theme and
tell WordPress to look for a menu you
might think that's real complicated but
it's not what I'm going to do here first
is just make sure that my function that
I'm about ready to call actually exists
which basically means do they have a
fairly current version of WordPress is
what i'm asking here so I'm checking if
register nav menu success close that off
tap in and if it does now menus now I'm
going to go to WordPress to put main
menu on screen navigation and that's it
so if I'll save that for functions dot
PHP that's all you got to do to make
sure that this guy works and if we jump
over into header dot PHP see where it
says main menu right here well jump over
into functions main menu so that's those
two things have to be identical other
than that you don't really have to worry
about anything else and if I file save
those two things and reload it you see
that nothing has changed here well
that's because you haven't gone inside
of word for us and told it to change so
you have to go into WP admin login then
under appearance and menus in your left
sidebar you have to come into main
navigation and just
click on sample menu and save now if we
jump back out to random site you can see
here that the menu is all set up let me
zoom in on here's the menu see
everything is all working all
beautifully now so we have a finished
menu inside of our nice little theme
let's jump out of that fix everything
else so I'm just going to leave this guy
open on the right side you're going to
watch all my changes another thing I
need to do is from the previous coded
HTML CSS file I'm going to need to open
up home CSS and select everything and
copy it and jump over here where we're
working on our theme go file new text
document paste all that in there then
we're going to save this in a proper
place which is going to be in our CSS
directory for our theme so right here
and this guy is going to be called home
dot CSS and then save that and now it's
time to come in here and fix everything
else about this website you're going to
watch it happen right here on your
screen first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to come into the height
section and i'm going to change this to
auto that way it's going to
automatically resize itself based off of
how much space is needed for all your
content and then i'm going to come into
minimum height and define a minimum
height of 1200 pixels so I've got to
change that then under post lists I need
to put in a margin right so that there's
positioning and there's everything is
set up right for that to provide for
space in the sidebar 330 pixels that's
nice and where did I get that well i got
it from down here so i don't need that
anymore so i'm just going to put that
with zero at this point and i'm also
going to come in here and let margin
left be zero nothing else needs to
change there now we'll scroll up here
post title which is going to be the
stuff that comes inside here well
they're all going to be links so i have
to change that to that now i'm going to
be targeting on links and then text
decoration i'm going to change this to
none so that there's no underlines on my
links everything else can remain exactly
the same see i did all the heavy lifting
whenever i created the HTML CSS version
of this website so now i don't need to
worry about changing that many different
things i'm going to go in here article
title i'm going to be targeting because
this is something new previously I had
everything all in the same types of
articles and so forth well that's not
going to work very well so I had
color f 2 sets the text color is going
to change like a grayish I like using
greys too dark add some padding 5 pixels
so I'm going to be targeting these
titles that come inside of here that's
what I'm doing margin left going to be
90 pixels I'm going to automatically
make the text uppercase and I'm going to
make my font bold 14 pixels 17 pixels
helvetica sans-serif and then text and
then I'm going to come in here and style
my font a little bit different make it
bold 24 pixels by 18 pixels georgia
serif and i'm going to make sure that i
get rid of text decoration set that none
so that that link doesn't have an
underline because that's just god awful
ugly and then article contact font 18
pixels line hi George and then that's
gonna be serif text color Oh f 0 f 0
position relative so that it all just
falls in line relative to everything
else and I want to make sure that I get
rid of those bullets with list I'll none
let's file save that reload and over
here and you can see that stuff starting
to come together still really ugly but
we're going to fix that up don't need to
make any changes to post images post
excerpts still going to be the same
featured posts still going to be the
same featured title however is going to
be a link now so we have to make that
correction nothing else needs to change
here except since we turn that into a
link that we're targeting we've got to
get rid of the underline featured expert
is not going to change at all but we
have this guy down here and it's
surrounded by a div all of these eight
little guys down here surrounded by divs
so we need to come in here and that dips
called more posts we need to create that
guy padding dashed off 20 pixels and
down here with recent posts look for
padding bottom that's going to change
dat 0 because of the changes we've made
here recent title that's going to change
to a link just like it has in the past
and what do we have to do whenever we
change something into a link text
decoration none just like before and if
we file save that guy you can see that
everything is loaded in here the only
little problem we're having is that
there are no image
is inside of these guys right here I can
go in and fix that though and I'm back
and after i uploaded those couple
thumbnails inside of there you can see
that everything looks peachy keen so in
the next part of the tutorials i'm going
to fix all the other pages leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
