my design patterns video tutorial today
we're going to talk about the Builder
pattern and like most of the other
tutorials this is hundred percent
self-contained so if you're just here to
see the Builder pattern you're going to
learn everything about it in this one
video however if you want to see all the
other patterns refer to the link up
above and you can check those out as
well as brushing up on basic Opie
principles so what is the Builder
pattern well this is a pattern that's
used to create objects made from a bunch
of other objects and when you want the
creation of these parts to be
independent of the main object and also
to hide the creation of the parts from
the client so both are not dependent
upon each other whenever you create a
builder pattern the Builder part of the
Builder pattern knows all the specifics
and every other class involved knows
nothing about what's going on in regards
to the specifics of the final object
you're going to create sounds way more
complicated than it is and now you're
going to see how simple it is here is
the Builder pattern basically I'm using
my old alien here and in this situation
he is going to request a robot to be
built for now here is the interface
which we're going to call robot builder
and it's going to find what every robot
has which means a method that builds a
robot head torso arms and legs as well
as receives the robot then of course
you're going to implement this interface
over here with the old robot builder is
what I'm going to call it and then you
just need to implement all those methods
and what this guy does is it's going to
set all the specifics for making a very
specific robot type and here is the
final robot it's going to have a whole
bunch of fields this guy up here is
going to set the values for those fields
whenever build robot heads called and
build robot torso and so forth and so on
and of course get robots going to return
this robot to whoever calls it mainly
this little alien over here then we're
going to have the robot engineer or what
is often called the director and what it
does is it creates a robot with the
field set by the Builder this guy up
here and then finally we have our
interface which is going to have all our
set methods to set all the values for a
robot and then the final robot itself so
now we're going to go from this basic
little diagram here
to build all of the code so on with the
code so here we are inside of Eclipse
and the first thing we're going to do is
come to robot plan which is going to be
the interface for creating all of our
robots this is real simple we're just
going to just like always to find all
the methods that need to be set up so
we're going to say that we want our
robot to have a head and it's going to
be passed a string and we're just going
to call that head so real simple and
then we're also going to define our
torso our arms and our legs and then
this is going to be past torso arms and
legs so here you're going to define all
the qualities that you want all of your
robots to have and then after that
you're going to go to robot Jabba and
you're going to implement the robot plan
which you just created and if we come up
here we're going to just put our mouse
over robot and it's going to say add
unimplemented methods we're going to do
that and there we go and this is going
to act as the concrete robot class based
off of the interface that we just saw
right there so what are we going to need
to do well we're going to need to
actually create these fields for
ourselves so they're all going to be
private of course during robot edie
robot torso arms and legs and then what
we need to do is just come in here and
go robot head is equal to whatever the
value of head is robot torso and make
sure that we what this is upper case of
course is equal to whatever torso was
when it was Sun over robot arms is equal
to whatever the value of arms was and
robot legs is going to be whatever the
value of legs was and there you go got
that all set up now the only other thing
we're going to want to do here is put
some get methods inside most of the time
whenever you have set method you're also
going to have get method so we're going
to go public string and all of the code
that is here is available underneath the
video you should get it if you really
want to learn this stuff it's free why
not okay return robot head real simple
and then we're just going to also do the
get methods for the torso torso arms and
arms and legs and there you go that is
all we're going to do with robot Java so
now we need to come in here - robot
builder Java which is going to be the
interface for building all of the
different types of robots we want to use
so what
sort of things we don't want this guy to
do public voice well we're going to want
to build our robot head of course using
interfaces just makes everything so
simple don't have these long classes
everything is going to be really easy to
implement and you don't have to think
that much I'm going to make that
uppercase and this is going to be torso
arms legs and there you go that's all it
took to create the basic interface or
robot builder da Java now we're going to
create old robot builder and this is
where you're going to see all the
changes because this is going to be the
concrete builder class that's going to
assemble all the parts for the finished
robot object so we're going to have to
go private robot because this is going
to be building a robot so we're going to
need access to an actual robot object
and then there's no use typing all that
out because we can just put our mouse
over this guy of course and go add
unimplemented methods and there you go
got our stuff automatically thrown
inside of there and now since we have
robot defined up inside of here in a
compositional type of way where the
field is actually an object Allah the
other strategy pattern sort of kinda
we're going to come in here and define
this robot which is a reference to this
robot up here right there is equal to
new robot so now we have that guy all
set up and this is the constructor of
course so we know that this robot is
going to be created whenever this guy is
called that's good and then what we need
to do is just go robot dot set robot
head and since this is an old robot
let's say his head is made out of tin
just to do something and you say all I'm
doing is calling all the methods that
were defined inside of the robot class
so set
robot or so and this is going to be tin
torso arms what would be an old-school
type of arm for this guy to have about a
blowtorch blowtorch arms and then we
come down to robot legs and what would
be an old-school type of robot leg
how about rollerskates so this is a
roller-skate robot with blowtorch arms
made out of ten and there you go there's
the old robot builder Java and every
single time you want to define a new
type of robot you're just going to
create a new builder object that's based
off of the main robot builder interface
which we just
in it and everything is just going to
work so now we come to the robot
engineer which is what I call it a lot
of people call it a director but I just
have always called it an engineer so
that's what I call it and what this guy
is going to do is create a robot using
the Builder interface that is defined
right here with old robot builder in
this situation so what are we going to
do we're going to go pro if it's robot
builder robot builder is going to be its
name and then we're going to call robot
engineer which is going to be the
constructor and it's going to be passed
a robot builder specific object which is
going to be our old-style robot type
here and then once again we're just
going to go this robot builder you can
think of it as kind of like a factory
type right like that so we know now we
have a robot builder or we have a
factory for building route robots and
this guy back here has robots inside of
it so you can think of it this way that
this guy defines this factory type don't
call it a factory but you know if it
makes you understand this better you can
think of it that way so we're defining
the robot builder factory area and over
here we're defining the robot itself
inside of old robot builder so that's
how we're able to backtrack and actually
create these guys so what do we need to
do with this well we're going to have to
provide the option for get robot so that
they'll be able to get the robot that is
created inside of here by the engineer
and to do that we're just going to go
return this robot builder get robot and
to do that we're gonna have to go over
here to robot builder Java and just go
public robot get robot so that it'll be
able to return that and then bounce over
to the sky right here which is the old
robot builder Java which implements the
robot builder itself and then of course
come in here and implement get robot
there you go
and what's it going to return it's going
to return this robot which this builder
knows how to create so pretty simple
bounce back over in a robot engineer and
then what the robot engineer is going to
do is execute the methods that are going
to be specific to the robot builder so
to do that we're just going to go public
avoid make a robot like that then we're
going to say this robot builder we want
to call the
build robot head method I like that
which of course is right here build
robot head and what's it going to do
it's going to set the value to tin head
for head inside of robot which is back
over here and you can see right there
there's robot head so that's exactly
what it's doing so bounce back over here
so what do we need to do now we just
need to set all the other values for the
torso and the arms and the legs and
that's it so if I'll save that and then
we're going to go into test robot
builder and we're going to check to make
sure we did all this right so what are
we going to need to do if we want to
build ourselves a robot well we're going
to need to get ourselves a robot builder
object obviously I'm just going to call
it old-style
robot and then it's going to be of type
old robot builder so you could think of
it same as if you're saying okay I want
to get myself all robot builder to build
me a robot and this is the class
blueprint that I want you to use to
create that robot and then we're going
to need to do is pass the old robot
builder specification to the engineer so
if we want to pass something to the
engineer well we're going to have to
actually create the engineer and I need
to spell engineer right and there we are
so we define that we want to get
ourselves a robot builder we want it to
use the blueprint to find an old robot
builder and then we need to get
ourselves an engineer to build it and
this is going to be equal to new robot
engineer and we need to pass over the
specs that we created right here or the
blueprint for what type of robot to
create and there we are we did that and
then we need to tell the engineer that
make the robot using the specifications
of the old robot builder class so we're
going to go robot engine here put a dot
there and then what's it going to say as
our options well one of our options is
make Oh bot well that's definitely not
going to be the right thing we'll click
on it what did that tell us I told us
that we need to change that to robot
make robot and then jump over here in a
robot engineer and change this to make
robot now we are nice way to catch our
little errors we've made there and then
the engineer is going to return the
right robot based off of the spec that
we passed it right here now we got
ourselves all robot so we're going to go
robot first robot is what it's going to
be called and it's going to be equal to
the object that is going to be returned
whenever get robot is sent to the
engineer so just to read go over all
this stuff basically we're defining a
robot builder right here and this can be
thought of as a blueprint for creating a
very specific type of robot and we want
a robot to be built for us what do we
need we need an engineer to build that
robot for us and to be able to build
that robot the engineer is going to need
the blueprint which we defined up here
passed over to it once it gets the
blueprint the engineer being smart like
he is can make ourselves a nice little
robot and then we're going to be
actually able to define the actual robot
and just call robot get robot from the
robot engineer and it's going to pass it
over and the robot will be defined and
ready for us to work with so pretty cool
especially because nothing knows what's
going on except for this guy here the
robot builder so let's check to make
sure that we actually did this right and
we can say proudly that our robot was
built and then we need to see if our
robot was built right so we could say
something like robot head type like that
and then we just need to go first robot
the object we created and say hey what
is your robot head look like and it's
gonna tell us and we just copied I
pasted that inside of there and we just
change this the torso get robot torso
arm type first robot get robot arms if
you use nice naming conventions you
don't even have to think you can just
like do this out of your head which is
great and get robot legs and if we
file/save that we can see what type of
awesome robot we created there in a very
structured manner and there you go robot
built robot head type 10 head 10 torso
blow torch arms rollerskates
able to put all that together with
really only one part of this whole
entire Builder pattern knowing any
specifics about the total robots is
gonna be created everybody else is left
in the dark and us does their jobs leave
any questions or comments below
the last till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
