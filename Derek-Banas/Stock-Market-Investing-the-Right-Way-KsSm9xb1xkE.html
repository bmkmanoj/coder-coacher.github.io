presentation in which I'm going to show
you the fair minimum you need to think
about if you seriously want to invest in
the stock market personally I believe
buy-and-hold investing is no longer
going to provide a good return on
investment in reality it never has apart
from the dramatic ride the market took
from 1982 to 1999 in fact the stock
market historically pays an average rate
of return of only three point seven
three percent and if you don't believe
that watch my previous tutorial which I
provide a link to here in this
presentation I'll give you a few tips on
how you can dramatically improve your
results with investing this is for
educational purposes only though and I'm
not providing investment advice I am
just providing investment theory what
I'm gonna talk about is the bare-bones
minimum you need to think about if you
are going to invest if you're not
willing to put this effort in it is my
opinion it is better to leave the stock
market alone altogether investment
allocation is extremely important I need
you right now to forget everything you
know about asset allocation what you
think asset allocation more than likely
is is pretty much indiscriminately
combining stocks and bonds in a
portfolio we are going to instead use
some math to build a portfolio with a
risk level you will be comfortable with
and then get you the highest rate of
return at that said risk level in fact
by using some math formulas we can make
highly accurate predictions on what
would be the maximum potential loss for
a given portfolio then you can decide on
how much potential risk you're willing
to take and then know that your
portfolio will act accordingly
in the examples that I use in this
presentation and all presentations that
come after here I'm gonna use Treasury
bills to represent the least risky
investment in my portfolio Wow I will
use penny stocks which are stocks worth
less than $5 these will represent my
riskiest investments I will for now not
include options in this portfolio
because they may be kind of confusing
but you must understand that history has
shown us that the structure of your
portfolio will determine your day to day
returns a 94% of all market days so the
structure of your portfolio is more
than anything else and if by the way you
want to see a presentation in which I
explain options derivatives and swaps in
a very easy to understand way see the
link above now I'm gonna go into a term
called standard deviation whenever you
hear people talk about risk in the stock
market what they're actually talking
about is a statistical term called
standard deviation now in this example
I'm going to assume that I can expect
ABC company to increase in value by 25
percent after 10 years I then must only
fear that I'll be forced to withdraw at
a point when the value has unexpectedly
fallen this rise and fall from the
average growth rate is known as standard
deviation when people talk about risk
they are actually referring to standard
deviation and if this isn't quite making
sense in a couple examples you'll
totally get it as you add more risk your
portfolio you are increasing the chance
that its price will deviate from an
expected return for example my risk list
1-year Treasury bill is going to more
than likely guarantee a point three five
percent return however while I'm
guaranteed to receive that rate of
return I can also be sure that inflation
is going to be much higher next I'm
gonna list some of the best performing
mutual funds and show you both their
average returns as well as their
standard deviations from 1987 to 2003
these funds were chosen because they
were some of the best at not only giving
you a rate of return but also they were
great at minimizing their standard
deviations first I list the mayors and
power growth which providing an average
rate of return of fourteen point six
five percent year over a year over that
time period and also a standard
deviation of only twelve point seven
five but what I want you to focus most
on is the Smith Barney aggressive growth
fund which provided an average return of
twenty seven point eight three percent
with only a standard deviation of nine
point eight now you're gonna understand
why standard deviation is important the
Smith Barney fund provided it to
investors an average rate of return of
twenty seven point eight percent and in
any one year was expected to provide
because of its standard deviation a
minimum rate of return of eighteen point
zero three percent the reason why is the
average return was twenty seven point
eight while the standard deviation was
nine point eight
you subtract the standard deviation from
the average return you get 18 point zero
three percent but I'm sorry this fantasy
world doesn't exist anymore think about
this by buying this mutual fund at worse
a return of 18.3% in the worst year and
in the best year you would receive a
rate of return of 37 point six three
percent on average what's funny is I
used to actually try to sell this mutual
fund to people and they often would pass
on it because they thought the return
was not good enough what you need to do
is think not only about expected average
returns but also think of their
deviation from this average if you
understand that the goal is not just to
get a good average return but also to
minimize standard deviation you really
are now starting to understand the
basics of investing okay here we have
the capital allocation line capital
allocation line depicts in graph form
the fact that as you increase your
standard deviation or risk your
potential return also increases the
capital allocation line is created by
looking at all potential investment
pools of investments along with their
expected returns versus their standard
deviation from those returns the
portfolio I'm emphasizing has an
expected return of fifteen percent the
only problem is that the standard
deviation is 32 percent this means if
I'm comfortable potentially losing 17
percent of my money this is a good
portfolio if I am not comfortable with
that
it's a bad one most people think that
behind diversification will protect them
from this risk they think it is a good
idea to randomly add different
investments to their portfolio this is
absolutely wrong as you can see in this
chart if you use a computer to randomly
pull together a portfolio you are no
longer able to minimize standard
deviation simply through diversification
after you reach a random number of
investments being 20 as you can see here
adding random investments to a portfolio
will not lower your overall standard
deviation a lot even if you go up to a
hundred two hundred three hundred four
here I'm going to talk about what is
called the efficient frontier what I'm
doing here is charting every investment
based on its expected return versus its
standard deviation I've already
described what the cow
the little dots represent all of the
investment opportunities out there the
line that curves away from the Cal is
known as the efficient frontier it
represents all portfolios with the best
return at the lowest standard deviation
the optimal portfolio represents the
point in which you are getting the best
return at the lowest risk level and the
optimal risky portfolio represents the
point at which you receive the highest
return versus all other possible
portfolio mixes the optimal risky
portfolio will provide you with the best
return on your money at the least amount
of risk if you're a bit confused don't
worry it comes down to this simple
concept we want to create a portfolio
that will provide the best return with
the lowest amount of risk that's it but
how is the optimal portfolio created
well if you understand standard
deviation there's just one more piece to
this puzzle it is known as covariance
when some stocks go up others tend to go
down a candy company's growth potential
is directly related to the price of
sugar for example so if sugar prices
skyrocket chances are the candy company
stock will fall this is known as
covariance it's a measure of the degree
to which two assets values move in
tandem if two stocks have a negative
covariance that means they move more
opposite from one another so one way to
hedge risk in one asset is to find the
other assets that affect its value and
add them to your portfolio this act
helps to minimize overall standard
deviation now to wrap up as mentioned
before a hedge fund named end of UQ
which means northwest quadrant made huge
returns based purely off of creating
optimal portfolios their name in fact
refers to the fish and frontier which
the best portfolio lies in the northwest
quadrant they constantly readjusted
their portfolios based off of expected
changes in expected returns as well as
standard deviations they did this with
computers but the computer sitting right
in front of you right now is probably as
fast as the one they used back in the
90s in future articles I plan on showing
you the math behind this article it
really isn't that complicated you just
need to plug in day-to-day price changes
for all of your investments
they then provide you with the following
standard deviation covariance in
relation to the other investments and
the expected returns then all you have
to worry about is general market risk as
history has shown us though market risk
only will affect you 6 percent of the
time with the right asset mix and if you
think doing all of this is way too
complicated
in my personal opinion don't buy stock
if you don't want to do it intelligently
if you think a brokerage house also will
do this research for you I say good luck
if you have any questions leave them
down in the comment section below
I love the answering questions and till
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
