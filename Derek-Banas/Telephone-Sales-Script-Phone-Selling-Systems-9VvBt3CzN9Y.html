presentation I recently gave a local
Chamber of Commerce and we completely
sold out the room so I thought I'd make
this presentation publicly available to
anybody who want to see it right now in
a day and age which we have 10%
unemployment it's actually probably a
lot higher than that in fact there is
one skill that is always in demand and
that is Tuggle marketing whether you
like it or not so today what I'm going
to do is go through exactly how I became
a very successful telemarketer I'll do
it anymore so don't hate me don't throw
tomatoes please not know terrible
comments but I'm going to give through
this presentation just so everybody out
there gets some skills and has something
else they can put on their resume I a
couple years back before I had any real
sales experience I work for a company
that I'm going to refer to as Foreman
family at this point in time right about
this time that I have marked off here so
when I first started working for them
and you can see what is coming for me I
got hired there I when I first got hired
I memorized all my sales scripts both in
person as well as my telemarketing sales
scripts everything anybody out there
doesn't know it a broker for the most
part is just a glorified telemarketer so
I went whole hog memorized all the
scripts I then what about educating
myself far and beyond anything that I
was expected to do I had this very nice
gentleman who taught me a lot about
investing and I read every book that man
told me read I then at this point
started to spend a lot more time not
trying to figure out how to make money
in a falling market and that gentleman
again helped me with that little did I
know what was coming up when the market
started to go up
around this time my fiancee started with
my ramen noodles said things weren't
going quite so well what I realized I
needed to learn how to sell did not
matter how great of an investor I was by
no means was I fabulous investor but I
was better than most brokers so what did
i do I throw outs Foreman scripts and
created my own I started selling a lot
of life insurance fund by accident and
propose to my fiancee and but it ends up
that that bridge was not too happy and
didn't really care for people that only
sold life insurance no matter how much
money I was making so they let me go
along with 30 other people at that point
in time so I went to work for a
telemarketing company the evil
telemarketing companies what did i do
there I broke tons of sales records for
one of the biggest telemarketing
companies in the entire country
I was now making twice as much as I made
at a brokerage company for telemarketing
so I decided that I wanted to thank for
the next level and sell the hardest
product possible sell which is
considered by most people real life
insurance for two years
I wasn't top 5% of the district because
of my phone skills
I admit that at that time I in-person
skills were not all that great in
regards to sales but my phone still work
awesome so that's how I was really
making my money and doing really well
then the Do Not Call list came through
so I had completely changed the way that
I was selling I'm going to get into all
that in his presentation whoops
why I failed at the brokerage company I
was thrown on telephone no problem you
have to do that but the problem was I
was surrounded by a bunch of people and
the company in general really was of the
feeling that everybody wanted to talk to
us because market was going up for so
long and they really kind of got lazy
basically my telephone call was hi this
is Derek masters Forman friendly okay
bye and that's pretty much how the
presentation went
unlike most of the stories you hear no
there was not this one shining example
who
was extremely successful telephone
everybody in the office was family so
what did the company do they wrote some
new scripts the script was basically
hello can I mail you something okay bye
and I just knew that that was not the
right way to do it that was not the way
remember this is before I had sat down
and rewrote my own scripts
it's just when everybody always says
it's just a numbers game and that is a
hundred percent wrong so what did I do
I started be failing around me I
realized the script I was being given
weren't working so I knew I had to do
something so I sat down and I read most
every sales book I could get my hands on
I read from a well over 100 demos what
the number one tip I got out of reading
lists of these sales books most number
downright terrible but the one tip I did
get is if you ever get the objection I
need to think about it that means you
hesitated at some point in assuming of
sale you have to throw from the
beginning till the end of the
presentation always assume the person is
going to buy and why shouldn't you if
you have the best product why are you
afraid to ask people to buy it and if
you don't have the best product go work
for somebody else it's just that simple
throughout my continuous simple clutter
and as of that year I discovered the vs
set and wagon a favor for a favor of a
40 principle the scarcity principle
liking principle to consistent
consistency principle for building
skills and so forth and so on basically
come from one branch of psychology known
as neuro linguistic programming so I
started reading every single book I can
get my hands on regards and our
linguistic programming and I would
reroute every script of in person on
telephone base completely off with an LP
techniques and I'll show you the early
scripts today in this presentation that
received a 7080 percent success rate in
selling
there is a lot of anxiety in regards to
making telephone calls I realize that I
did feel it I'm what you have to really
think about is not on what issues do you
and your employees have on the telephone
if you are an employer you're watching
this you have to really get into that
and conquer that you need to help your
employees face their fears and conquer
them or if you are the person on
telephone you have to obviously face
your fears but with a good telephone
strip you can eliminate most of the fear
after you make those first five calls
I found that to always be true but if
you're a telephone warrior you still
after a weekend of not being on
telephone you're going to get on caller
felt you're going to feel just a little
pinch of fear but you know you just have
to put that away and don't worry about
it
well as I was saying before it is not a
numbers game it's a good script plus
practice game you have to really get
your getting get yourself a reason for
people to meet with you this is
extremely important I by the way with
Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and where I
personally live I discovered that senior
citizens could receive amazing state
benefits if they just filled out
paperwork in the right way and there's a
program here called the case that would
provide seniors with on average five
thousand dollars a year in savings just
if they filled the paperwork out right
in regards to prescription drugs
remember this is before the federal
government prescription drug plan this
was paced was a statewide program so I
learned everything can learn about pace
every time can learn about government
programs that would help senior citizens
now I had a reason to assume that every
single person I talked to would want to
meet with few quick tips you need tons
and tons of practice talk to 50 people
per day at least you need to have
answers to every injection on a script
in front of you when you're on a
telephone you can't slip up on an
objection comes out
need to tape yourself no it's not legal
to tape up tape now the person on the
other end the line on say another being
taped and they give me the authority but
it's completely legal to tape yourself
talking down fun and you just want to
make sure you're constantly assuming the
sale throughout the entire presentation
selling on the phone also you have to
know requires a lot more aggression then
in person selling things that I would do
in telephone I would never do it inverse
themselves you need to get three
definite notes before you should move on
but normally three definite notes after
that point you should move on otherwise
you're just harassing people and that's
not nice you often get the feeling when
you're on the telephone why do people
hate me you have to really understand
the twenty seven percent of people hang
on a hang up on everybody that calls
them even Publishers Clearing House when
they're calling to tell them they just
want a million dollars and also you
understand that people are conditioned
to say now or I don't know from
childhood and just think about that fact
if you have children or you come to
contact with children how often do you
use the phrase now or use it or no to
them in comparison yes basically comes
down that there are four main principles
along the column phone first attitude
second acknowledge it move on and then
never ask for their permission and I'll
give you a couple other tips to gain the
edge that will be in the next
presentation can find times just about
up until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
