show you some additional plugins you can
use with WordPress and just start this
video off just in case somebody doesn't
know if you want to install new plugins
on your WordPress website click on
plugins or you can click on add new
there or you can click add new there and
then you would type in i don't know i'll
just type something right here random
then you click on install over here on
the right and then you click on install
now and although and that's basically
all you do and then you click on
activate plugin if you want to activate
that plugin I wouldn't installed some of
these plugins ahead of time today I'm
going to go over the all in one SEO pack
you have to any calendar and claimed
contact all solid plugins click on
activate little message comes up here
you need to fill it some information or
this plug-in work properly go to the
admin page plugin status I leave that
enabled and what is great about this is
it provides you a very easy way to
overload all of your pages with keywords
so I want to go for home title home
description old keywords just so you
know your home title and average going
to be 60 characters in length your
description kind of generally be able to
160 and your overall keyword should be
around 25 because Google doesn't
necessarily like the keywords usage in
regards to your keyword meta tags want
to leave everything else here pretty
much ask your fault really great I
sometimes click on this news categories
for meta keywords I like that
dynamically generate keywords for post
page I mean it generates all of your
keywords so it does a lot of work for
you that you might not want to do
log important events until later check
that off and basically that is all you
do and then you come down here and hit
update options now what just happened
well when every time let's say you want
to make a new post this is brand-new
website my mind so I has nothing on it
so if I hit edit you can see down here
all in one sem and you can see here
what's great is remember I said no more
than 60 characters no more than 160 well
it's going to count for you the number
of characters you're using in your title
in your description so that you won't go
over that it's really just a dynamite
dynamite tool and then you over here of
course you would put your your tags
which are keywords and I would also fill
in the xr2 area if you make reference to
any other information on other websites
definitely you should send traffic
offenses it's really nice and then you
can create a whole bunch of custom
fields custom meta data I mean it's just
dynamite so it's a great tool say if I
reason alone okay now I'll show you how
to use a tool called add to any and to
any wordpress plugin makes it easy for
users just 78 your content why would you
want others to post your articles on
Facebook for example because by doing
this you increase the number of visitors
to your site and increase the number of
incoming links to your site this plug-in
allows people simply then easily post
links to all major social networks and
email your articles and even bookmarking
website so let's go in it I already
click on activate I'm going to click on
settings basically you decide how big
you want the service debate with a
little tool click on that size that
looks about right for me then you have
to decide on where you want it placed
bottom of posts dynamite bottom of pages
bottom of posts and feed I leave that
out just play share and save button at
bottom of pages that's fine i netted
objects perfectly fine and you can put
additional toast variables and so forth
and so on to edit the different places
where aunt Annie will be a beside the
information I need you click on Save
Changes that's it
