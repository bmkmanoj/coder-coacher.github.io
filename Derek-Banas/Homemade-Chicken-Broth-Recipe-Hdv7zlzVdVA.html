show you how I make my homemade chicken
broth it's very easy to make and it is
really amazingly delicious so let's get
into it now the reason I decided to make
this recipe is I do a couple weird
things for one thing I put pesto in so I
decided to also teach how to make pesto
in this recipe now to make pesto you
just take two cups of chopped pesto and
add two tablespoons of garlic and then
here I'm going to add 1/4 of a cup of
pine nuts then I'm gonna add 1/4 of a
teaspoon of salt and then while I mix
all of that together I'm gonna swing my
mixer left and right and make sure that
everything is well combined then after I
have everything all nice and thoroughly
mixed together and that's basically what
it looks like I'm gonna get myself 1/3
of a cup of olive oil you can use extra
virgin or just any type of olive oil
really doesn't matter in this situation
and then after I put the olive oil in
I'm going to smash it back and forth
they're like you could say and then I'm
going to get myself 1/4 of a cup of
Parmesan cheese and dump that in and
then mix it just for a little bit in the
blender and whenever you remove it this
is basically your pesto and what it is
going to look like in its finished state
and then to this you can see pretty much
everything that I'm going to use to make
the rest of my chicken broth ok so the
reason why everything is gonna be pretty
easy to memorize is everything's gonna
be based off of onions here you can see
that I have two onions and I'm just
gonna chop them up it doesn't really
even matter how much you chop them up
and then my goal is to have half as many
celery's as I have onions and half as
much carrots as I have onions and then
once again half as much mushrooms as I
have onions and then guess what with the
chicken once again I'm going to have
roughly half as much microwave frozen
chicken bites as I have onions and now
to guarantee that all of the flavor from
all of the vegetables comes out in my
broth I then take all the vegetables
throw them back into a blender and then
I add 1 teaspoon of salt and then I
blend those guys together as you can see
and that's what it's going to look like
whenever it is all done I'm then going
to take those vegetables and I'm
throw them in a separate pan and then
I'm gonna go back to my blender and I'm
gonna get my chicken out and throw it
into the blender and then again blend
blend blend and the chicken when it's
done is roughly gonna look like this and
of course we're gonna remove it from our
blender and then put it in a separate
pan as well all right now that I have
the vegetables and the chicken set apart
I'm gonna get myself a third of a cup of
olive oil and I'm gonna put that in a
deep bottom Bowl I can see right here
and I'm gonna turn that up on high
okay then I'm going to put in a little
chunk of onion and whenever it starts to
bubble I'm gonna take all of my
vegetables and throw those into the pan
and then I'm going to stir it from about
three to five minutes or until it starts
to stick which means that a lot of the
water is being removed from the
vegetables at this point I'm going to
take all of my chicken and throw that in
there and I'm gonna stir all of those
till they're combined or approximately
one minute and then I'm going to put in
one tablespoon of dried parsley one
tablespoon of garlic powder
I prefer garlic powder over regular
garlic and then I'm gonna take a big
giant heaping approximately 1/4 of a cup
scoop of pesto and then there is no time
delay here I'm going to immediately add
in eight cups of water and I'm gonna
stir to combine to make sure that
something doesn't it invert in the
bottom now I think eight cups is just
about perfect of course if you add a
little bit less it's gonna have a little
bit more flavor if you add a little bit
more it's gonna have less flavor and
then whenever it starts to boil I'm
gonna turn it from high to 20% now I'm
going to let that sit and simmer at 20%
for approximately two hours if you only
have an hour and a half that is more
than perfectly fine and then I'm gonna
pour this into a colander and then after
it goes in there I'm going to mash it
down with either a spatula or a potato
masher or whatever just to get out all
of the broth so I hope you guys enjoyed
this I know it's simple but a lot of
times simple things like this can really
turn you into a pretty good cook and of
course add salt and pepper to taste and
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
