explanation of object-oriented
programming if you did not watch part 1
you should watch that first it's up
above and if you don't know anything
about programming you should take a look
at my JavaScript tutorial which is also
up above in this presentation we're
going to cover everything there is to
know about polymorphism but first off
let's make sure you completely
understand inheritance we defined above
the original car class then we created a
subclass of the superclass car and named
it Dodge in object-oriented programming
this is known as extending the
superclass dodge inherited all the
functionality of the class car and then
extended it with a new method named honk
horn and then it went on to create a new
function called drive forward you could
have also created new variables and
methods for the dodge class without
changing the superclass in any way the
Dodge object remember is always a car
object but a car object is not
necessarily always a Dodge object why is
inheritance good first often decreases
duplicate code it eliminates looking for
code that needs to be changed because
you never change old code you just
overwrite it it avoids breaking
previously working code and it
simplifies your code overall onto
polymorphism you can see here an example
in which I created a new object of type
Dodge but still used the original car a
class to define it what does this mean
as you can see here car a followed by a
video object you're creating named Dodge
tells the computer a variable of the
type car a named Dodge is being created
after the equals sign new car a sets a
sign space in memory for a new car a
object the equal sign signs the car a
object to the variable named Dodge and
the Dodge variable and the car a object
both are the same Dodge is just a
variable name that points to the car a
object in memory but there are thousands
of types of cars isn't this going to
make everything confusing well without
polymorphism you would have such
confusing definitions as car toy Yoda
truck 4x4 just to define a Toyota truck
that was a 4x4 with polymorphism you can
simply define a new object using the
superclass like this here I used this
superclass car followed by the object
named Dodge and then assigned it to the
car a object you can see here how this
differs above here I used the car a
class to define the new object Dodge
while here I used the car superclass to
define that object named Dodge
I'm simply declaring an object Dodge to
be of the superclass type instead of
declaring a an object named Dodge of a
subclass of the car superclass what does
this allow you to do well you can now
create one function that automatically
works with all of your subclasses of the
type of car here's an example here I
created a function named tuna and then
it is followed by the drive forward
function then the drive backward and the
stop functions which are all defined in
class car what this will allow you to do
is to pass any car type to the function
tune-up and know that it will
automatically run through all of those
functions which is drive forward drive
backwards and stop polymorphism provides
you with a way to write code that
doesn't depend on pipes in the car
example I gave if methods defined in the
car class manipulate generic cars no
matter what type of car they are all of
the subclasses of car can drive forward
drive backwards and stop since I can
trust that the methods in the superclass
car will be in all the subclasses I
could send commands to the Carnahan
object and let it sort out everything on
its own the code in the car is then not
affected in any way when I create a new
subclass I don't need to know how the
methods work I just trust that they will
another benefit is I won't have to
change the car class code and
potentially break other parts of the
program if a method in the car class
doesn't work for my subclass I override
the method in my new subclass
not the code in the superclass car
wouldn't it be great if you could create
methods that were smart enough to work
with whatever is sent to them it would
allow someone to send the number for for
example stored as a string and the
function would accept it convert it into
a number type perform the addition and
then send it back well you can with
method overloading all you do is create
multiple methods with the same name but
either a different return type different
number of arguments or type of arguments
you must note however that some
languages such as JavaScript don't allow
overloading because they don't assign
variable types to the variables but if
you're using an object-oriented language
that does assigning variable types to
variables such as an integer or a double
or a float this most definitely works
here's an example of an overloaded
method we've created two methods that
both have the same name and numbers one
returns an int or an integer the second
one returns a string you can also seen
within the arguments that they accept
that the first add numbers function
accepts integers while the second one
accepts strings however they would both
perform in exactly the same way you can
define as many overloaded methods as you
want as long as you change either the
return or the arguments in the way I've
described here above when I created the
class dodge of type car I had to define
the method name tuneup inside of the
class car I did that because you can
only call an object's method if the
class you're referencing has that method
but is it possible to create a
superclass that has all of the methods
and variables you need to take advantage
of polymorphism yes and it is called an
interface an interface is just a shell
class that provides the names of all of
the variables and methods but no covered
you describe what other classes will do
with it but don't describe exactly how
this way you have the ability to use
polymorphism without all of the problems
you can see here how I created an
interface named vehicle and then
assigned to it three variables engine
gas tank door and then define six
functions
that all classes that are of type
vehicle would have to implement in this
case drive forward drive backwards stop
open door get gas and get guests and
that is basically everything there is to
know about object-oriented programming I
left out language specific issues so
that you weren't completely confused but
I covered the most important parts in
this presentation I plan on creating
tutorials on different programming
languages such as PHP Objective C and
maybe job in the future if that's at all
possible if you have any questions leave
them in the comment section below
and I'm more than happy to make
additions to future presentations so
that you can completely understand
object-oriented programming till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
