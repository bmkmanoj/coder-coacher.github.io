21 of my android development for
beginners tutorial today I'm gonna make
a painting application that I
affectionately called raw stuff I'm
gonna do my best to cover pretty much
all the different things you can do with
a canvas component inside of App
Inventor we're going to be able to paint
with numerous different colors use
different brush sizes save and load
different images we're gonna be able to
paint just like we're using just a basic
paint brush we're gonna need to be able
to put circles inside of there we're
also going to be able to just click
right here and then you're gonna need to
be able to draw straight lines as well
as all kinds of crazy little shapes like
this I also implemented the feature
where we're going to be able to just
click on text right here and then type
in some type of word here why don't we
just type in monkey and then you're
going to be able to just click anywhere
inside of the canvas and monkey monkey
monkey monkey shows up and I'm also
going to allow you to come down right
here and type in an angle and then we're
going to be able to print out the text
on the screen at any angle so I pretty
much did a coverage of just about
everything you can do with canvas and
I'm gonna make that whole entire app in
this one video so let's get into it
alright so here we are inside of App
Inventor and the app that you just saw
is what I'm actually going to make right
now based off the power of video editing
you were just in the future and now
you're in the present but both are in
your past so let's just get into this
basically what I have here looks a
little bit funky now but what I had to
do is shrink down the canvas area so I
could put all this other stuff inside
here and I went and drew this ahead of
time because I know you guys know how to
drag-and-drop components let's get into
the most important thing here I have
canvas right here and of course in the
description there's a link to all these
different things and basically all I did
was put canvas inside here change the
background color to white and then down
here I have the width of 300 and the
height is going to be set at 250 it says
100 right now I'm not sure if you can
see that and then the most important
things is right here in the color
section I put a little label inside of
there as you can see over here it is
label seven and then I went and
increased its width to ten pixels but
there's no text inside of there so I
just used that for simple padding and
then inside of here I put in little
color blocks that whenever you click on
them you're gonna be able to change your
color and they are set for 43 pixels and
width and 40 pixels in height and then I
just went and threw sliders and labels
and buttons and all these other
different things inside of here now to
make this all ready to be used I'm gonna
come in here first to the table
arrangement click on that and then come
down here to height and change this to
250 pixels and that's what's going to be
the final layout and then I'm gonna come
into canvas right here and set its
Heights also at 250 pixels so there we
go
alright and that is going to be what the
finished apps gonna look like now I'm
gonna go in and create all of the blocks
to make this thing work okay so here I
am in the block section and I'm just
going to come in here first and create
some variables that I need so I'm going
to come in to initialize global name and
I'm going to give this a name of brush
size and I'm just willy-nilly just
throwing this together here and let's
say that we want our brush size to just
be 2 to start off so there we go
drag that there and drop it another
thing I'm gonna want to track is list of
images there might be a whole bunch of
other things that come up but I'm gonna
be saving the images in a database or in
a list and then saving the list in a
database so I know that I'm gonna want
to keep those and that is gonna be so I
can save and then reopen images so let's
create another one and let's just call
this and all the blocks are also there's
a link in the description if you want to
look at them of images and this is going
to be a list of course so we would need
to create an empty list and there we go
and like I said there might be some
other things that come up now the very
first thing I want to do since brush
size is here and it's on my mind I am
going to make the slider work there's no
rhyme or reason to why I'm doing it that
way I just decided to do it that way so
I'm going to click on slider and I'm
gonna say whenever the slider and then
the slider is going to change our brush
size I'm gonna say that whenever the
position is
changed that I'm gonna come in here and
set and brush size and the value is
going to be whatever the thumb position
is also importantly over in designer
down here where we have the slider if I
click on it if we come over here I
decided the max values gonna be 20 and
the minimum value is gonna be - I don't
know how that's gonna work out you do
because you just saw the app back over
in the blocks okay so here we are again
and what else do we need to do well
she's changing brush size doesn't really
make much sense so we're gonna go into
canvas and we're gonna set our line
width inside of canvas and that's going
to affect all the things that we draw so
set canvas line width this guy right
here drag him out of here
and I'm gonna drag him up there and drop
them right there and I'm doing this out
of my head so if I do something a little
bit silly please understand that so cuz
I think that it's very powerful to be
able to basically climb inside my head
if not a little bit dangerous okay so
whenever the screen is initialized what
are we gonna want to do well let's think
about that we're going to first off one
of the colors that I have there I want
to have a purple and so I'm gonna have
to create a custom purple and change
that color for that button and another
thing I don't really want the background
color to be white white I want it to be
a little bit different than white so
that the canvas area shows up a little
bit better alright so let's just do that
so screen one very first thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to change the
background color
so here's screen one background color
right there drop that right there and if
I want to use a color that is not one of
these primary colors that means I'm
gonna need to make a color so let's just
drop that inside of there and then let's
just change this just a little bit so
let's say two forty eight to forty eight
and to 48 so it's gonna be sort of a
grey very light grey let's drop that in
there and then I need to change my
purple color so that's one of these
buttons here purple color button this
guy right here and I'm gonna want to set
its background color to purple and for
some odd reason I know how to do that
that is 128 zero and one
twenty-eight so let's just go one
twenty-eight zero and one twenty-eight
whoops 128 okay that's purple so we got
our purple color on the screen now what
do I known I didn't need to do um going
to be using a database so what I'm gonna
need to do with the database is go and
get all of the things out of the
database and put them in my list of
images this guy right here
but there's a little bug inside of App
Inventor where you have to check that
the database isn't empty before you can
do that so let's go do that so I'm gonna
go control and I'm gonna say if drag
this down here and drop it right there
and I need to check not empty so I'm
going to go into logic that's when nod
is drag this down here and empty grab is
empty so we're just saying if not empty
basically and then I need to get my
database which is down here tiny DB and
I'm gonna say get value drop this right
here and the tag for this I'm gonna make
it be images and that's how it's going
to be stored the list of images that
have been saved it's going to be stored
using the tag images and then if that
database isn't empty then what I'm going
to do is I'm going to store those values
or that list from the database in my
list of images so I can just come up
here and say set and drop my list of
images in right there and then
conveniently I'm gonna be able to just
grab this guy and duplicate it and put
it right there so that's the little bug
inside of App Inventor you have to
always check if this is or if it has
data inside of it before you can put it
in there if you don't do that it's gonna
cause errors okay so the very next thing
we're gonna do is figure out what
happens if the canvas is touched now
there's a couple different things I want
to do I want to be able to draw text I
want to be able to draw text on an angle
and I want to be able to draw circles so
very first thing we're gonna do is we
are going to go find canvas which is
right here I'm gonna click on it and I'm
going to be using as many of these
things as possible just to demonstrate
them all so touched
there's touched and I have those little
check boxes inside are there that are
gonna help me decide if I want to be
able to draw text on an angle to just
simply draw text normally horizontally
or draw a circle so the very first thing
I'm going to do is I am going to need to
find out if the text box is checked and
that means that I want to draw text
instead of you know drawing lines and
things like that so I'm gonna say if
drag this drop it right there drag this
up here and give me a little bit screen
real estate and then I'm gonna need to
do some logic checking so I'm gonna say
equal to drop that right there and check
box the text check box is it check so
I'm gonna click on this and find out if
it's checked or not so if it is checked
and that means that it has the value of
true I'm true put it right there
well then I'm also going to want to
check if they want me to put it on an
angle in that situation if they if I
want to do that I'm gonna have to go
into control and do another if else
check here and I'm also going to want to
make sure that the number or the angle
is actually a number so I'm gonna have
to check for two different things so
come in here and get the and this guy
right here drop it right there and then
first I'm gonna check if it is checked
so where is that guy huh angle check box
is it checked click on that get this
well and then I'm also going to have to
do equal to of course equal to all right
so drop that there and then throw this
here and then see if it has the value of
true actually I don't even need to do
that now that I think about it I can
just put this in here cuz this returns
true so that's silly of me
trust that right there and then let's
just delete this then I'm going to need
to check that it's a number so come over
to the math section way down here at the
bottom is is it a number and I'm gonna
say that I want to check the part where
they're allowed to put in an angle which
is the angle text box this guy right
here and I'm going to want to get the
text that is inside of there and check
that it's a number and there that is
drag it and rub it right there okay so
that's gonna allow me to draw a text on
an angle so in that situation if I want
to draw text on an angle I just go over
into canvas click on it and then look
for draw text on an
goal and there it is draw text at angle
and there we go now the text that I'm
gonna want to use I'm gonna use that
little area in the bottom where I have
here let me just show you rather than
talking about something let's come in
here and let's get the canvas and let's
shrink this to 100 pixels again so I can
see it okay there it's on the screen
down here at the very bottom I'm going
to allow them to either put a file name
in here that they want to save or that
they're gonna be able to put text inside
here that we're gonna be able to draw in
the canvas okay so back inside of this
so if I want to get that text that they
can type in I'm gonna go into file name
text-box this guy right here and I'm
gonna get the text out of it so get this
drag it drop it right there
conveniently anytime you use the canvas
it's going to tell you where it was
touched and here's the XY coordinates so
if I want to get the XY coordinates put
the mouse up there drop that right there
and then get Y and drop that right there
and then the angle that we're going to
draw the text on is gonna be found in
the angle text box and we know that it
has a value and it's a number because we
check that so let's get this and put
that right there all right so that's how
we're gonna be able to draw on an angle
now otherwise if the text box was
checked however the print the text on an
angle box wasn't checked well we're
gonna have to handle that so we're gonna
come in here to this guy right here and
go else drag this over here and in this
situation we're gonna want to just print
text so we got to go back into canvas
again click right here and then just get
the draw text instead of the draw text
on an angle there we go and this is
gonna be real simple we're just gonna
get the same thing we had before there's
the text and then let's just duplicate
this as well duplicate x and y so there
you go now you're going to be able to
draw text and draw text on an angle
otherwise if this canvas was touched and
we're not going to be drawing with text
in that situation we're gonna want to
draw a circle which is another
beneficial thing to be able to do and to
draw that circle will go canvass and
then draw a circle this guy right here
first we need to get an else statement
drop it right there then get this and
put it right here and then we're gonna
get X Y and
and we're gonna duplicate this and then
the radius in this situation is going to
be the brush size variables get dropped
that right there and then I'm going to
get brush size there that is okay now
while I am thinking about it I also want
to be able to change the color that the
canvas is going to be drawing with
whenever the different colors are
clicked on let's just put this up here
and I'm just going to say when the color
button is clicked the black color button
this guy right here I want to change the
canvas color to black
so click let's just drag it and drop it
right here and then to change the canvas
color just click on canvas and then
you're going to look for paint color set
paint color and there that is right
there drag that over here drop it right
there and then you could type in
everything but I'm just gonna use the
colors and there is black right there
let's just drop it there perfect and
then I'm gonna make duplications of this
duplicate and let's go and put in a blue
and duplicate and I'm gonna do this for
all the colors and I'm going to fast
forward so you don't have to watch this
okay and for the last one I'm just going
to have to make a custom purple so let's
go in here and get purple let's get rid
of this and then we have the purple
color right here so let's just duplicate
this and there we go whenever they click
on any of these colors they're going to
automatically be able to change the
color that we're going to be drawing on
canvas and that's gonna work for the
text as well so pretty neat now what I
want to be able to do is allow the
person to drag on the canvas and I'm
gonna want them to be able to basically
draw straight lines and also allow them
to draw curved lines so what I'm gonna
have to do is go into canvas again and
I'm gonna say whenever their finger is
dragged this guy up here we'll get into
flung and animation and other stuff I'm
getting near the end of this tutorial
but I'm definitely gonna cover
everything that I promised I was gonna
cover okay so what I want to do here if
we jump over in designer here we are in
designer what I want to do here is
they are going to be able to click here
if they want to draw a straight line and
if they do not do that
then they are going to be able to draw
curved lines so I'm going to need to
check if that's checked okay so I have
to go into control of course and I'm
gonna say if drop this right there
the aligns checkbox is checked this guy
right here click on it and see if it's
been checked or not if it's been checked
if it's checked it's gonna come back
with true there then what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to draw a line with the
canvas so find draw line drag this drop
it right there and I'm also going to get
an else statement and throw it inside of
there since I'm gonna be drawing two
types of lines now if we want to draw a
straight line what we have to do is use
the starting X and the starting Y and
then the current X and the current Y
that's gonna draw straight lines if
however we want them to be able to draw
curvy lines like this we're gonna get
rid of this delete it and delete this
and instead we're going to go previous
so it's gonna keep drawing them over and
over and over again so previous X and
previous Y okay and there we are and now
we can draw straight lines or curved
lines no other thing that I'm probably
gonna want to do now that I'm thinking
about this is whenever the line checkbox
is checked I want to make sure that the
text box is unchecked
so because that would cause havoc so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say
whenever the line check box has been
changed grab this guy right here
rub it anywhere just drop it right here
well I want to check if the text box is
checked and if it is I want to uncheck
it so it's gonna act like a radio sort
of button so if the line check is
checked click on this get the checked
then I want to set the checkbox checked
for my text to false logic false and
drop it right there
then I'm going to duplicate this because
I want to do the same exact thing for
the text checkbox so text checkbox if
texts text box is true then this guy
which is now going to be set to line
check box is going
be false well there you go all right so
now those are going to operate like
radio buttons and I don't need to worry
about the angled one because it doesn't
work unless the checkbox where the text
is also clicked and what I'm talking
about is this guy right here
see I check if the text box is checked
before I check this so it's never gonna
get here all right okay so what else is
there to do
well the Save button needs to be worked
so let's go and do that let's go to the
Save button there it is and I'm gonna
say that whenever the Save button is
clicked well we're gonna want to save
and how exactly we're gonna want to do
that well first off we're gonna want to
make sure that there is a file name so
right here before we try to save we want
to make sure that they have a file name
inside of there and I'm gonna decide
that rather than give them a junk
default found him I'm gonna require them
to put one in there I'm probably also
going to want to use my notifier down
here to say hey this was saved okay um
then I'm gonna need to add the new file
to my list of images and am I gonna need
anything else yes my list picker which
is hidden but whenever I click on load
the list picker is gonna open allow me
to open up my file so I'm also gonna
want to save my list of images list into
that and then I'm gonna want to save
everything to go to the database so I
think I got all that right so let's jump
back into blocks and here we are so like
I said I want to verify that they
actually entered a file name so I'm
gonna have to get the if then and to do
that I'm going to need to check that the
file name text-box is not empty so get
this and the text drag it out of there
come back up here to the logic section
I'm gonna need the not and then I'm
going to need the text area is empty and
then get the file name text-box and put
that inside of there right like that
then I'm going to want to say that
everything's saved so where's my
notifier there's the notifier down here
and the notifier that I'm just
use a simple notice because I don't want
to do anything crazy and then I'm going
to need a way to do a join here because
I'm gonna need more than one piece of
information so there's a join drop that
right there and let's just keep this
nice and simple let's just say saved put
a space inside of there drop it right
there and I'm gonna come up here and put
another space inside of here so that it
actually has a space and then I'm gonna
call to the canvas to actually save
everything click on canvas and then go
to the saved as so this one right here
drop that right there and that's going
to say the file name that I'm gonna be
working with and the file name is gonna
be this right here duplicate that and
that is all I need to do to save that
now what I want to do is add the new
file name to my list of images so and
I'll get into how we're gonna pull those
out of the file system later on so to do
that I need to go into lists add items
to list this guy right here there we go
now I'm gonna go in to variables
and I'm gonna say I get and the lists is
list of images I believe yep list of
images and then once again the file name
here is gonna be the phone and then I'm
going to need to also save it to the
list picker so where is my list picker
there it is saved images list picker and
I'm gonna want to set the elements for
this guy to the list of images so this
guy right here duplicate this and drop
it right there and there we go now I'm
gonna want to send all this to a
database and I think I'm gonna do that
in a separate procedure in case I want
to do something later on expand on this
so I'm gonna say procedure and let's
just drop it right here and let's just
call this send to database and to send
it to the database the very first thing
I want to do is verify that actually
have a list to send to the database so
if then else boom and the logic section
not drop that right there verify that it
is an empty is list empty and then get
the global list of images then if it
isn't empty I'm gonna store it in a
database so just go down here get my
tiny DB and I'm gonna want to store my
values
and the tag is images just like I had
before and the value to store is gonna
be my global list of images duplicate
there we go and then all I need to do is
call that with Save button so procedures
and send to database and drop it right
there and there we are now I got all
that set now I need to make my load
button work yeah load button there it is
click drop it right here and whatever
that's clicked I just want my saved
images let's pick her to pop open so I
just call that to open it and then
whenever the saved images list picker is
changed after picking I'm gonna want to
save that to the canvas and to do that
we go and change the background for the
canvas and that's here set canvas
background image drop it right there
then I'm going to need a join cuz I need
a couple different things here so text
and join and what am I gonna put inside
of there well I know that this is gonna
save this to an emulated spot so I'm
just gonna go forward slash storage
forward slash emulated forward slash
zero and then another forward slash then
to that I'm going to get whatever was
selected by the list picker click on
this and then find selection on this
wares selection there it is selection
that's going to be the name that I'm
searching for and then very importantly
I want to put paying at the end of this
and um is there anything else oh there's
a Clear button also so whenever they
click on the Clear button this is gonna
be really easy I'm just gonna call for
the canvas to clear canvas and there's
clear right there so whenever they click
on the Clear button it's gonna call for
the canvas to clear it pretty simple and
is there anything else I'm almost done
here well I guess an error could occur
so let's just do that so go into screen
and if an error occurred bla bla bla bla
drop it right here and let's open up a
note of fire if an error occurred drop
it right there and just do a simple one
and then let's just be silly and just
type in error occured and there we go
and after checking the application I did
make one little error I'm going to have
to come in here and update my list
picker right whenever I initialize
everything so sorry about that so I'm
gonna go set saved images list picker
and then right here ill right there and
then i'm going to come in here and get
my list of images which is this guy
right here so get that coming on here
and put that in and everything works
perfectly okay so that's it that is how
to make a paint application inside of
App Inventor a pretty nice one actually
just want to let you guys know starting
up another giveaway for another Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 this time it is going to
be given to whoever makes the nicest
Android app using any tool imaginable
just has to be an Android app and it has
to be able to work on any Android device
it can't only work on certain devices
and of course you could use App Inventor
you could use just regular Java Android
and this whole entire contest is gonna
go on from now until the end of the
month whenever you make your app just
provide a link for me in a comment
section on my website I'm going to be
posting the information on the contest
all the information and that is where
you would post your link and the only
requirement other than it be an Android
app is that somewhere inside the app
needs to be contact information for you
so an email or something that proves to
me that you actually made the
application so please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
