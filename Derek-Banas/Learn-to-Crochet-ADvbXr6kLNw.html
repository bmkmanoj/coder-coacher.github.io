crochet tutorial and this one tutorial
are going unlearn pretty much everything
you need to know about hooks slip knots
chains
turning chains as well as single one
half double double and triple crochet
stitches and I have a lot to teach so
let's get into it crochet hooks are
gonna be differentiated by the thickness
of their shafts and millimeters and you
can see that that thickness is both
marked on the yarn as well as on the
hooks and it is perfectly normal to get
a hook that is one millimeter under the
recommended size whenever you very first
start to crochet the first thing you're
gonna have to learn how to do is to make
a slipknot so what you're gonna want to
do is take the yarn and wrap it around
your two biggest fingers and then you're
going to tuck it underneath in the back
and then you're gonna grab that you
shape and pull it forward and then
you're going to take these strings on
the side while holding the top and make
a little loop at the very top and then
you're gonna take your hook and insert
it inside of that hole right there and
then tighten it up and once again here
with thicker yarn I'm gonna wrap it
around my two fingers I'm gonna take it
behind I'm gonna tuck it underneath and
then I'm gonna grab that you shape and
pull it forward
and then get the other two strings
tighten them up make a little hole there
or a little loop and then I'm going to
insert my hook and that's easy and now
we're gonna make a chain now the most
important thing here first off is to
keep about the same amount of pressure
on the yarn the whole time you are
crocheting so what I do is I tuck it in
there in between those two fingers like
I have right there and then wrap it
around and then I grab the yarn and then
I'm gonna start making my chain so I
just insert the hook and then I'm gonna
proceed to pull it through the loop that
I have down at the bottom of the hook so
we're just gonna get it like that and
we're going to pull it through then
we're gonna take the hook once again and
we are going to lay it on the side of
the yarn and then we're going to pull it
through and you just have to do this
over and over and over again now
whenever I was first learning how to
crochet the
or the biggest mistake that I made was I
made it too tight you want to keep this
as loose as possible but not too loose
okay it's a it's like a feel thing but
you definitely don't want to get to the
point where you're struggling pulling
the hook through the loop I'll just
continue to do this a couple more times
so that you can see it and it's just
something you have to practice and if
you practice it for a long enough period
of time you'll eventually just get it
but just keep that nice and loose and
don't struggle with it otherwise it's
gonna cause all kinds of problems now I
went and made that chain 11 in total
loops right there and now what I'm going
to do is get to the hardest part now
what you're gonna have to do this is
going to be a single crochet stitch
you're going to tuck it in right in
between those loops that you are making
right inside of there or these or
whatever you would like and you're gonna
pull the yarn through once and then
you're gonna go up and you're gonna go
with your hook and get a little bit more
yarn and then you're gonna pull it
through two of those loops that you
created and you're gonna do this over
and over again so you're gonna not tuck
into where you already have put your
yarn you're gonna go to the next V
underneath of that once again you're
going to go and get your hook and you're
gonna pull it through one time and then
you give me go up again exactly as I'm
doing right here and you're gonna hook
into the side of that and then pull
through both of them once again and this
is what we call a single crochet stitch
and doing this very first row is the
hardest part of crochet at least that's
the hardest part that I've found so far
and I'm just going to demonstrate how to
do this a couple more times so we're
just gonna tuck inside of there go and
hook it pull it through once and then
we're gonna go up and get some more yarn
and then we're going to pull it through
the last 2 and repeat doing this until
you get to the end and I'm at the end of
the first line of my single crochet
stitches and I'm gonna tuck into that
and then I'm gonna make the very last
single crochet stitch
and then after that I'm going to create
a final chain before I then start going
in the opposite direction and how you
creates a final chain is you just take
your loop and you're gonna reach up and
grab your yarn and then pull it through
and now what I'm gonna do is show you
how to make a single crochet stitch row
and on the second row but second because
there's a it's a lot easier once you do
it the second time so what we're gonna
do now is we're gonna go between those
fees right like that with our hook and
then we are going to reach up and get
some yarn with our hook turn it like we
have then and then pull it through now
we have two loops on our hook we're
gonna go up and get the yarn and pull it
the whole way through so just like we
did before except this time instead of
grabbing just one piece of yarn we are
now going in and getting what is called
a V so we're getting two pieces of yarn
instead of one and that's what you're
gonna continue doing as we continue
crocheting so once again go up and get
that string and pull the whole way
through
and off you can actually see a mistake I
mean here if you ever do accidentally
grab two pieces just reach down real
gently and pull the one piece off that
is something that I fixed right there
very easily but let me tell you that
caused me a lot of headaches before I
realize just how easy it is to pull that
out all right and we'll do this and then
I'm gonna continue going on words for
the rest of this row and then we're
gonna create what is called a one half
double crochet stitch and now I'm doing
the very last one I'm gonna go and loop
there and pull it through and then after
we do that we create our final chain to
start our next row and whenever we're
gonna do a one half double crochet we
just took once and pull it through and
then we flip over our work and we
proceeded to start with the next line
now to create a one half double crochet
the thing that's different is we are
going to pull our hook underneath and
and we are going to talk hey the V just
like we did previously and we're gonna
tuck under the V and then we're gonna go
up and get some yarn with our hook pull
it through the first loop now you're
gonna have three loops on your hook and
then you're gonna go and hook the yarn
again and pull it through all three and
that's a one half double crochet and
we're gonna go do that once again after
we get that through there once again
just go up wrap your hook around your
yarn and then tuck it underneath the V
and then pull it through the first loop
and then go and pull it through all
three of the loops and you're gonna do
this once again until you get to the
point where there are none left and then
at that point once we're what we're
gonna do is we're gonna make a double
crochet stitch and you end the row or
start the new row by putting into
turning chains just as I show right here
and you pull that through and then we
are gonna loop under just like we did
before and we're gonna find our first V
to go under and we're gonna go through
that and then we're going to hook the
yarn with our hook and pull it through
like that and now we see we have three
and what we're gonna do is then go hook
it again and we're gonna pull it through
the first two of those and once again if
it gets a little it's tight don't worry
about it just take your time keep
everything nice and loose now you can
see we have two little holes there and
we're gonna go up with our hook again
and we're gonna pull it through all
right and that is a double crochet
stitch again loop under and we're gonna
find our next V that is not already
occupied tuck inside of there loop
through and then we have three and now
we're gonna go and hook it again pull it
through the first two and then we're
gonna go get some more yarn and pull it
through the last two and continue doing
that and once we get to the end of that
it's going to be time to make a triple
crochet and to do that what we're going
to do is we're actually going to make
three turning chains exactly as you see
right here and there is another one
there is the third and that's what
that's gonna look like three V's in a
row like that then we're going to turn
over our work and then we're going to do
two loops so we're gonna wrap it around
here once and then we're gonna wrap it
around there again and then we're gonna
go down into our work here and you can
see the V that's on a occupied and we're
gonna tuck inside of there and then
we're gonna pull through
and you can see now we have four loops
on our hook and then we're gonna go and
we're gonna hook into this and we're
gonna pull through the first two of them
and if anything catches don't worry
about it just take your time I'm
actually messing up a little bit here
because I'm trying to do this through a
telephone so it's a little goofy either
way so I got three on there now and now
I'm gonna go make sure I keep my tension
about the same but I also want to keep
it loose very important to keep it loose
so we're gonna go hook again and we're
gonna go through the next two and there
we go and just ease in there up you see
it got caught but I just let it slip off
and then we have two left and now I'm
gonna go and hook it once more and pull
it through the last two and that is how
we make a triple crochet stitch so there
you go guys I hope you enjoyed that and
with some practice you'll be making
yourself some slip knots and chain
stitches as well as single crochet
stitches one half double crochets double
crochets and triple crochets and like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
