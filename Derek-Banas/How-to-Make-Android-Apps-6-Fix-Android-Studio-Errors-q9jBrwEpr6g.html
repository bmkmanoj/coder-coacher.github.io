my how to make Android apps tutorial
today I'm going to cover a lot of issues
that are out there I'm going to show you
how to update Android studio 20.8 I'm
going to solve a whole bunch of Android
studio problems that come about whenever
you do so and I'm also going to answer a
question in regards to the previous
tutorial in how are we going to pass
objects between screens very simple
should it covered it before I'll cover
it this time
if you didn't watch part 5 you should
definitely watch it unless you're just
here for the new Android studio stuff
and otherwise I have a lot to do so
let's get into it ok so to get the new
Android studio we're just going to go to
developer.android.com SDK installing
studio dot HTML and you didn't come down
here and click on this guy right here
and install everything and everything is
wonderful now after you install
everything we're going to have to go in
here and fix a couple things what we're
going to do first is we're going to go
into configure and then we're going to
go into project defaults make sure you
can see everything here and project
structure whenever you do you're going
to want to make sure that this is the
right SDK folder that you want to use
and this is the java version that you
want to use as well now of course this
right here is probably going to be
different on your computer and this is
going to be different so just look for
the SDK folder and the version of Java
you want to use then after you have that
just come down here and click on OK now
we're going to bounce back again and
we're gonna solve another common issue
come down to configure again then you're
going to go to preferences and all this
information is going to show up we're
going to go to compiler Java compiler
and you're going to want to make sure
that one point six is selected right
there and then come down here and click
on ok all right now you have all that
setup I'm going to go in and open up an
application everything's going to start
installing here one of the errors that
is extremely common you're probably
going to see is that the project is
using an unsupported version of Gradle
well to solve that come down here let's
move this up a little bit you're going
to see that error pop up at the top of
the screen and then down here you're
going to say click update plugin for
Gradle so just click on that and that
solves that issue all right that's one
of the first things almost everybody
says now we're going to go into the SDK
manager this guy right here and I'm
going to show you everything that I have
installed in the SDK manager okay here
it is so I have Android SDK tools 23 and
I have 24 the platform tools all of
these different guys as well as 19 point
0.1 this is the one I'm going to use a
lot because the emulator works perfect
for that I'm going to show you how to
set up the emulator as well and there is
air everything else I have set up there
you go there you go so that's every
single thing I have installed most
important thing is that you have 19
right here you have all these things
installed as well as what I had at the
top there's 18 and I also have the
support repository and the support
library installed down here so that's
everything and then of course to install
everything you just click on what you
want to install just put a little check
mark here and click on install one
package and then select up here click on
accept license and install alright so
now we have the SDK manager setup now
it's time to set up the Android virtual
device manager which is this guy right
here and here we are and I've gotten
this guy to work on my device but the
emulator is really kind of wonky so I'm
just going to come in on this guy right
here and we click on edit and then for
this guy I just called it Nexus doesn't
matter what you call it I'm going to
select Nexus 7 right there I have level
19 for Android and Intel Atom as long as
you have an Intel processor you can use
that scheme with dynamic code word
controls nothing for the cameras you can
see exactly much RAM how much heap how
much internal storage and I use host GPU
down here and that is what I use so I'm
going to click on OK another error that
you're probably going to see the error
is you IDs are inconsistent okay solve
that issue it's pretty simple just click
on this guy or whatever emulators you
want to use or all your emulators you're
going to click on start whenever you do
that you're going to see an option here
wipe user data you're going to click on
that and click on launch that is going
to get rid of that UID error and that is
everything those are all areas that I
have seen with Android studio and
exactly how to solve them another well
actually there's one more over here
one thing that's confusing for people is
you can see build.gradle right here and
build.gradle right there this is the one
you're going to want to work with so we
decided we're going to use Android 19
and you're going to open
sky up you're going to put 19 there 19
point 1.0 make sure that is set properly
I'm going to use the minimum SDK 14
there's 19 again and then if you come
down here and you scroll up a little bit
you're going to see down here with this
guy make sure you have version 7 : 19 +
or well don't forget that little decimal
point + ok if you do that and let's just
show you what's going to happen if I
change this in any way you're going to
see up here Gradle files have changed
this last project sync da da da da come
over here and click on sync now and
that's going to fix any of those errors
that you might get I'm going to switch
this back to nineteen and click on sync
now that's what I want and like I said
the reason I'm using 19 is because the
emulators are unstable on some operating
systems so that's the issue and we want
to just keep on making Android whenever
they do get Android else set up properly
and working then we will use it so we're
going to get rid of that and then what
I'm going to do is show you how to pass
objects between screens again this is
from part 5 I didn't cover this so I'm
going to cover it now first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to create a
custom object new Java class over here
and I'm going to call this human and
click on OK and there is human now if
you want to pass objects between screens
what you're going to need to do is come
up here and type in implements
serializable there it is and what
serializable basically means is by
putting it there you're stating that
this class can be sent to other services
and this will allow you to save
instances of a class and restore them
whenever you need it so we need that and
then we're going to come down here and
we're going to create our constructor no
point and get in anything well let's go
in here and define private double and
let's give our human a height and a
weight and then let's also give our
human a string name too and nothing and
that and then I'm going to right click
inside of here and come down here to
generate click on that and when you do
you're going to see constructor pop up
here just come in here and select all
those and come down here click on OK
then I'm going to right click again
I'm gonna go generate again and I'm
going to say that I want my getters and
setters generated for me as well just
come in here and highlight all those I'm
down here click on OK
and there you go that's all we have to
do for this customized object and you
can pass any type of serializable object
back and forth between screens as well
now we're going to jump over into
mainactivity.java and setup the passing
of this object and all of the changes
are going to occur in this method down
here on get name click and I don't need
anything over here so let's just move
that out of the way so we can zoom in a
little bit so you can see everything
good now right after we have this result
right here we're going to get rid of
this guy and we could also get rid of
this guy as well because we're not going
to need that there it goes and then
we're going to come in scroll this up a
little bit and we're going to define our
customized Bob human is equal to new
human there it is and let's say that he
is six and a quarter feet tall 185
pounds and his name is Bob now if we
want to send this we have an intention
to send Bob I'm just going to call it
send Bob equal to new intent and then we
have to pass our context to it and then
we have to say where we want it to be
passed which is 2nd screen and class and
there that is now if we want to put Bob
inside of our intent we're going to go
to put extra and then we are going to
give it the key of human Bob and then we
are going to say that we want to pass
our Bob object pretty simple then down
here for start activity we're going to
use the same thing start activity for
result just come in here is you are
intent and the result and that's it you
just passed an object over and I'm going
to run the emulator to show you what
happens we're going to have to go into
second screen dot Java now and make a
couple little changes here inside of on
create this guy up here we can get rid
of this guy right here just comment that
out and what we're going to have to do
is create a Bob over here equal to human
and then we're going to go activity that
called and then get serializable extra
and just say the key that we want human
Bob now we have our text view right here
and we're going to pop in all Bob's
information into that text view so
calling activity
message append and in this situation I'm
going to say that I want Bob and get his
name put that inside of there and let's
put a space there plus and then let's
also go and get Bob's height and we
could say feet plus get his weight and
we could say pounds if we make those
changes let's go in here and let's run
this guy pops up we want to click on the
emulator pick the nexus that we just set
up in our abd and click on ok and our
emulator opens up and we can just click
on go get it and you can see right there
the Bob data was passed over and we can
still to them in here and type my name
click on enter and then it pops over and
gives my name right there so that's how
to pass objects how to fix Android
another thing you guys might not know
about is I'm giving away another Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 as well as a Galaxy gear
SmartWatch and all you need to do is
before the end of the month go to the
link under the video in the description
and submit an android app made by
anything you can use the Android studio
use eclipse you can use App Inventor you
use anything one of the only restraints
is it has to work on every Android
device or you know within a minimum that
makes sense but I have all the rules in
the description so click on those and go
and make yourself an Android app and win
a couple Android devices and for the
next tutorial what I'm going to do is
I'm going to make a conversion app what
you guys wanted to see me make an app
this time what I'm going to do is I'm
going to make an app from scratch I'm
not even going to create the use case
I'm going to do that live right here for
you in the next video so if you have any
questions or comments please leave them
down below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
