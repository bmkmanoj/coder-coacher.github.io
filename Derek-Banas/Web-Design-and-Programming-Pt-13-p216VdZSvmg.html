my web design and programming tutorial
today I'm going to talk to you about
exception handling
now with PHP if you want to show errors
in the browser when they occur in your
code you're gonna have to open up your
PHP ini file which you can see right
here and you're gonna have to locate a
line on here that's gonna say display
errors underscore errors equals and it's
going to say off you want to switch this
to on and then save the PHP I and I file
and you're ready to go we can regards to
checking for errors in your code as well
as exception handling okay so after you
have that done and saved you're gonna
have to restart your server which I
trust you know how to do that and then
at that point you're gonna have to
decide what type of error reporting you
want to occur and just to step back here
for one second an exception is just
simply an error that occurs in your
program and you can make that make more
sense by just saying that your code will
work except if the client or the user of
your program types in something for
example if you're performing divisions
and your code will work as long as they
do not tell you being a zero which would
caught as an error you would of course
want to protect from that entering on
zero and then what you do is you set up
code to handle those errors and then
those errors or exceptions are thrown to
that code and that code is then used to
protect against any errors showing on
the screen and in general just makes
everything right you turn on error
reporting in your PHP code by typing in
reporting and then normally you're gonna
always type e underscore all you're
never gonna use this in anything except
developmental code because normally of
course you wouldn't want errors to show
up even if they did occur see it's even
better for your whole entire process to
just crash and not work but this is in
the development stage that you would use
this code right here for reporting of
any errors and whenever you type e
underscore all in here this is gonna
warn on all errors and all warnings and
this is the most common way to use their
reporting in PHP and if you wanted to
temporarily shut this off you would just
put 0 inside of there I'm gonna leave it
on and you could also put e underscore
if it's strict all in uppercase letters
and you will be notified if your code is
what PHP considers non
optimized code so that's how you turn on
error reporting now in regards to error
handling what you're gonna do is you're
gonna type after the word try and in
between curly brackets any code that you
want to protect in regards to errors
what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna call
for a function called error Wrangler and
I'm gonna pass it the number one and
number two so two attributes are
variables and then I'm also going to
define up here number one is equal to
one and number two is equal to zero and
because of the division by zero is gonna
cause an error we are going to trigger
an exception on purpose and then if this
does not cause an error this code here
is gonna print number one divided by
number two is and then the answer to
that division this code here will never
be triggered if an error occurs however
you didn't understand that about the try
if this causes an error it is not going
to go down here it's gonna simply handle
that error so now we need to define the
function error Wrangler and you could of
course put this code inside here that is
contained inside of error Wrangler and
get rid of this all together but I just
chose to do it this way number one
number two and then you're gonna say if
number two is equal to zero we know
that's going to trigger an error then
you want to call the throw command no
exception and you're gonna create a
custom error message that will be shown
on the screen otherwise we're just going
to return true so the whole point of
this function is to simply see if
there's something wrong with this code
and I separated this out from here well
then if you're throwing an error you
need to catch that exception so you know
start it off every time with exception
followed by dollar E and you're gonna
print out the screen error or whatever
you want to and here's the most useful
functions that are going to be available
to you by paying reference to this
object e we are going to call a function
that's going to print out this custom
error message that you put up a up side
here and these are all the useful
exception methods that are available to
you okay file is going to print out the
file that caused the error
and you can see here in a second what
these look like and get in line just
gonna print the line in the code that
caused the error and then close that off
and close this off now if we run this
I'll save it you can see can't divide by
zero shows up and shows the location of
the code that triggered the error right
there on the second line and it just
shows you also that the earth occurred
at line 18 inside of your code and if
you'd actually want to overwrite the
class exception object you could also do
that and create custom error caching
inside of PHP how you would do that is
come in here and just extend that class
so I'm gonna call this my new class
arrow Wrangler and it's going to extend
the exception class and then I'm gonna
define inside of this a function that
I'm gonna call error report and what
it's going to do is create a string it's
going to contain all of that error
information that we talked about before
and this is identical to what you saw
before except because we're working with
an object here we're going to use the
this method which is a reference to the
exception object everything else is
identical get the file the triggered the
air and get the line that the error
occurred on and then close that off and
then this guy is just going to return
that string you just created right there
and that is actually the end of the
class that's all that you wanted to
change with this said class so we're now
gonna create another try block where we
think an error could occur I'm going to
show you a couple different exceptions
that you can handle or how to handle
multiple exceptions so let's say if the
number two is equal to zero
we want one exception to be thrown so
throw new error Wrangler can't 0 close
that off else if no space number 2 is
equal to 1 let's just say to be funny as
you throw an error on throw new
exception this is the default exception
that you throw and if you do this what's
on this line it will guarantee that any
errors are caught so divide by 1 I'm
just making something up here and then
we don't need to put the else in here
and we're just going to go if neither of
those things happened number 1
number two is and then just put number
one divided by number two just like that
and then want to close off our try block
and now we have to catch those errors if
they are thrown and this is our custom
exception handling class that we created
error Wrangler right here and if this is
triggered we're going to shoot out the
screen exactly the returned information
that we get from the function called
error report and if you wanted to log
this error to a text file is you would
take this same code that's returned from
the error report function this string
right here and this will log it to a
text file that you could look at later
on or see all your errors in one place
this is actually very useful three means
that you want this information output it
to a text file and the name of the text
file and of course you have to have
permission right to it and the die
function which doesn't necessarily have
anything to do with exception handling
but I just wanted to go over it what it
will do is if it has ever called it will
kill your program and no longer run
anything and we're if that is called
we're going to have it also print out a
message to the screen that says
something bad happened so there's
another function and then if you want to
make sure that you catch all other
exceptions that are thrown just catch
the generic exception exception just
like that but always make sure this is
the last exception that you catch if you
put this up here it's gonna actually
catch this error even though that one is
not called so it's very important to
always keep this exception this
catch-all exception last in your
sequences of catches and if that's
called we're going to simply call the
get message that is sent which is this
message right here don't divide by one
and we're gonna print that to screen
just like that and if we file save that
you can see right here at printed error
can't divide by zero this is this guy
right here because number two equals
zero it's gonna print the location of
the code that caused the error this
specific line in which that error
occurred and then also something bad
happened because the die function was
called right here and if we jump up here
and click on this and put one inside of
here file state of it jump over here you
can see that don't divide by one was
called which was called by the this guy
right here this was the catch-all
exception and then of course if you come
in here and
I've been a legitimate number and file
save it you can see that it printed out
legitimate information because there was
no exception to handle so that is just a
brief overview of a bunch of little
things that in regards to how you use
exception handling inside of PHP now of
course I'm gonna get a lot more into it
in the upcoming examples that are coming
and especially whenever we start getting
into how to secure PHP if you have any
questions or comments leave them below
and otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
