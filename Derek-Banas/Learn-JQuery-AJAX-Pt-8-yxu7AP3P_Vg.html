eight and the final part of my jQuery
AJAX tutorial in this tutorial I'm going
to show you exactly how to pass
information back and forth to the server
without page reloads that is the core
ability that Ajax techniques provide to
you and jQuery makes it real easy if you
didn't watch part 7 of this tutorial you
definitely want to watch it because at
the end of part 7 I actually show you
the working web page that I'm going to
describe in this tutorial so what will
you learn here I'll show you model ways
you can retrieve text and XML from the
server using jQuery and Ajax techniques
of course this works without a page
reload I'll also show you how to send
data to the PHP server for processing it
will then send that information back
like always I'll walk you through the
code and explain everything just as I
have in the previous tutorials you can
see here on the left and right side of
your screen all of the XML code that is
needed if this looks like gibberish to
you make sure you check out my xml
tutorial before you proceed basically
what we're doing here is we're just
loading in customer information being an
identification number first name last
name street city and zip this XML file
is gonna reside on a server and we are
going to use jQuery and Ajax techniques
to retrieve it and display it on the web
page without a page reload this is the
PHP code will use to double whatever
value was passed to it and then echo the
result to the web page if this doesn't
make sense see my how to code PHP video
tutorial it's pretty simple we're just
posting a value to this PHP file it is
going to multiply that value times two
and send it right back to us but you can
pretty much do anything you want in your
PHP script and send it back using the
exact techniques you see here this is
the actual HTML and jQuery code here I'm
defining the beginning of my HTML file I
then go and retrieve the newest jQuery
library and of course you can hit pause
on the screens to write this down or go
to new think tank comm and just download
all of this code for free here I define
all the event handlers for all the
buttons on the web page
I also define what functions should be
called when the events are triggered for
example when the button named one button
is clicked
code will run the function named get
info from server this buttons HTML code
you can see down here and the second and
bulleted item in the lower left hand
side of your screen here I'm using the
Ajax function to pull text in a text
file on the server over to my web page a
set of key value pairs are used to
configure the Ajax request all options
are of course optional and here I'll
show you all of all the optional options
for the Ajax function first off you have
type and this refers to the type of
request to make being either post or get
and the default is get URL contains the
URL to which the request is going to be
sent you would almost always throw a
value in for this the option success
will tell you which function to call if
the request succeeds it passes three
values to the function that precedes
this keyword success they are the data
returned from the server text status
which describes the service status and
the XML HTTP request object XML HTTP
request is an object in the lp sense
that you will use to communicate with
the server without reloading your page
the data option will contain the data to
be sent to the server data type defines
the type of data that you're expecting
back from the server be it XML HTML
script JSON JSON P or just simple text
the option error will tell you what
function is to be called if a request
fails this function has passed three
arguments again the xml httprequest
object a description of the type of
error that occurred in an optional
exception object and a bunch more
options are also available for the Ajax
function but they're not commonly used
so I'm not going to go over them in this
part of the tutorial continuing on with
the code this function receives the text
from the text file as well as the server
status it then adds the text to the
element with the identification name
first and you can see here in the third
bulleted item the code for that
paragraph here I'm loaning a value into
a span element with the load function
the load function is passed the location
on the PHP script in the data you
pass to that script you could also pass
a callback function that is executed
when the request completes the function
serialize array creates a JavaScript
array made up from the elements in the
form named in this circumstance the form
that is the data passed to the PHP file
named get double you can see the PHP
code above previous in the tutorial this
function is pulling the XML data from
the server notice that I define that I
expect the data return to be of type XML
with the option data type colon followed
by XML after the Ajax function is
executed the function post a page 2 is
passed the data to be processed this
function receives all of the XML data
for to customers and appends that data
to the element named customers the find
method allows us to search through the
XML data looking for a tag named
customer when found ice then assigned
the values that lie between the opening
customer tag I defined and the closing
customer tag I defined to the JavaScript
variables the final five lines of code
are appending these values passed to the
end of the element name customers and
the rest of the code is straight HTML
code which I am sure you understand this
is the end of my jQuery and Ajax
tutorial I hope it helped if you have
any questions or would like to see more
on jQuery AJAX or anything else leave
them in the comment section below and
you can see here the final part of the
