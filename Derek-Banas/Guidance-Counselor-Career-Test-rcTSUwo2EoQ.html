guidance counselor test today through
taking this test you'll be able to
discover what job is perfect for you or
what business is best for you I created
this tutorial because John sent me a
message as you can see here asking for
me to create a aptitude or career test
that would show people what career or
business would be best for them what I
did was I went to a whole bunch of
guidance counselors and found the best
test and the one that was most accurate
for me and I'm going to present that to
you here in this presentation it's
pretty much just like a way for you to
be able to visit a guidance counselor
anytime that you would like and also I
provided this test on my website if you
get a new think tank and go to business
plan business proposal and click on that
this is going to pop up and here is the
thing where you can just type in all of
your information and it automatically
will calculate everything for you but if
you'd prefer to just do it here in this
presentation that's fine too all you're
basically going to need to do is create
a chart that looks like this with Co n
in the top left corner see re see AR co
M SOC inv and so forth and so on and as
you take the test which ever answer best
fits you you'll put a little tick in a
mark in one of these boxes and it's very
important that you answer as quickly as
possible and don't think too much about
your answers and here are the questions
and I'm just going to explain this to
you right here it says I want my income
to be stable and if that's true of you
then you would put a tick in the o RG
box and if you don't care if your income
fluctuates to very very high amounts and
then in other circumstances to very low
amounts then you would put a tick in the
inv box and I'm gonna take this test
with you and try to timeout everything
as we go along
in this part of the test what you want
to do is think of this as either true or
false
so in question 36 here it says I welcome
criticism from others if that's true put
a mark and see re if it's false don't
put a mark anywhere
okay so that's the end of the test and
if you have more votes in the co n area
than in any of the other areas that
means your consultant and if you fit
into this area that means you have a lot
of experience more than likely and love
to give your advice and also if you're a
consultant you must strive to either get
a job or start a business in which you
can exercise this part of your
personality which is your love of
providing your own advice and some
examples of jobs in this area you can
see here on the screen and I'm gonna go
further and use my own results as an
example to show you exactly what it
would mean if you had equal numbers of
checks in different boxes
if you find that you have a lot of ticks
in the CRE area this just simply means
you have a desire to create things and
people that fit into this category
normally wish to follow their own path
but also enjoy bringing other people's
dreams to life and if you are a creative
you will never be satisfied in any job
in which you're not able to exercise
your creativity and here are some
examples of jobs or businesses you could
be involved in if you're a creator and
of course if I'm going too fast just
click pause if you have a large number
of tics in the caregiver area or CA are
this just means you love to help and
support others and more than likely
you're gonna find meaning in life based
off of how many people you're able to
help and here are some examples of
physicians that would be perfect for a
caregiver then if you have a lot of tics
in the communicator area or Co M you're
the type of person that likes to explain
your ideas were the ideas of others and
a position would be perfect for you if
you're a communicator is one that will
allow you to constantly talk people
through issues and move people in
general towards success and if you are a
communicator chances are you are an
expert in one or in numerous different
areas of studies and here are some
positions that would be perfect for a
person that is a communicator if you
have a lot of tics in the socializer
area or SOC you're a person that is
happiest whenever everyone around you is
happy and of course if you are a
socializer you definitely do not want a
job that would force you to be quiet all
day and here are the type of positions
that would be perfect for a socializer
now what you want to think about is look
at these different careers and then
think which one works good for me or
which one sounds good and write that one
down and then after you have all of this
info
in front of you you're gonna combine it
and weed it out feel a lot of ticks in
the investor area or I envy this is
means that you're more than likely a
person has no problem accepting risk
this is also the type of person that has
the best chance to strike it rich but
also the person has the best chance of
failing miserably people that are of the
investor type that are successful are
just simply people that never give up no
matter how many failures they have and
of course you are again the type of
person that would not want a position
that would make you feel tied down and
here are the type of careers that are
perfect for investors if you have a lot
of ticks in the organizer or a G box
this means that you are a person that's
extremely comfortable with juggling
multiple tasks at a time you're also
going to get extremely irritated if
you're surrounded by people that are
disorganized and you may or may not
enjoy keeping other people organized and
here are the type of careers that are
perfect for the organizer type if you
have a lot of ticks in the salesperson
or s al box this means you're a person
that finds a lot of success in closing
deals you'll be extremely aggravated by
anyone who gets in your way and you're
also more than likely probably gonna
have trouble with management because why
they more than likely will get in your
way of closing deals and if you're a
salesperson pretty much any business and
what you're selling is the right type of
business for you to be involved in
techies which this is where I ranked
number one are people that love gadgets
and technology in general more than
likely are going to require a good
amount of a long time for which you
utilize to go through mountains of
information and more than likely you're
completely obsessed with information in
general you probably won't require much
people time and unless you have a lot of
ticks in some of the other socializing
areas you're probably not going to be a
person that's that interested in
socializing and here are some perfect
jobs for the techie okay now I'm gonna
go through my results and explain
exactly what I came up with this is
based off of actually talking to a real
guidance counselor who explained exactly
how to make sense of these results well
I got nine ticks in the techy area in
the under artist I got eight and
third-hand communicator so what does
this tell me I'm just gonna look at the
techie and artists first this tells me
that I would best love a job in which
I'm either a web developer programmer a
graphic designer
that makes sense because if you combine
techie with artist
that's pretty much what you get now if
you add in the communicator aspect that
leaves me with the perfect job being
either web developer programmer being
involved in tech support again
communication being a public speaker or
a blog writer well that's pretty much
what I do for a living I am a web
developer programmer tech support public
speaking blog writer and I'm quite happy
with that this all came about because a
lot of people liked my personality test
and I provide a link to those here on
the screen if you have any questions or
comments about this tutorial or test
