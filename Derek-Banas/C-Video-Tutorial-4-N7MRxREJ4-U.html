4 of my C video tutorial today we're
going to do a lot of experimenting using
pointers and how they relate to arrays
and functions if you missed any of the
previous parts of this tutorial I'll
link to all of those in the upper right
hand corner and I'm also going to try to
transcribe what I'm saying here in this
tutorial and I'm going to provide it in
the code that is in the description for
this video so I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay I'm using the
same setup as before TextWrangler basic
text editor and terminal if you're on
Windows use notepad plus plus and the
command line or whatever you want to use
okay so I'm going to be doing a lot of
experimenting here because I want to try
to make this fun and I'm exploring
different teaching capabilities that I
have now of course we all know whenever
we compile and run our program you're
going to be provided with a piece of
memory and RAM to store the data for
example like variables so let's just
come in here and just create ourselves
some variables R + 2 is equal to 15 okay
so we know that that is going to be
assigned to some area inside of the
memory and each time we're going to
create one of these integers 4 bytes of
data is going to be saved in that memory
and we know that because the previous
tutorials and each of those areas in
memory are going to have an address
which we are going to be able to use to
locate said data and we can actually
come in here and return set address
let's just say R + 1 is equal to by
putting in a % P and then we'll say ran
to is equal to and another % P like that
and then what we're going to have to do
is throw an ampersand in front of those
two variables so there's R + 1 and R + 2
that's going to return the addresses for
them now sometimes it's going to seem as
if these variables are actually going to
be stored next to each other but that's
not necessarily true the reason why
people think it's true is very often
they are sort next to each other but not
always so you can't really rely on that
so for example just to show this type in
addy and then what I'm going to do is
put size of and then throw R + 1 inside
of there which is going to pop back a 4
then if I want to go in here and
actually print this out rather than
using a hexadecimal version
of the address so I want to print out
the decimal version so we can analyze
this just going to put in a D inside of
there don't need to change anything else
pop over here compile and execute and
you're going to see here there's the
hexadecimal version of the addresses and
here is the decimal versions of the
exactly the same address see here the
size of the integer is four and you're
going to see here 88 well if we go 89 90
91 92 they're going to see the new
address for the next one very often like
I said they show up next to each other
in memory but not a good idea to count
on that now if we want to assign this
address to another variable so that we
can pass the address along to say maybe
other functions so that they'll be able
to access the data we're going to have
to use the same exact data type for our
pointer and very often pointers are
going to be having a P in front of them
and then we just get the address exactly
the same way that we got it before there
we go and now it is going to be stored
inside of this variable the address that
is and just like we did previously we're
going to be able to go in here and print
out the address for our pointer so let's
just change this to pointer like that
pointer again the only thing it's going
to be different is this actually has the
address inside of it so we don't need
the ampersand in that situation we can
just type in random one
actually it's Rand one and then Rand one
again up over here compile execute and
you're going to see that yes indeed this
address that is down here seven five six
is the same as the one that's up here so
that's how we can store those addresses
inside of other variables now if we want
to actually go in here and get the data
that is held in that address using the
pointer we're going to use an asterisk
to get the value that's stored there and
this is known as dereferencing the
pointer and dereferencing just means to
use the pointer to access the variable
and it's very easy to use we're just
going to say printf and if we want to
say value for the pointer we just we
only get the decimal representation
since it's an integer of course that's
going to be stored in there data wise
then we're just going to put the
asterisks inside of there and then P R +
1
just like we did before compile execute
and you can see now the value is 12 and
if we come back up side here well I
didn't actually print the value out but
we can come up here and see that Rand
one's value is 12 so that's how we can
get that information so now let's see
exactly how we're going to work with
arrays and pointers now in essence an
array name is pretty much a pointer so
we're going to create prime numbers like
this throw some data inside of here and
we can actually print the values by
index just like any other array so if we
say first index like that we can then
come in and go prime numbers and print
the index that way but another way we
can use it or another way we can print
it is using the asterisk because what is
passed over is in essence a pointer and
by putting asterisks in front of it that
is going to give us the first index
inside of our character array compile
and execute and you can see they are the
same now of course we're going to be
able to very easily get the three for
example which I just coming in here and
changing this to one but how would we do
the same exact thing down here using
this asterisk well we're going to use
something called pointer arithmetic to
access that information and in essence
what you're going to be doing is adding
one to the address and since it contains
n so in essence what's going on is we're
going to skip 4 bytes forward and yes if
you are wondering you're able to also do
this and grab information that lies
after the memory area where you are but
that's not advisable and there we go
that does exactly the same thing compile
and there you can see so that's another
way to get in here and do this stuff
well that brings us to how do we work
with arrays of strings well in essence
what we're going to do is we are going
to create an array of strings by
creating an array of pointers and to do
that we're going to type in character
with an asterisk students and let's say
one old four of them and let's say it's
Sally
mark-paul and Sue just random names and
there we are now if we want to retrieve
them
could do it in a bunch of different ways
and that's kind of why I'm approaching
this as experimenting with this stuff I
think it's a little bit more fun but
it's also going to show you the
importance of experimenting okay so if
we want to print out this information
and let's say that we want to print out
more than just the name well to get the
string I mean it's a string so there we
are just put it yes inside of it
but if we also want to get the address
for it just put a D inside of it bounce
down here and then we're going to say
students I and then we can get the
address by putting the ampersand in
front of it and doing students I as well
compile execute and there you can see
not only the names print out but also
the addresses that's kind of cool
so now let's go and take a look at how
we're going to use pointers with
functions and how to pass information
back and forth between functions we're
going to basically do the same thing
again we're going to create Rand 1 this
time just going to initialize it to 0
and RAM 2 and initialize that to 0 as
well then what we're going to do is we
are going to call we're going to mess up
on purpose here first just to show how
important pointers are and I'm trying to
present this model different ways to use
pointers and as the tutorial the c
tutorial itself continues i'm going to
change some things all right so we have
that set up but of course we're going to
create our function ahead of time up
here we're going to say void as we'll
just go and copy this generate two
random numbers and that's why we need
standard library by the ways we're going
to use a random number generator int r +
1 remember it doesn't matter what the
name is these are brand new variables
and just the values of these are being
passed up here so the name is really
doesn't matter but I just wanted to use
the real name just to show that okay so
now if I want to actually come in here
and generate some random numbers I'm
going to use the rand function this
isn't the greatest random number
generator but I'm just using it just
here for now what this is going to do in
essence is generate numbers from 0 to 49
of course if you want to generate from 1
to 50 just add a 1 to the end of it
come up here change this to random 2 and
then let's say I want to come in
to actually print out new brand one in
function is equal to and go R + 1 and
then we can do the same exact thing for
ran - just to show that it's not working
the way that we might have thought it
would - and we can come down inside of
here and go print R + 1 is equal to and
print out exactly what R + 1 is equal to
and then do exactly the same thing for
ran to compile and execute you can see
up here in the function they were
generated and they got number 8 + 50 for
the random number
however down here inside of main R + 1 +
R + 2 still have the value of 0 so how
do we fix that well I think you know the
answer is going to be pointers but you
may ask yourself hey what about global
variables remember last time we use
global variables and we were able to
access those global variables and change
them no matter what function we were
using well that's actually a pretty good
idea except for the numerous problems
that come along with global variables so
for example just to list a couple of
them let's say you have all your
variables stored as global variables
well if you bring in any other outside
functions you might have problems such
as naming conflicts you use the same
global variable same name as somebody
else uses so that could cause a lot of
problems it also can be really hard to
figure out where changes are coming from
whenever so many different functions are
accessing global variables and it's also
going to eliminate a lot of flexibility
because you don't know if a change made
by one function might adversely affect
some other function in your program so
it's best to almost never use global
variables and like I said before we're
going to be able to solve all these
problems using pointers so let's come in
here and I'm just going to change the
code a little bit and it will say printf
and then we're going to say main B for
function call because I probably should
did that before let's clear this and
then we're going to call function and
then I'm going to say main after
function call and then I'm going to
print these out like that and then I'm
going to call I'm just going to change
the name of this so I don't cause
confusion but say pointer random numbers
and in this situation I want to pass the
address
how do I do that what am I going to put
here ampersand of course and I'm going
to put another ampersand now it's going
to provide me with the address so that
I'm going to be able to go in there and
change it and then I'm going to come in
here copy that paste that in there and
then I have to come up here and create
pointer random numbers so I'm just going
to leave this right here the way it is
there's one change here I'm going to
have to make math to put a star inside
of there and if your arguments that
you're sending to a function or ever
passed as pointers you're going to put
this asterisk after the datatype in both
situations of course and just to
reiterate because I keep bouncing back
and forth between the ampersand and the
asterisk to get the address of the
variable we're going to use the
ampersand that guy right there
and to access the data that's in the
address we're going to use the asterisk
okay so that's how it's different then
if we want to assign we're just going to
put a star in front of here star inside
of here and then if you want to retrieve
the value also inside of the function
you're going to put another asterisk
inside of there compile execute you can
see main before function call Rand is 1
0 R and 2 is 0 new Rand wanted function
is going to be 8 and 50 we're back
inside of main and Rand 1 still has a
value of 8 and 50 that was assigned in
the function so you may ask yourself
well how do you pass strings around
because that's one of the only things we
didn't cover let's just get rid of that
all together and let's get rid of this
method here all together and let's do
pretty much the same thing with me okay
so what we're going to do is we are
going to create a character array I'm
just going to call it random message and
I'm going to say edit my function there
we are so there's a couple different
ways to do this
I'm going to do it treating it like it
is an array because that is what it is
alright so what we're going to do here
is we're going to pass in random message
and then we're also going to pass in
size of random message to our function
and then of course we are going to print
it out print F and say new message like
this
random message after the functions all
done so that just leaves us to create
edit message sense and what I'm going to
do with this is good
edit message sent then what you need to
do is go character star for the message
and I'm going to just have it be a
different message name it doesn't really
matter and then I'm also going to come
in here and go sighs and I'm going to
create a new message like I said I'm
going to treat this like an array
because that's what it is and we're
gonna go new message then I'm going to
say if the size you passed in is bigger
than the message I'm about ready to put
inside there well that's okay then
I'm going to say int and define this I
don't have to do that I can just go for
int I is equal to zero
doesn't really matter then I'm going to
say I while I is less than size of new
message and then increment I and then if
I want to assign these new values I can
do so new message and then I could come
down here and say something like else
new message is too big or something like
that
compile execute and you can see that new
message was overwritten based off of the
previous message and just to prove that
I guess I didn't prove it take an old
message file save compile
there you go edit my function I should
have typed in edit my message doesn't
matter edit my function and there it is
as new message so that's one way to
change or edit strings inside of outside
functions using pointers as the tutorial
continues I'm going to try to experiment
more and have these tutorials be a
little bit more fun and maybe make them
feel a little bit more like a classroom
atmosphere so of course if you have any
questions or comments leave them in a
comment section below otherwise till
