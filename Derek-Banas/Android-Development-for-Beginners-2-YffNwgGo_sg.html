2 of my android development tutorial for
beginners with a focus on App Inventor
and in this part of the tutorial I'm
going to introduce you to App Inventor
blocks and we are going to completely
finish the app that we just started in
part 1 of this tutorial and so if you
haven't seen part 1 of this tutorial I
provide a link in the upper right hand
corner as well as in the description for
this video and you absolutely have to
watch it otherwise no this is going to
make sense so I have a lot to do so
let's jump into it okay so in the last
part of the tutorial we created this
whole entire interface we have right
here and one thing that I left out is
the icon this is going to be the icon
that represents your application on your
Android device and just to show you what
it looks like here it is actually it's
not there here is actually the zombie
picture that I drew and inside of here
this is just what I'm going to use for
my zombie icon and it's 96 pixels by 96
pixels so it will show up really nice
and all I need to do to import it is
just to go over here to icon click on it
come down here and click on upload file
this little guy here is going to pop up
and I'm going to hit choose file and
here is the zombie icon just double
click on it and then click OK and it's
going to appear over here in a second as
it loads and there it is on the icon and
that's how easy it is to go and add an
icon for your application now what I
want to do is jump in and actually show
the application running okay so to test
our application here it is you can see
it on the screen hello zombie hopefully
you can see it there it is right there
now if you have this installed but you
do not have GPS enabled this is what's
going to happen so you're going to open
it like any other app and then you're
going to see this warning message it's
going to say can't access GPS please
enable GPS well because we set
everything up so that it will go and
automatically go to the right part of
the settings and allow the user to
enable GPS they'll hit OK and then
they'll get sent to exactly the right
place which is right here and they'll
have to put a checkmark right there and
then they'll be able to use our
application by hitting the back button
first and then they're back inside of
our application and it's working ok so
you got an example of what exactly is
going to happen
and or what we're going to have to
program to make it work so that if the
user doesn't have their GPS set up it's
going to go and it's going to send them
to the settings part so that they're
going to be able to run and use their
application now let's take a look at all
the things we're going to have to build
inside of our application okay so as you
saw we're going to need to enable the
GPS if it isn't already enabled we're
going to have to send the user to enable
the GPS if it's not enabled we're going
to have to get the current latitude and
longitude and we're going to be using
latitude and longitude a lot with
multiple different things so we're going
to use it to store the location for
latitude and longitude using the GPS
data that we get we're also going to be
displaying latitude and longitude on the
screen in our little label and we're
also going to be speaking it now that's
going to tell us that we are going to
have to store latitude and longitude in
a certain special place so that we'll be
able to share it and that special place
is going to be a global variable which
is it sounds complicated and I know a
lot of you guys out there already not a
programmer thinking why is he talking
about this but this is just for the
beginners whenever there is data that we
need to share between multiple different
components or multiple parts of our
program it's going to make sense to
store them in special little boxes and a
special little box is called a global
variable then what we need to do is make
the phone vibrate whenever the zombie
button is touched we're also going to
have to make the phone speak out
location data when it's touched and
we're also going to have to be able to
detect shaking as well as detect screen
orientation changes now you don't have
to memorize all this I'm going to be
bouncing back and forth from this to
what is called App Inventor blocks so
let's take a look at exactly what App
Inventor blocks are okay so this is the
part of App Inventor you are used to and
this is what is called the designer over
here designer that's where we are now
we're going to take a look at blocks so
let's click on that and now we're in the
block section and it's completely empty
so what we have to do here is to program
and make everything work now inside of
App Inventor pretty much everything is a
component or a button label you know all
those things you saw and
they are going to trigger what are
called events and then we have to react
to those events an event for example
would be clicking on a button that's an
event something happened let's react to
it now like I said before we're going to
have to store our zombie latitude and
longitude in a special place that
special place is going to be a global
variable to access or create a global
variable we're going to come over here
to variables and don't try to memorize
all these things I'm going to be using
them over and over and over again and
eventually you just get used to it
so here you see initialize global
variable and it has a name inside of
there now what's one of the things we
need to store well we need to store our
zombie latitude and to start off we're
going to give it a dummy value now to
create a dummy value just click anywhere
not on a component anywhere else and hit
the double quotes like that and then hit
enter that's going to create this little
piece here which is going to be pretty
much a nothing value don't know if you
heard that click or not but it clicked
into place and now those things are
created and we have to create another
global variable or a box that we are
going to store the longitude in so let's
drag that little guy out there and type
in I'm going to call it zombie longitude
and there can be no spaces in here and a
common thing that we do is the very
first word in our name is going to be
lowercase and every other word
thereafter is going to be uppercase so
we'll be able to see what they look like
click anywhere double quote enter and
there we go we gave it a nothing value
because there's currently nothing in the
box all right then we have to think
about what do we need to do next well
one of those things that we're going to
need to do next is enable GPS or send
the user and force them to enable the
GPS now whenever you took a look at the
application and you might want to rewind
this and look at it again what happened
whenever you started it and the GPS was
not enabled well it flashed up a dialog
box and said hey you need to enable this
and then you clicked on it
okay and then you went and you fixed it
well that's what we're going to do this
is going to be initializing the program
we need to have the GPS enabled before
we are able to use our program so that
means initialize the initial steps we
must perform to get our program to work
those initial steps are going to be to
get the location sensor to start working
so that it can get GPS data another
thing we're going to have to do is if we
can't get that data we're going to have
to pop up a dialog box and so let's go
and do that all right so if we are going
to be initializing and whenever we're
initializing something we're referring
to the screen or the app itself and here
it is so we're going to click on screen
and we're going to want to initialize
things and where is initialized up there
it is was right there all along so if I
want to start initializing I just click
and hold and drop and there we are and
there it is these are going to be all
the things that are done before our
program gets going so what I say we need
to make the location sensor work so that
we can get things like the zombie
latitude and the zombie longitude data
all right
so to do that we need our location
sensor here it is it's going to have all
the things that we need we just click on
it and the very first thing we're going
to have to do is enable it so let's look
for enable and you can see right here
this is location sensor enabled also you
can see here that we have set location
sensor enabled well the important part
is these puzzle pieces see look at them
this guy right here is going to provide
us with data this puzzle piece here is
going to allow us to set something
that's the reason why there's an open
puzzle piece here and there's not an
open puzzle piece there so open puzzle
piece means that we're going to be
setting something just like the name
says well here it says that we are going
to be trying to find out if the location
sensor is enabled well we know that it
isn't so let's drag this out of here
come up here and you can see that these
two pieces fit right to gather now a
weird quirk whenever we're using the
location sensor to get GPS data is
sometimes it wants to be set to false
meaning that it is not enabled in that
situation what we're going
have to do is first set it to not
enabled and then set it to being enabled
or true now that means we're going to be
using two of these guys so we're going
to click on it and we're going to right
click on it and click on duplicate and
that's going to make two of those and
they snap together right like that now
whenever we want to put false or true
inside of here we don't want to type
them out like we did up here we want to
instead grab them from the logic Center
logic is things like true and false so
we are going to grab false first we're
going to shut it off and then we're
going to duplicate that put that on
there and set it to true and that is
going to make our location sensor
enabled now what we need to do is choose
the provider of our data and what we
want to choose is GPS so what we're
going to have to do is say if GPS is an
option to provide us with our latitude
and longitude data that we want to get
then we want to use it however it won't
be available to us if they have GPS non
enabled in that situation we're going to
have to open up a dialog box and ask
them to fix that problem so to do that
anytime you have a situation which
you're saying I want to do something if
something is true otherwise I want to do
something else in those situations you
want to use what is called an
if-then-else statement or an
if-then-else block those guys can be
found inside of control over here and
you can see right here if something is
true then I want to do something else I
want to do something else so just click
and drag it and drop it right underneath
of there and there we go
now what exactly do we want to be able
to do here we want to go in and say hey
location sensor the available providers
you have for getting latitude and
longitude is one of those named GPS well
what we're going to need to do here is
go and look at the location sensor and
see what it provides to us so we'll
click on this and we can look at what's
going on
available providers is one of those
things
so let's take
riders out and let's drop it there it is
however what do we want to do we want to
find out if one of the available
providers is GPS in that situation what
we're going to be doing is looking at
text which is going to be the list of
available providers and figuring out if
one of those happens to be GPS so we
want to be searching through text so we
click on text and we look for well we
take a look at what we have available to
us let's just cycle through here and
then we come down to contains text which
are going to be a list of available
providers and piece is going to be the
thing we are looking for specifically
which is GPS so let's drag that out
there and let's look at this what do we
want to do we want to search the text
which is a list of all the available
providers of data in regards to latitude
and longitude and we want to find out if
one of those available providers is GPS
so we're going to click put a double
quote and type in GPS and hit enter grab
our little puzzle piece and put it there
so all this is doing is it's saying hey
give me the list available providers is
one of them GPS if one of them is GPS
then we want to use it so we're going to
say we want to set our provider name to
be GPS since we are still using location
sensors that's going to be inside the
location sensor area and we're going to
look for provider name and there it is
however we want to set it to GPS so
instead of this one we want this one
grab it
drop it come up here then set location
sensor provider name - it's going to be
GPS we can just click on this and
duplicate it if we'd like put that right
there and then in this situation we want
to lock it to stay GPS we do not want it
to become something else and I'm
actually going to print out and put all
these guys on my website so you'll be
able to copy directly from there because
I know sometimes it's hard to copy from
a video and I'll put it a link to those
pictures in the description that's
underneath this video so we want to lock
our provider now on GPS and this is
something you're just going to learn
over to
time and how we're going to do that is
cycle through here until we have
provider locked and let's drop that and
drop that right there and then we need
to set something to true so let's just
grab this guy right here or we can just
remember a true and false is logic
something's either true or its false and
we can grab that out of there just so we
know where that came from
come over here and drop it into place
and there we go now the situation comes
in which may be one of the available
providers isn't GPS well we need that to
be something that we can use and we also
know the only reason why the GPS
wouldn't work is if they don't have that
setup on their phone so we need an else
if this was true we're going to do the
then part if this isn't true we want to
do something else so we're going to
click inside of here and you can see
right here that we can use else--if or
else well we don't need this right now
so let's just use else and we're going
to drag and drop that there and then the
else appears down there a little bit
weird but you'll get used to it now in
this situation we need to open up a
dialog box just like you saw before and
we need to say hey go get your GPS door
so whenever we want to do that we want
to use what is called a notifier to pop
up the dialog box
well we already put a note of fire in
here there's the notifier click on that
and what do we want to do we want to
show a dialog box so we look through all
these different things and look at this
one of them is show choose dialog drag
that drop it there bring it up here and
there we go now inside of this we need
to provide a message which is going to
be inside the dialog box title which is
going to be at the top of the dialog box
then we're going to have two buttons and
the first one's going to be okay and the
second one is going to be cancel and yes
it's going to be cancelable so our
message could be something like double
quotes remember please enable GPS and
enter and there we have that and put
that in there and there it's ready to go
now for a title we could do something
and yes you could also click on these
and hit duplicate drop that in there and
come in here and change this to
something like can't access GPS and
there it is another thing is remember
the first button that appears in the
dialog if you're at all confused
but just rewind go back to normal sound
like everyone and my voice there for a
second rewind take a look at the
application again we can just come in
here or I can just click here somewhere
and go okay which is going to be an
option this is going to be a button and
then the other one could be cancel and
there we go and then cancelable well
that's a logic question isn't it and
we're going to say is it possible to
cancel and in this situation we'll say
yeah it is alright so there we go
so that opens up and initializes
everything the only problem would be is
what are we going to do after the dialog
pops up and they click on ok well in
that situation we come to part to send
the user to enable the GPS so let's go
and do that so any time we use a dialog
box after the choice has been made we're
going to need to catch it react to that
event the event being clicking on the ok
button saying yeah I want you to be able
to use my GPS well to handle the event
from a notifier we're gonna go back to
the no defiers and we're gonna look at
what we got here and one of them is
after choosing after they've made their
choice in a dialog box what do we want
to do I'm gonna grab this and drag it
out of here drop it in here now what
exactly do we want to do once they have
made a choice well we want to see if the
choice was ok and if it was ok then we
want to send them out and have them make
changes to their settings so what are we
doing here sounds like an if-then
statement if they clicked on OK then
we're going to send them to make changes
to their settings so that means we're
going to be needing to do some control
things and that's going to be an if-then
if they chose ok then we're gonna go and
change our settings now in this
situation we're going to need to know
what choice they made and real nicely we
can get that information right here from
get choice so let's just drag that out
and put it there but we want to figure
out was the choice ok well in that
situation we're going to have to
come in here and do a little bit of
looking around and that means we're
going to have to go to logic we're going
to see if the choice was equal to okay
so grab that drag it down here and throw
it in then we're going to get the choice
they made and see if it is equal to okay
and you might want to actually copy this
here duplicate just to make sure you get
exactly the same thing and put it inside
of there so in the situation which they
made the choice that it was okay to
change the settings that means we are
going to go and allow them to make the
changes now this brings in what is
called a procedure or a function or a
bunch of statements that we want to
perform and we're going to keep them in
one little box so that maybe we want to
perform them somewhere else those are
called procedures I'm going to
demonstrate a procedure here or how to
create one and then after you've seen
this a couple times you'll just
understand the way it works so to create
a procedure we just go to procedures
over here there's procedures and then we
look at our results up here or what
we're going to be able to do now a
procedure again is just like I want to
do a couple things like you would do in
a programming language with a function
just look at what I do and it'll make
sense so what I have to ask myself is do
I want a result after the procedure is
performed or do I not well I don't have
any reason to want anything after they
go and change their settings so I am
going to use this guy so what exactly do
I want them to do I want to send them to
the settings part in their Android
device that is going to allow them to
turn the GPS on well I'm actually going
to actually have to show you something
here we're going to go into this guy
right here this is a place where I can
cycle through all of the potential
settings options available in a device
by no means try to really focus in on
this or memorize any of this this is
again something you're just going to
either remember by looking at the
pictures on my website or through
practice time and time again so what I
want to do is I want to send them to the
part that's going to allow them to turn
on location services so I can use our
GPS so inside of here I'm going to
do a search for location up here there
we go and I'm going to cycle through all
of the potential options well here if we
look we see show settings allow
configuration of current location
sources that's the guy that we want
again don't try to memorize this but
this is the part of settings that is
going to allow us to go in and turn on
GPS for our apps so I'm going to copy
that guy jump back over into App
Inventor and any time that I want to
open up another activity or another
application I'm going to use something
inside of here called
activity starter so let's click on that
and whenever you use activities starter
you have to tell it first what action or
what activity or what application you
want to have open which is right here
those are called actions drag that out
of here drop that right down there then
we have to say okay well we have to give
a location for what you want to open
well in this situation that is going to
be that settings thing that I just
copied and pasted double quote paste
that in there hit enter and there it is
and this is going to be the part of
settings that we are going to launch
then after you define what activity you
want to have executed you have to tell
it to start that activity so again go
into activity starter click on it then
we're going to go to the top right here
where it says call startactivity come
down here and drop that in so here we
defined what activity we want to have
open which is going to be the settings
part of our Android device and here we
just said start it so that's what's
going on there well I want to give this
guy a nice name and this nice name is
going to be open location settings right
like that
and now that I have that defined we know
that we have to call open location
settings if their choice was okay
meaning that was okay for them to go in
and change their GPS settings so then if
we want to call this guy right here
we're going to have to go into
procedures again and look for call and
looking open location settings is in
there drag this out and drop it right
there and that is how we're going to be
able to call that guy so it's just a
bunch of dragging and dropping okay so
we got over the hurdle of setting up the
GPS automatically inside of settings now
we need to
get the current latitude and longitude
so let's go do that
now to get the location data we're going
to have to go into the location sensor
click on that and whenever you want to
set up a new way of getting latitude and
longitude we're gonna have to go to
location changed and here you can see
latitude and longitude as well as
altitude is an option we're going to
grab that and drag it out here now with
this guy what we're going to do is we
are going to set these global variables
or boxes up here with the right
information and to get to the location
data for these guys we can just put our
little mouse over top of this and get
set global zombi latitude drag it over
here drop it right there and then since
we want the latitude we put our mouse
over this and we say hey get me the
latitude and drop that right there we're
also going to have to get the longitude
we can just duplicate this drop it right
there come in here change this the
longitude and then change this to
longitude as well and on there and there
it is just like that we're able to grab
that information from the GPS and set it
inside of there now remember we also
wanted to change the label to display
the latitude and longitude information
no problem now if we want to change the
label we just come over here and click
on this guy and then we want to change
the text for our label so we want to
find set the label text to oops there we
are got it drop it right there
then we're going to drag it right up
here and there we go and then let's say
that we want to print out latitude print
out whatever the latitude is then we
want to print out longitude and the
longitude information well we want to
print out more than one text area so
doing the whole click and double quote
doesn't work that means we need to
change the way that we are going to be
building or creating a list of text in
that situation we're going to go over
our little text tool and click on it and
the way to create more than one piece of
text is to use what is called a join
drag it over here drop it right there
and there we go now we actually want to
create four lines of text or four
different things so just click on this
grab string string is a fancy word for a
line of characters and now we have four
strings that are going to be shown
and you can see the puzzle pieces right
there and we can click double quote like
that and sale at a tude and put a colon
in a space there that is drop it in then
we need to actually get the latitude and
have that get printed out on the screen
so in that situation we could drag this
down here and put it right there or we
could go and get the zombie latitude and
put it right there but I'll show you
another way to do it also we could also
go directly to the location sensor like
this and then come through here and
scroll down until we see it right here
drag that out
drop it come over here and then drop our
latitude data in right there then we're
also going to have to put longitude
information out duplicate this drag that
drop it right there and put longitude
inside of there however if we want to
have both of these on separate lines
we're going to have to use a line break
which is a backslash and an N I know
that's a little bit funky all you
program where people know it let's just
remember that's a short way to do a line
break to put a line break in text so
that works and we're going to do a
duplicate drop that it's out of there
and change this to longitude which is
right there and that is going to
automatically right there that little
block of blocks is going to update our
little label inside of our application
to show latitude and longitude all right
so we have the GPS enabled and we got
the current latitude and longitude now
what we want to do is get our phone to
vibrate whenever the zombie is touched
so the zombie is actually a button so
come over here click on button and let's
look at all the options we have one of
them is click so grab that drag it out
here drop it right there and what do we
want to do well one of the things we
want to do is have it vibrate so come
over here go to sound 1 there it is
and we can choose that we want it to
vibrate bring it over here drop it right
there how long do we want it to vibrate
let's say half a second click anywhere
double quote 500 there we go drop it in
we could also come over here to the math
section right like this and this is
probably the most proper way of doing it
and actually picking the number dragging
this over dropping it right there and
you can also delete blocks by just right
click
on them and going delete block there we
go and drop that in there and change
this to 500 half a second another thing
we wanted to do is whenever the zombie
is clicked on we want to have it speak
out actually this information up here at
latitude and longitude information well
guess what we're going to need the
text-to-speech come over here
text-to-speech click on that and speak
message sounds like exactly what I want
it to do
drop that in there and there it is then
we have to give it the message we want
it to speak well we're going to have
multiple lines so that means we need a
join let's just do a duplicate here to
keep it simple drop that right there
then in this situation we're going to
get rid of this drag it out of there and
delete it we could also let's zoom out
here grab this guy right here drag it
and drop it in the trash can if we'd
like to do it that way and let's make
this a little bit friendlier let's say
something like zombies latitude is and
then down here let's say something like
zombies longitude is look zombies there
we go and we're going to have to get
this information and we have it stored
in these global variables remember so we
can just come up here and say get global
zombie latitude come over here drop it
in there that works and we could also do
a duplicate and drop this right here and
change this to zombie longitude and
there we go also said that we are going
to have a sound play whenever our
application is shaken well that is going
to be in the accelerometer that's going
to detect the a shake has taken place so
we want to look through everything here
and we see when the accelerometer
detects that the device is being shaken
we want to do some things up grab that
drag it out of there drop it right here
and there that is we want a sound to be
played
no problem come over here there's sound
to right there we want to play a sound
well call the sound tube and play it
that sounds like the right one drag it
drop it out of there drop it in there
and then we want to change the label
text well since we already did that this
is a situation which we might want to
create a new procedure or function so we
can just call this to occur but in this
situation what I'm going to do is just
click on this whole entire thing
right here and duplicate it and drag
this down and drop it right there and
there we go so now the button whenever
it's click is going to play a sound it's
going to vibrate and it's also going to
convert our text to a spoken robot voice
that says zombies latitude is and says
latitude zombies longitude is and says
they're zombies audited and then also
whenever it's shaken it's going to play
a sound and after that it's going to
change the text on our label and that
brings us to the last thing detect
screen orientation changes well I'm
actually going to do this
in a little bit of a crazy way just so
that we can demonstrate a couple other
different blocks that are available to
us
okay so screen orientation changes well
guess what that means we need to go to
the screen and anytime we're thinking
about the device itself changing this is
probably where you going to go and you
can see right here when the screen or
the device changes orientation we're
gonna drag this out of here what do we
want it to do well let's find ourselves
some space here and I'm zoomed way in if
you use happen fenner you're like wait a
minute why is this look so much
different in mine say I'm zoomed in
that's why it looks the way that it
looks okay so when the screen
orientation changes what I wanted to do
is shrink the size of the zombie so if
whenever you think about the orientation
changing if the orientation changes to
horizontal well in that situation that
is going to mean that the screen width
is greater than the height whenever it
is vertical which is the normal way of
holding a phone the width is going to be
less than the height so we're going to
need an if-then-else statement and that
means we're going to have to go into
control there's our buddy if-then-else
grab this guy drop it right there there
we go then we're going to say if the
screen width is greater than the screen
height well we need to do a greater than
and that's going to mean we're going to
need our math guy right here and it's
actually inside of here where we have
equals grab that drag it up try to find
where I have it there it is okay draw
like that drop it right there then if we
want to find out what our screen width
and height is well guess what that's in
the screen area come over here again
click on this and look for screen width
and height it's not there so we're going
to have to scroll down and there we go
screen width right there bring that out
and try to find it and there we go I'm
going to say if our screen width is
greater than our screen height duplicate
this and then change this to height of
course then what we want to do is change
the size of our zombie or zombie is
actually a button there it is right
there click on this and if we look at
all the options that are available to us
you can see here that one is set height
and also with so I'll drag that over
here drop that right there and in this
situation I want to shrink it by a
certain percentage which means I'm going
to divide the height by a certain number
that means I need to be able to perform
a division guess what those are in the
math blocks click on math and look for
division there's division
grab that bring it over here drop it
right there and there we go
so I want to take my button height which
is this guy right here that means I'm
going to need to go over into the button
again click on that and find button
height remember we want our puzzle
pieces to fit together and this one
requires this guy so drop that in there
now I want to divide it by let's say 1.4
again math want to create a number here
grab that ruing it over here drop it in
divided by 1.4 and that is going to
shrink it whenever the orientation
changes to horizonte want to do the same
thing with our width so let's just grab
this duplicate it all right that drop
that into place and yes you can have
these blocks stack on top of each other
but it's not really a great thing change
that the width change this to wit and
there we go
and then in a situation in which we are
not horizontal we're in vertical well
that's going to mean that
I want to change back to the way things
used to be and I can also scroll here so
in that situation I want to set my
button height let's just duplicate this
there we go I can pull this part off of
here
and then well first time I have to go in
here and add an else else there we go
there we go drag this up here drop it in
there going to do a duplicate again
duplicate this time I'm going to be
affecting the width and there is the
width then I'm also going to be using a
number I'm going to convert it back to
what it used to be
height is 342 and then I'm going to
change the width the back to where it
used to be right there and that's 285
and again I'm doing this orientation
change here just to be able to
demonstrate some different math
functions and yes there are easier ways
to do orientation changes and that is
everything that is how to create the
entire application and now that we have
everything set up properly all we need
to do to get it on or our device instead
of using the normal Kinect and AI
companion which is the normal way we can
just click on connect AI opinion let's
get out of that click on connect a AI
companion right there or we can use an
emulator but since we're using GPS AI
companions going to work in this
situation we're going to click on that
it's going to put this up here on our
screen we're going to be able to
photograph this with our Android device
and test it if however we want to
actually send it to our Android device
so that we can test it on our own that
situation you come to build and this guy
doesn't always work so what I'm going to
do instead is I'm going to say I want to
save the apk which is the fancy name for
our Android application to my computer
whenever I click on that little things
going to pop up and it's going to build
my application for me as you can see
right there and there it is all set up
and here it is and I could go show in
finder here is my zombie application now
what I want to do is I want to email it
you have to have a gmail account that's
the easiest way to take this guy and
automatically have it load and execute
on your Android device you're going to
need to get this guy and you're going to
need to email it to yourself
one of the ways I'm going to do that is
go to services and
you email with attachment but you can do
it whatever way you feel comfortable
emailing an attachment and then I'm
going to send it to my gmail account but
the very first thing we're going to need
to do is make it so that our device is
able to execute and install unknown
applications which is in essence what
this is so let's take a look at how to
do that okay so to be able to run an
outside application on your device what
you're going to have to do is inside of
settings now this is going to be
different on everybody's phone but on
mine it's going to be in settings and
then I'm going to have to come in here
and look for in my situation its
security but what we need to look for
specifically is unknown sources right
here where it says allow installation of
apps from unknown sources this must be
checked and if you have that checked
then you'll be able to receive the
applications and install them okay so
now that you have that all set up and
you have the capability to install
customized applications what we have to
do now is go and check our email and
install that application so let's take a
look at how we're going to do that now
that we have sent our application using
just regular old email remember we have
to use Gmail if we want to be able to
open this up we can now go into Gmail
and we're going to see the application
right there and from this we're going to
be able to click on it and install it
it's going to say do you want to install
an update to an existing application or
do you want to install this application
in general and then the user can just
come down here and hit install but make
sure you must send it to a gmail account
it can't use other pop versions of email
and if you do that your application will
be installed and ready to work with all
right now everything's installed and
everything's working and we reviewed a
heck of a lot of things using App
Inventor please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
