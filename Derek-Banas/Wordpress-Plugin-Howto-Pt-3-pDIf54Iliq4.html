of my wordpress plugin tutorial today
I'm going to show you everything I
haven't shown you in the previous two
tutorials if you haven't checked those
out there are links on the screen to
them as well as a link to my short code
tutorial which I just did because today
I'm going to show you how to add a
wordpress shortcode to your plugin file
so that you don't have to force people
to add code to their functions PHP files
hopefully that makes sense if it doesn't
it will so what I'm gonna do is I have a
part in here in the code which says
create a shortcode capability for the
plug-in
well doesn't exist yet but it will
appear in just a couple minutes so if
you want to give people the ability to
create short codes and I'm gonna show
you exactly what that is okay so
previously we had this all this
information here stuck only in the right
of the WordPress theme
well now what we're gonna do is we're
gonna allow you to click these links to
the RSS feed your Facebook account and
your Twitter account just by entering
this shortcode that you see right here
so you're gonna have NTT SOC any T new
think tank social network and then
you're gonna define your Facebook ID and
your Twitter ID inside of brackets and
then if you do that this is going to
show up on the screen so I'm gonna show
you all the code that goes into that and
I've also been getting a gazillion
requests from you guys for me to do a
Facebook tutorial if you really want me
to do it go on my website it's new think
tank calm and go right here and click
like if I get 25 likes that's all if you
see 25 likes and you don't want to like
it don't like it I don't care but if I
get 25 likes I will do a Facebook
tutorial and I will cover everything
just like I always do alright so we have
to come in here and create the
capabilities to do short codes inside of
this plug-in that we've been creating
over the last two courts of this
tutorial so I'm gonna call it NTT social
network then animals with SC which is
going to be short for short codes I'm
gonna say args because it's the guy's
gonna accept multiple different
arguments and put content is equal to
null and you're always going to do that
every single time and then this is just
a basic function just like anything else
and you could use this and all the code
is available on a link in the underbar
so if you want to get it it might help
you understand this stuff better
but either way what we're gonna do here
is this is going to be heavily based off
of what we did when we created this
widget capability for this
and if we scroll up you're gonna
actually see in the function widget
which is here on the screen we're gonna
be doing a lot of the same things we're
gonna be extracting arguments in a
different way but most of the other
information and a lot of the things that
we did in the widgets function up here
we're gonna redo down below to get this
shortcode to work so I'm using that as a
basis to get this guy to work first
thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna extract
out all the arguments that are
potentially sent to the shortcode like
the Facebook ID and the twitter ID and
all those other things and I'm gonna go
to shortcode ATS
I'm gonna say array because all those
attributes are passed as an array and
then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say
NTT Twitter because that's the name in
the shortcode as you can see right here
just so you totally get it and TT
Twitter say this is the arguments that
are being passed over so I just need to
ask for them I'm gonna go in here and
I'm gonna say I want these attributes
that were passed to be stored in local
variables with the same name or I'm
going to say I want to use a new think
tank as a default all right then I'm
gonna do the same exact thing for
Facebook actually I'm just gonna copy
this and there's no reason to define the
RSS feed because I do that automatically
for you inside of this plug-in in here
I'm just gonna go do Manus and then you
close that off and put a TTS right like
that
now everything all the attributes are
now in local variables inside of this
function for you to be able to use and
do whatever you want with them next what
I'm going to do is I'm gonna link to all
of the images that I want to show up
meaning I'm gonna link to the logos that
should pop up right here and they're
gonna be inside of the plugins folder in
a folder called images so you know NTT
feed underscore icon is equal to plugins
and this is how you access your plugins
folder inside of WordPress and I'm gonna
say I want images because there's an
images folder and I want this specific
logo that's called RSS logo pane and
then if in files so that it looks for
the images folder for this specific
plug-in and this is just a reference to
this file right here that's on the
screen that's what that means and then
I'm going to copy this and then I'm just
gonna change this to Facebook for the
Facebook logo change this to Facebook
and change this to Twitter and change
this to Twitter so now I got images to
associate with all of these
links that I'm gonna be creating then
we're gonna scroll up a little bit here
now what I got to do because we are not
allowed to echo out the screen we have
to actually send we have to combine all
of our information together save it in a
variable and save it back or send it
back to be shot onto the screen so what
we need to do is instead of using echo
we're gonna be using another string
variable that is going to contain all of
the code that we need for this shortcode
to be displayed on the screen I'm gonna
call it NTT social net content doesn't
matter what whatever you want and then
I'm gonna define all of the HTML that is
needed this is just gonna be a long
string and I'm gonna use the dot
operator to continue adding to this guy
as I build it from there on and then I'm
gonna call get log info and this is why
I don't need to pass it or do anything
in regards to RSS feeds because this is
automatically gonna grab the RSS feed
for whatever this site is so that's cool
copy that I'm going to continue adding
to this inside of single braces and then
I'm gonna continue adding in all of the
HTML that I need image source is equal
to I like that and then inside a single
quotes continue building all the HTML
code here I'm gonna link to actually I
don't need these single quotes here I'm
gonna link to the image that I defined
above and then I do need single quotes
this time I'm going to close that off
and type in height is equal to 50 pixels
because that's how big it is and width
is equal to 50 pixels which it is and
then I gotta close off that tag and then
close off the link tag and then I can
actually copy this so I'm gonna do that
copy it we're gonna do the same thing
for our Facebook link and or Twitter
link something that changed things
inside of here what I'm gonna put here
is what I was able to get up side here
so if I'm gonna put in Facebook inside
of here I'm gonna make a reference to
this guy right here which is going to be
whatever attribute they set or the
default so you know a MTT Facebook and
just put that inside of their image
source can stay exactly the same this
just needs to be changed to Facebook and
everything else can be exactly the same
so isn't that nice and then I got to do
the same thing here I go in and T to
Twitter and then I'm gonna type in
Twitter here okay there we are all that
information is ready for me to be able
to return it back and be thrown directly
on the screen with just that little
shortcode so I got to go return we're
going to
take this guy right here whoops make
sure you put the dot operator in there
and also in there caught that and you're
gonna return all of this information you
build here and it's gonna automatically
go onto the string so the only other
things you have to do is to add the
short code so everything shows off and
how you do that is you go add short code
right like that and we're going to call
this short code MTT SOC any T so that's
its name then we have to define what
function is going to be called whenever
that short code is entered and this is
the function this is the function name
you just created close that off and put
a semicolon at the end of it and then
put quotes around it so there's all that
and the only other thing I haven't shown
you how to do is how to give your
plug-in the ability of being uninstalled
properly and there's really not even any
point in doing that because this is
literally all that you do if somebody
clicks on uninstall what you need to do
with this very specific plug-in is just
show all of the options you want to lead
it and these are just going to be all of
the potential variables that are stored
inside of WordPress and if you do that
everything will be deleted except of
course you're not going to have to put
ntt defaults in there twice or three
times and then all you do with this guy
is save it in the same location as your
plug-in and call it uninstall dot PHP
and that's it now you know how to do
every conceivable thing with plugins
inside of WordPress I have a whole bunch
of more further plug-in tutorials but
this guy right here that I presented in
the last couple parts or last three
parts is an ideal tool for you to use as
a template to create all of your plugins
as is the theme tutorial in which I gave
you that option as well so if you have
any questions or comments leave them in
the comment section below and remember
if you want me to do a Facebook tutorial
go to my website look at this click on
like like I said if I get 25 votes I'm
doing an entire Facebook tutorial so
hope you guys like that otherwise still
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
