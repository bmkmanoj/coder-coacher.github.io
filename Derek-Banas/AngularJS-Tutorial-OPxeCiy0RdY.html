angularjs tutorial this is the most
popular request from you guys and in
this tutorial after talking to a whole
bunch of different people I figured out
that the main problem people have with
angularjs is all of the new jargon so in
this tutorial I'm going to explain
exactly what MVC means or Model View
controller I'm also going to cover
modules directive scope expressions and
services and I'm going to do all this by
using a ton of examples so I have a lot
to do so let's get in whit
now angularjs is going to provide a
front-end framework based on the MVC
model or Model View controller and it is
built on top of JavaScript as well as
jQuery and with MVC the model is going
to represent the data source the view is
going to be the rendered webpage and the
controller is going to handle
communication between both of them and
by structuring your page this way your
code is going to be easier to maintain
it's also going to be easier to update
and it's also going to make your code
much more readable and that brings us to
angularjs is jargon which i'm going to
explain in this tutorial but briefly i'm
just want to cover everything that you
see right here angularjs uses modules
which are going to represent the
components used in your application and
by using modules it's going to make it
much more easy to reuse your code and
other applications or other parts of
your site now web pages are normally
going to be manipulated by working with
the Dom object in either JavaScript and
jQuery and angularjs is going to allow
you to extend HTML tags and attributes
using something called directives which
are going to make it very easy to bind
data directly to your HTML elements now
angularjs is going to use javascript
objects to represent said data called
the scope which can be data generated on
the web server or a database or a web
service or client-side using regular
angularjs code which I'm going to
provide a bunch of examples of that in
this tutorial you're also going to be
able to use expressions that are
directly linked to the scope or data
anytime you see scope just think data
and the benefit to this is that the page
is going to be updated dynamically as
the data changes data binding which is
sort of another jargon
works as well so that whenever your data
changes on your webpage the model is
going to be updated as well as whenever
data changes on the model your webpage
is going to be updated and then finally
that brings us to services there are
many services provided for common tasks
like Ajax techniques to dynamically pull
data from web services and other such
things which I'm going to demonstrate in
this tutorial so enough talking let's
jump over and start writing some code
okay so on the left side of the screen I
have the atom text editor which I'm
going to use in this tutorial instead of
sublime text which I normally use and on
the right side I have Google Chrome and
you can see the beginning of a web page
here and of course all the codes
available in the description for free
and I named the HTML file angular Tut
HTML and then I'm gonna have a J's file
called exam 1j s and everything's
structured so that you can see it right
here basically the HTML is going to be
in a folder called angular Tut and then
I'm going to have a J s holder inside of
there that's going to have all my
JavaScript files so make sure you have
everything structured exactly the same
way and we're going to create our
webpages just like we normally would
with our HTML tags and so forth and body
and all this other stuff and if you want
to be able to import angularjs this is a
CDN and this is the ball you basically
have to do is put this at the end of
your file near the end of the body tag
and then provide a link to your script
your JavaScript code that you're going
to be using inside of this HTML page and
basically what we're going to be doing
here is implementing a template model
controller as well as scope and I'm
going to jump over into the exam one or
example one J's file right now I'm going
to type in var app 1 is equal to angular
module and then what we're going to do
is pass in app 1 inside of this and then
followed by brackets and then what I'm
doing here is I'm going to define the
angularjs model that I'm defining and
modules are basically used to associate
an angularjs app with the part of an
HTML document they're also going to
provide access to numerous angularjs
features and also help with organization
and the angular module function here is
going to accept the
module name as well as a list of modules
inside of this bracket we don't have any
inside here right now but it's normally
going to list a bunch of modules that
we're going to need for this to be able
to function properly as well as an
optional configuration for our module
which would come after this after
another comma but we're not going to use
that either right now now you may be
wondering where exactly is this app 1
coming from I'm going to jump over here
and right after the HTML I'm going to
type in ng - app is equal to app 1 and
this is going to define the ng app
parameter and it's normally going to be
either put in the HTML tag right here or
in the body and this is going to be set
so that angularjs knows where to begin
compiling your code and app 1 like I
said previously is going to be the
module name and as we saw previously
it's going to be referenced in our
JavaScript file another guide we can put
inside of here that we're going to use
is ng and knit and it is what we call a
directive and what it's going to do is
initialize application data by assigning
different values to variables so we
could do something like I'm in here and
say person is equal to first-name and we
could put Derrick inside of there and
last name and put my blast name inside
of there and then we could put a
semicolon and then we could put in
another group of data say we have
something like capitals is equal to and
we can say city Montgomery and state
we'll be using this data here in a
second and then throw some additional
state capital information inside of
there and while we're inside here we
might as well define our controller so
we're going to say do and to define the
controller we just go ng controller is
equal to and let's just call this
controller 1 and close off our div tag
and basically what we're saying here is
this right here this div element is
going to be a view as well as all the
other elements that lie inside of it and
we're going to use our scope component
to provide data to our view so let's
jump back over into JavaScript again and
define our controller and
do that we just go app one and
controller we're going to reference the
controllers name that we defined over in
the HTML just like this and then we'll
throw a function inside of here like I
said previously the scope is going to
link our HTML elements to variables in
our scope and the controller function in
this situation is going to receive the
controller name as well as a factory
function that's what this is referred to
as a factory function let's close that
off right there and factory function is
going to get the controller ready to use
and we're saying scope right here is a
dependency by putting it inside of the
attributes area and that is telling
angular to automatically pass in the
scope object whenever the function is
going to be called angular smart enough
to know what we want and it's going to
throw it in there automatically for us
and this is an example of what we call
dependency injection angular basically
sees that my factory function contains a
scope component and it goes and gets it
and throws it into the function to be
able to use for whatever we need
automatically we can start assigning
values inside of here just by going
scope and first for example is equal to
1 which is going to define an initial
value for us and then let's come in here
and create another one and let's call
this second give it an initial value of
1 and then let's also come in and define
a function that's going to be called
whenever a button is clicked basically
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to have it some data and automatically
update everything on the screen so you
can create a function inside of here
inside of the scope object and let's
call this update value and how you would
do that let's go function and it's not
going to receive any attribute so we can
leave that blank close that off though
and then we're going to say scope
calculation is equal to the value
assigned to the first element which
we're going to define here in a second
and we're basically creating a string
here that we're going to then output
onto the screen and second go down to
the next line is equal to and then we
can go and add the two values together
and I'm going to use a shortcut here
which is the unary plus operator which
is going to convert a string into an
integer in this situation so I can get
my scope
like this and then add it to the other
value that I have defined in the HTML
and we'll put that to the screen so
we'll save that and we'll jump back over
in our HTML and we'll start defining
some things so let's say we want to
throw a span inside of here and we could
just say values and now we're going to
define two elements that are going to be
bound to the first and second values in
the scope that we define previously and
we're going to bind them using the ng
model so we'll say input type is equal
to text and then we'll bind them to
those scope values by saying ng model
first put these inside of quotes though
you can see that they automatically
update and then we're going to do
exactly the same thing for another value
here so we'll say this is second of
course because that's how we defined it
previously and we also said that we want
to bind a click event to call our update
value this function right here and in
this situation we're going to use a
button so we can say ng click is equal
to update value and that's a function
and we'll just put some as the value for
our button through a couple break
statements in here and then if we want
to get this value right here the
calculation what we're going to do is
we're going to be able to display that
scope value inside of this using what's
called an expression
just a couple curly brackets and then
calculation and that will automatically
display right there and if we reload it
you can see right here values 1 and 1
those default values 1 and 1 come from
this definition right here and we can
come in here and change those values and
hit some and you can see the
calculations automatically generate it
so you can see just how easy it is to
come in here and change all those
different values and work with them and
you saw an example basically of a whole
bunch of different things directives and
models and how we're going to be able to
update all those different values now
we're in regards to expressions you're
also going to be able to perform
calculations with expressions so we
could come in and just go do something
really simple 5 plus 5 is equal to
expression and then just put five plus
five inside of there and
load and you can see five plus five is
equal to ten automatically goes inside
of there and your expressions are going
to be able to also bind data directly to
the HTML so we're not going to have to
use ng model with an expression so you
could say your first value is and then
just come in here and then just type in
first and it's automatically going to
update we even windows values change so
your first value is one let's come up
here and change it to two up see I
changed five see they're both changing
automatically there you go
pretty cool and you're also going to be
able to bind these using and another
directive called data ng bind so we
could say your second value is and then
we could throw a span inside of here and
then inside of it go data ng bind is
equal to second so we can refer to it a
couple different ways and then close
that span off and close off the
paragraph or first value is one your
second value is one we can also come in
change that to six and so forth and so
on
so there's a bunch of different ways to
bind data directly into your elements
you're also going to be able to build
strings using expressions so you can
come in and say person F name plus
person last name you entered and then we
could say first and second and the
person that I'm referring to here is
this information that we put in here
inside of ng in it reload that Derrick
banished you entered one and one see how
that shows up there's a lot of freedom
in regards to how you can work with data
another things kind of neat is we could
use ng repeat to cycle through a list of
information so let's take our capital
information here and cycle through it to
do so we could just go ul for an
unordered list and Li and then call ng
repeat is equal to and we could say
capital in capitals see this is called
capitals and then just output the
information we want inside of an
expression so we could say city and then
capital city plus and state plus
capitulum state and then of course
closed off our list item and close off
our unordered list and reload it and you
can see that it automatically went out
and printed all that information
directly inside of there so that's a
quick overview a whole bunch of
different things you can do with
angularjs now I'm going to jump over and
show how we can use multiple views as
well as multiple controllers okay so I
created a new HTML file to angular Tut
to HTML and exam 2 j/s and you can see
right here we have app 2 and if we jump
over here I already defined app 2 and
there and I don't have ng in it in there
right now now if you'd like to create
multiple different views using the same
controller this is how we would do it so
let's go and throw an h4 tag in here and
we'll just go entry controller and I'm
going to have this generate some random
numbers inside of here so I'm going to
call this control 1 close that off and
we could do first random number and we
can throw an expression inside of here
which is going to be random num 1 and
then throw an h4 tag inside of there
close that off now let's do the same
thing let's generate two of these
because I said I'm going to generate two
views for one controller so the
controller is going to be exactly the
same except in this situation we call
this second I'm going to have random
number two inside of here now let's jump
over into our J's file and inside of
this controller I'm going to define both
of those once again we're going to say
scope and random number one is equal to
let's generate a random number using
javascript so it's a math.floor and then
we'll say math.random times 10 plus 1 so
1 through 10 is what we're going to be
generating here and then we'll do the
same thing from Nate random number two
and we'll see how they generate
different numbers randomly and that's
all we need to do we can reload this you
can see first random number is 10 second
random number seven eight and ten six
and three and so forth and so on and in
this situation we have one controller
and two views now let's take a look at
how we can use multiple different
controllers so let's say we let's jump
over into the JavaScript first and we'll
define a new controller I'm going to do
it much the same way and this is going
to be a
mood generator and I'm just going to
leave this be app to controller once
again SEP this is going to be our bad
mood generator and I'm just going to
create an array of bad feelings
there we go disregard it unimportant
rejected and powerless and now let's go
and randomly generate different bad
moods and we're going to generate good
moods here so we're going to go bad
feelings and math.floor math.random
times 4 so this controller here is going
to generate some bad feelings and we're
also going to create another one that's
going to generate some good feelings and
there we go so we have the good and the
bad and two separate controllers now
let's jump over into the HTML and you
can pause this for a second if you want
to type it out then I'm going to jump
over into the HTML and make these work
and to do so just going to create some
h4 tags again ng controller is equal to
and I'll reference my bad controller and
then I could say I'm feeling and I could
go bad h4 and then we're going to do the
same thing with our good controller
that's good and then I'll just change
this to good and save it reload it and
you can see that automatically generated
I'm feeling powerless I'm feeling inner
peace I'm feeling disregarded I'm
feeling pleasure and so forth and so on
so there are examples of how we can
create multiple views that use the same
controller as well as a page that
contains multiple controllers another
thing to pay attention to here is when I
reload this you can see for a brief
second I think you can see it anyway you
can see the curly brackets in there well
in the next part I'm going to show you
how to get rid of that as well as a
whole bunch of different directives okay
so if we want to get rid of those curly
brackets showing up there momentarily
what we're going to do is type in ng
cloak and if you had your reference to
angularjs near the top like in the head
section you wouldn't have to do this but
if you have it at the bottom you're
going to have to come in here to the
Style section and you're going to have
to type in exactly what you have here
which is basically saying that we don't
want things to be displayed on the
screen until everything has been proper
compiled and ready to be displayed okay
so that's how ng cloak works you just
slap it in there and everything works
beautifully now I'm going to jump over
into my JS file and I'm going to throw
some data inside of this controller here
for us to be able to use I'm going to
say scope and groceries is equal to now
let's create an array of different
objects we have here so I'm going to say
item Tomatoes it's going to be sort of
like a grocery list
so purchased was it purchased yet or not
I'm going to put false inside of there
do this for a bunch of different food
items and then I'm going to show you
different ways to manipulate them over
in the HTML part hummus
okay so there's some different things we
want to get if we go to the grocery
store and let's keep it like that for
now and jump over in the HTML work with
that and you can see here I'm
referencing that controller that I have
over there G list control grocery list
control and like I showed you previously
you're going to be able to bind data
using either expressions or ng bind for
the most part I like to use expressions
though because they're just easier but
you can go either way let's say we want
to give this class name of list title
and we wanted to get the number of items
in our grocery list we could just say
groceries and length and this will make
for a nice title groceries to get and
then close that off M eyes will
demonstrate how to use ng bind here as
well h3 class equal to list title to
exactly the same thing and then we could
throw a span inside of here ng bind is
equal to groceries link quotes around it
then close off that span and then type
in groceries to get and close off the h3
tag and you see if we do that get
exactly the same results just in two
different ways
let's get rid of this though so it
doesn't cause confusion you're also
going to be able to list those array
items that we have inside of there let's
go and do something here we'll say oh
well because I want to show you a couple
different neat things here and I know
you're not supposed to put styling
inside here I'm just doing this just as
a quick and dirty way to get around
things
fifteen pixels so we're going to create
an ordered list and a list item and I'm
going to use an expression here to go
and get one of my grocery items so I'm
going to say groceries I'm going to get
the first item since it's zero-based
array and I want specifically just the
item name in this situation and let's
tie them close that off and close off
that ordered list and return and you can
see Tomatoes shows up there and of
course tomatoes is the first item that I
defined inside of there so that's how we
get individual rate items and now what
I'm going to do is use ng-repeat
like I used previously to list the rest
of the items so I'm going to use an
ordered list again and if I want to skip
the very first item I can say start is
equal to two so I'll skip the first item
so that will have tomatoes and all the
other ones directly underneath there and
now for each of the list items I can use
ng-repeat
to cycle through all of them and list
them out and I can say grocery in
groceries I could also skip showing
Tomatoes here in this situations and so
I don't want to list it twice by going
ng - if and then I could use index to
make sure that my index is greater than
zero right like that that's going to
skip the very first index or the zero
index and then list the rest of them so
there's another guy you can use ng-if as
well as index and then G repeat actually
has a whole bunch of different guys like
index as you're cycling through all of
these different items you're also going
to be able to use first and this value
is going to come back true if the item
that we're currently working with is the
first item you're also going to have
last and that's going to come back true
if the item you're currently working
with is the last item I'm going to
demonstrate this middle if it is neither
the first or the last it's going to come
back as true and you're also going to be
able to use even as well as odd and in
those situations and or in this
situation if the is if the item is a
even index it's going to come back
through if it's an odd index is going to
come back false
so let's cycle through these and take a
look at what we got so we can say
grocery and item is what we want to list
out here and I'll
so list out index you could also do the
odds and all those other different guys
that I just showed you a second ago and
Li and reload and you can see that
potatoes bread helmets comes back and
you also see that I have the index right
there and there's a whole bunch of
different really cool things we can do
with all those different guys as we'll
see as this tutorial continues you're
also going to be able to use either
ng-repeat start or ng-repeat end to
allow yourself to be able to use
ng-repeat on two elements rather than
just using one element and how you would
structure those in this situation I'm
going to create a table so we'll go
table and we'll go TR and I can say
ng-repeat
start is equal to grocery in groceries
and then we'll go to TD use an
expression here grocery item close that
off and then I'll go TR ng-repeat and
and then in this situation I'm going to
list out whether the item has been
purchased or not and then close off that
tag as well if we reload it you're going
to see they all list out their Tomatoes
false potatoes false da-da-da-da-da so
pretty cool different ways we can cycle
through different information using
angularjs and I think that data binding
is kind of cool so I'm going to use
another example here where I'm going to
show you how you can use what's called
two-way binding to allow your users to
come in and change the data model so
let's say we have a label here
I'll have it just be change first item
and then we'll provide an input and use
ng model again to bind that over there
with the first grocery item so that
would be groceries 0 like this and then
reference items specifically and make
sure this is inside of quotes and it
will close off that input box see we're
not doing anything with the JavaScript
it's going to automatically work so
reload this and see right there comes
back it's Tomatoes let's change this to
ketchup and you can see as I type it in
it's automatically changing and you can
do anything you want with it
so pretty cool stuff other things really
neat is we can use something called
ng-include and that's going to allow us
to input HTML fragments directly into
our pages and I just want to point out
that before
we do this if you get an error that is
called cross-origin requests are only
supported for protocol schemes the
reason why is you need to have all of
this inside of a server to be able to
have this work and you can refer to my
zamp tutorial XA MPP if you want an easy
way to install a patchy server on your
computer but that's what that error
means if you see it so what I want to do
here is create a grocery list HTML file
as well as another grocery list and one
of them is going to be an ordered list
and one's going to be an unordered list
so let's get our unordered list handled
here first off so you're going to be
able to use all of your angularjs
techniques outside of here and pull them
directly inside and have them
automatically work which is pretty cool
so we're going to do ng-repeat again
grocery in groceries and then we can use
our expression grocery item close that
off close our unordered list and we'll
select all that copy it I do pretty much
the same thing in the grocery list part
except this is going to be an ordered
list so I'll change that ordered list
change that to ordered list and let
everything else be exactly the same we
can close those well let's reopen it
just so you can see what I actually had
the names for these okay so I don't
think I showed it this is called grocery
list
HTML and this is called UL grocery list
HTML again all the files are available
in the description and those are saved
in the same directory as all of our
other HTML files as you can see right
there now I'm going to jump over into
the JavaScript file and this is
basically going to return different HTML
partials based on whether a check box is
going to be either checked or not
checked so I'm going to say scope get
list is equal to function and then close
out off at the end and this is going to
return scope show list and if show list
comes back as true it's going to return
the unordered grocery list HTML file to
display inside of there otherwise it's
going to return the regular grocery list
dot HTML file and show that or display
it inside of there jump back over here
and use it so let's define an h3 tag
inside of here and we'll say grocery
list
close that off and then we'll go and
create a div and call ng-include that's
going to allow us to use a partial
inside of here and by default I'm going
to use grocery list dot HTML make sure
you put the double quotes with the
single quotes inside of there for this
to work and then close off that div and
now I'll show you how to get this to
work with the check box so we'll say
type and this is going to be a check box
and then I'm going to use ng model equal
to show list remember this is the thing
that we were checking if it's true it's
going see there's show list if it's true
it's going to return unordered list if
it's false it's going to return grocery
list so two different partials depending
upon whatever this checkbox is checked
or not close that off and then we could
say show unordered list and let's throw
a label around this as well and then
close off our label right here and now
what we can do is call ng include as an
element itself and have the source be
equal to a call to the get list function
and if we go and reload it you can see a
grocery list and it automatically went
and printed all those out and that's
what happens whenever you just do a
regular old ng-include and give it a
very specific file name it's going to
put that HTML partial inside of there
and here you can see that we can change
the partial just by checking on this
little checkbox see how they switch back
and forth so that's how we can use an
event of sorts to automatically change
the HTML partial it shows up inside of
there so another cool trick the thing we
can do that's cool is we're going to be
able to use something called ng switch
which is going to allow us to
conditionally insert or remove an
element inside of our document so let's
just go and create a label again and
we'll go type a number and we'll say one
two four is what we're specifically
looking for here and then we'll use an
input box text box in this situation ng
model and we want to bind it to some
number and we'll close off that label
and now we'll use ng switch to go in and
say div ng switch is equal to and here
is where some number is going to be
close
that div and then we'll load completely
different elements depending upon what
that was and we'll say ng sich win is
what we'll be using here so if they put
a one inside of there we're going to put
you entered one close that off and let's
do a whole bunch of these you can put
anything inside here not just text you
can put whole entire elements or you
could use ng include put a whole bunch
of things inside of there just changes
to two three four and then let's also
create a default and the default is just
going to be ng-switch default this and
in this situation we'll just say
something like not following directions
and reload that type a number from one
four type in one so you entered one
comes in there type in four four comes
in there type in seven not following
directions goes in there you can see
it's all automatic which is very cool so
is a whole bunch of neat ways that we
can work with data binding and a whole
bunch of other different directives now
I'm going to go over and talk about
events as well as how we can enable or
disable elements as well as hide or show
elements okay so I'm going to be doing a
little bit more styling here inside here
so I'm going to paste this inside here
again this is called app four and this
is exam four j/s and angular Tut four
dot HTML and you'll see how I'm going to
be using all those additional little
stylings that you see right there here
in a moment again got a controller we
have module reference and so forth so
let's go in here and play around with
all this stuff let's close off this div
first off so that doesn't cause any
confusion we're inside of our controller
and it's called event controller in this
situation I'm going to focus in here on
all the different events we can use so
I'm going to create an input box here
just to keep this very simple and to
start off I'm going to say that I want
to target the ng blur event which would
occur any time the user would go inside
of an input boxing and leave whenever
that occurs I'm going to say here that I
want to take the value for ng blur and
increment it by 1 and then we'll close
that off and then underneath of it I'm
going to throw an h4 tag inside of here
and I'm going to say that I want to
display on the screen an incrementing
blur event so I'm going to say blur blur
inside of there and then close off that
h4 tag save that and then jump over into
the jas file over here and inside of the
scope object I'm going to give blur a
default value of zero and save that jump
back over here save all that stuff and
reload will change us to angular Tut for
dot HTML you can see there's the input
box
I clicked inside of it I left that
increment it clicked again it
incremented click again it incremented
and you can add a ton I'm actually going
to add every event to just this input
box just to demonstrate all of them so
there you go
I added in click double click copy paste
cut focus model change key down mouse
enter and mouse leave and you can see
all those other different events and
they're structured exactly the same way
the blur was except key downs going to
be different so I'm going to have to
change my JS file for that let's jump
over into my JS file now you can see
there I went and changed all those
different things gave them all default
value of zero one guy that's a little
bit different however is the key down
whenever they click on the keyboard
let's check over here did I define that
yes key down event like this basically
what happens is whenever they press
something or a number or whatever or a
key on the keyboard it's going to pass
over an event to my JavaScript file and
I need to handle it properly over here
to display what key was specifically
clicked on and to do that I'm just going
to go in and say scope key down which is
what I wanted to splay on the screen but
to make that work I'm going to go
function e the event that we had over
here see this event is going to be
passed over as the variable e in this
situation and this is a little bit funky
but this is basically going to convert
the key code that's passed over into
basic characters and numbers so we can
display I'm just looking for an example
to show you here and to convert from a
key code to an actual character we could
use from character code e.keycode this
isn't perfect like I said but whatever
it's going to work for what we're doing
here and the other guy
what we have here is mouse enter and
mouse leave don't need to do anything
special for those guys so we can just
come down here and create another scope
mouse enter is equal to and just give it
a default value of zero do the same
thing for Mouse leave default value of
zero and if we save that and we say this
everything should work so let's reload
it and you can see right here click
event watch that I'm going to click on
it up see it work double click what just
got on here double click up see it
showed up and I'd also work I'm also
going to be able to come in here and we
could watch like the change events see
there's nothing down there right now so
we could type in you know just something
and change events see it changed seven
times we typed in seven different things
we could do a copy what just got copy we
could do a paste watch this guy paste
and there's also cut and there's also
focus which we you know is done whenever
we actually focus on something forgot to
put in my little key events so this is
over in the HTML file once again so
let's go h4 and little say key pressed
and throw in KD key close that h4 tag
and then we'll do similar thing for
mouse enter event there's also going to
be Mouse down mouse move mouse over and
mouse up if you want to play with all
those different guys from say Mouse
enter events and then we'll do Mouse
leave events and we defined those over
in the J's file yep Mouse enter Mouse
leave those all look good I'll Center
mounts leave and reload it and you're
going to see key pressed I can come up
here and click inside of there and hit G
for example and it didn't show let's go
and see why and the reason why that
didn't work is I had KD key with a
lowercase K let's change that to KD key
like that and reload it and if I come in
here to this guy and hit G and key
pressed you can see G shows up and if I
come in and hit one you can see the key
pressed one shows up and you can also
see that the mouse enter and mouse leave
guys are also working
that's a rundown of all the different
events we can use now I'm going to show
you how you can enable as well as
disable different elements I'm going to
clean up all the code here a little bit
so we don't need to display all that at
once
and I'm going to create a new scope
variable and it's going to be called a
disable button and I'm going to give it
a default value of true just start off
I'm going to jump back over inside of
here in the HTML section and I'm going
to create a paragraph and then inside of
this I'm going to create a button and
say ng disabled and it's going to be
either be disabled or an enabled based
off of the value of disabled button
which I defined over in the JavaScript
file so come in here to find disabled
button and let's just give it a name of
button just be a little boring and
there's my button now how I'm going to
enable it or disable it is I'm going to
have a checkbox so we'll say input and
I'll have the type of course be checkbox
and here we're going to tie this by
using ng model once again to disable
button so the value is going to change
depending upon whether this is checked
or not for disabled button close off our
button tag and wrap that nice and save
it and reload it you can see right there
disabled button it's currently disabled
if I click on that now it's enabled so
that's how we're able to go in there and
very easily enable and disable different
components inside of our webpage now I
want to show you how we can come in here
and either hide or show different
elements so we're going to show
different things depending upon whether
it's day or night so I'm going to say
scope day time button is equal to true
and also I'm going to do something with
table so I'm going to create another one
of these guys and it's going to be let's
just do capitals again create an array
inside of here there we go we can use
that to demonstrate some other stuff
with tables inside of here so inside of
our controller of course we're going to
create another paragraph and we'll throw
an input box inside of here now let's
use a check box once again does that
work good before so check box tie this
to the model of daytime button and give
it a value of morning and then of course
we close our paragraph tag and then
let's create two different paragraphs
that we are going to display depending
upon whether the checkbox is checked or
not and we're going to use ng hide in
this situation and whether it's going to
be hidden or not is going to be
depending upon whether the checkbox is
checked or not if you want to do the
opposite so that if day time button is
checked we want it and it gives us the
value of true and we want to convert it
into false we just put an exclamation
mark in front of it so we'll say a
date/time button right there and I'll
turn trues and falses and in that
situation we want good morning to show
up and otherwise paste that inside of
there let's get rid of this and here
we're going to say good evening so it's
going to show totally different
information depending upon whether this
is checked or not reload and you can see
good evening shows up there if I click
on good morning it's going to say good
morning and so forth and so on
and what we're doing is completely
changing or hiding and showing different
elements depending upon a condition
we're also going to be able to come in
here and change a class dynamically so
let's create another paragraph tag this
is where we're going to be using all
that styling that we saw previously so
it goes create a select guy in here
we'll say
mg model is equal to text styling and
we're going to have different options in
this select box we're going to change
the class of an element using a select
box so we'll say blue text and then
we'll have our other option the bold
text and these guys are coming from this
guy say this is blue text and this is
bold text so if you're wondering what
those guys were them now you know we'll
just change this to bold text and then
we'll close off our select box and our
paragraph box of course then after this
let's create another paragraph and this
is going to be the guy we're going to be
changing and we'll define this as ng
class is going to be equal to whatever
the value of text styling is going to be
equal to we'll just make this some
random text blue text and bold text like
that and reload it blue text say it's
blue bold text now it's bold okay so
whatever you give the value for text
styling here in this select box or how
you would change the model in any way
you would automatically be able to
reference it in an ng class item
and it would automatically transport the
ng class directly inside of there so
that's how we can dynamically change a
class
and the final thing I'm going to show
you is how we can bind classes on even
as well as odd elements so let's use ng
repeat here once again to cycle through
our capitals that we defined over here
inside of our JS file once again inside
of the controller I'm going to create a
table and table TR and here I'm going to
use ng repeat like we have used
previously and here I'm going to say
item in capitals which is the name of
our array but I'm also going to define
different classes that I want to use
depending upon whether it's an even or
an odd row so we'll type in ng class
even is going to be equal to striped
blue which is class will be defined
above and then for the other one we're
going to say ng class odd is going to be
equal to and make sure you put that
single quotes inside of there
striped beige and then for each of these
individual items we go TD and get the
item city as well as the item state and
display those inside of that table with
the different styling for each one of
those and then we'll close off TR save
it and reload and there you can see they
show up real nice and neat there you go
guys that is a lot of information about
angularjs in the next part of the
tutorial I'm going to continue teaching
everything until I've taught pretty much
everything you could ever want to know
about angularjs and before I leave I
just wanted to send out a special

supporters you guys make it possible for
me to continue making my videos and
thanks a bunch and like always please
