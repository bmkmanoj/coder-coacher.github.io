26 of my android development tutorial
today I'm gonna do what you guys have
been asking for for quite some time I'm
going to show you a foolproof way to
install the new Android development
tools as well as the Samsung Mobile SDK
on both windows as well as on Macintosh
I'm going to cover how to do it with
Windows first so Macintosh users you can
look in the description for this video
to find the time in the video in which I
start showing how to install everything
on a Mac and I wanted to update you guys
on my Samsung giveaway in which the fine
people at Samsung are giving away one
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and three Galaxy
gear smart watches this is of course
being brought to you because of the
Samsung smart app challenge for 2013
which they're giving away 1.1 million
dollars which is more money than I can
even imagine the rules have actually
changed but probably for the better
basically Samsung is going to allow
everyone to be eligible to win one of
those four fabulous prizes
if you go to developer.samsung.com
forward slash sign up and sign up for a
free Samsung developer account after you
do that because YouTube has changed the
way comments are working now you should
then go to my website tell me that you
signed up for a free Samsung developer
account and then tell me why you should
win said device leave it up to you I
want these devices to go to people that
really really really will appreciate
them and now on to my video okay here we
are in Windows and I tested this with
about 24 different Windows computers
different versions of windows 7 and 8
basically the only thing you're going to
have to do different is how you're going
to find your control panel and so forth
so basically hit the start button come
up here and go to control panel now to
easily install the new Android
development tools what you're going to
have to do is uninstall Java 1.7 and
install Java 1.6 if you do that I have
never had a computer have any trouble
installing those tools so if you know
how to do that and while you can just
skip the video but if you don't know how
to do it I'm gonna show you how so we're
going to go to
uninstall a program and then chances are
you have Java 7 or you might not have
Java 6 if you have Java 6 well just skip
ahead I actually have a link to the
Android development tools URL in the
description for this video just go there
and download it but either way if you
don't we're just gonna uninstall this I
mean here are you sure you want to
uninstall say yes and I leave it to you
security wise and so forth but you know
this is the way to do it if you don't
want to mess around or have errors or
anything and the same is also true if
you're on a Mac that's what we're going
to do with the Mac we're going to go and
delete windows 1.7 well actually we're
not going to delete it on a Mac we're
just going to say we want to use Java
1.6 instead of 1.7 but on a Windows
computer it's just easier to do this
select the next one and it uninstall yes
I am sure and then it's gonna say can I
run this yes and it will delete itself
three-two-one and gone okay job is gone
so let's close the control panel and
then you have to do a little bit here to
find what you want which is Java
development kit six you for five and
I'll have this great big giant huge URL
in the description for the video as well
and you may have to have a Oracle
account which is free to get this but
either way just want to go accept
license yes thank you and then come down
here and I'm gonna get Windows 64 come
over here and get it it's probably gonna
say I need to sign in which it did sign
in if I can remember my password and
then you can see that it is downloading
the Installer down here and when it's
done we're just gonna say open then it's
gonna say is it okay to run this it yes
and then the installation was rips up
just hit next and just hit next and it
will install and then we'll hit next
again and it's just about done there it
is
and then successfully install Java
da-da-da-da-da make sure we want version
six doesn't matter about the 45 that
might change and then hit close okay
we're almost there now if we want to
check to make sure it installed
everything the way we want click on the
old start button hit all
Rams name Kemal pr2 accessories and I
come up here and go to command prompt
command prompt is going to open we're
gonna go Java - version like that and
1.6 is installed we're almost home get
rid of that now we're going to go I'm
going to open up Chrome again and we're
going to go to developer.android.com SDK
index.html come on over here and
download the SDK click on that and it
will download and what you're going to
do is I installed it you don't really
have to know anything just it's going to
come in there you have to uncompress it
I'm going to open it up I'm going to go
into my hard drive I'm gonna go into
users which is where I stored it you
sort wherever you want I'm gonna go into
downloads and there it is ADT bundle
windows da-da-da-da-da this is it open
that up open that up there's eclipse
open that up and there is eclipse okay
warning you want to run this say yes
unless you don't then you won't be able
to run okay an Android developer tools
its installed now I'm going to show you
how to install say okay I'm going to
show you how to install the Samsung
Mobile SDK which we're going to need to
develop specific apps for samsung
devices so I'm going to soon it go
Samsung Mobile SDK inside of here and
it's going to take me to it
there we are Mobile SDK Samsung
Developers this is what we want click on
that here we are I want to go to getting
started and this installs so easily and
let's just scroll through here and come
down to where it says downloading and
installing using Samsung SDK manager hit
show here we are again scroll through
this and you're gonna scroll through
this until you see this right here
developer.samsung.com repository blah
blah blah blah blah you want to
highlight this copy it and you're gonna
go into help and you're going to say
install new software and then in this
window you're gonna say add you type in
Samsung Mobile SDK manager
I like this paste in the URL and hit OK
I already installed it so it's gonna say
hey what are you doing you're trying to
do this again but either way all you
need to do is just come in here and
select that or do select all which is
always what
I do and then hit next and then you're
going to get to this window in my
situation says the operation can't be
completed all you're going to do is
select that again and then hit next and
next and next and finished and then it's
installed and it's ready to go and
everything works beautifully there it is
100% up-to-date version of the Android
development tools on Windows and that's
all you need to do now I'm going to show
you how to do this with OS X so the very
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to go Java slash and version like
this and it's going to tell you the
current version of Java you're using if
you see this 1.6 you you're right so you
don't really need doing that you could
just jump right to installing the
Android development tools however if you
instead see something like 1.7 whatever
whatever then you're going to need to
install 1.6 I'm going to have to delete
1.7 but instead you're going to have to
just install it now another thing before
we install that just to make sure it
isn't already there which most Macintosh
is have multiple versions of Java
installed is we're going to go forward
slash system library forward slash
frameworks forward slash Java VM dot
framework forward slash versions and
there we are then we're going to hit LS
that is going to show you every version
of Java that is currently installed now
if you see a folder with 1.6 in it or
1.60 in it you don't need to install
java 1.6 obviously if you do see one
point six or one point six point zero
here
however this says one point seven in it
well then what you're going to need to
do is just set one point six as your
current version of Java and not have to
do anything else that will be the
current JDK so in this situation what
you need to do is type the following
into your terminal sudo Ln /f hsv-1
point six and then current JDK and hit
enter now whenever after you hit enter
for that you're going to have to type in
the password for your computer if you
have that setup then
do that you should be able to go Java
version and 1.6 shows up if not
something went wrong because that's
exactly what you need to do and I have
all this stuff in text format available
also in the description for this video
now if 1.6 and none of those things show
up there what we're going to need to do
is install Java okay so since you don't
have 1.6 version of Java you're going to
go to support Apple comm /k b da
da-da-da again the link to this will be
in the description come down here and
then we're going to say download and
then what it's going to do is open up a
dmg file you guys who use OSX all the
time know exactly what that is and then
you're just going to install it that's
it piece of cake
hit next a whole bunch of times and you
are done and then basically we just go
over to developer.android.com SDK index
dot HTML again and we're going to say
hey we want to download the SDK bundle
for Mac click on that it's going to
download well after you say that you
agree to these terms and then you want
to download it it's going to download in
a zip format it's going to look
something like ADT bundle Mac like that
we're going to unzip it and then we're
going to open up eclipse and then we're
going to open up the specific version of
Eclipse for the brand-new Android
development tools going to jump over to
Samsung again just like we did with
Windows and if you missed that part
we're going to go to
developer.samsung.com forward slash
samsung mobile sdk forward slash start
and you're going to see downloading and
installing using samsung sdk manager
you're going to scroll down and you're
going to see developer.samsung.com sm
sdk repository samsung - sdk you're
going to copy that link and over here
the Android development tools are all
set up I'm gonna hit OK and here we are
now if I want to install the Samsung
Mobile SDK just hit o Staal new software
click on that this guy's going to open
up hit add and I'm going to type in
Samsung Mobile SDK
I'm going to paste in the URL that I got
from samsung hit ok and then I'm going
to select all like that and then come
down here
and hit next and next and next and next
and finish and then everything is going
to work beautifully and you'll be able
to install and work with the best most
up-to-date tools please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
