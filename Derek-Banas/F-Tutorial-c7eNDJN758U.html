f-sharp video tutorial and this one
tutorial you are going to learn the
course syntax of the f-sharp language
and in the description underneath this
video I have a link to all the code as
well as a transcript of the video and
also I have timestamps to all the
individual topics covered in this video
so you don't have to watch everything
all at once you can watch part and then
come back to it and just click on a
timestamp and go back to where you
started and like always I have a lot to
do so let's get into it okay so here we
are this is a Visual Studio 2017 the
brand-new Visual Studio and what we're
going to do here first is we're going to
come in and we're going to go file and
we're going to come down here and go new
projects and then inside of this you are
going to open up other languages this
visual f-sharp and then console
application give it a name and then come
down here and click on OK I went and
called my project F sharp Tut as you can
see right there and it automatically
created program dot FS and that's where
we're going to be writing all our code
and you can also see program FS over
here ok so let's just start here now
basically F sharp is Microsoft's
functional language and it's going to
provide a way to develop predictable
code that is often way shorter and
that's a major benefit of functional
languages in that they apply functions
to data rather than focus on state
changes like most object-oriented
languages and another benefit of
functional languages is that they are
great in regards to executing multiple
processes at once and one of the reasons
why is because variables for the most
part are immutable meaning that once the
does the value is assigned it cannot be
changed so but we'll get into all that
what we want to do here a very first
thing is we want to open up open and
system and what this is going to allow
us to do is access things like read line
and write line different functions that
are available in c-sharp that we may
want to use in a couple other functions
as we go on we're going to be doing a
lot of stuff here now I'm going to do
rundown of how to both read information
in from users as well as how to output
it and a little bit about variables now
if you want to create a function it's
very simple you just come in here and
create function like that there it is
and you go equals and then you tab in
and you are going to start writing your
function now whitespace is going to be
used to define your code block so it's
very important to go and make sure all
everything's tabbed in exactly the same
and let's say that we would want to come
in here and print to the screen and not
use a newline what we would do is go
print F and that's the version of print
to the screen without a new one and I'm
going to say something like enter your
name and put this like that and another
thing we're going to want to do is come
way outside of this function basically
to get out of the function you just go
and get rid of the whitespace there and
we're going to type in system dot
console actually you don't have to type
system this is a reference to this guy
open system so you're just going to be
able to go console dot read key and
that's going to read in an individual
press on the keyboard and then it's just
going to say ignore it's going to ignore
that input from the user and basically
we are using this to keep our console
window open until the user clicks on a
key on the keyboard and then it will
close so that's the whole purpose of
that and if you want to be able to call
this function you just come in here and
go hello outside of the function itself
and there you go basically this is a
hello world application but we're going
to do a little bit more with it let's
say we want to read data in from our
user we're going to go left and
basically what let does if I didn't say
before is it's going to bind a name to
either a value or a function so hello or
in this situation I'm going to create a
variable called name and I'm going to
use read line to read in input from our
user and as you can see there's no
semicolons none of that stuff at the end
of these statements now print F n on the
other hand is going to put a new line
after it print
something on the screen and another
thing is that is important to know about
print fm is that it is statically typed
in regards to parameters that it is
going to receive and what I mean by that
is for example you're going to do
something like a % and s and that's
going to represent a string so and well
with scan example and then I'll explain
it so let's say they go and they enter
in their name you want to go hello and
answer with whatever name they put
inside of there that's how you do it ok
and we know that this is a string here
and the other different types you're
going to have is you're going to have
integers and you are going to have
floats and you're going to have boolean
and you're going to have my strings
obviously I already covered that you're
going to have uppercase a which is going
to represent an internal representation
of things like tuples don't worry about
that if it's confusing as time goes by
here we're going to give a lots and lots
of examples or an O which is going to
represent an object so let's come in
here and let's go and actually execute
this you can see your first f-sharp
application executes we're just going to
come up here click on start and it's
going to automatically start itself as
you can see comes up here says what you
are enter your name and I'm going to
type in Derrick if I could spell my own
name properly hit enter
and it goes hello Derrick okay so very
very simple and I'm just going to hit
any key and it's going to close the
console and that's what this guy does
down here now I'm going to do something
a little bit more complicated let's go
and get rid of all of this here because
sort of getting in a way what I want to
do now is show you an example of how we
can format a floating-point numbers so
let's come in and we'll see some of the
maximums and minimums and things like
that so let's say we have PI and we want
to output that on a screen well let's
just throw a float inside of there and
then we'll just throw PI inside of there
like that now whole reason I did this is
just to show you the precision of
working with floats you can see right
there by default it is only precise up
to six digits okay and another thing if
let's say you they put six digits is
actually too much for it you'd actually
like it cut down to four digits
you just put a period in there on a four
and you run it and
- automatically cut it down to four but
let's say you actually want to get more
precision what we can do here is we can
get more precision we can get a maximum
of 27 decimals of precision and to do so
you go something like big and pi is
equal to and throw in 27 digits and then
end that with a Big M that is going to
get you the precision that you are
shooting for so let's just change this
to big pi and then what we're going to
do is inside of here instead of F you're
going to put an M and then of course
we're going to throw big PI inside of
there so there's big pi and there it is
and run it whoops that was an error what
I do wrong oh I put have a little space
there and by the way all of your
variable names are going to start off
with underscores or letters and then
thereafter can contain numbers so let's
say that now everything is wonderful and
let's run it and you can see now that it
was able to output many many many more
digits whenever you put the M inside of
there so that's important to know you're
also going to be able to add padding to
both the right and the left with printf
n so let's come in let's just get rid of
that and we'll do something like oh I'm
just going to show you how padding works
so let's get rid of all that and let's
change this into percent and negative 5
s and then % and a 5s and what this is
going to do is add padding to both the
right and the left of whatever we have
inside of there you're also going to be
able to come in here and have multiple
different parameters passed inside you
don't have to separate them with commas
or anything just like this we can run
that and you can see here that we have
padding here on the right and then
padding here on the left side so right
padding left padding that's how that
works out another thing that's
interesting is you can actually have
dynamic padding and I'll show you an
example of that you can just put a star
inside of there and then come out of
here and then define how much padding
you want and then what you actually want
in there in regards to your string in
there and that's it uh and you can see
I've added padding to the left side for
our
string hi okay so there is just a bunch
of useful information regards to input
and output and working with prints as
well as our princess as well as print FN
and now I want to do a couple more
examples of binding okay so I'm going to
change this guide up here to bind stuff
and then I'll come down here I'm going
to do more with functions as a do toriel
continues so bind stuff like that and
then inside of here
basically your default variables like I
said before are going to be immutable
and that is unless they are actually
marked mutable so we give you an example
of that so you can actually use mutable
variables inside here but it's not very
common with most functional languages
you just put mutable inside of there and
just like we did before we go equal to
and 175 and since you have mutable
inside of there you're going to be able
to change that value how you change it
is with this little sort of arrow symbol
and now all of a sudden I weigh 170 and
just to show you that that actually
worked the way that I am saying it's
working we can go inside here and go
weights and remember this is an integer
and weight like that and while we do
another example here as well you're also
going to be able to come in and use what
are called reference cells if you want
to change a value so you can do
something like let change me and equal
to and reference and 10 and in that
situation you'd be able to come in and
go change me and then colon equal to and
50 and let's go and actually show you
that that works also
so let's come in here like that and
we'll just call this change or something
and that's okay and we'll change this to
change me and there it is whenever you
want to get the value of that reference
though you're going to have to come in
here and put an exclamation mark like
that just little weird things you have
to do let me tell you're not going to be
doing this as much because like I said
with functional languages you're mainly
going to want to work with immutable
data but either way I just wanted to
show it to you just so you can see what
it's like yeah we could come in here and
run it just a
yes in fact I am able to change those
values okay so a couple examples of some
crazy stuff you can do binding wise with
f-sharp and now let's jump in and since
this is a functional language maybe we
should talk about some functions okay so
I wouldn't change the function we're
working here to do funks and then I'm
calling new funks down here and if I'm
going too fast just literally use that
pause button as you're watching these
videos because I go pretty quick okay so
let's go in here we can create functions
inside of functions of course let's call
one get some and basically functions are
going to start with let of course you
like you saw then you're going to have a
name and then you're going to have
parameters so we'll go X you're going to
then have optional parameter types so
you go X and a colon and int like that
comma and integer type for the next
parameter and then you're going to have
an optional return type and then we'll
say X is or X plus y and there you just
define the function and now we can come
in and we can execute that so we can say
5 plus 7 is equal to and that's going to
be an integer and then to call this
function I'm going to go get some and
five and seven are going to be the
parameters we pass inside of there and
there we go and we can run that and
we're going to do more interesting
things with functions but you can see
right there the function worked okay so
we got a value of 12 and since you are
watching a f sharp
tutorial I'm guessing you probably know
what a recursive function is so let's
come in here and demonstrate one okay so
to make a recursive function which is a
function that calls itself you're going
to go let rec like that and I'm going to
have this guy calculate a factorial if
you don't know what that is I'm going to
show you an example I'll walk you
through it and let's go and do a brief
explanation of how if statements work as
well as else statements so they look
just like every other languages we're
going to say here if X is a less than
one then we want to return a value of
one elves if X otherwise or else we're
going to go and get the value of X
and multiply at times factorial and
we'll pass in X minus one like I said
this doesn't make sense don't worry
about it I'm going to explain it step by
step here in one second so let's go and
get the factorial for example of four
and this is going to be an integer and
we'll come in here and we will go and
call our factorial function right like
this and then we'll be able to execute
it and then I'll explain exactly how it
works so let's go up here click on start
and you'll see the factorial comes back
up four is going to be equal to 24 now
how do we figure that out well here you
go this is everything you need to know
so the first time through our loop like
I said recursive functions call
themselves so we come in here and we
have a value of 4 comes down here it
says if 4 is less than 1 which it is not
we're going to return a value of 1 which
we can't because it's greater than 1 in
that situation where you come down here
and we're going to go 4 times call the
factorial function with 4 minus 1 and
you get exactly what you see here 4 and
then call the factorial function again
which is going to pass in a value of 3
then we're going to go up here factorial
3 comes in 3 times factorial of 3 minus
1 which is going to be equal to 2 see
exactly how that works
then we're going to come in again now we
have a value of 2 and we will pass to
inside of here then we'll have 2 times
factorial of 2 minus 1 which is going to
be equal to 1 come down here 2 times
factorial 1 what happens whenever we
pass one in if X is a less than 1 then 1
okay so in that situation we are going
to come in here and get our value of 1
which is going to be this guy right here
so 2 times 1 is equal to 2 this value
right here is going to be returned up
inside of here because of this function
right there then we'll get a value of 6
that 6 comes up here we multiply that
times 4 and get our final answer of 24
ok so if you don't completely understand
it's ok just an example of a recursive
function we're going to do a lot more of
functions and we're going to do a lot
more of functions right now something
else that is really cool is we are going
to be able to use
I'm the expressions so let's create a
list inside of here so we'll just go
random list and I'm going to go into
detail with things like if and else and
creating lists and working with lists as
the tutorial continues but I'm just
moving along here so two and three so
there you go you created a list with one
two and three inside of it now what
we're going to be able to do is use a
function called map which is going to
allow us to perform a calculation on
every item in the list and then return a
brand new list so to do that let's go
and go random list to is equal to and
the map functions located in the list
module so we're going to go list map and
then you're going to use fun inside of
here and basically fun is going to be
used to create lambda expressions so
we're going to say fun X this is a
function that's going to receive a value
of x and for each value of x it is going
to multiply those values by two it is
going to receive inputs of random lists
and it's just going to go through random
list value one multiply it times two and
add that to the random list two so forth
and so on so let's go in here and let's
go and see what that actually looks like
so I'm going to go print F N and let's
just call this a double list and like I
said before you're going to use a % and
a to get a internal representation of
this new list because this is an easy
way of figuring out what's actually in
the list so we'll go random to exactly
like that and we will run it and you're
going to see it doubled every single
value inside of our list later on I'm
going to show you how to cycle through
all of the different items and output
the list items one by one I just want to
show you that example because I think
it's interesting another thing we can do
is we can use the pipeline operator to
nest function calls so in this situation
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a list I'm just going to create
it right here so 6 7 &amp;amp; 8
exactly like that and then
and on the next line I'm going to come
down and put a pipe symbol in there it's
on the right side of your keyboard if
you don't know where that is
and then that a little bracket and I'm
going to use filter and what filter is
going to do is it's going to keep only
items in the list that match a condition
so I'm going to say list dot filter and
then inside here to find my function so
I'm gonna go fun and this is like an
anonymous function what we're defining
here so this is going to receive a
variable that I'm going to have B V and
I'm going to go and take the modulus of
this and what modulus does is it does a
division and it returns the remainder of
said division and then I'm going to
check if the value returned is equal to
zero so what I'm trying to do here is
create a list of items that are even or
you know even numbers so then what I
have to do up to this is go and put the
pipe and the bracket there and I'm going
to go list dot map and then I'm going to
multiply every item in the list that
filter went through so filters going to
get rid of things it's going to say hey
if this is on an even number I don't
want it in my brand new list and then
what maps going to do is map is going to
take all these items and it is going to
perform some operation on them in this
situation I'm going to get every even
number and multiply them times two okay
so we got that all set up whoops this is
not proper I have to come in here and go
fun like that
okay so now we have it all set up and
then the final operation that I want to
perform on this list that I have up here
is to print everything and how I can do
that is just go print and FN exactly
like that and say that I want to print
out my list of even doubles so you can
see it's taking the list it's going
pumping it through the filter then it's
pumping it through the map and then it's
going to pump it down here and print it
out on the screen we go at our the % and
a and this is a very neat way of working
with this stuff and you can see right
there got only the even numbers and
multiplied only the even numbers times
two and printed them out
on the screen so this is just the tip of
the iceberg of ridiculously cool things
we can do none other thing we can do is
we can come in here and execute multiple
functions so let's say we go malts nom
and this is going to be it's going to be
a function that's going to receive one
value and it's going to multiply that
one value of x three okay so we created
a brand new function called multiply
number and then let's copy this and
let's make another one so let's throw
this inside of there and we'll call this
add number so add number like this and
this guy is going to receive Y and Y and
it is going to add five today so I'm
going to say plus five now what we're
going to be able to do is actually
perform that operation on multiple in
multiple different ways so what we're
going to be able to do is go left and
let's say we want to be able to receive
a value that is going to multiply the
value times three and then we want to
call this one and add 5 to it we can
actually do crazy stuff like that how we
can do it is we can go mult numb so
we're saying we want to multiply the
times three whatever value we get inside
of here and then we want to add so like
just exactly like that
so it's going to copy this we can also
do it in the opposite direct so we're
going to be able to come in here and go
add and then moles so multiply and in
this situation we don't even need to
change anything around we just need
change this guy so there we are so in
that situation in this situation it's
going to multiply and then add and in
this situation it's going to add and
then multiply so there's all these cool
operators in time inside of F sharp so
let's show you an example of exactly how
those are going to work so we'll just go
mult and add and this is going to be an
integer that we're working with here and
to actually call the operation on a
number for both of those operations so
you pass a 10 inside of here and then
let's copy this and then we'll have it
be just slightly changed we'll change
this to add and then multiply keep the
value the same and then this is going to
be add and then multiply and we'll save
that and we will run it and you can see
all of the really cool things we can do
with F sharp ok so neat neat neat neat
neat stuff and of course we're going to
be doing more things with functions as a
tutorial continues but I noticed that I
was talking about modulus and all these
other weird things so why don't I take a
brief step back and show you some math
functions ok so we're back inside of do
math now change the name there you don't
need to change the name every time like
I do and here's a rundown of some basic
mathematical functions of course we can
add values together see how that's done
subtract multiply divide this is the
modulus which is going to return a
remainder of a division and one thing
that's important to know is if you want
to put percent signs inside of print FN
like that you're going to have to double
them up and this is going to show up as
1 % okay and then here you have 5 to the
power of 2 and we can run that just see
how all of those guys work out and you
can see exactly how they all work out
and of course if you've got and you
wanted to have this guy only be 2
decimal places or something else one
decimal place whatever you can go and
put a point and a 1 or a 2 or a 10 or
whatever you want to put inside of there
ok so neat stuff now let's go and let's
say you wanted to get the data type of a
variable let's go and go let number and
what's on a value of 2 to it and let's
go and figure out what the data type is
I know you know but you know I'm just
showing it away I'm figuring it out so
you're going to cut a percent sign and a
inside of there and then you're going to
go number and get type and that is going
to give you the data type and while we
are at it let's also cast to another
type inside of here let's just copy this
guy right here
throw that so out of there and what we
want to do is we're going to go a float
like this and we're going to change this
to point to float and to change to a
different data type all you have to do
is put in the data type you want to
switch to so will go float and number
and now that is going to be a float just
by putting the float inside of there and
you do the same thing with boolean x'
and all the
different things so in this situation
will go a are this would be an int so
integer which is look there we are and
will just change this to I like that and
of course is going to knock off the
decimal places and then we'll change
this to int and then we'll go and put
something like 3.14 inside of there just
so you can see an example of how those
we're going to work so that's how we get
the type and how we cast and you see
exactly right there that they worked
beautifully now there are a bunch of
other different built-in math functions
here's just a rundown of a whole bunch
of them of course you have cosine and
sine and tangent and all those guys this
is going to give you an absolute value
this is going to round for ceiling so
it's going to round whatever the value
is that you give it up floor is going to
round down this is a log function this
is a base-10 log function and their
square root there's a couple other ones
just wanted to cover all of the basics
though really quick and you can see
exactly how all of those different math
functions will work for you all right so
there is a rundown of a lot of the math
that you're going to use with f sharp
and now what I want to do is come over
and do a lot with strings so I'm going
to call this string stuff and we'll come
down here and of course we will call
string stuff so string and stuff and
you've seen some strings already you're
getting acquainted with them one thing
it's important to know is inside of your
strings there are certain escape
characters like for example you have a
new line and then if you want to
actually put in a backslash you have to
put in two of them and then you could do
double quotes like that and single
quotes and you actually already saw what
happens if you want to put in a % so
there's some escape options for you
what's great a function let's just keep
it very simple what's called a string
one and I'm going to say something like
this is a random string in there you are
you just created a string and another
type of string can have is what's called
a verbatim string and these are going to
be strings that are going to ignore back
slashes so all the things that I just
showed you
for create one of them you just put an
ad sign like that and here I'm going to
say I ignore backslashes and you can go
in there and throw some backslashes in
there just make sure that that works but
I know it does
another thing let's say you wanted to
have or one here's another thing called
triple quoted strings so it's just
another option for you and it would
allow you to use quotes inside of your
strings so you just put three you know
double quotes inside of there and then
you could say something like I ignore
double quotes and back slashes so
there's another thing and then you could
put that in quotes and then one two
three and there you go so that's another
option for you of course we're going to
be able to combine strings so let's go
and create another string here
so we can go string one and let's throw
a space inside of there between the two
strings and then + and string - there
you go we can come in and get the length
let's go and print the length out so we
go print F N and we'll go length and
that's going to be an integer of course
and to get the string length you type in
string followed by a length and let's go
and get the length of string for print
that out there on the screen you're also
going to be able to access values or
characters by index so let's go and do
that so for defin and here I'm just
going to put this is the character code
so it's just going to be a % there it is
and if you want to go and let's say use
string one and get whatever is in the
one index that's how you do that you're
also going to be able to get a substring
by passing in a range and we're going to
be doing more with ranges as the
tutorial continues now let's go first
word for example and % this is going to
be a string of course and to get that
guy we're going to say that we want to
do while you're going to put a dot and
then you're going to say we want to
start at index 0 and then we want to go
up through index 3 so there
is and there that is so neat stuff now
let's execute that you can see how all
those different guys are going to work
for it see the link there is 44 you're
going to see here H right there
we went and said we wanted to get the
first index of this guy well there's the
H and we grabbed the first word zero one
two three okay and that is the range
zero one two three okay so that's a
range function that's available the
thing is we are going to be able to use
collect to execute a function on each
character inside of a string so let's
say we want to have every single
character inside of our string be
uppercase we can go string and collect
and then fun and C and s printf and put
in our character inside of there and
let's put a comment there with a space
and then the individual characters so
what's going to do is it's going to
receive a string called and it's going
to have commas written inside of it and
it is going to print out individually
all of these individual characters with
commas in between all of them alright
and then we can say prints FN and commas
and the string upper string and we'll
save that now we'll run it so you can
see exactly how that works and there you
can say went and printed out all of the
individual characters separated by
commas okay neat stop do some more stuff
let's say that we want to check if any
of the characters meet a condition so
let's say for example we want to check
if any of the characters or uppercase
will go any upper and this is going to
be a boolean of course going to receive
a value of true or false we'll throw B
inside of there and then to do that you
go string dot exists and then we'll go
fun and see a little arrow symbol like
that and then we'll go character is
upper and there will be the individual
characters that are pulled out from
inside of the string we pass inside of
it and here what we're going to do
is let's keep it simple let's just go
string one see if any of the characters
in string one are going to be uppercase
or not whoops forgot to put the little
percents on in there and execute it we
know the answer is going to come back as
true and yes indeed any upper and you
can see it comes back is true okay so
tons and tons and tons of examples all
right let's do some more let's check if
any character meets another condition so
what we're going to do is we're going to
pass in a string that's going to contain
digits and we are going to check if any
of them or we're going to check if all
of them all the characters inside of the
string meet the condition so say printf
n and we go number and basically we're
checking to see if the string passed in
is actually a number and to do so we go
string four also every single one of
them has to meet this condition and
we'll go fun C with arrow inside of
there and then check if a string or if a
character is a digit for every single
one of these we use is digit and we'll
sort of see inside of there and then
what we're going to pass inside of here
is one two three four store it as a
string and we'll run it and that's going
to come back as true as well and you can
see that it does come back it's true so
trying to do some useful things here
while explaining a whole bunch of random
things we can do with that short let's
say we wanted to apply a function to
each index in a string so actually what
we're going to do now is we are going to
say that we want to pass in a value of
10 and have it automatically convert all
of those numbers up until 10 two strings
and print them out on the screen so
sounds like something really hard to do
not with f-sharp
so I'm going to call this string 1 and
go equal to string and knit we want to
get 10 index values when we're going to
go fun.i
this and then I and 2 string so there it
is and there it is and there it is now
of course we can print that out and see
what that looks like so this is just
going to be a whole bunch of numbers
numbers and it's a string
and string one okay and I'll do one
final one you can also apply a function
to each item in a string so let's go
string dot iterates and function C and
print FN and individual character C and
what it's going to commit what's going
to the string it's going to get passed
inside of here it's print me all right
so we have all this set up all these
cool things we can do with strings and
there you can see it went and prevented
the values it generated 10 values 0
through 9 and printed them out on the
screen as if they were strings and here
it cycled through the string print me
and printed all of those out on
individual lines because we use printf N
and remember anytime we print an
individual character with printf n we're
also going to get a new line at the end
okay so a whole bunch of things we can
do with strings with F sharp now let's
go take a look at looping now you are
normally not going to use looping like
you would in an object-oriented
languages with F sharp but you can so I
just change that the loop stuff so why
don't I show you what a while loop looks
like inside of F short so we'll go let's
this is going to be a magic number
guessing game so let me go magic num is
going to be equal to and I'm just going
to have this be a string and seven
inside of it
then I'm going to go left and I want to
be able to change this values so I'm
going to name it mutable and guess is
equal to and here this is just going to
be an empty value now the while loop is
going to go why not and we will go magic
and number equals and then pass in the
guess well then do so as long as the
magic number is not going to be equal to
the number they guessed we're going to
continue to do everything inside of this
loop so make sure we tab inside of here
and I'm going to go print F and I'm
going to say guess the number and ask
them to guess our number of course and
then I'm going to go guess and change
the value of guess just like we did
before by reading in a value so we'll go
:
and read line exactly like that and then
after they do guess it we're going to go
Prince F n and we'll say you guessed the
number and we'll put space inside of
there so it looks a little bit better
and there it is okay so that's how we
can create or use a while loop to make a
little guessing game so it says enter a
number and I get one and that's wrong
two three four and seven and you can see
there it worked okay so example of while
loops and how we can do cool things with
while loops now let's take a look at
four loops and then I'm going to show
you how we normally do looping inside of
F sharp so a four for loop we're going
to go for I is equal to 1 to 10 okay
so makes sense we're loop from 1 to 10
I'm going to show you a couple examples
make sure your tab in I'm going to go
print F end and I'm going to print out
all of those values okay let's do
another for loop let's say we wanted to
iterate downwards we could we can go I
is equal to 10 and then we're going to
go down to 1 so we're going to go from
10 to 1 and let's go and let's print
that out so that is in there that is and
as you can notice here the eyes are
going to be contained inside of the for
loop of themselves so that's how we can
change the value over and over again
we're also going to be able to iterate
over a range so we're going to go 4 and
I in and then define your range so so 1
to 10 and then the do and then after
that all the things you want to do so we
want to print all those values out and
why don't I show you the F sharp way of
normally iterating things why instead of
doing all this whenever we can actually
pipe values why would we do loops like
this when we can just pass in and pass
in a list into a function and have it
just work I don't want to give an
example that so we can just go 1 to 10
exactly like that we're going to pipe it
into we're going to go that we want to
iterate these guys and what we want to
do is want to pass them in here and have
them print that they values over and
over again so numb
there it is and there that is and this
is and there we go and that's going to
allow us to print that another thing we
can do just as our final example here is
let's say we want to be able to sum a
list we can just go let's and sum is
equal to and then go list dot and reduce
and throw a plus inside of there
that's the operation we want to do when
we'll say one and let's do this
two values one through ten add those all
up do I still have a print in there yes
I do
and we'll call this sum like this and
then sum is going to be passed out on
there so real quick ways to do all kinds
of cool things and here you can see
there's a whole bunch of different
things first we iterated through 1
through 10 and then we went and iterated
from 10 to 1 and then we hit rated from
1 to 10 once again and here you can see
that we were able to go through and
output all of those guys using this
handy dandy little thing here where we
piped all those individual values from
the list into here to print and then you
can see here we solved all those values
ok so neat neat neat neat stuff we can
do with looping inside of F short and
now I dive in here and get a little bit
more into how conditionals work so I'm
going to call this conditional stuff
let's just abbreviate that and
conditional stuff all right so let's go
and take a closer look at if-else and LF
so we're going to define an age and it's
going to be equal to 8 what we can do
with if statements then is go if age is
less than 5 then we want to print some
information on the screen and what we
want to print here is let's get rid of
that will go preschool okay so that
child is going to preschool
LF same as else if age is equal to 5 you
can see just have the regular equal sign
there then we want to print something
else so in this situation we will go
kindergarten alright simple enough and
else if let's do another one and we can
also put these on top of each other
we'll go age is greater than 5 and
so both of these are going to have to
come back as true if we're going to do
what comes up next and we're going to be
able to go less than or equal to 18 well
in that situation then we were going to
well let's go into a calculation first
before we do that we're going to
calculate the grade so we're going to go
let and grade equal to poops get rid of
that age minus 5 and let's go and output
that new piece of information and that's
going to be whoops put that there but
there go to parade throw this inside of
here and then change this to grade okay
so we're able to stack those and else
we're going to say this is the default
now the other are true we're going to
say go to college all right and there we
are so there is an example of how we can
use if and else if and else and all
those guys and you can see since it was
the age of 8 comes back with go to grade
3 all right so neat stuff let's do
another example
why not so I just want to show you some
more things we can do conditional wise
by demonstrating how the or logical
operator works let's say we want to
define who gets a grant the college
grant so we're going to say that the
person applying for the grant has a GPA
of 3.9 and it's also based off of income
so we'll say income for said students is
going to be equal to 15,000 and then
what we want to do is we want to go
print F N and we'll say whoops college
grants oh by the way did I mention
comments just put there you go that's a
comment and this is a multi-line comment
so multi one comment all right for some
reason I forgot that so that's how you
do comments and multi-line comments all
right so let's K this is a boolean I
just doing this stream-of-consciousness
out of my head so we will then go GPA
greater than whoops
or equal to three point eight and or if
their income is less than or equal to
$12,000 in that situation we will
that student qualifies for a grant if
either this or this coming back is true
alright and otherwise the other logical
operator available to you is going to be
the knot symbol and how that works is
let's just go and give you an example
we'll go not true and boolean close that
off and then you get a knot and true
so knot is going to turn trues and
falses and pulses in the throughs it's
very powerful and it's run that and you
will see college grant yes it comes back
as true and not true well it not turn
screws and falses and you can see it did
that all right
so conditional operators and how they
work hey let's do another one another
thing that's kind of considered to be a
conditional operator is match all right
and you can use match and guard
statements to do basically the same
thing you just did up here let me give
you an example so let's go let's grade
two and string equal two and then we're
going to say match age with and then
we'll put in our different conditions so
we'll go pipe or we'll put that symbol
enter and we'll say age when age is less
than five well in that situation we want
to return preschool all right so there's
that in a situation in which we have a
value of five in that situation we want
to return kindergarten do all kinds of
neat things with match and we're also
going to be able to come in and go age
win and we can stack these up just like
we did before age is greater than five
and age is less than or equal to 18
stack those up in that situation we want
to do more and what we want to do is go
whoops age minus five and then we want
to convert that into a string so we can
output it on on the screen and we'll go
to string to do that okay and then we'll
go in and by default we'll put an
underscore that represents by default
and in that situation this is going to
return a string that just says call it
let's go and run it so print FN and we
will change this to grade two because
that's what it is
and throw in that's % and this is going
to be a string of course and we'll
change this to grade two whoops what I
do
oops okay save that and let's run it and
see what happens
and you can see it still comes back
grade two comes back with a value of
three just like the other one did
alright so more more more stuff and why
do we go and talk about lists all right
so let's call this list stuff just to
stay consistent and list stuff all right
so what we're going to do first is we
are going to create what is called a
list literal so imma go
list 1 is equal 2 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 4
okay you saw this before but we're going
to do cooler things here let's say we
want to print the list let's go print
and let's just pipe it inside of there
nice and easy
list it rates aims we want to go print
FN and have each of these items come out
on screen on their own line alright he
alright sort of saw that whoops
change that to I of course alright so we
got that we can also come in and print
the items using the internal
representation of a list with the a so
list one and there that is you're also
going to be able to use the cons
operator to join a whole bunch of
different values so we go five and six
and seven and that would be an empty
list in that representation and we can
print that out just you can see what
that looks like a print FN and we'll do
something like that and list two in that
situation like I said before we're going
to be able to use ranges so we can go
call this guy list three just to stay
consistent say we want values from 1 to
5 in the list well there you go you just
created that and you can also create
ranges with letter
inside of them so we go list for equal
to and let's say we wanted to get a
through G there you go that's how easy
that is now you have a list with letters
inside of it and let's go and print out
lists for in that situation is that's
the one that's a little bit more
interesting and you've seen ranges
before you're also going to be able to
generate a list with a knit like we saw
before so let's say we want to create
five indexes and multiply those indexes
times to do so so we'll call this list 5
is equal to lists and in it it's going
to create five indexes inside of there
and each of those indexes it is going to
multiply times two so we'll just go I
times 2 and that is will print out that
lets go like this now let's run it see
how it works
all right here you can say so we got one
two three four there we were basically
let's go up here see one two three four
this is how we were generating those
guys right there and then you can see
here where this is the internal
representation of these values we use
the range here we used another range
there and then down here you can see
that we generated five values and then
multiplied each of those index values
times 2 so 0 times 2 is equal to 0 2 x
times 2 is equal 1 times 2 is equal to 2
4 6 and 8 all right and we're going to
do more so let's keep on going keep
everything here on this page let's say
we want to generate a list using what we
call yield what this is going to do is
it is going to in this situation going
to multiply each of the index values
times themselves we can do that let's
call this list 7 whoops now let's call
it with 6 equal to and then we'll go a
in and let's say we want to go 1 2 5 do
and yield and multiply a times a and we
can generate that guy and let's do
another one
let's go list 7
equal to and here we're going to
generate an even list so we'll go for a
in one to twenty do and then we'll throw
a condition in here so we'll go a and
this is the modulus is equal to zero
then yield a so if that condition is met
then yield it and another thing we can
do is we can use something called a
yield bang and what it does is it
creates multiple lists for each item and
then merges them into a final list so
I'm going to show you an example just
kind of crazy stuff so we'll go list
eight is equal to 4ei in one through
three and we'll go do yield bang which
is going to be the exclamation mark and
then we're going to go a dot a plus two
plus two like that and what it's going
to do is let's say you pass in one two
three what it's going to do for the one
is actually go and generate another list
which is going to be one two and three
so it's going to go through and the
first part of the list is going to be
wherever you pass in that's where the
one is and then the next one is going to
be a plus one so that's where the two is
and then a plus three or a plus two I'm
gonna show you an example and then it
will make sense
and when we go and print all these guys
out as well so neat stuff so six and
then this one is seven and then we will
print out eight as well so there's list
eight and let's run it just to show you
an example cool stuff we can do and here
you can see well let's come down here
here we generated one through five and
multiply them times themselves so here
we got 1 times itself is 1 2 times 2 is
4 3 times 9 da-da-da-dah and then down
here we went 1 through 20 and we said
we've only wanted even numbers we can
see we generated only even numbers and
here we went and yielded or use the
yield bang which is going to take one
two and three and then perform these
operations in this
range on those things so you can see
this is for the 1 this is for the 2 and
this is for the 3
all right so cool cool stuff let's do
some more functional languages love list
so of course there's a lot of things you
do with them let's say we wanted to get
the length of a list just come in here
and go lengths and of course that's an
integer and let's get list AIDS length
we can just type in a link and that's
going to get it for us we can also check
if a list is empty or not so we'll go in
and we'll change this whoops
we'll change this to empty and of course
that's going to be a boolean value and
we'll do this on list 8 as well so list
8 you go is empty and it's going to give
you an answer for that and we can also
get an item at a specific index so let's
say we wanted to get something like what
is at index 2 and we're going to use
lists for for this which is a whole
bunch of characters so like this and we
go list for and item and to get index 2
you just put index 2 inside of there if
you want to get the very first item that
is often referred to and list as the
head we can do that and we'll do the
same thing for list for just so you know
a list for is this guy whereas list for
there it is see it generate a whole
bunch of letters inside of there so
we're going to do this for lists for a
once again and we'll get the first value
so we'll go list for and follow that up
with head now we got that we can also do
the tail which is everything except for
the first item so we'll go use the a in
that situation there and we'll go list
for and of course we put tail inside of
there and that's gives also tail we're
also going to be able to filter out
let's say for example we want to only do
evens we can do that let's go let's list
9 equal to list 3 and we're going to
pipe this in to list filter and then put
our can do
inside here so function X is equal to s
and it will do the modulus of two is
equal to zero and of course I'm just
using the modulus a lot and generating
even numbers because I think it's easy
to understand let's say we want to
multiply all values times themselves
let's go him treyton of the list and
this would be list ten is equal to and
we're going to go list nine and we're
going to go a list and we'll use map and
then define the function we want to
perform on each one of those items so
like this and that's going to be x times
x multiply those values times themselves
and what else can we get well final
thing we could do is we could sort a
list so let's go and sort it so call
this sorted and we'll just get the
internal representation of that and we
will go the list and sort and let's just
do when we generate it here we'll do
everything backwards so four and three
and we'll see exactly all that prints
and as the final thing here there's so
many things to do oh this is supposed to
be listened nine then want to Mossad up
okay got that fixed and the final thing
I want to do is show you how to psalm a
list showed you it before show you
another different way of doing it we can
go some and I that's going to be that
value and we can go list and fold and
then we can go and call this function
sum and you're going to get an element
passed inside of it and then you're
going to go sum plus elements and we
will throw 0 inside of there that's
going to represent the sum value right
there
the sum obviously starts off as 0 and
then we will have our list inside of
here so one two and three and then we
will close that off and close that off
and of course we could have a name of a
list inside of there and let's run it
and there's a bail bear what's up build
error this value is not a function can
be applied but that the 35 what are we
doing here oh I just got confused I bet
you cuz the space it's not there there
we are got rid of it let's run it again
and here we go
and there you can see there is the head
there is the tail this is whenever we
got the index this is whenever we were
checked if it was empty or not here we
start off with five four three and it's
sort of them and here it went in some
does values I write so whole ton of
things to do with lists you should go in
there and experiment with them and now I
want to talk about in ohms now basically
in ohms let's change this to enum stuff
and this to enum stuff enums are going
to allow us to use sort of flowery
specific information and assign names to
our data to make it make a little bit
more sense so we're going to do this
outside of the function we're going to
go to type and emotion equal two and
then we define all of them so we can say
an emotion would be equal to joy and
give that a value of let's make it zero
and then we have fear which is going to
be equal to one and then let's define a
final one which is going to be anger and
give that a value of two all right now
let's work with it so let's go and
create it and let's go my feeling is
equal to and then you go emotion
followed by joy okay and then what we
can do is do let's say we wanted to do a
match just because I really like matches
all right so we'll go if my feeling
matches whichever one of these guys
we're going to perform different
operations so if it's equal to joy what
we're going to do is we are going to
print out some information that is going
to say something like I'm joyful okay
joyful like that and then we can come
down here and if the value is equal to
fear we can print out I'm fearful okay
so I'm fearful oops there it is and
let's do another one let's say anger and
done and we'll say I'm angry I'm angry
was it not angry full all right and
there's an example of just the different
things that you could do alright so now
what I want to do is talk about options
call this option stuff and change this
down here to options
stuffs and em back up here basically an
option is used when a function may not
return a value so let's give an example
here let's do a division in which we
want to block a situation which they
could pass in a zero so a division by
zero error how we do that is let's go
call this guy divided and what's sick
it's X&amp;amp;Y as a value and then we want to
use match and we're going to say with
and we're going to have our different
values so if they pass in a zero what we
want to do is return none otherwise by
default everything else is going to be
fun
so we are going to say sum and then
we'll go X divided by Y like that then
what we can do is we can come down here
and say F and divide 5 0 and there it is
and we'll say is some then we want to go
and print out some information
so we'll go print and we even though we
know this is never going to work we're
going to go 5 divided by 0 is going to
be equal to and there's the a and then
after that we're going to call the
divide functions will go divided 5 and 0
and if we want to get the value from
that guy we can do so just by putting
value inside of there and then we can go
l-lift and divide and pass in 5 0 and
put that there and here we're going to
check if it is none that returns value
is done then we're going to go then
print F like this and we'll say can't
divide by zero chance divided by zero
and then we could also come and go else
and we can just say something happen we
don't know what so we'll go prints FN
whoops or my doing we could say
something happens so something happens
and there that is and if we run it up to
the you're going to see can't divide by
zero goes in there and the reason why as
we passed in a zero inside of there
you can see exactly how all of those
different guys work and that's an
example of options and now we're going
to talk about tuples okay so basically a
tuple is a comma separated list of
values of any type so let's go and let's
create one so we go let's a bridge we're
going to create a function here and it
is going to receive X Y and now let's go
W XY and Z and it's going to receive or
return a float value and then inside of
our function where you go let's and sum
is equal to W plus X plus y plus Z and
then we're going to go and get the sum
and divided by 4.0 all right so good and
then we're going to go and print out
this information so we're going to say
average and this is going to return
float of course and then we're going to
call our new average function and we're
going to do so by passing it a tuple so
we'll get a 1.0 and 2.0 and 3.0 and 4/5
all right so there that is and why don't
I go do another example here so I just
want to briefly touch on two bolts we
can also like I said store multiple
different values inside of here so we
can say Derrick for example and 42 and
six point two five so there's a bunch of
different data types and if you want to
get data from a tuple let's go let's and
name we're actually going to assign
multiple different values inside of here
and let's say we don't care about the
height so we're just going to put that
inside of there for the data we don't
care about and we're going to receive
all that information this is my data
we're going to pull out Derrick put it
in the name variable pull out age put it
on there and say we don't care about how
you and then we're going to print out
some information and what we're going to
pronounce his name and that's a string
obviously and to get that specific thing
let's go name alright got that set let's
run it and you can see it was able to
calculate the average and was also able
to pull my name out of the tooth pool
okay so some free free free free free
stuff on tuples I want
talk about records okay so basically a
records just going to be a list of key
value pairs for creating custom types
I'm going to create one outside of our
function called customer and it's going
to have some data inside of it and let's
make sure we put the white space inside
of there so I'm going to say the name is
going to be the key and it's going to
contain a string and slip semicolon and
then we're going to have the balance
that the customer owes us and that's
going to be a float all right so you
just created a custom record now inside
of our function we're going to create
one so we'll go let's Bob equal to and
then inside of here we're going to find
all that stuff so we're going to name is
equal to Bob Smith hands close at all
semicolon and his balance is going to be
equal to one or one dollar and fifty
cents so Bob Smith owes us some money if
you want to get some information out of
there about what Bob Smith owes us we
could go and get the string which is the
name and go owes us and then we can go
and get the float cut it down to just
two digits and then we can just go Bob
and get his name out of there and Bob
and then get his balance out of there
all right whoops spell balance right and
there is and let's run it and you'll see
that that works all right and Bob Smith
owes us one hundred dollars and fifty
cents okay again brief explanation just
wanted to just briefly touch on records
and now I want to get into a pretty cool
example of how we can use sequences okay
now sequences are going to allow us to
create what are called infinite data
structures that aren't going to be
defined or populated until they are
needed
so let's come in here and let's say now
let's just generate a sequence of 100
values so how you would do so as you go
let's and let's call this sequence one
equal to and then you go sequence and
I'm going to show you exactly how they
work so I'm going to go like
and then 100 1000 I don't care it could
be 100 1000 all right and let's generate
another one let's go and try another
sequence let's call this sequence 2
equal to sequence and here what we're
going to do is we're going to generate
even numbers so we'll go to do so we
have 0.2 and that's going to define how
we are going to increment up to make
sure that's 0 and then go dot two and
then dot dot and 50 all right so that's
going to generate only even numbers from
1 to 50 so that's where you define how
much you increment each time through and
let's do another one we can do a
descending sequence so the sequence 3 is
equal to I'm also showing you how to do
things with ranges here but whatever
it's nice to learn multiple things at
once put that there and sort of bothers
me let's make it right okay there we go
and what you're going to see here is if
we try to print any of these they're
going to be abbreviated so what I mean
by that is we'll go and try to print
sequence 2 we know that that's 50 digits
or no 25 digits let's run it and you can
see whenever I print it it only prints
out the first 4 okay so the sequence
isn't going to be generated until it is
actually required now you could actually
come in and print the whole list however
so let's go and I'll show you how to do
that what you do is you go sequence and
2 and convert it to a list and then you
go sequence and 2 and we're going to use
our pipe here once again and list and
iterates and then say what we want to do
with that information so we'll go print
f'n and we'll print all this information
on individual lines so like that's like
that like that what that's going to do
is allow us to print the whole list for
sit - alright see print it all out there
and otherwise it's not going to so what
we can do now let's do something really
cool let's say we want to generate a
whole bunch of prime numbers what I want
to do here is create a function it's
going to test if a number is prime so
I'm going to call this is prime
it receives a value and it's going to
test if it's Prime I'm going to not
going to get into the math this is a
recursive function so it's going to come
in here and generate or check multiple
different values that are passed inside
of it so I'm going I is greater than and
we only have to check up to half the
value to find out if it is prime or not
and then we are going to also come in
here modulus I and the go and check once
again and I plus 1 I just gonna keep
this want to do something cool but I
want to explain all that all right so
you guys really want to know I'll
explain how the prime numbers are
generated but that's a general very easy
way to generate if a prime number is is
is prime or if a number is prime or not
so what I do here is if is prime returns
true then I want to add it to my
sequence and if not it won't be added so
I'm gonna go is let's and prime and
sequence is equal to sequence and then
what we can do is go for and in and
let's say we want to get 100 we want to
check five hundred digits ok so that's
if and then we'll go is prime and then
yield that means it's going to go into
my sequence and then after that what I
can do is I can go and print out all
those prime values somebody go prime and
sequence and we've got run this guy well
as I do everything right let's uh get in
and there you can see it went and print
it out the abbreviated version of that
sequence so let's go and say we want to
print out everything well we're going to
do it in pretty much the same way that
we did before let's go and just copy it
get that throw that there and then we'll
go sequence to list and it will change
this to prime sequence prime sequence
list iterative tada let's change this to
prime and then this is all cool believe
that exactly what it is and here we can
actually have it generate all those
prime values and you can say print it
out all the prime values from 1 to 500
all right me ok so there's a whole bunch
of examples
of sequences and how you can suck them
up and how they work and now I want to
talk about maps okay so of course I
change that to map stuff
now basically maps are collections also
of key value pairs and let's go and
create a map so what we need to do I'm
going to create a map called customers
and very first thing you do whenever you
create a map is you generate an empty
map so you go map empty and then what
after you after you're done with that
you're going to add your key values to
your map by using add I'm going to add
I'm going to go Bob Smith and then I'm
going to say Bob Smith owes us whoops
make sure you put quotes around there
we're going to say Bob Smith owes us 100
dollars and 50 Cent's and then you
follow that up with a period let's add
another person so we'll say we want
Sally marks and there's suddenly marks
and she owes it's 50 dollars and 25
cents I'm really obsessing about this
and there you go so you just created
yourself a map now let's go in here and
let's say we want to find out oops don't
want that print if N and I'll say number
of customers let's say we want to get
the number of customers in our map
that's what we do is just go customers
and count and that's going to get that
for us I'm going to do a whole bunch of
other things here though first it's good
thought and let's say we want to find
out what Bob Smith's balance is let me
go let's and customer equal to customers
and we go try to find Bob Smith in the
list and then I do that is go Bob Smith
is the key that I'm searching for inside
of here now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to use match to define what
happens I'm gonna say match customer
with and then if we come back with some
value X well in that situation we know
that we received a Bob Smith match so
we're going to print some information
out we're going to say that we want to
get the balance for Bob Smith or whoever
else we're searching for so we'll get
balance and then we
to go point 2f just to abbreviate that
and then we'll get the value of x and
otherwise if there was no match for Bob
Smith we will do something else we will
say not found all right just to keep it
simple so they're not found all right so
we got that let's do some more stuff
where we start printing things out let's
say we want to list our customer names
and balances pretty easy let's go
customers the customers and at a and
impasse customers inside of their
customers let's say we want to test if a
key exists or not customers we go
contains key and then we'll pass in Bob
Smith Bob Smith well if it does contain
Bob Smith well then we have to define
what we want to do in that situation
we will say something simple like Paul
Smith was found and you can also come in
here whoops don't do that let's go put
that back where it goes all right let's
do another thing here let's say we want
to get a value of a key so go like this
and put that over there and we'll say
Bob's balance but you know so like this
but and we'll say customers and Bob
Smith so the key inside of there and
that is and then finally we can remove
items so go let's let's create a brand
new customers item in here and we can go
math and remove and we'll say we want to
remove the key for Sally marks from the
customers and then we can come in here
and print it out to show that it works
so say number of customers and we'll go
costs to and count just to prove that I
worked I was right and let's see what
you got and there we can see started off
with two customers now we have one
because we've got rid of Sally marks can
see here when print out the balance we
found Bob Smith
we also were able to print out Bob
Smiths balance all right so cool stuff
that we can do with maps now I want to
briefly talk about generics ratso
generics let's do an example here
basically a generic is going to allow
you to use any data type in a function
so let's go and define two functions I'm
going to have one be adds stuff and how
you defined you don't know what's going
to be coming in here is you go single
quote like that and T and then x and y
is equal to and then what this guy is
going to do is it's going to print out
this addition so I'm just going to keep
it simple a and inside here we'll go X
plus y we do it that way of course
because we don't know what the data type
is and now what we're going to be able
to do is come in here and call add stuff
and define that we are working with
floats in this situation and then go
five point five and two point four or
something like that and it will work so
let's run it and you can see seven point
nine comes back and we could also come
in here and we could do its and we'll do
this so five and two or something and
there you are and there's a generic and
run it up went down here and there's
seven alright so there you go very very
brief explanation of generics now we're
going to talk about exception handling
call this exception stuff for exp and of
course exception handling is going to
allow us or provide us with a way to
catch errors so inside of here let's go
let's and let's do our divide example
again to catch the potential division by
error or division by zero error and what
you're going to do just like many
languages you're going to say try and
then and then we are going to go and try
to do this so we're going to do
something like the 2f and divided by
point to F is equal to and point to F
and then have X and Y and then X whoops
X divided by Y inside of there now
we're going to put with inside here like
what do you normally do and question
mark and we're going to say that we
expect it is possible to have a / 0
exception so divided by 0 or 0
expression exception and in that
situation in which we do we're going to
go like this and print a message that
says can't divide 0 and that's going to
keep the whole program from crashing
instead it's going to print out can't
divide by 0 all right so we got that set
up now let's go and try to do it let's
try to break it so we'll go divided and
we will pass in a 5.0 and a 4.0 like
this and that's perfectly valid if we
run it you're going to see that it goes
and it does it no problem at all however
if I would come in here and go try to
pass a zero inside of there and if we
run it you're going to see that comes
back as infinity why because the
exception wasn't actually called on that
it considered it to be okay well not
just so I don't have to mess around with
casting and so forth I'm just going to
change that to 5 and 0 and then change
this to I and then we're going to raise
our own exception so let's through this
inside of there okay and now those are
all going to be integers we'll have to
worry about that and now you can see
what I did was I threw in an if
statement and what it's saying is if Y
is equal to 0 then I want to raise an
exception and this is the message that I
want pass to it otherwise I'm going to
say everything's okay and just perform
that calculation and you can see down
here it is going to work this side so
let's run it so that's how you to raise
exceptions exceptions and so forth and
so on
so yes exception handling requires more
diligent coverage but like I said I'm
trying to cover everything as quickly as
possible and now I'm going to talk about
strokes
okay so strokes are going to allow us to
create our own data types so what I want
to do is I want to create one called
a rectangle and you have to define that
this is a struct and then inside of it
you're going to define some different
values so I'm going to say my rectangle
is going to have a length and that's
going to be a float and then it's also
going to have
a width also going to be a flutes and
then I need to define what happens
whenever I create one of these data
types so I'm going to say that length
and width is passed inside of it
and whoops make sure that's an equal
sign and whenever that occurs what I
want to do is a sign length whatever the
length was that was passed inside of it
and width is going to be whatever the
width was that was passed inside of it
and then finally after we do all of that
stuff we're gonna put end inside of
there
all right whoops got an error because I
didn't put a semicolon
all right not fixed it all right so
let's go down here and use our struct so
I am going to say let's area I'm going
to create a function and it's going to
receive or I'm going to call it shape
and it's going to be of type a rectangle
like we just defined here so rectangle
is and whenever this guy's called it's
going to take the shape and it's going
to get the length and multiply it times
the width so there that is and there is
how we work with our custom data type so
let's go create a rectangle is equal to
new rectangle and let's say we get a
five and a six passed inside of there
and now let's go and get the rectangle
area so we'll go all rectangle or rect
area throw that inside of there put this
here and call our area function pass in
the rectangle we just created and then
and then let's go and print out our
results sort of them say area and like
this and then whatever the rect area
value is and why is that giving me an
error Oh
because I've got Patito sign in there
alright so save that then let's run it
then you'll see how it works and there
we calculated the area alright so again
brief explanation of structs and now I'm
going to finish off the whole tutorial
by talking about classes as well as
inheritance all right change that to
class stuff let's come up here and
define a class now class is just going
to model a real world
objects by defining the attributes
called fields and the capabilities
called methods of those real-world
objects so let's say let's just do a
simple ones call this animal and we have
to define that it is going to be a class
and then we're going to find the
attributes or fields and so we're gonna
have this which is going to be a string
and there's also going to be a height
and that's going to be a float and
another value we'll have is a weight
which is also going to be a float now we
need to define our constructor inside of
here how you do that is you go new and
then all the things that get passed in
every single time you create a animal
object so we'll go high name height and
weight and whenever that is cold we are
going to whoops let's go down here there
we go and we will define everything so
we'll say name is equal to whatever the
name was they passed in and whoops make
sure you use semicolons here and height
is going to be equal to whatever the
height was that they passed inside of
here another semicolon and then finally
weight is going to be equal to whatever
weight they passed inside of here close
off with the curly brackets and then we
can now define the capabilities or
methods how you do that did you go
member and X and let's say we wanted to
find run as a function or animal is
going to be able to do what to do so by
going print like this and then we're
just going to keep it simple we're going
to say whatever the animal's name is and
then followed with the word run and then
how you get that animal's name is just
by calling X and name FD a-- complete
all of that stuff then you have to put
end inside of here so what I'm gonna do
right now is I am going to hey you know
what I might as well come in here and
show you an inheritance so inheritance
through inheritance whenever you create
a class that inherits from another class
it is going to receive all of these
attributes and/or fields and methods
that are in the animal class so I'm
going to create another one let me go
dog this is going to be a dog class
and we're going to define name and
height and weight and the constructor
inside of animal is going to take care
of all that for us so we go equal and
then we're going to say how what we're
going to inherit from so we're going to
inherit from animal and whatever we do
we are going to pass it the name and the
height and the weight so that the
constructor and animal is going to be
able to handle all that and initialize
my dog objects as well as animal objects
and then we can come in and not only do
we get all the fields and methods but we
can also create our own so we can say
member and let's say we want to have our
dogs be able to bark well now they can
and will do this some of the thoughts
and we will here say whatever the
animals name is barks that goes and then
get the name we do exactly the same as
we did before and now we can test out
this in our class stuff function down
here so class stuff
let's go and create spots and he is an
animal objects and his name is spot
obviously and he has a height of twenty
point five whatever's and a weight of 40
point five whatever's there you go and
we can go spot and run and spots going
to be able to demonstrate how he runs
and now we'll create a a dog object so
we're going to call this bowser is equal
to new dog and bowser and we'll say that
this exact same size so 25 and what 45
there that is and now we can demonstrate
that the subclasses are going to be able
to use not only the fields but the
methods and all that other stuff so
we'll go bowser and we'll call run and
then Bowser and have Bowser or bark yeah
put that on a separate line obviously
all right and we will save it and we
will run it and you can see spot runs
and Bowser both runs as well as barks so
there you go guys that is an insane
amount of information about how you can
do so many different crazy cool things
with f-sharp hope you guys enjoyed that
tutorial if you did please leave a like
I mean this is crazy so just like always
please leave your questions the comments
