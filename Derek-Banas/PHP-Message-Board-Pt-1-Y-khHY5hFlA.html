my tutorial on how to make a PHP / - ql
message board slash forum whatever you
want to call it the reason I'm making
this tutorial is this guy right here
requested it so this is kind of going to
be a continuation of my web design and
programming tutorial which I really
focused on PHP and MySQL and I provide
links to both the beginning of that
tutorial as well as a link to the
specific part of that tutorial in which
I start talking about MySQL and how SQL
works so whenever you're creating a
message board or a forum system using
PHP the very first thing you have to do
is create a database well we're going to
use MySQL of course and I'm going to
need to create three tables inside of
MySQL one being users one being message
and one being topics well first thing I
have to do is login to MySQL and here I
am logged into MySQL clear the scroll
back from that and then to create a
database I'm going to offer case
everything that is a command in MySQL
here for you so you can easily see what
is an SQL command and what is not I'm
going to call this message board spelled
like that created that now if I want to
use message board I just type in use
message board okay super now what I have
to do because there's nothing in there
is create a table in the first table I'm
going to create is the table name users
create table users and an SQL you're
able to put this across multiple lines
because you and your statement with a
semicolon and one thing I'm going to
need of course is a user ID and I'm
going to make that of medium in size and
if this does not make any sense
check out the nice Joelle tutorial that
I put up a second ago I'm going to say
that this has to contain a value that's
why the not null is there and I'm going
to put Auto increment in here so that it
automatically generates values and then
I end up with a comma and then everybody
that's going to use this message board
is going to have a username and I'm
going to give that a variable length of
30 characters not null again not in all
forcing them to put something in and I'm
also going to require them to have a
password and I'm going to make that 40
characters and the length even that's
kind of insane now let's change that to
30 not know and then they're also going
to have to provide an email address
a lot of these numbers are just kind of
like guessing and you just normally want
to just guess based off of what you
think will be the maximum number or the
largest in the length and then I'm going
to assign the primary key the key that
is going to represent each piece of data
in this table as user ID then I'm gonna
close that off and I made a little bit
of an error there see I put the ID in
there twice well I want to get rid of
that so what I did was I hit up on my
arrow key and that's going to open up
this little thing it's going to be nice
and handy and I'm going to delete that
little error that I made that and that's
great you can see just by typing de ASC
or described you could actually type out
whole entire thing
there is the nice little table that I
just created I'm going to clear my
scroll back and create the next table
all right so I have to create a table
it's going to contain each individual
message that is posted to my form so I'm
going to have to create a message ID
that's going to represent each one of
those and unsigned not null and auto
increment medium in unsigned not no and
there we're going to store the user ID
for whoever posted this message here on
the screen and then I decided to break
everything into topics so I'm going to
create a topic ID and I'm not going to
have that many topics I'm only going to
have I think six now five so I can use a
tiny int here more than enough and then
I'm going to have to store a subject and
I'm gonna guess that subjects are only
going to be 50 characters in length and
we're going to require that they always
have a subject if they post a message
otherwise it's not going to make much
sense and then message text which is
going to be the actual message that they
put in there and I'm going to use long
text not no because it's not much of a
message if they don't leave one and I'm
also going to put a timestamp on here
just going to record the precise moment
in which they put the message on the
message board that way I'll be able to
better organize and put things in order
based off of when they were posted and
this might need a little bit of
explanation I'm going to put a parent ID
and what this is going to do is allow me
to track replies in regards to whether
this message has a parent meaning the
parent would be the original message
whether this is actually a reply to that
original message because I'm going to
of that capability to reply because
that's also something very common and
here I'm going to make the primary key
message ID and then you could also close
it off like that and you can see there's
that table it's a little bit messy
because of the fact that I'm zoomed in
so far but that's what that guy looks
like clear scroll bat and now I'm going
to create my final table that I need and
it's going to be called topics and the
reason why I'm doing this is to make
this table normalized meaning I don't
want to have duplicate information in
tables and explain that more in other
tutorials tinyint
and I also want to make sure that the
information that I have in one table is
precisely the same as in all other
tables variable number of characters 50
in length since I'm going to be the one
defining these topics not anybody else
you can have this be whatever I want of
course you can provide people the option
to do that this form is basically just
going to be set up in a way that's going
to allow you to understand how it
operates and then make changes from that
point it's not going to set the world on
fire and there is my topic table now if
I want to insert values into the topic
table that's easy enough I just use the
insert command into what Table Topics
and then I have to define what I'm going
to insert specifically into into this
guy actually let's go back okay here's
the topics table so you can follow along
as I actually insert information into
this table so I'm going to go insert
into topics which is the name of my
table and then I have to define
specifically what cell in the table I
want to insert into and that's going to
be topic and then values remember
anything in uppercase letters is SQL and
then let's say that I want to insert
news as a potential topic strange
whatever strange would be celebrity
politics and let's just do one more and
sports and that with a semicolon now if
I would go select everything from topics
you can see all the information that I
just put in there and it auto increment
it and created individual IDs for
everything on screen for me okay so
let's create some users from my database
now normally this is going to be done
through your PHP code but here I just
want to show you how that's done with
MySQL because this is
kind of a review of MySQL so I'm going
to type in username password email close
that all type in values and then let's
just put in me 12 so that's going to be
my username and then I want to generate
an encrypted password that's why I use
this Shah function there and then I'm
going to enter in an email address and I
could actually come in here put a comma
and create a couple more people so let's
say Suzy's f1 to Shah in there you go
and I want to take a look at all those
people in their link you can see there's
the encrypted password there's username
there's an email and they all have user
IDs that are all specific now on for
something that's a little bit more
complicated inserting values into the
message box so insert into message and
I'm going to do user ID topic ID parent
ID subject message text right like that
put values on a separate line just
because it was forced to there and then
what this is going to be user ID is
going to be one so it's actually going
to be me topic ID is going to be four
because that represents sports and I'm
gonna put zero in here because this is
going to represent a message and not a
reply to somebody else's message then
and this is total rambling nonsense what
is the best team opinion and then and
then to show you exactly what it would
look like if somebody replied to this
message being Susie Smith the only other
user on here while two is going to
represent Susie Smith topic is going to
be four still talking about sports and
the parent is actually going to be zero
which is a reference to this message
right here so this is a reply and you
should probably for your subject area
just automatically put in whatever the
subject they were replying to was or you
could of course let them define that and
if you were a Steeler fan that would
definitely be something you'd put there
select star from and you can see here
all that information there's the
timestamp there's a subject of course
it's messed up because I have everything
sort of squeezed in this box but there
it is a little bit smaller you can see
message ID user ID topic ID subject
there's the message text and there's a
timestamp was automatically created for
me and the parent ID meaning it's a
reference to the
same exact message now to finish this
guy off in a zoom in so you can see what
I'm doing again and it's always smart to
have indexes assigned to identification
numbers because this allows you to very
quickly make queries on your database
and really the only requirement is that
these indexes be unique so one thing
that's going to be unique in the message
table is going to be user IDs if you
want to add an index just think about it
is it's going to speed up everything
user ID and you can even put a column in
here and put more of them at add what's
going to be another part of the message
table that's going to be unique well
topic ID is going to be unique so put
that in there and then if you want to
make the message part of the message
table the actual message people leave
easily searchable you add full text
capability to it and let's say I want to
do that to both the subject and the
message text area and that all works
real nice and then if I want to come in
here and further alter the table for
users and add a unique index for
username and email to make sure that
there are no duplicate usernames or
emails which would completely confound
the system that's exactly how I do that
and you can see how this would affect
the database as a whole that's all I
have time for today up next I'll show
you how to integrate this database
system through PHP scripts till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
