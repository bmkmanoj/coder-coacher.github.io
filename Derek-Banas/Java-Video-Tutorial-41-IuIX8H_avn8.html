my Java video tutorial series today I'm
going to show you how to create servlets
using eclipse and if you don't know a
servlet just a web application it
receives requests from users and then
responds via our browser what we need to
do and this is your responsibility is
you're gonna have to go to Tomcat Apache
org and you have to download Tomcat and
I have a link underneath this video that
provides step-by-step how to install
this on either a Mac or a PC or a Linux
box or anything but I just want to go
over this because it's very important
you want to come down here to binary
distributions and if you can't see this
then just view it fullscreen stay HD
video and you're going to want to
download either the zip or the tar dot
GZ I downloaded the Toro GZ because I'm
on a Mac and you're also going to want
to come down here to where it says
source code distributions and you're
going to want to download this zip file
that's right here we'll get more into
how to use that later then what you're
going to need to do is go to eclipse.org
forward slash and downloads and you're
going to want to go to right here where
it says Eclipse IDE for Java EE
developers you're going to want to
install that and just come over here and
pick your version of your operating
system and download it really simple
let's get into the code now to setup a
clip so that we'll be able to access our
new Tomcat server that's very easy to
install the first thing you're going to
want to do is inside of Eclipse go to
preferences and open that up and then
you want to click on server right here
runtime environment right there and then
here you can see I have Tomcat installed
but if you don't just click on add it's
gonna pop up all these different
versions of Tomcat inside of Apache you
just want to click on one of those guys
click on next you're going to want to
browse to the location for your version
of Tomcat click on open da-da-da-da-dah
and click finish in my situation I hit
cancel that another question I get from
you guys all of the time is how to shut
off serializable errors that you get a
lot of times inside of Eclipse I'm going
to go over exactly what all that stuff
means but if you want to show it off
again inside of Preferences in this
situation you're going to want to go to
Java and open that guy up and you want
to open up compiler and then go to
errors and warnings scroll down inside
of this guy and you come right here
where it says potential programming
problems serializable class without
serial version UID and you want to
over here and click on ignore but I'm
going to leave that warning on so now
you have the server running inside of
Eclipse now we're going to actually
create ourselves a servlet and to do
this I'm just going to go into my
project Explorer which is right here on
the left side of my screen I'm going to
right click on it I'm going to go new
and then click on project now inside of
this I'm going to scroll pretty much the
whole way down inside of this directory
here that's called web and open that up
and then I'm gonna click on dynamic web
project and then click on next now I'm
going to give this a name being less
than 41 does just stick with what I
normally do here I'm going to come down
here and click on Apache Tomcat version
7 leave everything else the same and
click on next and then click on next
and let this be lesson 41 let this be
web content and make sure you click on
generate web dot XML deployment
descriptor more on what that means later
on as well and then click on finish so
everything is right here in Lesson
forty-one under project Explorer now I'm
going to come down here where Java
resources exists and I'm going to right
click on that and go new and then go
servlet under Java package I'm going to
type in hello servlets and then this guy
class name is going to be less than 41
just like before and click on next click
on next again here I'm going to uncheck
constructors from superclass and then
click on finish that's going to go in
there and build all of the different
files that I'm going to need to be able
to use now what I want to do is
implement tooltips so that I'll be able
to actually put my mouse over top of
these guys and be able to get some
information in regards to what these
different methods and libraries do to do
that you just need to go into Java
resources and open that up and then come
down here to libraries where this guy is
and then open that up and then come down
here where servlet forward slash API dot
jar exists now I'm going to right click
on this guy and come down to properties
and click on that now remember whenever
I had you download the zip file version
of Tomcat let's go back just so you know
what I'm talking about this guy right
here source code distribution and then
zip this is where we're going to be able
to use that we're going to do is go to
location path and we're going to go
external file and then we're going to
locate that so wherever you downloaded
it to and then you can find it right
here Apache Tomcat blah blah blah blah
dot zip and then I'm gonna hit open like
that and then I'm going to hit OK now
whenever I put my mouse overtop of any
of these little guys
tips going to pop up and it's going to
be provide me information in regards to
what these libraries do that's coming
kind of useful now I'll get into exactly
what all these different guys do first
off you have the Java i/o this just
handles i/o exceptions and have gone
over exceptions many times in the past
and actually whenever I'm here I'm going
to import a new library it's going to be
import Java dot IO dot print writer and
this object just contains a whole bunch
of methods that are going to allow me to
print out to the browser and you have
this guy here servlet exception of
course it handles any type of exceptions
that are triggered by servlets javac
servlet annotation web server lit which
is actually this guy right here this
allows you to clear the configuration
for the servlet and as you can see down
here it just basically says that
whenever somebody goes to my website and
goes the forward slash lesson 41 that
that is the location for this web
application of this servlet and it'll
execute from there so that's all that's
going on with that and you have HTTP
servlet it's just an abstract class
that's used to create servlets you know
of course just like before it has all
the methods and all the things you need
this is just going to handle passing
requests to do get and do post which are
two methods that I'm going to talk about
here in a second and then this guy right
here handles the responses so let's
grill down through here and you can just
see I'm extending hqv see sort of lit
right there and we get into the serial
ID type information and guards to what
that means what you have to understand
if you don't quite get this don't worry
about it I'll get more into it later on
but basically any class that implements
the serializable interface is required
at least by eclipse in this situation to
define an ID number now if you don't do
it Eclipse automatically just gives you
one basically what this does this idea
is it just represents your current
version of said class and if anything
about your class ever does change then
your ID should also be changed and the
reason why these are used at all is just
to remain backwards compatible for
previous versions of said class that's
the reason why they are there so if you
have any questions about that just leave
them in the comment section below I'll
be more than happy to answer any
specific questions then we get down here
to this method to get and the server
calls this method to handle any type of
get requests that are issued from the
browser and this is normally used this
method here whenever you don't need to
gather information from a forum not
saying that it can't be gathered that
way but that's normally whenever do get
is used and for those who don't know
which I'm sure if you guys are watching
this everybody knows where to get
requests is but what get requests just
sends data as part of the URL so if you
just have golf comm blah blah blah blah
blah forward-slash about dot HTML and
then if somebody wanted to pass along
city and pittsburgh like that's what a
get request is all the information is
being passed is passed in you oh Ralph
of course you guys know that
well now inside of this do get since I'm
not going to be passing any information
or receiving any information from the
user I'm going to actually use this
method and the first thing I need to do
is go response set content type I need
to define what type of information on
moving passing here and in this
situation it's going to be HTML
information so that's on though I'm just
defining what type of information is
going to be passed and then I got to go
print writer and this object just like I
said before has a whole bunch of methods
and if it'll allow me to print out to my
browser and I'm just going to call it
output just probably a horrible name but
whatever I'm going to go response get
writer and all the code that I have here
is available also underneath this video
any little URL and basically what get
writer is going to do for me is return a
printwriter that can write to the
browser and then I have to actually
define what type of information I'm
going to print out to the browser so in
that situation I just go output again
print line and then I'm just going to
type my HTML directly inside of here I'm
going to go over neat better ways of
doing this in the future but yes people
actually do this and let's just say I
put an h3 tag inside of there and I just
go hello servlets and then a closing h3
tag and a closing body tag and then an
HTML closing tag and that's what's going
to be passed out to the browser whenever
people come to this web application then
we have do posts and the server calls
this method to handle any put requests
and normally like I said before it's and
used whenever you need to gather
information from say a forum or
something else and pass it back for this
guy to process that's all we're going to
be doing with this guy so far so let's
save it and then we'll come down here to
where it says web content and then we're
going to go web forward slash INF and
we're going to open up web XML and
side of the screen and we're going to
make a couple little changes here this
is what we call the deployment
descriptor and basically what it does is
it defines the URL for the servlet and
also it handles encoding information so
it basically says hey Tomcat this is the
location for my servlet so if somebody
types in you my URL and then they type
in for example and replace this and type
in Lesson 41 then it is going to know
that that is the location for my servlet
after the URL so that's all we need to
change with that guy so we're going to
save him as well and occasionally you're
going to see what's called a restricted
library error whenever it occurs you're
going to know it occurred if something
like that does happen you're gonna come
over here click on your project name
which is less than 41 in this situation
go to properties go click on Java build
path and then you're going to want to
come in here to where it says JRE system
library and then click on remove that
will delete it off of there and it will
get rid of that issue but then you have
to add it back in to add it back in just
click on add library of course remove it
before you try to add it back in click
on add library click on JRE system
library and then click on next and then
finish and it's gonna load that guy in
there and it'll make that error go away
if you do get it but I'm all done I know
it seemed like it was long winded there
but this is actually I can do this in
seconds whenever I'm used to it if I
want to actually run this servlet I just
right click on lesson 41 up here and I
just come down to run ass and then I go
run on server click on that everything
else here is perfectly fine gone next
if lesson 41 wasn't over here in the
configured area it would be here and I
click on it and click on add another
thing that might slip e up and then
click on finish
and it's going to open up everything
just leave everything like this the way
it is and there you see
hello servlets there is our little guy
and actually if I click on this and then
jump over to my browser and paste into
there you're going to see hello servlets
also opens up inside of there there you
go that's how to set up Eclipse so that
you can easily build servlets leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
