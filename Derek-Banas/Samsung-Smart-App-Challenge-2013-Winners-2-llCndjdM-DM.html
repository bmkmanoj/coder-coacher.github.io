last video I did on the winner of the
samsung smart app challenge so in this
video I'm going to go over the other
nine winners so I have a lot to do so
let's get into it first we're going to
take a look at the three second-place
winners and more specifically party
party the judges found this game to be
cute and visually rich in regards to
environment and as you can see here
there are numerous different characters
you can design here i am now doctoring
the color of my character you can swipe
through all sorts of different colors
and you can also swipe through multiple
different bodies connecting to devices
so that people can play party party
together is almost effortless you just
click on party party and you have to be
on the same Wi-Fi network and it just
works the only real complaints this game
got from judges anyway was that it just
needed more events which as we all know
can be easily added to any application
as you can see here we have a little
sprinting game and with a little click
we can get our little game master here
to have us also perform a little jumping
type of game and then we can go over and
ask our game master for a new game and
before you know it we are jumping over
logs which come from numerous different
locations just like the judges said it's
a perfect game it just needs a couple
more events and that brings us to
another second place winner being shared
lens and all the judges agreed it was a
tight clean utility app that worked
seamless on our devices to get it to
work all you need to do is open it up
and just click on tap to share we then
give our device a name and click on
share now and then on a nearby device it
will automatically show up we just have
to pull out the little drawer and just
that easily we're able to click and see
exactly everything that the device's
camera is pointing at the device that
has the shared camera is going to be
able to focus as well as take photos and
of course on our other device that is
sharing that camera we will also be able
to take pictures as well the device that
is sharing the other devices camera is
also going to be able to determine if
flash is used and also the resolution of
the picture
and that brings us to the final of the
three second-place winners being clouds
and sheep now the judges said that the
visual design of clouds of sheep is
undeniably irresistible and as you can
see that's pretty much what it is clouds
and sheep has tons of game mechanics
which are introduced you through these
little signs you see right here as you
can see the first one says throw a sheet
and then the next one says grab a sheet
by the tail and force it to do a barrel
roll but as you play the game not only
will you interact with the Sheep and
collect stars which is pretty much the
object of the game you'll also interact
with the environment to create rain
clouds and with those rain clouds you'll
be able to tap on them to create puddles
for your sheep to drink from and then
later on also grow grass full of flowers
and a whole bunch other different things
there's also the opportunity to mate two
sheep and basically what you need to do
is get yourself some flower seeds and
just click on those and plant them
around on your field then you just need
to get two sheep together that have
eaten flowers and whenever you do are
two little sheep get together and gaze
longingly into each other's eyes and
then a heart appears now all you need to
do is get yourself a cloud push it over
towards the heart and boom you have
yourself a baby sheep there's also
another option that allows you to take
photographs of your sheep if then allows
you to add a custom message to your
picture and then send it to your friends
in numerous different ways and on top of
that you can also if you activate the
gift option send real sheep directly
from your game over to your friends
clouds and sheep is already a big hit on
the Play Store and it's free so by all
means go check it out and we have tennis
academy first you have lessons which is
basically a tutorial system then you
have tournaments with AI and then you
have challenges which let's go and take
a look at the two of those the first one
basically teaches you how to play the
game itself basically what you're trying
to do here is just hit the tennis ball
into the little circles on the screen
and then there's another one where you
hit tennis balls at aliens what really
shines about tennis academy though is
the multiplayer basically you just get
two devices click on multiplayer the
other one click
multiplayer then you're going to pick
whatever character you want to use and
then you are done both devices are
connected and you can start playing and
this Academy is really a fun game and
whenever it's available on the Play
Store you should definitely check it out
and we have another great utility app in
which the judges said the promise of a
translation apps such as this is
immediately apparent and it most
definitely is to start a conversation
between two people you just enter into
your chosen language or name and the
name of your group and hit enter then
somebody nearby picks up their device
clicks on group wing and then they'll
get the option to enter a new name as
well as pick from many different other
options language wise and here i'm going
to pick french and then i'm just going
to type in the group name again
basically to connect to devices all you
need to do is share a group name and
then it's going to be extremely easy to
translate here I'm just going to say
hello and that's going to be sent over
to the other device automatically
translated into Bonjour and here i can
say how are you doing today and again
it's going to automatically translate it
into French and send it to the other
device it just works it's pretty cool we
have zero note which is called a
real-time collaborative writing
application that allows several users to
write on the same document at the same
time and that is exactly what it is
you're going to be able to communicate
through just basic text as well as
you're also going to be able to use your
camera to take photographs and also
access each other's galleries after you
have your note set up all you got to do
is click on information it's going to
give you a share code and a password
which you can define and then you can
just give that to whoever you want to
share the document with they can click
on share note enter the code and the
password and they're in now the neat
thing about this app is any time either
device changes anything in the note both
devices are going to be updated and it's
pretty neat then we have smart audience
which is a kind of a similar app except
in this situation it's going to aid in
allowing audience participation with a
speaker again you just type in the name
and you hit host session then the
audience members are going to be able to
answer pre-made surveys questionnaires
and a whole host of other different
things and then as well you're also
going to be able to store these surveys
which is going to provide easy access
basically what smart audience does is it
allows the audience to in with some
where another interact with the speaker
to make the speech more interesting and
as a person that gives speeches quite
often I could definitely see this being
pretty cool I know if I would whip this
out and basically present this to
audience members to participate while I
was giving a speech I would definitely
have a lot of fun with it now of course
I'm just using silly little things like
where should we eat out but you could
basically have the audience members
answer any number of questions or ask
any number of questions here this device
is basically acting as an audience
member and as you saw it was pretty easy
for that audience member to just jump
right in and they could answer the
survey questions like we have right here
but another thing that's also pretty
cool is we could also provide a way for
them to ask questions here again I'm
acting as an audience member and I can
just click on questions I can type in
pretty much anything here this person is
obviously obsessed with when they're
going to eat we can push that right
there hit okay and then over on the
speaker's device I can then check this
questions and we have a really creative
app called buddy film basically one
device is going to act as a director and
then numerous other devices can act as
cameramen basically just give a nickname
and then somebody else or multiple other
devices click in give themselves a
nickname as cameramen here I only have
one cameraman being Pat but you can see
I clicked on that and then over in the
director immediately I can see exactly
what's going on with their camera and as
you can see I can also host multiple
different cameramen now what's
interesting is the director basically is
going to be controlling what is being
recorded here I'm just recording my
minecraft Lego set but you could record
something a lot more useful and you can
see right here I'm going to click start
recording and it's going to start
recording basically the cameraman has
control of what a cameraman would which
is whatever is being filmed but the
director controls everything else then
of course we can upload the video back
over to the director and then we can
provide a certain level of editing to
all of these different videos which is
really kind of neat and then we have I
gladiator which is a really interesting
3d hack-and-slash type of gladiator game
here you can see there's story mode and
there's multiplayer options available
just like most of these apps you can
play between friends with nearby devices
as the game progresses you'll be able to
upgrade your weapons as well as your
basic skill set as you can see right
here each level is going to have certain
challenges to meet to upgrade your
overall skills and basically then you're
just going to enter the arena and hack
and slash at your enemies and it's been
a lot of fun going over all the winners
or the top 10 winners in the samsung
smart app challenge for 2013 hopefully
you enjoyed this it was kind of fun for
me to do and of course i have a link in
the description underneath the video so

your own please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
