Emacs video tutorial in this one
tutorial I'm gonna show you how to
install on Mac OS as well as Windows I'm
gonna cover all of the basics I'm gonna
cover moving around inside of Emacs
editing repeating region searching
buffers frames shells macros setting up
a programming environment and numerous
other things that I couldn't list cuz I
don't have room everything that I cover
here is available in a cheat sheet that
is in the description underneath the
video and I have a lot to do so let's
get into it
okay so Emacs is gonna work pretty much
the same on Mac OS as Linux so I'm just
gonna cover Mac OS so what we're gonna
do is I'm gonna go to Emacs for Mac OS X
dot-com I found this is the easiest way
to install it and just click on this guy
right here and a little box is gonna pop
up and this is a dmg file so you're just
gonna click on this and you're going to
say open and then all you need to do
here is grab Emacs and drop it into your
Applications folder okay
that is how hard it is to set up Emacs
on Mac OS there is a bug that I'm gonna
show you how to fix but first I'm going
to show you how to install Emacs on
windows alright so what we're gonna do
here is we're gonna go to the new org
forward slash software forward slash
Emacs and we're gonna go right here to
Windows and click on that guy right
there
you can see right here all of the
directions for how to install it and I'm
just gonna click on nearby new mirror
you're then gonna open up your file
system and I am going to go to my C
Drive so there that is
and here is my C Drive and then I want
to create a new folder and I'm just
going to call it Emacs C Emacs right
like that and I can minimize that I'm
gonna come over here and I'm going to
get this version UMAX this zip file
that's right here and click on that it's
going to say if I want to save it and
I'm gonna say that yes I do and I'm
gonna say specifically save as gonna say
where I want to save it and I want to go
into the Emacs folder that I just
created
so that is and I'm gonna leave the name
be exactly the same and I'm gonna click
on save now I can come down here
gone open and you're gonna see all of
the files right here I'm gonna go into
the bin folder and I'm gonna click on
add PM dot exe and I can just click on
extract all yes that's all fine and
everything is running perfectly here
after that's all done I'm gonna be able
to go into my bin folder right here and
click on run Emacs dot exe and there is
Emacs all ready to go and I can make
this full screen and I can go and
increase the font size on it by holding
down ctrl and then clicking on the
letter X whenever I say I want to issue
a control command I'm gonna hold down
control and then click a letter while I
keep it down and if I say I want you to
hold down the meta key that means the
Alt key and this is on Mac as well as on
Windows I know and also on Linux the Alt
key is the Medicaid that's what I'm
referring to so what I want you to do
here is increase the font so I see
you'll be able to see this I'm gonna go
control X and then I'm gonna hold down
control again and I'm gonna click on the
plus sign and that's gonna allow me to
increase the font size so that you'll be
able to see it a little bit better on
the screen now what I want to do is I
want to open up my anit file so what I'm
gonna do there is go control X and
control F and down here at the bottom of
the screen you're gonna see fine file
like this and then down here what you're
gonna do is you're gonna type tilde
forward slash and then follow that up
with dot Emacs and then inside of here
what you're gonna do I'm gonna have a
copy of all this you don't have to
memorize it you're going to paste in
exactly what you see right here and this
is going to allow you to install
packages which is what we're gonna do a
little bit later on and to save that
you're gonna hold down control X and
then ctrl s and that is going to save
your file and if you go down here you're
gonna say that it wrote exactly what I
told it the write once again we can
increase the font size by going control
X and then holding down control and
hitting the plus sign to increase the
size now over here in the Macworld again
control X and ctrl + + + to increase the
size you're going to see all of the
things that I pasted inside of there and
this is where I normally use the Mac so
there's a couple other things like for
example how I set my theme that I
used inside of Emax on Mac and there's
one other thing that you're gonna want
to add on Macintosh specifically and
what we can do here is just come down
here to this line and this solves a
common error I'm gonna say set and
keyboard and coding and system nil and
then ctrl X and ctrl s once again and
you can see that it says that it wrote
that and there you go basically
everything is set up on Windows as well
as on Macintosh and if you want to
change the theme over on Windows let's
just go back over into Windows
I can go meta or alt followed by X and
then down here in the bottom of the
screen so there's no way for me to
increase that you're gonna type in
customize - themes and then hit enter
and you're gonna see a whole bunch of
different themes that open up here we
can increase the size once again and
let's say I want this one I clicked on
that one and there it is it's all set
and I can click on save theme settings
you can do whatever you want you know
whatever you want and then click on save
theme settings what these couple lines
right here are doing is allowing us to
act access a bunch of packages that
we're gonna be able to Stallwood install
which is going to provide a lot more
extra functionality - and to test that
these couple lines of code that we added
right here are actually going to be
working inside of Emacs you might have
to restart Emacs to get this to work
what we can do is I'm gonna hold down
the Alt key or the meta key and hit X
and then I'm going to type in lists
packages and hit enter and you're gonna
see a whole ton of different things
we're going to be able to add and later
on in the tutorial I will actually add
them and then let's jump back over into
Windows and let's verify of that that
works so once again I'm going I might
need to restart this I'm going to test
it let me go MX and I'm gonna go list
packages and enter and I'm gonna look
specifically for something that I'm
going to cover here in a minute which is
going to be closure and I do not see
closure listed as an option so I'm going
to restart Emacs
and restarts Emacs once again I'm just
gonna go run Emacs dot exe
and this guy's gonna pop up and I'm
gonna retype in list packages holding
down the alt X key and then typing in
list packages and if I do that I you can
now see that all my closure packages are
showing up so that I know that my
initialization file was set up properly
all right so now what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna mainly just stick in the Mac
OS version of Emacs and you'll just have
to trust me that basically everything is
exactly the same on both platforms okay
so here we are and what I'm gonna do is
you're gonna have to practice with Emacs
to really get into it what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna cover a large percentage of
it but that's going to still mean you're
gonna have to spend about two hours just
practicing all this stuff but if you
follow along as i su commands and such
you shouldn't have any problem okay so
i'm gonna zoom in here a little bit
first thing i want to cover is how we
can open up health you're going to go
ctrl + h followed by eye and you're
gonna see right here a listing of a
whole bunch of key bindings and i
accidentally just did something wrong
here it's giving me all kinds of weird
errors so what you do is the way to stop
something that you did incorrectly is
you're gonna hold down ctrl + g and
that's gonna quit anything that you may
have done and fix it okay and after I
hit control H I this is going to provide
me with a whole entire help system which
is going to be extremely useful I'm
going to hold down the ctrl key now and
hit V and you're going to be able to
cycle through everything
hold down the Medicare your Alt key and
hit V and you're gonna go back up so
this is one place to bounce around
inside of if you want to see all of your
key bindings once again ctrl H for help
and you're going to type in B and you're
gonna see down here all of the possible
key bindings like the different commands
and such you could ever want to use is
going to be available down here and you
can see that I'm in the upper part of
this is called a frame you can call it a
window you can call it whatever you want
it's traditionally called a frame inside
of Emacs but if you want to switch down
to the bottom part what you're going to
do
is the bottom frame is go ctrl + X and
then hit the letter O and you're gonna
jump down to the bottom frame and then
we can increase the text size once again
no like I said this is going to allow us
to see all of the possible different key
bindings ctrl V once again is going to
allow us to cycle through and you're
going to see a whole bunch of different
things you can click on those and test
them out and see you know what they do
and such but I'm gonna cover most of the
most important things in the this
tutorial so if we want to close that guy
out and what we can do is go control X
and the number 0 and you can see that
that closed that down alright and
there's just tons of these like little
commands you can issue that are so
extremely useful another thing you know
I was talking about bindings and such
let's say you have a + bi binding I mean
these things that I keep talking about
hold down control and then hit X and so
forth
let's say that you know of a command
control X B what that is is it allows
you to switch buffers see each one of
these open frames that you have inside
of here they are referred to as buffers
and they are going to be buffers until
you save them as files so let's say you
wanted to get help on a specific key
binding which is control X B you want to
know what that does
you're gonna go control and you're gonna
go H followed by K and then you're just
going to type in ctrl + X and follow
that up with B alright and now you're
going to see that all the information is
available if you want to jump down into
that bottom frame once again you're
gonna go control X and the letter O and
then we can go control X and ctrl + + +
to increase that and you can see it
provides you with an insane amount of
information in regards to what that
specific command does inside of Emacs
another thing you can do is if you want
to see all the functions for a specific
action you can also do that in a similar
way control h1
again and then we can hit a for example
and you want to see all of the buffer
commands for example you'll go bu FF er
and hit enter and you're gonna see over
here on the right side there's another
frame and it's gonna show you every
single buffer key binding command that
you could ever want and whoops we're
gonna go and control X and the letter O
and now I'm over here and then I can go
and look at all those and once again
control V is gonna allow you to go down
and meta key or alt key V is going to
allow you to cycle up through it alright
so there's a bunch of different ways to
use the help system and if we want to
close down the window that we're
currently and I go to control X and 0
when it closed down the other one
control X and 0 and now we are back here
in the original help file alright so
what I want to do is I want to start
working with different files what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna go and hold down
the medic key and X and I'm gonna type
in sh e ll shell that's gonna open up my
terminal it's gonna work in Windows as
well and I can come in here and use this
just like a terminal now I can go PWD
which is gonna show me exactly where I'm
located inside of my file system I don't
want to be there though so I want to go
someplace else so let's go control X and
o switch back to that and go control X
and 0 to get rid of that so now I just
have my terminal open and I can change
myself to a different file system so
let's go see D and bounce around here a
little bit alright and I'm gonna change
into my users directory and you're gonna
be using like C drives and things like
that inside of Windows but I'm pretty
sure you're well aware of how that's
gonna work I'm then going to change into
my movie backup folder and change into
my and then do LS and see what I got
inside of here you can see ahold of my
different files that I have set up on my
system and I'm gonna change into my
Emacs tutorial directory and then this
is where I'm gonna start working with
some files and what I can do
go control X I'm going to create a brand
new file and then ctrl F and it's going
to have me down here find file and it
has me listed as movie backup I'm going
to change that into Emacs tutorial and
then forward slash and I'm gonna call
this Emacs Tut and you can see new file
showed up down there now as you're
typing there's going to be a whole bunch
of different things you may want to turn
on or turn off one of the things that I
always like to turn on or turn off well
there's certain things there's a hard
rap as well as a soft rap and that
basically just means I'm going to go and
shrink my window down here so that I can
play around this a little bit let's go
and throw in a whole bunch of text now
you can see right here how everything
this is what we call a hard rap because
as it gets to the the end of the word it
just breaks the word off and throws it
down here now if you want to make this a
little bit nicer what you can do is you
can hold down the meta key and X another
thing you can do instead of holding down
to Medici is just to click on escape
I'll do that this time I'll go escape
and X and what I'm gonna do is go visual
line - mode oops go mode right and you
can see it down here visual line mode
visual line mode and I'm gonna hit enter
and when I do that you're gonna see that
this is creates a soft rap which is
going to make sure that the words aren't
broken out and it's automatically going
to resize also as the window resizes and
the alternative that to that is a hard
rap and that would be meta key X
followed by Auto - fill - mode alright
but I prefer the visual line mode and I
don't know why anybody would use
autofill mode but whatever so that's
another thing another thing you can do
is you can shrink text go control X and
then control negative okay and plus
would make it go up and you can see that
you can switch back and forth between
those two different options if you'd
like to you can also change your font
and to do that and you can go meta X and
then you're going to type in menu - set
- font and down here you can see all of
the different font options that are
available pops up you can select
whatever you'd like and I can
close that out so that's how you change
your fonts you're also going to be able
to customize your theme like I showed
you before meta X and type in customize
- themes you can do all kinds of crazy
stuff inside of Emacs you can even open
up Tetris so let's go meta X and type in
Tetris and there you go you can play
Tetris on an Emacs so pretty neat stuff
if you want to switch back to a
different buffer and it's actually a
fully functional game so you can move
this stuff around if you want to switch
back to your other file you're gonna go
control X and B and it's gonna say
switch to buffer and Emacs tutorial is
listed say it is down there and I'm
gonna just click on enter and that's
going to take me right back to where I
was before if you do something in that
you decide you don't want to do like
taking the cheese off of that right
there and you want to switch back to
your you want to undo that you can just
go and hold down the control key and
either the forward slash that's gonna
get it or you can hold down the control
key X and then click on you for undo
I actually prefer control X you because
undo it's easier to remember whatever
another thing he can do is there's a
tutorial system built directly inside of
Emacs to access that control H and then
you're gonna follow that up with T and
there is your tutorial system but I'm
gonna cover everything that's in that
plus a whole heck of a lot more I'm
gonna go to control X and B to switch
back to my Emacs tutorial file then I'm
playing around out now what I want to do
is cover many different ways in which
you can move around inside of Emacs
alright you can see my blinking cursor
in the upper left hand corner what I
want to do I already covered control V
is gonna move you down pages and meta V
is gonna move you up pages if you want
to go to the previous line you're gonna
go ctrl + P for previous say it's
bouncing up and down inside of there if
you want to go to the next line ctrl n
for next so previous and there's next
you're going to be able to jump forward
by words by going meta f4 forward
so very quickly jump around inside of
here you can jump back a word by
Mehta once again and Metta my mean alt
back like that so forward and back
you're going to be able to jump forward
sentences by holding down meta e so FC
jump the whole way through the whole
entire thing right that and you're gonna
be able to jump backwards in sentences
by and I remember that with the e first
sentence okay and then the a you're
gonna go backwards sentences so you can
see how how quickly it's going to be to
move around inside of your different
files you're going to be able to jump in
multiple different paragraphs with what
I call a big forward that's gonna be a
meta and then you're gonna have your
curly braket pushing to it towards the
right and then you can do the left curly
braket to jump backwards and once again
that's the meta key and the backwards
and then you could jump to the very
beginning of the buffer or your file by
holding down the meta key and then
clicking on the less than sign and you
can jump to the end of the buffer by
holding down the meta key and hitting
the greater than sign another thing
that's really useful is to be able to
jump to specific line numbers now to
display line numbers you're gonna go
meta X again and you're gonna go Li and
um and - mode and now you have line
numbers and what's cool about that is
you're gonna be able to go meta
G followed by another G and then jump to
a specific line so let's say I wanted to
go to the 13th line I just could
thirteen and I jump directly there I use
that constantly you're also going to be
able to go forward a character you're
gonna be able to use your arrow keys
inside of Emacs but that's actually once
you get used to max you'll probably use
these shortcuts in any way but you want
to go forward you just hit ctrl F you
want to go back control bat is control B
if you want to go to the end of the line
control E and if you want to go to the
beginning of a line you're going to go
control a alright and those are the main
ways you're gonna move around inside of
Emacs and now I want to show you exactly
how we can jump around and edit files
inside of Emacs now if you want to quit
Emacs and I don't know why you do that
you just go control X followed by
control C and that is
give you the option to whether you want
to save your file or not you can type in
why no da-da-da what I'm gonna do is hit
ctrl + G to cancel quitting Emacs
because I never want to do that and also
you're going to be able to open or
create files of course by going control
X and ctrl F for file execute file is
kind of the way I'd like to remember
that you're gonna be able to save files
by going ctrl X followed by ctrl s for
save and that wrote that file for me we
can also undo things inside of Emacs of
course covered this before but let's
just come in here and type in a word and
then say I don't want it I just go ctrl
X once again whoops cancel that out ctrl
X and you or I could go ctrl X and
forward slash but I don't wanted to do
that so I'm gonna get rid of that let's
go and switch back to our regular one
control X this is going to stay in the
buffer that I'm currently in or close
the other one whatever however you want
to refer to it can also come in here and
I'm going to show you how to do
selections but currently I haven't done
that so if you want to delete a
selection that I have like this you're
going to go ctrl + W and you can see
that one away
I'm gonna go ctrl X and you to bring it
back you can go and delete a whole ton
of different things let's say I want to
delete the word that is in front of my
current cursor position I can do that
I'm gonna go meta key or Escape D and
there you can see KitKat went away
I'm gonna go control X you to bring it
back I'm going to be able to kill every
letter to the end of the sentence by
going meta key cat on and K see all went
away control X undo bring it back
I can kill up through a character here
I'm gonna go and met a key Z and let's
say I wanted to kill the whole way up to
the letter B I can do so and there we
know what I could kill the next two
words in this situation I'm gonna go
escape to and escape D and that took
away two of those words and another
thing it's neat is I'm actually going to
be able to come in here and copy and
paste and
what you can do is I'll actually paste
in this situation the very last thing
that I went and killed and to do that
should go control why you can see KitKat
pops back up inside of there and control
why is referred to as yank of course
you're also going to be able to come in
here and copy things so let's say we
want to copy melted we can do so I'm
going to show you here in a second how
to create what are called regions for
selection so you don't even have to use
your mouse at all which is really cool
so let's say I want to copy melted I can
just go and meta key and W which I like
to remember with the key phrase take
with so I'm going to go Medici W so
there you go
got that and now what I can do is come
down here and paste it and remember
that's yank which is control
y and there's melted and why we refer to
it as yanking is we are you actually
yanking it off of what is called the
kill ring or all of the different pieces
of text that you have killed and you can
actually show all of the text in your
kill ring by going ctrl + H and then
you're gonna follow that up with V and
then you're gonna type in kill - ring
and that's going to show everything that
you have inside of it once again control
X and the letter O to switch to it and
then we can increase the size and you're
gonna see all of the different things
that I have copied and pasted and so
forth and so on
let's close that control X and 0 and now
I'm left with just this guy right here
you can then go and cycle through the
kill ring and copy and paste or yank
each of the different things inside of
it so what I'm gonna do here is I'm
gonna paste the next kill ring item so
I'm gonna go ctrl + y and you can see I
got melted and if I want to get the next
thing on the kill ring I go escape and
followed by Y and you see there it is
escape Y escape Y and you can see all of
the different things that were
previously killed which is really cool
if I want to jump back to the beginning
of the line once again meta key and a
that's gonna jump to the end of the line
and once again I can go meta key and E
and then if I want to delete the
sentence that this is I'm going to go
ctrl X and
backspace and delete the entire sentence
seized as you practice all of these
different commands eventually they just
start to stick in your head
and I remember when I first started
using the Emacs within the first day it
started look whenever you're first
starting off it seems so complicated but
once you start playing around a little
bit it just starts to stick another
thing you can do is you can define that
you want to repeat something a command
numerous different times and how you do
that is you go escape key and the number
of times that you want to delete it so
let's say I want to move up two lines
inside of here how I do that is I go
escape followed by two and then I go
control P and I just moved up two lines
I can move up more lines so we go escape
and four and control P and you can see
that's another way to very quickly move
around on your screen now I want to get
into regions because this is how what's
gonna allow you to select without using
your mouse and things like that so I'm
just gonna come in here and let's say I
want to select the breadless burger
alright what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to set what's called the mark and you do
that by going ctrl + space and then
you're going to want to move your cursor
to the end of whatever your selection is
so I'm gonna come down here to Berger
alright so I got that guy and then I can
go meta key W and that's going to go and
kill that guy right there and of course
I can go control Y and paste it right
back inside of it again I can also
select whole entire areas and how I do
that is I go meta key and H and I like
to remember that by whole you know at WH
o le but I refer to this whole with the
H and that's what how you select that
you could select the whole entire buffer
by going ctrl + X followed by H once
again whole that's gonna select your
entire buffer you're also going to be
able to define how many words you want
to select from wherever you are and to
do that you're gonna go escape the
number of words that you want to select
let's say I want to select four and then
I'm going to go meta key shift at and
then you can see I grab the next four
words
and I can do a copy and paste or do
whatever I want one that situation once
again control W is going to go and
delete that and once again control X U
is going to undo that deletion and so
forth and so on
so there is a way to work with regions
and to be able to copy and paste inside
of Emacs and now I want to cover
searching and replacing now if you want
to search throughout your file here and
for a specific word what you're gonna do
is go ctrl + s for search obviously and
then a word that you want to search for
you can type in cheese for example which
I know shows up and it's gonna show you
all the different locations for cheese
across your entire file you're going to
be able to go and hold down ctrl + s and
it's gonna cycle through all of the
different cheeses inside of your file
till it gets to the very last one on the
screen you're going to be able to also
search backwards to do that that's gonna
be ctrl + R and then what you're looking
for here I'll look for tortilla oops
go and get rid of that alright ctrl G
all right so I'm going to do it again
ctrl R and then we'll the word that I'm
looking for let's go let's go egg
I don't know that works perfectly fun
and then likewise I can just keep
hitting return over and over again or
ctrl R to cycle through all of the
different eggs in the file and then I
can hit return to cancel that search can
also do a search for a regular
expression so let's say I wanted to find
all of the cheeses as well as regular
old cheese inside of here you're gonna
be able to come down here and do that so
I'm gonna go and actually do it right
here search for regular expressions I'm
gonna hold down the control as well as
the medicate and hit s and that's a
regular expression search is what you
see right here right there and let's say
that I want to look for listen cheese a
good one yeah alright so we'll do CH e e
se and then we will follow that up with
an S as well as a star and you can see
that it matched for cheese's as well as
cheese
and you can do any anything you can do
regular expression wise you're going to
be able to do inside of Emax and i'll
let you go and you know play around with
that idea another thing you're gonna be
able to do is do a find and replace to
do that you're going to go escape and
then the percent sign and the quarry to
replace let's say that we want to
replace cheese with and you're gonna hit
enter and then and it's gonna say quarry
replace cheese with see this down here
and we will say something like gooey I
don't even know is that he spoke gooey
cheese I don't know but I'm gonna say
that's that's gooey cheese and you're
gonna say quarter replacing cheese with
gooey cheese and then you're gonna have
different options for that and if you
want to replace just one of them the
first match you're going to hold down
the Y key if you decide you don't want
to replace you're gonna click the N key
if you want to replace all you're gonna
need to go exclamation mark and that's
what I'm gonna do and replace 12
occurrences and now every place that
cheese was previously on the screen
you're going to see that it's now gooey
cheese all right come just using weird
text files here all right so I think
balance back up inside of here and so
there's a whole bunch of different ways
to search and replace inside of Emacs
and now I want to talk a little bit more
about buffers okay so I said before that
we will be able to show all our buffers
by going control X and control B and
there they are I'm gonna go see X and O
to switch over to my other buffer
there's another command that we have see
x equals plus and then you can see those
are all of the different buffers that we
have going to be able to switch to those
different buffers let's say I want to go
to my scratch just by going see X and B
and then I can type in the star symbol
followed by s C then I'm gonna be able
to go tab and scratch is gonna show up
here by default C scratch way down here
alright and I can just hit enter and now
the scratch buffer is gonna show I can
go and see X
let's say I want it too let's increase
the size there is I can then go CX and
followed by H once again to select the
whole entire buffer to do whatever I
would like with it and I already talked
about this before but if I want to
bounce back and forth lets you know what
I'm gonna talk about this as frames
instead so if you want to close your
current window what you're gonna do is
my current window is what I just
selected there
I'm gonna go control X and 0 that's
gonna close it I can close all but my
current window by going see X and one
well that's my current window so nothing
else is gonna close I can move to
another window I'm gonna go see X and B
to open up another buffer and there is
my scratch 1 let's say I would like to
split this buffer I can go see X and 2
CX + 2 and you can see I switched it or
split it that way I'm also gonna be able
to split it horizontally by going see X
+ 3 and you can see how many of these
different windows or frames I can have
on the screen at the same time I can
make the window wider by going control X
and curly bracket I have to go to
control X curly bracket to keep doing
that I can also make it narrower control
X and the opening curly bracket control
X opening curly bracket and so forth and
so on alright and let's go and let's
close everything except for the current
frame um in C X + 1 they're all closed
I'm gonna go see X and B to change to
another which is my Emacs tutorial
alright so there's a whole bunch of
other different ways to work with frames
or windows or whatever you want to call
them and now I want to get to start
getting into some really cool stuff with
like executing shell commands so you can
open up your shell by going meta key X
shell or you can always replace the
Escape key with the medicai if you'd
like to do that instead and there is our
show and I'm gonna be able to switch
into let's actually into it alright so
it's going shrink and this is gonna work
just exactly like all exactly what you
would think it would work like another
things kind of neat is you're actually
going to be able to run shell commands
inside of your phone
so let's go and switch back over into
this I'm gonna go see X n o letter o
let's say you have letters that you
would like to sort or words let's make
it a little bit more complicated so
let's say I have Bob and I have Dave and
Alice and cat all right Cathy and let's
say I would like to sort those I
actually can do it I'm gonna come in
here first off and I'm gonna select this
I'm gonna get control and space to
select it and then I'm going to go meta
key e to select everything downwards
then what I could do is I can go escape
and then the pipe symbol and sort and
hit enter and it's automatically going
to alphabetize or sort all of those
different names down inside of there so
that's kind of cool and I can actually
replace the selected text let's go I
have this selected once again here what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go escape one
escape again pipe and then I'm gonna
type sort and again and you can see that
it went and made that change directly
inside of my file so it's so cool you're
gonna be able to use all these different
shell commands directly inside of your
text files which is just mind-blowing
and and adds so many numerous different
possibilities so that's another cool
thing you do with Emacs not a neat thing
you can do is you can create what are
called macros and basically what a macro
does is it records actions and then it
replays those so how you would record a
macro is you are going to come in and
you're gonna do control X and very often
you're going to see control refer to in
in documentation as C X okay so like
that and meta key X okay
just thought I'd cover that and then you
can have escape X instead and what's so
forth and so on but let's talk about
recording a macro how it would work is
you would go ctrl + X and then your
opening parenthesis and then you're
gonna perform a whole bunch of different
actions and then you are going to follow
that up with control X and your closing
parenthesis and then to run
you're doing - just go control and X
followed by e and that's gonna play your
macro and here I'm going to show you an
example of exactly how to do that so
let's say that we have a whole bunch of
a list with a whole bunch of numbers in
front of it alright and what I want to
do is I want to create a macro that is
going to allow me to switch or is going
to remove these these numbers from each
one of these names how do I do it well
what I'm going to do is go control X and
open parenthesis and down at the bottom
it's saying defining kdb macro I'm then
gonna follow that up with escape Z and
what that basically means is I want to
delete up to whatever I say and that's
going to be the space and you can see I
deleted everything right there and then
to close my macro I'm gonna go control X
followed by a closing parenthesis and
now what I can do is I can go down to
the next line and then to execute the
macro I can just go control X and E and
go down to the next line and control X
and E and it's going to perform you know
that that called it can be numerous
different commands in a row so let's go
and undo that well another thing I can
do is I can actually show my macro that
I just created so I'm gonna go control X
and control K and hit space and it's
going to show the macro down here at the
bottom of the screen so escape z space
alright so there it is and it can be
much more complicated of course I can
then let's go in here and go to control
X undo oops
ctrl G to cancel that and then ctrl X
undo ctrl X undo ctrl X undo and now
what I want to do is play my macro just
by clicking on the letter E so I'm gonna
do it again I'm gonna start off right
here I'm gonna go control X and opening
parenthesis and then I'm gonna go escape
and Z and delete up through the space
and then I'm going to go to my next line
and I'm going to go control X followed
by E and now what I'll be able to do is
just hit E
and no control-x and it automatically
goes and executes that I'm also gonna be
able to save macros let's go to control
X U and how I can do that is go control
X followed by control K and let's say
that a good name for this would be
something like well then type N and it's
gonna say name for last k DB macro right
down here at the bottom of the screen
and I'm going to call this delete line -
number all right and there it is and now
it's saved and I'm gonna be able to use
that macro again I'm right up here and
do I want to delete it and how I would
do that is here I'm gonna go meta key X
and then I'm gonna type in delete line
number like that and hit enter and it
automatically worked so pretty cool
stuff couple additional things I can do
let's say I want to count the number of
words and characters I have here inside
of this I can do so and to do that I'm
going to select this whole entire thing
I'm gonna go ctrl + space and then I'm
gonna go meta key + e to select
everything then I'm gonna go meta key +
equals and if we then come down here
you're gonna see that the region has one
line twenty nine words hundred and
eighty-seven characters I could also
come in and convert all of those to
uppercase by going ctrl X and control
you for uppercase and whenever you do
this for the first time is is actually a
disabled command if you want it to
actually execute you're gonna have to
hit Y very often you're going to see
things like that so I'm gonna hit Y and
it's gonna say enable command for future
editing sessions and I'm just gonna say
why why not and you can see everything
is uppercase now I could then convert it
to lowercase
I'm gonna go control X and then I'm
gonna go control and pipe whoops let's
go back to the beginning
I'm gonna go meta key and a and then I'm
gonna go ctrl + space and then I'm gonna
go meta key and E to select everything
let's change it all to lowercase
I'm gonna go ctrl X and in control pipe
and once again and ctrl L and once again
you're gonna see that this is not
something that this is currently
disabled so I'm going to say yes I want
it and yes I want it in future sessions
and now you're gonna see everything's in
lower
case another thing I should probably
talk about is something I haven't talked
about is this thing that's been on the
screen the entire time this is called
the mode line and as you probably guess
this is the name of your file right here
this is the current line you're on
twenty nine this guy over here there's a
couple different things that could be if
it has star star dash that means that
the file has been modified but not saved
if it just has three dashes that means
it's not been modified if it has two
percent signs that means it's re in
read-only mode and not modified and if
it has one % and a star that means it's
in read-only mode and it has been
modified and then we have fundamental
over here there's a whole bunch of
different modes that are available
fundamental is the default mode then
you're gonna have text mode there's
numerous modes I there's hundreds of
modes I can't cover them all I'm gonna
cover the most common then you're gonna
have text mode which is going to be used
whenever you're mainly going to be
working with text files you're gonna
have paragraph indent text mode which is
when paragraph should be indented
indented text mode which is gonna be
used for outlines and switch and if you
want to switch to a different mode all
you need to do is go escape and X or
meta X and then you're going to type in
whatever mode you want to use so if you
want to use text mode you're gonna type
in T ext - mo de and hit enter and now
you're gonna be in text mode and if you
look down here you're gonna see that
this says text okay so that's how you
switch to all of the different modes
once again if you want to switch back to
fundamental mode you're going to go meta
X and then follow that up with fun
mental - mode and now you are in
fundamental mode as you can see right
there and then we can go and do whatever
we want to do after that
all right so covered a whole bunch of
different things and now what I want to
do is cover how you can program using
Emacs specifically using closes so you
could program with any language inside
of Emacs but what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to show you how to set up closure
today because closure is very often
programmed using Emacs and I'm actually
gonna do it in Windows now everything is
exactly the same in window
as in Mac well actually the shell is
different but what I'm gonna do here is
in essence gonna be exactly the same so
what I want to do is I'm going to switch
over to my other out of the shell so I'm
going to go see X and the letter O and
then I'm gonna install some packages for
closure if you don't remember you can
see all the packages available by going
MX and when I say am of course meta key
and then you got type in list packages
and there you can see are all of our
packages and zoom in here I'm not gonna
go to the closure ones but this is
basically what you need for closure so
to install that what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to type in meta key X and then I'm
going to type in package install and
enter and then install package and what
I specifically want to install is cider
so hit enter and it's gonna go and get
all that stuff and as soon as it's done
and once again you're gonna do exactly
the same thing on Macintosh as you're
doing on Windows exactly the same thing
see that's done the next one I want to
do is meta key X and package install
once again and this time I'm going to
install closure mode and there it is
done real quick and the last I'm going
to do is meta key X and package install
and whoops there it is and projectile
alright I'm not gonna go into all the
details of what all this stuff is just
know that these are what I'm going to
use for programming and closure which is
what I'm gonna do next
now before I do this what I'm going to
do is I need to install another program
for working with closure and that is
called line and Gen and here it is and I
already have Java installed I trust that
you know how to install job of course
and I'm gonna come here and go download
line and Jen win installer and I'm going
to run it and this is on windows this is
how you're going to get it and this is
going to be the directory that you're
gonna want to go to then we're gonna go
next and next and everything else here
is fine so click on
next and install and while that's
installing this is going to be with the
web address that you're gonna go to to
get that but if you just type in line
and genuine installer you'll find it
also and open online help no run a
closure repo now and I'm gonna go finish
now for Macintosh I'm gonna do something
different
first off I'm going to install homebrew
and that's available at brew dot SH and
to install homebrew you're just going to
copy and paste this right here and put
it inside your terminal and hit enter
and it will install homebrew
then after homebrews installed I can go
and get line in Jenin and install it
directly inside of Emacs all I need to
do is go brew install and line engine le
i N ing in okay hit enter and all that
stuff will install for you okay I'm not
gonna do it because I already have it
installed now what I want to do is I
want to actually create a project okay
inside of Windows what I'm gonna do is I
went inside of my documents directory
and you go to change directory like this
and let me go down here CD and then
whatever directory you want to go to
obviously and we'll increase the size of
this a little bit so you can see it
better
okay CD and then whatever your directory
is but first what I need to do so I need
to make a directory and these commands
are different in Mac and Windows I'm
gonna show you the difference okay so
make directory and I'm just gonna call
this Emacs or now let's call it closure
Tut that's doing underscore - cut
alright so that's good so make directory
close your Tut so there that is and then
I'm going to change to the directory by
just going like that and close your Tut
okay oops I type closure wrong change
directory closure Tut and there we are
then what you're going to do is you're
going to type in le I n new app and then
whatever you want it to be called and
then I'm gonna go dir and this is on
Windows again I'm going to change my
directory to close your Tut which I just
created and go dir to see everything
inside here you're gonna change to your
source directory and dir and there
you're going to see closure Tut
directory once again closure tut oops
have to do an underscore oh and also
make sure after you install line and Jen
that you restart your shell to make sure
everything is up-to-date and there we go
and you are and there is your core dot
clj file which is what we're going to be
using so I'm going to switch over to the
top directory or that the top buffer and
then I what I want to do is actually
open that file so this is going to be C
X and C F and then I'm specifically it's
looking in my Emacs directory which is
not where I want to go so I'm gonna have
to change that where I want to go is
exactly what you see in front of you
here so this is going to be C and users
and that is the full directory for where
I have my file at yours might be
different obviously unless you have a
Derrick banners directory and when you
do that's gonna open up this file that
you see right here and now what I want
to do is I want to split my window so
I'm gonna go see an X and 3 and I can
open up a repo here I'm gonna go meta X
and then I'm gonna type in cider - jack
- in and this might take a second to
start up for the very first time
and you can see the reap we'll start it
down here and come in here and I can
zoom in a little bit now I can bounce
around to the different parts here by
just holding and going see X and oh and
there I am in my code window and I'm not
gonna get a lot into closure here but
I'm just gonna do a little simple thing
just to prove that everything's working
so I'm gonna go print line and I'm gonna
say hello and I can actually execute
this line joy just going control X and
then ctrl e and whenever I did you can
see hello prints down here right like
that
and I can also come in here and execute
main if I would like to all I need to do
is come in there and then do a dash and
main and you can see it prints out hello
world so there everything is working on
the windows end and now I'm going to go
in and show you exactly how to do the
same thing on Mac OS okay now we're
gonna fix a common little issue that
some people have with Mac Oh
yes so I'm going to do is go mad icky X
and I am going to install another
package so I'm gonna go package install
in the package I'm gonna install is
exact - path - from - shell and that's
done and then what we're gonna do is
we're gonna open up our Emacs file so
control X control f and dot Emacs and
there that is and then we're just gonna
put this line in right here exact path
from shell initialize and then we're
gonna restart Emacs after we save it of
course then we go meta X and open up the
shell by typing in shell of course then
what we're gonna do is we're gonna go to
our directory where we want to create
our closure file and I'm going to change
to my Emacs directory Emacs tutorial
where I'm keeping all these files and
then to create our closure file you're
just gonna go le i n followed by new app
and closure Tut and make sure there's a
space between le i n new and you know
like that exactly like that hit enter
and there the project has been created
so I'm gonna go LS to see all of my
different files that I have here and I'm
going to go change directory to closure
- Tut LS and change directory to the
source directory and then change
directory to closure underscore Tut and
then LS and there is our core dot clj
file and then I'm gonna switch over to
the other partner EOC X and the letter O
to jump to the other buffer and then I'm
going to open up that file with C X and
F and it's gonna say what file do I want
to specifically get I'm gonna get my
current working directory for my file
I'm gonna go ctrl + space and then meta
e to select this whole entire thing and
then met a w to copy that and then I'm
going to switch over to the other buffer
with a ctrl X and a letter O and then it
goes C X and C F to open up a file and
then I will paste down inside of here
the file that I want open
poor dot clj and there it is and there
is my file and everything is exactly the
same of course and I can down here to
the end and I can execute something so
just to sample this I'll just go print
line again and I'm gonna go hello just
like I did before in Windows and at the
very end of that I can go control X and
control e so actually I'm going to start
a repo first so let's go and do a a meta
X and then I'm gonna type insider - jack
- in and it'll start that up boom there
it is
and we can zoom in here just to make
sure you can see that I'm gonna go see X
and O to go back to this guy and then
I'm gonna go print line and hello and
then I can execute it by going control X
and control E and you can see it printed
hello there and then I can switch back
over into the repo and see X again o and
run the main file it's gonna print hello
world alright so there you go guys that
is a heck of a lot of information about
Emacs hopefully that helps a lot of
people out there and like always please
