affordable websites that search engines
will love so now you're ready to start
posting articles on wordpress there are
two approaches to writing articles on
the web one it is to just write about
whatever you want randomly and of
someone finds your content of interest
the other is to start out with a plan
I'll cover search engine optimization of
websites and another article but for now
I thought I'd introduce some things to
think about as you planned your articles
if you want to attract the large number
of visitors to your site your articles
must be valuable timeless original and
personable by valuable I mean your
article should be a value a large
percentage of people try to write about
subjects that people are definitely
interested in and you can find out what
people are reading about on the internet
in many different areas there's Google
insights google trends technorati and
alexa.com and i have a listing of all
those in the article that precedes this
video by timeless I mean the article
should be of interest to a large number
of people a month from now for example
this is important when you're trying to
create a large content driven website
let us say you wanted to have a hundred
interesting articles on your site if you
create five per day but four of those
files will will have no value to anyone
in a month you're working against
yourself instead of reaching your goal
in 20 days it will take you a hundred
days to reach your goal the original
content is invaluable there are far too
many aggregators of information as it is
and the only way you can make your site
different is to create content that is
not available anywhere else so go get
inspired by something and creates an
original content finally do your best to
talk like a real person try to be funny
tell stories and don't get stuck writing
articles that are aimed only at pleasing
the search engines many search engine
optimization trip tricks are geared
towards making it seem like a website is
of value so do your best to appeal to
real people and then search engines and
by just making a valuable timeless
original site and everything will work
itself out now I'm assuming you're
logged into your wordpress.com account
now at the top of your page drift your
mouse over to the link titled my
dashboards and you'll see one of your
postal Papa are one of your actual Brett
blogs click on it when you do a
drop-down will appear showing all those
blogs you currently have set up the
WordPress you're now going to catch on
page under right now you'll see a
listing of your total posts pages
categories and tags the posts are your
articles pages of first static pages you
created that are more similar to normal
website than blog pages categories refer
to how you group to articles with other
similar articles tags are keywords that
help to find the topics covered in a
post the recent comments section will
list all comments others have made on
your blog incoming links show you other
websites that are linking to your site
that your stuff section shows all of
your recent posts what's hot describes
what other sites are talking about and
the section labeled quick press allows
you to post on to your blog without
thinking about the styling of the pose
you just plug in your title content tags
and whether you want to add media and
hit publish and if you want to save a
draft which will keep others from seeing
the post until a later date click on
save draft and step as you see right
here and this would obviously reset and
delete all the content now if you wanted
to insert an image for example you want
to put your mouse here and click on that
and you can see here you can upload an
image from your actual computer and only
stored on the WordPress servers or click
on from URL which is quite simple just
copy the image address go back in
they've been here am at that URL then
you can type in a title which I
definitely would alternate text image
caption which would show up with the
image itself and then choose what types
of alignment you would like and this
little pictograms here to show you what
that is click on a link damage
and then click on insert into post you
can also find here all files that you
would upload from your computer are
automatically saved in the media library
area and if you would have hit up upload
an image would up here right here you
want to upload a video for example now
if you upload one from your computer
they can be served on the WordPress
servers so that's going to cost you an
additional money or you can post for
free from a URL and what I'm going to do
is actually go here I'm on YouTube y.o.u
tuv com want to double click in this
section right here where the URL is I'm
going to copy it go back into my
dashboard area paste it right here and
insert post and it will automatically
insert that video for you you can also
insert audio if you click here or
multiple other different types of media
and I'll open that up for a second you
can see here JPEGs these are both JPEGs
a ping file falls somewhere between a
JPEG and a gift this is a dobie PDF file
which is a very popular document storage
format dock as well as docx Microsoft
Word PPT pptx PowerPoint and this is an
open office file format at a later date
i'll cover the section here that refers
to add to pole and if you're wondering
additional places that you can find
websites that have video I have a
listing of a multitude of different and
video hosting websites down at the bar
finish off this post i'm going to walk
you through the best way to post your
articles first click on the link labeled
posts on your left side bar and you can
find that right here this will list all
of your current posts and provide you
with the ability to edit them or perform
different bulk actions i'm going to
click on add new right here in this
unlabeled area we actually have a this
is what your title goes i'm going to
open up a word processor copy the title
copy it
paste that in and this has a lot of
formatting options that you see in most
word processors today this again is
where you would insert different types
of media color here is where ever you
would switch to a straight HTML if you
would like to paste that way most of
these are self-explanatory lock quotes
are a little bit on not understood when
used they create whitespace that shows
up before and after the block quote
element and also inserts margins for the
block quote element there's your
hyperlink this would create a hyperlink
this will destroy one this is a more
button or insert more tag when you
decide that you want to cut off your
article you can insert the more tag to
effectively split the post this is proof
rating back in your profile section you
can actually go and change the
information in regards to how it checks
grammar and spelling this is full screen
mode this is not this is the kitchen
sink i currently have it on just brings
up different formatting options here's
some text formatting options underline
if you clicked on this button here you
would stretch your text so that would
look more like a square area and aligned
change the text color import plain text
word race formatting insert special
characters this is you're in dental out
then total opposite is it your undo toll
this is redo and this will give you some
specific help in regards to rich text
formatting i'm going to jump back over
here grab my pose in my word processor
tambien
paste it
don't wanna do we for mounting this is
your excerpt area where you would do a
brief explanation with the actual post
is bound search engines eat these up and
also your readers a lot of trackbacks is
a reference to edit URLs you would want
to list them that you make reference to
in your post up here just consider it a
kind gesture and just lets the other
person know you're using our content to
sign down here if you want to allow
comments allow trackbacks I would
believe those both posted and then at
that point you just saw you want to save
your draft until a later date preview
the article inside of your actual page
and are you sing posting on site before
press close that for now or do you click
on publish and that's basically
everything else your tag area would be
your keyword section and that you would
want to reference to this article I
would definitely put some keywords in
there and then here you'll see the
categories so since I'm waiting brain
what WordPress i would like to click on
the wordpress category and click on
publish and that ends the posting under
kozel wordpress post in the next article
long go deeper into all of these other
remaining areas in the media links pages
comments ratings polls parents users
tools and settings and then you'll know
just about everything there is to know
about wordpress thank you and have a
great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
