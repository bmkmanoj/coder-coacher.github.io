affordable websites and search engines
will love today in this post i'm going
to be talking about the media links
pages comments and ratings sidebar
options i'm assuming you are currently
at wordpress.com and that you have a
blog setup from one of the previous
posts click on one of those right now on
your mind ash boards first off going to
go over into the median length and click
on that can see here you can perform
multiple all actions either to delete
these these images if you'd like and as
well you can just by clicking on edit
you can see descriptions that i've typed
in in regards to these different forms
media that i uploaded in this case a
jpeg of elton breath pounds brown and if
you click on add new you'll be able to
grill easily go through and add any
additional other images or files that
you would like just like we cannot
select automatically uploads it and then
you can type in your title your
alternate text that would appear if the
image is not available caption and ended
description like i said for search
engines love content and this is another
additional area you can add some content
and just click on save all changes and
then those files will be available for
you to use your making book and that's
basically all its to it now we'll move
on to the links area see here i only had
in one additional link by clicking on
add new i can also by clicking over here
on link categories not only see link
categories but also create a brand new
category as you see here just by typing
in information along with a description
and click on add category and here is
one of the categories the only category
i have set up currently but if i did i
could perform bulk deletes on those
linked categories now if we click on add
new
first off I would give my lake a nice
name I wouldn't put whatever web address
would take me doodling I would give a
description I would either put it in my
generic blogroll category or create a
new category we go down here and target
I almost always click on the nun target
and what this the reason why is I it
will keep the link a person clicks on
from opening a brand new browser what
people don't like that down here I would
describe the relationship if I have one
with the person I'm liking to you would
type a URL to a small image address what
this is referring to is if you would put
the URL of an image here that little
image would appear next to your link and
if you type in the address of an RSS
feed for the link wordpress displays the
link to the site's RSS feed and RSS
stands for Really Simple Syndication
with an RSS page you can share the
headlines from your blog by adding the
rssp it to your blog your users can
easily gain access this information at
the same location as the length and in
the vlog you can add any additional
information about the link and then you
can give the link a rating if you wish
and if you go to the top right hand
corner drugs a month I can just click on
a blank and that links automatically go
and be creative one and that's basically
all there is to know about that down in
the comment section as I refer to
earlier this is a brand new blog i set
up if people were commenting on my
articles I could sit here in and decide
if I wanted to approve them and allow
people to see them mark them as spam or
delete them by just clicking here on
move to trash
and you can create pages on your site
that do not change these are like
traditional website pages they are
called static pages and you create these
pages by clicking on pages in your left
toolbar and and if you click on add new
you're actually going to be taken to an
editor that will allow you to create a
new page and I'm going to take you
through process right now and sell some
blips let's jump over into my actual
blog and let's take some content this is
just for the example so I don't care
what it looks like give it a title and
then paste some text right in there
allow comments allow trackbacks this
intro as long as if we go open let's
zoom in here over here in the attributes
section if you leave this set as main
page this also is going to show up in
your menu ball so let's I talk to it you
can put any information in there you can
put images video audio different links
to media just like you did whatever you
were doing normal clothes except this
will never change click on publish
and it's done now if we jump over here
to visit site you can see intro is right
there so this is really great ways that
you can create static pages that align
back to go in your menu bar allows
people real quickly to get to whatever
information that they want to and that
is basically it that's the media link
the lakes link the page link and the
comments link and don't go into the pole
area or later date but now you are just
about an expert in WordPress next time
we're going to cover appearance users
tools and settings and then you'll know
all there is to know about workouts your
comments are welcome thank you you have
a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
