on how to make either healthy or
meatless porkchops now by porkchops I
mean something that looks like this I
guarantee you if you feed this to
someone they will not know they're not
eating a pork chop as you can tell this
is cold but as you could tell it is very
very meaty right through and it tastes
exactly like a pork chop but if you want
to see what the insides look like that's
what it looks like that's about the only
thing that might give it away to
somebody is very very obvious and
they're staring at the thing this is a
pork chop very healthy so instead of 286
calories 18 grams of fat 93 milligrams
of cholesterol and 30 grams of protein
you're gonna get 120 calories point 5
grams of fat zero cholesterol and 23
grams of protein so let's get into it so
the trick to making fake pork chops is
this right here
vital wheat gluten yes today I'm gonna
show you how to make what is called
sittin and it is the basis of most fake
meat that you eat that you think is real
meat the reason why it's used is it has
a texture very similar to me so to start
off in food processor or you can mix
this by hand either way for the process
a lot easier and please don't waste your
time trying to make regular sit an it
takes forever and I see no difference
between this and regular homemade satang
so there's one and a half cups of vital
wheat gluten and all it is is flour that
has all the starch washed out of it then
we're gonna add some spices of this guy
we're gonna put in 1 TSP of garlic
powder there you go
one and a half teaspoons of cumin there
you go you don't have to be very exact
about this believe me the taste is going
to be pretty overwhelming it's a pork
chop I mean it's not taste like a pork
chop and here's about 1/2 teaspoon of
pepper made this whole bunch of times
never was terribly exactly that ended up
saying every single time and then you're
going to put in a half a teaspoon of
chili powder there you go 1/2 teaspoon
clean out off then to this you're gonna
add 1 cup of water so just dump the
right in there and then to that you're
gonna add three tablespoons of either
liquid aminos that's what I used is I'm
allergic to MSG or you can use tamari or
you can use soy sauce so three
tablespoons of that and wait until you
see what this looks like after it's
mixed something to behold slam the lid
on top your food processor let it go
and after you're done you're gonna open
this up and you're gonna start seeing
why this is used as a meat substitute
gonna dump it out here and the texture
is extremely similar to the texture of
meat
now we're gonna be boiling this to make
it a little bit softer but you can see
right here this is what Satan looks like
say it's real call me it's terribly
gummy now of course when it boils down
it's gonna get more of a consistency
like meat and you're basically going to
with your suit and it's gonna roll this
out and you can make it about as big as
you want or cut out as many cutlets as
you want or do whatever you want with it
but basically what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna cut it into six pieces so six
cutlets is what it's referred to as so
just cut it in half and then make your
cutlets there you can say so it's sort
of already looks kind of like meat
believe me it's gonna taste exactly like
a pork chop there you go so you got
another piece of meat ish type stuff but
then you're gonna get yourself another
one and another one and then you can
form this out here like that
very gummy but I promise you I guarantee
you'll not be able to tell it's not pork
chop there's another one smash that up
make it sorta lit with a rolling pin and
there you go so there's the seitan now
the next part you're gonna boil your
Satana this is pretty simple you're just
gonna turn this on high and then to that
you're gonna add yourself three
tablespoons of either the Liquid aminos
this stuff or tamari or soy sauce
whatever you want to put in so this is
five cups of water 3 tablespoons Liquid
aminos and then before it even starts
the boil does anything you're gonna take
your little cutlets that you've cut out
and you're gonna throw them in that pan
and I got this on high little min there
right like that they are try to make
sure they're submerged but that's not
necessary and then you're gonna let this
cook until it comes to a boil and then
you're going to turn it down to about
30% on your oven and then you're gonna
cook it for an additional 60 minutes 30
minutes into that you're gonna flip them
over so bring this to a boil and then
turn it down to 30% on your stove top
and let it boil for 30 minutes flip it
and in 30 more minutes and it'll be
ready okay so while you have your
satanic over there in that water liquid
aminos soy sauce concoction now we're
going to make the wet binding that is
going to make up the crust for our pork
chop so you're gonna put 1/3 a cup of
water in there then you can measure out
3 tablespoons of mustard I'm just using
this Grey Poupon but any type of Dijon
type of mustard is what's recommended oh
that's right about 3 tablespoons and
then to that you're going to add in 3
tablespoons of flour and this is going
to be what you're gonna dump your
cutlets in before you put them in the
dry part of the crust you're gonna make
here and then what are you gonna do
you're just gonna stir this up this is
gonna add a lot of taste to this guy and
actually this is good for cooking in
regards to a batter for a whole bunch of
different other types of food this
batter is very very good you just wanna
get all the lumps out of it by that I
have about about about pretty simple
stuff and there you go
okay so that's ready you just got to
keep moving this stuff's easy to make
all right so now you want to get
yourself what you're gonna dunk in your
dry ingredients or your pork chop and to
do that you're gonna need 1 cup of flour
these are 2 1/2 cups
oh say I've got so I get to those so you
want 1 cup of flour then you want to get
yourself some nutritional yeast and you
can order all this stuff off the
internet
I don't provide links because I don't
want you to think I'm just doing us to
get you to buy stuff off of me through
affiliates it's really easy
oops there you go I dumped some of that
in there that's right around 1/2 cup
like I said you don't have to be
terribly exactly this stuff now with the
spices you should but other than that
you're pretty cool today you want to get
yourself some cornmeal or I personally
like to use masa harina corn flour but
you can use regular cornmeal it doesn't
matter whatever you got and to this I'm
gonna get 2 tablespoons so 1 &amp;amp; 2 there's
2 tablespoons masa harina or regular
cornmeal whatever you want then you're
gonna get yourself some baking powder
and you gonna put 1 tablespoon of that
that's just gonna make everything rise
up so tablespoon of that and then it
comes to your spices now again about a
half teaspoon of pepper you can put
ground pepper in there it doesn't really
matter there you go
1/2 teaspoons of cumin again so this is
1/2 teaspoon measure so 1 and 1/2
teaspoons there you go then you're gonna
get yourself one-and-a-half teaspoons of
garlic powder but the doctor died 1 2 3
that's 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of garlic
powder then you can get yourself 1
teaspoon of paprika 1 and 2 so that's 1
teaspoon of paprika and now you got your
dry mix and your what mix so we're just
gonna go and get our dry mix and stir it
up real nice and then you're gonna go
and get yourself a pan to fry all this
stuff now of course I wouldn't start
this until I've just about had all of my
cetain all boiled up and inside here you
could bake this if you want I have never
tried it so I'm gonna give that a go but
all the more fat here remember I'm
replacing a pork chop that's normally 18
grams of fat with a pork chop that's
literally zero fat so any little bit of
fat you get I mean this is like one and
a half tablespoons it's not like the
pork chops gonna suck all that up and
what am I gonna do I'm gonna turn this
down to 6 and like I showed you
previously we get himself maybe a little
bit of flour drop that over here inside
now whenever that starts to bubble up
then I know I'm ready to start frying
this stuff remember 60% on the stovetop
and while waiting for that this is what
this italics like after I've boiled it
for 60 minutes or an hour or whatever
you want there it is
of course it's gonna be hot I'll let
this sit aside for a second in my pan
looks like it's bubbling just a little
bit here so that looks like it's about
ready so to make my pork chop so I just
take my wet ingredients we'll just make
I'll throw that pork chop in there or
that's a pan chop or whatever you want
to call it cutlet don't get both sides
and then we're gonna go into my dry
ingredients and this is how simple is
those it's pretty much like boiling the
stuff as the hardest part
flip it over a couple times make sure
it's nice and evenly coated
take it drop it in your pan now you're
gonna let this cook for about two
minutes per side
actually let it go for one minute ya see
two minutes will be a little bit better
that's what its gonna look like after
one minute if you have the exact same
make and model of stove but I have flip
it over and there you go that's after
one minute on the other side and there
you are so basically two minutes each
side and you got yourself a working pork
chop like I said I guarantee you eat
this thing you're not gonna be able to
tell the difference it tastes exactly
like airports ah there you go
healthy meatless pork chops leave any
questions comments requests or anything
