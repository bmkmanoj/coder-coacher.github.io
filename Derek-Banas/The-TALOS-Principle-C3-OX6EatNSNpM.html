guys let's see here I have to turn my
volume up on my end
umm lots of questions oh yeah people
have been telling me that this level is
like the first level that basically
requires you to draw a map and so that's
why I said the hardest so far because
people are like prepare some paper
because this one's gonna be tough so
let's do the console after I either get
frustrated or I solve this level so it's
up exodus what's up Anthony what's up
all you guys alright let's see this is
one of those time capsule things can we
ever truly fully understand the divide
between our biology and our intellect
how much is nature how much is nurture
it's my intellectual capabilities and my
knowledge were replicated in a machine
would that machine be me would it be
human and what would be more humbling to
my ego if the answer was yes or if the
answer was no what if I'm making too
many assumptions there's no time to
worry about my ego now there's work to
be done
hmmm alright so there was our time
machine
this is jammer quarantine where is the
jammer being quarantined oh okay
there's the jammer oh no this is not a
gaming channel actually this that's why
I was gonna talk to you guys um I don't
know how many you saw random livestream
Friday I've been mixing my channel up
just to make it more fun you know and do
some more videos different topics so
forth and so on and so that's why I
started doing one random livestream
Friday and I'm gonna continue doing that
because I love doing that but no I'm not
going to be eating weird things every
Friday actually I don't plan on eating a
weird thing and in a video for quite
some time like months mm-hmm the idea
for random livestream Friday is to do
live streams like a lot of you guys
don't know this because very few people
have been watching my channel since the
beginning um in the past my channel was
very very diverse I covered so many
different topics that's why I laugh when
people are like why don't you only do
programming videos cuz that's what you
always did and I'm like actually no I
yeah that became the thing I was known
for but that's definitely not the only
thing I ever did I have tons of videos
on tons of different subjects and people
don't know that because I'm mainly known
for programming videos but so I sort of
missed I got in it in a position where
all I was doing was programming videos
and I wanted to get back to my roots and
sort of do fun videos you know I mean
I'm still gonna do programming it is and
I'm actually working to make my
programming videos more fun like the
next big tutorial series I do is going
to be video games
like using unity and mana game like
indie developers use so you know that is
where I am heading and that's gonna
start happening pretty soon what I'm
guessing here is I'm supposed to put can
I get this fan to work oh I should do
that what I'm guessing is yep that's
what works I'm gonna try to see if I can
hit all these with this thing let's see
so yeah oh it's somebody yeah guys tell
me if somebody is irritating in the chat
I will ban them I'm not putting up with
people being banned fans my next
learning one is f sharp and it will be
up on Wednesday and it took forever to
make like I mean literally forever it
was a very very hard one to do alright
so hmm see what's the best way to do
this
took a long long time I'm probably gonna
have to put all these done at once so
and then after that Swift the new
version of Swift and Swift forests not
coming out until like fall maybe winter
and people been asking me for a swift
video so I'm gonna do it
and whenever Swift floor comes out then
I'll do that if there's interest so
anyway so in the act of going and doing
new things and trying to keep my channel
exciting and different I was thinking
maybe I would make Monday today um make
her Monday and make stuff like just
completely rant and I mean when I say
random crazy things I mean literally
anything anything I could do just
completely weird stuff so I don't know
what you guys think about that but oops
I need something to open that no no
oh well I let my jammer all right I
don't know what you got and I'm gonna
and I'm gonna start making video games
on wet Wednesdays and Saturdays like
I've always been doing and I'll continue
playing these games on Tuesdays and and
Thursdays and if I get you know if I
can't come up with an idea maybe I will
also play games on one of the other
tastes I don't know what you guys think
about that tell me about that yeah I
enjoyed I loved making that video on
Friday it was a blast but yeah I'm not
going to eat random things all the time
that's just not my bag but what's the
hardest functional language no I don't
mean I'll try to make cool stuff I don't
want to give it away I already know what
my first couple videos are gonna be and
I know there is no way on earth anybody
would guess what my what I'm planning on
doing for my first like maker video like
there's no way anybody would guess it
it's so out there and crazy and it's
based off of requests that I got alright
so I got the piece awesome that
supposedly is not the hard part the rest
of them are supposed to be hard so I got
my piece of paper here and I'm ready to
draw a map if I have to what should I do
next oh here's this
you couldn't make yeah electronics
Monday make yeah like I'll build a
transistor radio or I'll build like I
get things about okay three little
connectors and a fan like make stuff
like anything yeah that's what I'm
talking about I'm talking about it'll be
a live stream and it'll just be like a
video the starts and the goal is to
create something create something you
actually call it creators creator Monday
I don't know
as you could see in my last I don't know
if anybody how many of you guys I know
some of you guys were here you know that
I can paint and you know I could do like
illustration and I'm talking like
anything I'm talking about making things
I'm talking I'm not talking just like
maker stuff you know I'm talking about
just making all kinds of crazy stuff
well that's gonna do the fan which I
don't need
know what to do well I could just you
know what what I think I'm gonna do
there's my piece that I need right there
I'm gonna take this and I'm gonna put
this on here let's see how big okay so
this is a big one and there's a prism I
think what I'm gonna do is very quickly
draw a map of this area and I'll answer
a extremely weird question that I got
well I guess it's just different okay so
when I did my livestream my last
livestream one of you guys was talking
about lab-grown meat if you don't know
the last livestream I did was on beyond
meat which is like a veggie burger but
it's a veggie burger that is very very
similar to ground beef so anyway what do
you guys said that they are working on
true lab-grown meat and basically what
they do is they stick like some protein
from a chicken into a machine or
something I'm just assuming this is a
real thing and it was a philosophical
question and it like spits out fake I
guess chicken I don't know and this
person said if they actually did that
would I eat it well I'm not I'm like one
of those I don't know a lot of you guys
know this or not but I am a vegan but I
am NOT like a vegan that likes to tell
everybody what the I could care less if
you eat meat then that's fine I'm it's
not my place to tell people what to do
so
and people always ask me like why I
became a vegan it's very simple I grew
up on a farm and it was just weird for
little me to eat the animals on the farm
like little me didn't understand eating
the animals on the farm and I didn't
like it and so like you know I saw these
animals getting butchered and things
like that very humanely on farms they
butcher of things a lot more humanely
than they do in factories and so forth
so it was just weird for me and so I
didn't like eat meat when I was a little
tiny little untidy and then just I was a
vegetarian for forever and about four
years ago I stopped eating dairy
altogether and the reason I did that is
because my daughter is lactose
intolerant so there you go there's the
great mystery it's not I'll show you
what I'm drawing here as soon as I get
it done if you want to know what it
looks like to do so there you go that's
my whole reason why so I wouldn't and I
don't really like the taste of meat like
if you go your entire life and don't eat
meat you just you just don't really I
don't like candy and you know just
because when I grew up I never had candy
so I never ate it so whatever that is
okay here's my rough sketch if you guys
want to say it I don't know can you see
that it's just a rough sketch just sort
of help me keep this gigantic level in
order so that I can sort of understand
what I'm looking at okay so
hmm so what I'm thinking I'm gonna do is
do what I did before and you guys have
any questions do the witness what are
you talking about I've already played
delete us do I take supplements no yeah
I don't take any supplements zero
all right so anytime we have a situation
in this game there's like certain rules
I keep in my head just from playing this
a whole bunch of times anytime there is
a fan in a position like this in the
past and there's blocks which I saw
blocks that means that it's gonna you
I'm gonna have to put a block on it put
a prism on top of it and then hitting
multiple connectors so I know that's a
role that I'm hoping they stick with so
I'm using that as the basis of how I'm
gonna climb through this
oh really I didn't knew that one of you
guys said that if I stand on the fan it
will actually show me a whole entire
thing well don't do that yet
cool thank you I didn't think of that
that's common sense and I don't have any
oh wait a minute I don't have a block
yet so it doesn't matter all right
there's a block right there though okay
so I'm just gonna refer to the map to
try to figure this out so any other Reds
know
no thumb other than that red which I'm
not gonna use that one right now so
there's that okay I can get the block
and put the Block on this and then I'll
get the prism
and then let's go look and see what one
of you guys told me to do let's just do
this okay so I'll take that off of there
and then I'll be able to see everything
cool thank you for that tip I should
have thought of that oh oh I can't stand
on it without the lock that's cool
they block it whatever I got the block
here anyway so awesome I can see
everything now
Wow that helps a lot you know what I bet
you that was probably one of the things
you were supposed to discover that I
didn't know about okay so that's sweet
awesome
okay so this Chris got a lot easier I'm
just writing down a couple little
thingies here so I can see what these
jammers aren't things like that okay
wonder if I fall fair how hurt nope
so alright well so we know a little bit
more about what we're doing here
don't worry I'm gonna try to do really
cool games I'll do my best
anyway
you see here where I'm trying to go
sorry this is just a really complicated
alright so let's go get this put that on
here yeah these things getting this big
is kind of crazy okay so I got who likes
another prism in there so let's try like
a prison this and this and this okay
maybe I was wrong maybe the fan box
thing was a distraction and I don't
actually even need it we will find out
there's another one can i connect to
this yes I can also
yeah I'm not gonna really bother with
the Stars because everybody's has told
me that it doesn't really it's just it's
ridiculously hard and basically all it
is is you run around trying to trying to
find the stars more than anything
they're like hidden everywhere and that
doesn't sound lonely like fun to me so
and they are and the stars also I guess
have like nothing to do with the story
so you know it's just like there is an
extra challenge which is Cole that they
you know went through the effort of
doing doing that but you know me
searching for stars and a video live
stream doesn't sound like something I
would want to watch so yeah I think I
have to use this now I already found
some of the stars what am i drinking
it's mainly ice actually see there's a
little bit of water and there it's a
what do they call that a psychosomatic
thing ie my brain has been trained at
any time I am trying to solve something
like a problem or something the chewing
ice makes it easier for me to solve
problems I know it sounds crazy but it's
useful
all right so can I go back with the
jammer because I need to get through
here and then get on top of that so I
think I need a box to get that and I
think my original idea is indeed true
that I'm going to have to use the prisms
to use a prism anyway
to light up multiple things like you
know very intelligent how I phrased that
huh
all right so how many of these things
can I get well okay so from that area I
will be able to hit this I might be able
to hit that right yeah I'll be able to
hit this so can I go into the other
rooms
I plan on climbing the tower somebody
said do I plan on staying faithful do I
plan on climbing the tower
I plan on climbing the tower I wonder if
I can hit that looks like I could but I
can't hit that one let's see if I'm
right here so I'm gonna take wanna take
this well I'm gonna try to hit that that
and when I pick it up it's gonna go away
all right I think so there's no way to
do it is there
what's definitely our hit now
hmm well I I can put the box on her I
guess what's out there doing my best
here
okay so or if I should use the jammer to
get one more of these or not
I don't know let's just try this this is
getting pretty crazy itself so let's
just try doing that and then this and
then this and then put this on top up
there mm-hmm
I need a prism what'd I do with a jammer
oh there it is
I need one of the other prisms this is a
tough one
hmm what I bet I could hit that one also
now I can't I need something there hmm
well let's try getting this it's not
gonna hurt in it and then I can go like
that and like this hey there goes and
now I should be able to take it away and
I did
alright let's so many of these things I
opened that's open and let's put this
here oh I can get this box
books I don't know that I'm doing the
right thing here by the way but yeah I
answer the question about the the guy
had about the chicken yeah I think I did
oh he asked another question he said if
this is actually sort of an interesting
question
he said if people didn't have didn't
have any problem eating like lab-grown
chicken well would they have a problem
if they throw a chunk of human meat in
there and they used that and I thought
that was kind of an interesting question
I wouldn't eat either one just just my
opinion on that oh whoops
open up yeah I don't know about you guys
if you guys could would you have any
problem if they it's not like they're
killing people there's like let's say
there's a machine this is somebody
else's question this isn't my question
he said if there was a machine and you
you could stick a piece of any type of
meat into it and it would like replicate
it or something in some way would you
have any problem eating it like if it
was chicken or if it was beef and then
he was like at what point would you no
longer eat it like some people he a this
is actually kind of my question like
when would you draw the line and we're
assuming that everything tastes
delicious
you know everything tastes wonderful
when would you draw the line would you
draw a line at like cat meat now we're
not killing an animal we're just getting
meat from one animal and like let's
let's let's take killing completely out
of it let's say there's a cat that has a
leg amputated and you're going to use
that meat from that cat in your machine
would you have any problem eating that
and the cat meat is delicious
I can pretty much guarantee you captain
cat meat is very um
vicious but let's just assume that would
you eat it that's kind of a good
question I like that yeah you can't eat
it oh yeah there you are Bernard there
you are
yeah you can't eat human meat it gives
you kind of something very similar to
mad cow disease so you can't really eat
it but let's assume mad cow disease for
eating for cannibalism doesn't exist
would you do that that's a good question
I like that question so anyway I feel
like I'm sort of on the right idea here
but maybe I'm off by a little bit well
this guy I can go through the window
with that so that might require me yeah
it's gonna require me to get my jammer
but I can definitely save that oh I need
this box in here don't I I think I do
let's just put it there so we'll move it
there now
I don't know what would happen I don't
know what I don't know what I mean I
obviously I don't eat any meat so I have
no idea what human meat tastes what a
crazy thing to talk about but you know
you guys asked me so you know I'm here
all right so I can get rid of that prism
so I have to go am I gonna be able to do
it
I might not be able to
yeah I'm not gonna I can't go through
the gate but I can do this yes I know I
can get this one and I can get that one
Hey all right
is there something I can't get this one
though but it doesn't matter because I
just need this let's take that now it
didn't you know whatever just I need to
keep it this open so let's try that and
then I could take two of them right I
don't know I can only take one of them
let's take that and then I need to get
this one I can't shoot through the gate
mm-hmm that stinks
whoops that already got that
like I'm missing something what's my
favorite vegan meal does the is one of
you guys what's my favorite vegan meal
mmm I think my meatloaf is my favorite
thing I make a vegetarian meatloaf
that's made out of something called
textured vegetable protein and I think
that is my favorite vegan thing to eat
you know that's not normal me I just
like regular vegetables and things a lot
you know there's all kinds of food I
like a Chipotle tonight my wife wanted
to go my kids wanted to go so I went
that's it's like a once a month thing
oh this is this is hard I don't know why
I'm being so stupid
I don't believe your meat you're making
in a machine would a vegan would
consider it to be vegan meat no I don't
believe they would just the mere fact
that it's real I think most vegans would
not most people are vegans for ethical
reasons I believe I'm not so talking to
much this extremely complicated puzzle
and I'm talking my head off let me sit
here I know I'm forgetting something
hmm looking at my mouth
this is a tough one
I wish there's a way that I could hit
ooh yes this is work
and that one I don't know that that
solves anything I really don't think it
solves anything
I think it oh yeah it does
okay so then pick that up
mmm maybe it's awesome am I gonna fall
backwards off this hill whoo that
doesn't look good
I can shoot through trees
then maybe I can't shoot through this
oh oh I don't need to shoot their trees
I can shoot right here I study another
prism sorry guys this is just really
hard I know I'm missing something
yeah I wouldn't be surprised at some
vegans would would like the super meat
thing you're talking about
I wouldn't for health reasons I don't
know something that's grown in a lab I'm
kind of assuming probably isn't very
healthy that's like that beyond meat
thing it was it wasn't healthy there's
nothing healthy about it
and one of you guys said to start over
and I think I might actually be the best
way to do it because I have a idea what
I need to do and I think I got myself in
a position of making it actually harder
to solve these puzzles then easy
well wait a minute
there's a box in there maybe that's what
the box is torn
let's see if that's true
it's the box meant to get this high
enough to hit that and the other thing
let's see
okay yeah I think I might be on his own
okay so put that there I just have to
move this up a little tiny bit and then
and this
there
all right my mother here I think I might
did it yeah did it
wow that was hard but I did it yay look
at that thing I'm glad I didn't start
over
wow that was a tough one
oh really a lot of people one of you
guys said that I solved it in a
completely different way than you're
supposed to solve it okay that's cool
I mean that doesn't surprise me I mean I
like I said I've never beaten it so I'm
sort of you know just going it's kind of
hard to talk and do this also at the
same time whether top whether top what
does whether top have to do there's no
new puzzle okay so there's a box I
wonder if we can do our little trick
with a fan throwing me up in the air so
I can draw a really good map there is a
jammer behind a door
hmm don't know ooh lucky there's a star
over there or if I get it no no try it
I'm gonna try to draw just a really
quick map here just to get a rough idea
what's going on it's pretty
straightforward so I think it might help
me a lot it's just basically this that
there's this over here yeah this'll just
take me a second because without a map
the last time I don't think I would have
solved that last puzzle last puzzle was
window over here right yep and there's a
window there so window anytime there's
windows they normally have some sort of
window related shooting things through
windows and there's a gate and then
there's another gate right yes
okay so very brief little map you don't
need to say all right so let's go back
here there's a jammer back there there
is a ladder there is a plate looks like
there's a fan there is a is there
another plate or a fan back there looks
like it there's obviously the connector
as it played boxes okay and what do I
have
Oh looky
I can graffiti on this seek counsel has
anyone managed to solve this one I wrote
that well looky a messenger must be
awakened first it's a clue
a messenger must be awakened at first
well the only thing I can do is this so
let's do this now what would I want to
do first
thinking this okay
and now I got a person okay so I got a
prism works I'm 42 years old
Oh somebody said that if I get a bunch
of stars it allows you to unlock all
kinds of hints that would be useful well
I got this oh well let's do that
it was almost telling me to do that
maybe that was a hint okay so now I got
a box but I'll still what I do
she's my jammer let's jam not see what's
in here anyway
case there's a pad there's a fan there's
a ladder patent another fan jot that on
my little mouth there's a fan fan pad
and fan
what do we want to do
well the next obvious thing okay so I
got a fan here and this fan is going the
only thing I can do is blow boxes right
and there's a switch and this turns it
on
oh wait a minute
now I thought maybe for a second this
was gonna help me get the jammer out of
here know what if I could get oh that's
neat I wonder if I can throw a box in
here and then get the jammer and jump
over the box with that let's try that
where's the box at I don't know if it'll
throw it that direction or not let's try
that
then I got my jammer out of there
whether tall with this wither top have
to do with anything
all right let's just put it here oops
there we go
let's see if it safely idea works it's
kind of crazy but yeah look it worked
awesome okay so now I can get my jammer
out of here and put my jammer anywhere I
want to put it that's cool
um no I want to jump and then I want to
yeah jump
awesome okay cool and you know what I
wonder if I can GM this no I can't Jam
that so I lost my box for the jammer ooh
I might be resetting this no I can't
grab it through the window I don't think
now see everybody always just telling me
I can just grab things for Windows but
no I cannot do that that's been a long
going thing where people are like you
could just grab it or the window I'm
like no I can't why can't i JM the
purple thing that stinks maybe I can
wonder if I can climb up on here I'm
just saying whoops I think
maybe I don't need the box otherwise I'm
gonna be resetting well wait a minute
can I take the box I don't think I can
take the box or the purple no definitely
not
yeah whatever we'd ever best might be
resetting that yet you can't pick the
box here I'll show you
dudes people in the chatter saying that
I need to put the box through the window
you can't there's no way to do that and
there's no way of picking it up out here
see doesn't work so I tested that
already a whole bunch of times let's see
now
what else can we do
well yeah I wrote there's a box over
here right well I got a box good there's
a box
I just find it easier to refer to my
notes and trying to refer to my little
map drawing that I got here you want to
see what I could have it's silly see
there it is that's and then I draw a
little things on here just easier for me
for some reason to look at a map and try
to figure out where to go next
hmm what else do I got here didn't I
have a chain or a prison that's where I
did oh yeah this one right here I don't
need this anymore all right
and then where's the power source
there's the power source well I can hit
a whole bunch of things from this no
let's just put that there
there's a ladder I wonder if I go over
the ladder can I get back I hope so yeah
I can good what's this stuff makes a fan
gun okay I can't go anywhere with this
and those fans don't blow things up they
just blow things over or so I'm guessing
well that blew that over there so I'm
guessing I need to blow a box over there
and let's see what's over here maybe a
box on a prism oh it might want me to
blow it both directions
the most well-known thing project I work
time was QuickTime and QuickTime VR
there you go that's the biggest thing I
ever worked on but I was as you know
device driver guy I didn't do like any
of the fancy stuff I did the bare bones
low level stuff somebody asked me what's
the what's a project I worked on that
people would have heard of quicktime
clicked on VR
let's try that get the box and then
let's try it on here and let's try
throwing a jammer over because I have a
jammer just laying here so let's just do
it
see what happens there's another fan on
the other side for I don't see if this
works there's a fan on the other side
for blowing it back so what I'm doing
here is just seeing if that worked okay
see I can blow it back so no harm no
foul and there's a jammer now I can get
into the other room and then there is
this
okay I got this how can I get the blue
Jason man this game is crazy sorry this
is obvious it's just an obvious to me oh
wait a minute I found it
awesome okay so I did it is there an
easy way to get the star there's a star
over there um how do I get back there
looks like stairs it's just a box maybe
hmm
Oh easy if I get a box I know the box is
oh there's a box
where's that star right again okay not
there there it is okay so I can't get it
that way can I get it this way let me
see no I can't jump that high
somebody's sick
somebody said I solved this in some
weird way that they didn't know they
could solve it
throwing the jammer they said was not
how they saw fit hey whatever it's cool
that they allow you to solve it in
multiple different ways yeah I don't see
an easy way to get the star and like me
I don't know somebody said they don't
remember it being that easy that's cool
well it wasn't easy I just it took me
out I mean you know don't know Wow well
I've played for an hour let's go over I
would like to have beat this whole thing
but I don't think that's happening in
any reasonable amount of time so what
I'm gonna do is go over and check out
the console and then tomorrow I will
beat this and then move on to see
whatever I've decided that for now it
doesn't matter too much if you can't
justify these moral intuitions of yours
in fact just in case by some outside
chance you proved to be right I'd like
to sign up for the game if you're in
charge of the Ark who will be first
aboard when the floods come what does
one have to do to be valued above all
others it says be a good person be a
person be alive I don't see how to
explain this to you be a contributing
person be conscious
I don't know what do I want to be be a
contributing person that's the
scientific thing to say you say that now
but wasn't it not so long ago you were
claiming morality applied universally
have you changed your mind or are you
just confused I changed my mind
morality only applies when people are
cooperating you confused me morality
only applies when people are cooperating
it's the same exactly inserter net
weight cooperation isn't necessary after
all
I don't know so the whose lives are
worth the most then what do I have to do
for my ticket aboard your Ark be a
person I guess we're just letting all
the animals well the animals are not
depending on the ark should I be worried
that one must have such particular and
dubious psychological properties in
order to qualify who decides who is a
person and who isn't is a human infant a
person yes she's a man there's
definitely a robot I don't really see
how that can be true the distinction we
agree to between persons and animals was
that persons are more intelligent or
more reasoning but a human infant is no
smarter than your average SWA wha how do
you explain that infants have the pathan
there you go I suppose they do yes but
if your proposal is that the simple
casual potential to become a person is
sufficient to buy entry onto your ark of
the morally wouldn't that still include
an awful lot of animals okay no man no
animals having up an I want to bring
some animals along you know just in case
we have to eat something it's been the
moral of this thing is eating animals
somehow that happen okay
it would animal lives are worth the same
as humans this again I suppose the
industrial slaughter of animals for meat
in autumn sometimes I get tongue-tied
for meat is on a moral par with genocide
then would you really save a chihuahua
just as soon as a fellow person animal
lives are worth the same as any other
conscious pynx I misunderstood can we go
from the top I don't know
you're one of these people that just has
to explore every option are you you know
what that tells me that you are a bad
decision maker but fine I yourself out
why don't you just don't expect me to
match your enthusiasm and my efforts to
avoid repeating myself there are only so
many ways to say you're wrong what's it
going to be this time alright so he's
asking me how do you get on the ark
there be alive I don't see how to
explain this to you to do I'll say be
alive this is the crest
that's to say rights in your world as a
person does this was just like people
that were things we decided we wanted to
save at the end of the world maybe I
misunderstood his question so the grass
has the same rights in your world as a
person does is that it how would that
even work community service for people
who step on the lawn I think you must
have confused the question why don't you
try again I thought we just say I don't
see how it explained us did tried just
about a really question but what will
really bug you is whether that's because
there is no answer or because you
weren't thinking outside that box you
live in let me lay my cards on the table
wow it seems prudent to me to hedge my
bets
you just haven't made it clear enough
proposal for me to buy what you're
peddling
there's something about the way you talk
that makes me uncomfortable it would be
for the best if you work out what is
what it is before I do see you
terminating support session all right
and I'm just gonna skip this alrighty
