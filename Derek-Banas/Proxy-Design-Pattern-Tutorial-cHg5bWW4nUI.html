21 of my design patterns video tutorial
today we're going to talk about an
extremely simple design pattern and that
is known as the proxy design pattern so
what is the proxy design pattern well
the proxy is a class which is going to
be used to limit access to another class
and you may do this for security reasons
because an object is intensive to create
or that object is in a remote location
that you'd like to have a proxy or a
thing that sort of decides what methods
are available what fields are available
from that outside object but in this
part of the tutorial I'm basically a
focus on the security aspect of the
proxy design pattern because there's
numerous ways to use it which I'm going
to get into at a later date so here is
the basic class diagram for the proxy
design pattern you have from the last
part of the tutorial which was the state
design pattern which is available in the
lower left-hand corner if you want to
completely understand what's going on
here I created a basic interface for an
ATM machine
now this ATM machine of course allows
you to access and receive cash now of
course I'm sure you could understand why
that could be a security concern if in
an outside program we wanted to be able
to access this ATM machine class object
so what we're going to do is we're going
to throw a proxy object in between and
only allow the client in this situation
that is protected because both the proxy
as well as the protected object are
going to implement the same interface
what the proxy is going to do is limit
access to fields an ATM machine to just
getting the ATMs current state and the
amount of cash in the machine we're not
going to allow them to set the amount of
cash the machine or take money out of
the machine and that is going to be this
part of the tutorial so let's get into
the code okay so here I am in get ATM
data and this is going to act as an
interface that both the ATM machine as
well as our proxy are going to implement
so I'm going to define inside of this
interface those methods that I want
those using this proxy to be able to
access
in regards to our ATM machine and I'm
just going to come in here and to find
them so I think it's perfectly safe to
be able to get the current state of the
ATM machine or what the ATM machine is
currently doing because no damage can be
done in regards to just getting that
information and I also think it would be
perfectly fine to tell them how much
cash is in the machine so we're
basically implementing this as if this
would be at a bank office in which a
manager would want to access and make
sure ATM machines are running properly
so there we go get ATM data Java is done
so the next thing we're going to do is
go into the ATM machine dot Java which
we created in the last part of the
tutorial and to use this guy we're going
to come in here and just type in
implements get ATM data now this is
going to be able to properly work with
our proxy just put our mouse over top of
this guy right here ATM machine and
add-on implemented methods that are
forced because we implemented get ATM
data and you can see that both of them
popped up down here
so down here and get ATM data we're just
getting rid of this and then down here
for return just to keep this very simple
I'm gonna say ATM state and that's going
to get the gist of how the ATM machine
is going to be running going to pass
back object information but either way
that's definitely enough and then down
here in get cash in machine we're going
to return cash in machine which is up
here so I might as well just copy that
like I said this would be set up so that
a branch manager for example would be
able to figure out if a machine ran out
of cash that's all we need to do ATM
machine is now set up so that we'll be
able to get that information next thing
we need to do is set up ATM proxy Java
jump in here in this situation the proxy
is going to both create and destroy ATM
machine objects and provide access only
to those methods that we would consider
to be safe so get ATM data going to
implement the same interface very simple
and then what's it going to do it's
going to say hey you need to implement
some methods here and there it goes and
unimplemented methods and there they are
now this is an act
a go-between between our regular ATM
machines so what we're going to want to
do here is actually create ATM machines
inside of this proxy so very very simple
if they would call get ATM state we're
going to say ATM machine and then I can
call it real ATM machine is equal to new
ATM machine and create an ATM machine
object and then in the return area I'm
going to go real ATM machine paste that
inside of there put a dot and one of
these methods is going to be get ATM
data which we can see right here just
click on that and then throw a semicolon
in there so that's going to create a new
machine
however just allow access to this very
specific method which is also the same
exact name as what we have right there
and then down here we're going to do
pretty much exactly the same thing with
get cashing machine so create a new
object and then down here in the return
statement you're going to go return and
then we're going to say click and one of
these is going to be get cash in machine
boom there that goes and there that goes
and this is done now you have your proxy
finished now it's time to go into test
ATM machine and see if everything worked
so we're just going to come in here the
bottom of what we created in the last
part of the tutorial and start working
with this guy so I'm going to go ATM get
ATM data which is the interface they get
ATM data and we're going to call this
real ATM machine is equal to new ATM
machine and this is also going to lock
it out from only being able to access
those methods that are defined inside of
it and then we're also going to create
the proxy which is going to stand in
between it and I'm going to call this
ATM proxy is equal to new ATM proxy I'll
save and then I'm going to print out
some information from there print line
throw a new line in there just for the
heck of it and go current ATM state and
then if I want to access it I can go ATM
proxy boom and then you're going to see
here what pops up none of the secret
information that we wouldn't want to
show up however it will pop up get ATM
data so I'm going to click on that and
then I'm also going
come and do something very similar here
we're going to print out the amount of
cash in the machine to cash in ATM
machine and all this codes available in
a link underneath the video and then
once again if we go into the proxy that
we just created here we're going to see
get cashing machine is one of the things
available however set cash and machine
and all the potentially dangerous
methods are not close that off and you
will not be able to do things like say
ATM proxy set cash in machine because
that is not defined in the interface and
just in case you are wondering
I think you can see the red mark
underneath our C doesn't work and even
though I did create rule ATM
I'm also not going to be able to use
that to access that method you may ask
yourself well why not same reason we
have over here it is part of the
interface get ATM data so and get ATM
data is the version that I am using
right here so that blocks out
potentially harmful methods however if
we save this and execute it you're going
to see that it's going to give me the
information that I do need which is the
current state which means there's no
card currently in the ATM machine and
the total amount of cash in the ATM
machine which is $2,000 so there's a
basic overview of the proxy design
pattern like I said before it could be
used in numerous different ways and
we'll get into that later parts of the
tutorial if you have any questions of
course take a look at the code
underneath the video and if you don't
see your questions answered there leave
a any questions or comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
