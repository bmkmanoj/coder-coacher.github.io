of my how to lay out a website video
tutorial where I will take you
step-by-step through the process of
creating this design that you see here
on the screen completely out of my head
so that you can see exactly how I layout
websites and hopefully learn something
along the way well in part 1 and 2 which
you can see links to above this video
and you should definitely watch those
before you watch that I created what you
see here on the right side of the screen
well today I'm going to create the
middle two bars that you see right here
and I'm just going to jump right into it
right at the end of end of left sidebar
which is a div that surrounds all of
this content here I'm going to create a
new set of middle bars that I'm going to
throw some information into so the first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a day of shut off caps lock
though and I'm going to create a div
there's going to be two of these so I'm
going to assign a class to it instead of
an ID and then I'm going to close off
that div and throw in a comment so that
I know where it begins and where it ends
so this middle column div is going to
surround all of this content in a single
column and there's going to be two of
those well then what I got to do is
create another div class is equal to
middle containers with I'm going to call
it and again close off that div and what
middle container is going to do is it's
a div that sort of surround all of this
content in this block right here now I'm
going to continue making additional divs
I need to make a title and that is going
to be this guy up here that's listed as
article and I can zoom in on us there
now you can probably see it a lot better
and I'm going to call it middle title
given an h4 tag because that's what I've
been doing yeah code article closed-off
h4 tag close off the div and then I'm
going to put a featured image inside of
here and I know because I have a
placeholder image which is right here I
know the dimensions on that image in the
dimensions are 260 pixels wide by 142
pixels in height and I'm not going to
put it inside of a div I could but I'm
not going to I just have to say there's
the location which I just showed you
featured image hang alt and some code
featured image like I told you 200 60
pixels why height is equal to 142 pixels
class featured image so that I can
target it and move it around wherever I
want to because you can probably guess
I'm going to have to
around a good bit then I have to create
this middle title here that's called
Facebook marketing so I'm going to
create another day of that's all you do
over and over again is create divs and
move them around middle order title I'm
going to bold it because that's what the
design looks like and then I'm going to
create a date because eventually now
this can definitely be used as a
standalone website no problem there but
I'm eventually going to turn this into a
wordpress theme and all of the code here
HTML code CSS all that is available
right underneath this video click on the
link and you can do whatever you want
with it I get asked that all the time
that's why I bring it up all the time
and then I have to create a horizontal
rule scroll this up and I'm actually
going to create a div that is going to
represent a horizontal rule I'm not
going to use the standard horizontal
rule because I like to move the
horizontal roll around nice and that's
how I do it and then you come to the
actual content making a paragraph like I
often do middle excerpt then I have to
get some lorem ipsum copy and paste that
in there and I'm just going to cut it
off based off of what I have in the
layout and I'm going to do an H
reference a link to the actual article
content and I'm going to call it click
for more close that off and then just
type in more any tag and it close off
the paragraph tag and there it is that's
everything that you need to create this
guy however I'll show you what that
looks like and we file save this and
reload it you're going to see it's a
total mess now what I got to do is jump
into the CSS and fix it up and I have
all the CSS embedded in this I never do
that but I'm doing it just so I can keep
all my files all in the same place and I
can pretty much remember what this looks
like so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to jump in here and start editing
it itself first thing I'm going to do I
have middle column which is the column
that surrounds the div column that
surrounds all three of these guys and
I'm going to define a width for this of
I had guessing like 200 60 pixels based
off of what happened before and then I
know I'm going to want to put a margin
on the right and let's say 20 pixels
because that's what I did before also
that doesn't mean it's going to work
we're just going to go and see how
things look and then adjust based off of
that so file say alright so we got that
moved in it looks like it you might be
right okay so now what do we go to do
you might have to come back the middle
call and make a couple changes but I
think
for the most part everything there is
going to be fine middle container
all right background color I know I can
get this right is white FFF then border
well I used three pixels before the use
three pixels again so I'm doing exactly
the same thing as what we have here in
the left sidebar so I know that's going
to work so put a border on it margin I'm
just going to use ten pixels again
because what I used before yeah I'm kind
of copying a lot with I'm gonna leave
that at two hundred sixty pixels cause
that's what I did before height I have
no idea so I'm gonna put in 300 pixels
keep adding two pixels let's file save
it see where we're at
reload okay so yeah not quite certain
here it's looking about right so now
what do I got to do I'm gonna start
messing around with the middle title
which is what's this article here like
who we are and I'm going to use who we
are kind of as an example middle title
and my font I'm going to use the same
exact thing actually let's grab all of
this and see how much of it applies all
right so my font I'm gonna leave it
exactly the same background color going
to leave it the same color I'm gonna
leave it the same width is definitely
going to be wrong let's say 175 instead
because it's going to be a longer thing
longer bar as you can see here this bar
is longer than this bar height more than
likely going to be the same
text-align:right definitely going to be
the same padding right six pixels
probably going to be real close to being
right and I'm definitely going to
position it relative and 78 negative 21
those might be perfect one thing I am
going to do here changing is z-index I'm
going to change it to 20 what's up going
to allow it to do is float over top of
this featured image let's file save it
see where we're going all right pretty
good pretty good there's a little bit of
a gap here I'm not quite sure if you can
see that or not
so there's a little bit of a gap there
so that means my width needs to change
let's say 80 okay that's a little bit
over I'm also kind of wondering if this
is wide enough meaning the middle
container because I don't think it is
quite wide enough take it up to 64
reload and then let's take this up a
little tiny bit more middle title that
is actually it's just a little bit up
too far let's move it from the left a
little tiny bit 72 meaning the
positioning from the left side of this
bar that it's inside of sort of flipping
around here a little bit okay let's try
this at 88
a fossa all right that's this is just
about perfect padding right let's just
take this up to about seven perfect okay
so I got that in the perfect perfect
perfect position everything else looks
like pretty good too so now what we're
going to start doing is messing around
with a featured image so what are we
going to do position it relative left
let's go one pixel and then how far up
in the area are we gonna want this guy
to go because we want it to go
underneath that banner
let's try 50 pixels reload okay that was
too much let's take a little bit off of
it let's try 45 perfect okay so that's
looking good
remember this is just a placeholder that
doesn't mean it's going to look that way
later on alright so now we're going to
start playing around with the middle or
title which is this title Facebook
marketing right there if you can't see
this look at it full screen alright so
we're going to position it relative and
from the top let's try negative 50
pixels that's 45 it looks about right
let's see and padding left let's try
four pixels all right looking pretty
good looking pretty good pretty tell you
let's see here a little bit let's say a
little bit not quite so much upper try
45 I'll say alright much better and
aside from that as far as I can tell
everything looks pretty good so then we
got to go middle art date and as I was
creating these divs I just haven't
written down a piece of paper that's why
I don't have to refer down to their
names constantly position:relative top
I'm guessing it's going to be negative
45 pixels just like the top one padding
left guess what it's going to be four
pixels just like before
reload perfect we're getting now we're
almost done actually now I got to create
the horizontal rule and I already used
horizontal rule in the left sidebar so
I'm going to call this horizontal mid
rule background color because it's a day
of gray color I used before height it's
going to be two pixels like I useful for
width is going to be completely
different let's try a hundred 70 pixels
margin left say three pixels
position:relative and let's say we want
to move that guy 50 pixels from where
it's laying at mm too much okay I
should've made it 45 being a little
stupid that's okay now what did I do
over in the layout in a layout this goes
the whole way across the screen so
that's just dead wrong so we got to make
this go the whole way across the screen
so I'm going to look up here so width
264 let's say 200 and
50 almost there try for reload all right
looking good looking good and then we
just have to do the middle xor color
this is the text color to F or F and I
use the same colors over and over and
over again font size I'm going to change
it to the same font size using the left
sidebar 10-point margin left it's going
to be 3 pixels just like it was before
position:relative there's any questions
you have leave them down below and I'll
do my best to get to them and top
meaning how far up from the top from the
bottom or where it is right now do I
want to move it reload look in pretty
sharp
so let's look over here and see what
this guy looks like alright so this is
pretty tight while this is a little bit
loose or so I'm going to move this up a
little bit so I got to go to middle
container and this is the height when
let's lop off 30 pretty tight looking
really really really good and
technically I'm pretty much done I'm
gonna have to do now is scroll down to
the very bottom of the screen and see
where it says end of middle container
well I'm going to select that one of the
reasons why we use comments and I'm
going to come up here and copy this guy
and instead of three like the original
layout I think it's gonna look better
with four so I'm gonna go two three four
reload and there you go looking pretty
good looking pretty good I might change
that back to three later on but I think
it looks pretty good and then what I'm
going to do is go to end of middle
column second middle column close off
that comma and then I'm going to come
down to middle column select all that
div class middle column copy roll away
to the bottom and right before content
wrapper come in here paste that in file
save reload going now if we zoom out you
can see that everything is coming out
pretty pretty good leave any questions
or comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
