3 tutorial this is part 1 of the
tutorial and I'm going to start off very
very basic here but we're going to get
very complicated over this video series
so first off what you're going to need
to do is go to python.org right here and
then click on download and then you want
to look right here get the most
up-to-date version of python whether
it's Windows Mac or Linux or UNIX and
download that and I'm sure you can
figure that out on your own then what
we're going to do is after everything's
been installed you're going to see this
little guy here whether you no matter
what platform operating system you're
using
it's called idle and it allows you to
write Python programs double click on
that
we're later going to go into using a
traditional IDE to develop Python
programs you don't know what that means
don't worry about it and whenever you
open up idle you're going to see what
it's called the Python shell you could
actually write code in here but I prefer
to actually write my code in a file that
I can save so I want to click on file
and new window now the way that I've
laid this tutorial out is actually based
off of votes that you guys left on my
website so you said you wanted my
tutorials in the future to be more
interactive so you can see exactly what
I am doing so that is exactly what
you're going to get today first off this
is one of the most simplistic things to
do with programming language what we're
going to do is we're going to print the
words hello world and we're going to do
that by calling a function called print
in Python just look up here in the upper
left hand corner that's where I'm typing
and put a bracket in there and what size
by title is it gives you all kinds of
information on how this function
actually functions we want to print out
a line of text
surround it with brackets and that's it
that's all you have to do with Python
now go to run from now on I'm going to
hit f5 because that's a shortcut and
then I have to give it a name so I'm
going to come over here call it hello
world dot P Y py is important because
that signifies that this is Python code
I'm going to save it as soon as I hit
replace over here you see hello world
get printed out on the screen so you say
that's not all that great well now we're
going to add some user interactivity
with Python now instead I'm going to say
hi and then I'm going to create a
variable that I'm going to temporarily
store whatever the user enters in on
over here in this pane - variable name
name doesn't have to be name it can be
anything you want it to be I'm going to
call a function called input and I'm
going to type in quotes but I can use
single quotes also just see you now
enter your name this colon doesn't have
to be there it's there only for
aesthetic reasons this is the part
that's going to print on the screen and
then I'm going to print out on the
screen
and then a comma followed by name and
then a closing brace I'm gonna hit f5
see here it's asking me for my name
I enter my name hit enter and it says hi
Derrick real simplistic nice easy
program let's get a little bit more
complicated let's ask for an age and
just so you know no matter what is
entered in here I know this is a string
of text and a string of text in Python
it's referred to as a string no matter
what is entered in here it's going to be
considered meaning in here meaning into
the input function it's going to be
considered a string of text even if they
enter a number now I'm going to ask them
to and on the estimate giving me the age
we're saved to the variable age I have
to if I'm going to do a comparison what
I'm going to do here is compare their
age - my age but this is a string of
characters like I said before so what I
have to do is change it into a number or
in programming terms what is called an
integer and how I do that is I'm going
to take the variable age and I'm going
to throw it into a function and a
function is just code that does a
certain thing this function here input
takes in information that the user types
in and print prints out whatever you put
inside of quotes and int what it does is
stands for integer is it turns whatever
variable you put within brackets into it
into an integer or a number without a
decimal place so I'm going to change age
from a string into a number and then
reassign it back to its original
variable name and then I'm going to add
ask what it is so I'm going to say if
age I'm gonna say is equal to and it
sometimes nicer to put brackets around
this
35 and Python is different than other
programming languages normally in most
programming languages you would use
curly braces to surround all the code
that would be executed if age indeed was
equal to 35 the Python does it different
puts a colon after it and then it
indents for spaces that's a default so
this is whitespace that's how Python
determines what code belongs to this if
statement right here so if the age is
equal to 35 what I'm going to do is
print onto the screen
you are the same age as me but what do I
do if they're not the same age
that's where else comes in and what I'm
going to do here I just type in else
this is just basic logic I'm going to
print out
and if I hit f5 to run this see enter
your name I'm gonna type my name enter
my age I'm gonna type my age and it's
going to say you're the same age as me
now if I go in here and type in and just
go over here run it again enter name
enter my age and you can see it
automatically figured that logic out so
is just a you know how to use an if
statement an else statement a print
statement and so forth and so on so
that's nice and usable what I'm going to
do is show you exactly how these guys
change and go a little bit into this
function right here now you see I
created a variable named age and if I
want to find out what type of variable
that actually is I can use a function
called type so with the print command
I'm now going to run a function inside
of the print command it's going to tell
me what age is variable type wise so you
type in an age and then we're going to
do the same exact thing here and let's
chop this off at the end here because we
don't need we don't really need that
there either and then we're going to put
another print command here I'm going to
show how this variable changed because
of the in function f5 run it
and you can see here it was a string STR
that is variable age and then it went
into the integer function and now it is
an integer and you can do all kinds of
other little neat things normally if
whatever you were going to be running
Python you're going to be doing it on a
UNIX platform Mac OS X is a UNIX
platform though whenever this code is
run it this line of text up here is
going to tell the shell in UNIX or Linux
where the location is of the interpreter
that can interpret this code so this is
common we don't need to do this because
we're doing this with idle and that's
just another thing that you should have
in your code and another thing that's
useful is making comments anything that
follows a hash mark is ignored inside of
Python so we're going to say my first
program just to be simple you could also
do multi-line comments by putting three
quote symbols you could also do that
and then again this is all going to be
ignored
inside of Python so that's a basic
rundown of the beginnings and how to
basically use Python and how to install
it next up we're going to get
complicated real fast I'm going to jump
right in here and teach you a lot about
different variables and all of the
methods or functions that are available
to those variables see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
