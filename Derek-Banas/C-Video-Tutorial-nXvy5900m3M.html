video tutorial I've received this
request numerous times over the past
couple years and today I'm going to make
an extremely fast C tutorial it's
actually going to be a couple videos but
either way it's going to be way quicker
than anything you've ever seen in your
life and I provides links to all of the
code and I heavily commented it to aid
in translation and I'm going to keep
everything very very simple so I have an
immense amount to do so let's get into
it okay I have a very simple setup here
I'm using text wrangler if you're on
Windows you can use notepad plus plus
and everything is pretty much exactly
the same and over here I have the
terminal or if you're using a Windows
machine you could of course use the
command line and I'm just going to be
typing into code here saving it and then
executing it over here so let's go
alright so to create a multi-line
comment you would just put a forward
slash and a star and then whatever you
wanted to type in here and there you are
there's your multi-line comment a single
line comment is just going to be double
dashes very much like you are used to
then what I'm going to need to do is use
include and the reason why is I'm going
to be using some functions like printf
and scanf which are going to allow us to
print to the screen and also take input
from the users and to do that I need to
use include to include certain code and
for printf and scanf specifically I need
standard input/output H and what this is
going to do this include statement it is
going to take that code and stick it
wherever the include statement is and
that is pretty much what include does
I'm also going to do a little bit with
strings and strings are a little bit
weird with C and to do that we're going
to need that library I'm also going to
define a constant and it is common
whenever you define constants using the
define keyword that you put your
constants name in uppercase letters and
what this is going to do is at compile
time any time it sees my name it is just
going to replace it with this string
right there so moving along another
thing every program at C is going to
need is a main function and the reason
why is the main function is going to be
where
the computer starts executing your code
and if you put any other functions which
we're not going to get into functions in
this tutorial but if you put any more
functions that are not referenced from
main they will never execute and to
define main you just type in main and
then you're going to put curly brackets
just like that and that is how main is
defined and if you can't see this you
can view it in full screen because it's
a 1080p video another thing since I'm up
here I'd like to show you how to use or
create a global variable and a global
variable is going to be defined outside
of main and it is going to be accessible
to every single function in the entire
program so that's all that means that's
a global variable and more specifically
this right here would be a variable that
is local to the main function and just
to put it really simple a variable is
just a box in memory that is going to
allow you to save all of your data and
whenever you are creating names for your
variables you have to start them off
using a letter I'm just going to put in
here first letter type in any variable
name you want of course and then in this
situation we're going to create a
character and we use single quotes to
create that said character also however
you can use uppercase letters as you can
see right here and you could use
underscores and you could also use
numbers inside of your variable names
just as long as this first guy right
here is a letter characters specifically
which is a specific variable type are
going to allow you to hold any of 256
different characters and like I said
before they need to be surrounded by
single quote or an apostrophe and of
course you can put a number inside of
there however you would not be able to
use that number in calculations and so
forth because it's considered a
character and not a number an integer is
going to be any whole number that does
not have any decimal places either
positive or negative and they are going
to be between negative 32,768 to 32,768
positive that is your possible values if
you're creating an integer and I'm just
going
create one called age and when it's I
have been 38 and there we go now if you
need to use an integer that is bigger
than what I said was provided with the
integer which just think 32,000 what
you're going to need to do is use what
are called long intz and let's just
create ourselves a super big number and
let's just make it negative three two
seven six seven zero zero zero and don't
put commas inside of here can't do that
and the long int is going to provide you
with the ability to create even bigger
numbers now if you want to use decimals
then you're going to want to create what
are known as floats which can be
positive or negative and of course they
can contain decimals and let's just say
pi value is equal to 3.14159
da-da-da-da-da and that would be a valid
type you could use inside of there and a
float can be as big as 38 decimal points
in length roughly if you need to use
something that's even bigger than that
then you can use a double and let's just
say really big pi is equal to and I'm
just going to copy this guy right here
paste that in there and yes I know that
this is not pi so you don't need to tell
me I'm just typing that in there just to
save ourselves some time and that is
what the doubles are for prints F which
I referred to earlier is going to allow
us to print information to the screen
and something you're going to see a lot
is this backslash in and what that's
going to do is force a line return or to
skip a line that's what that guy's for
and as you're going to find most of the
see function names that you're going to
say are not going to contain uppercase
letters however that doesn't mean you
can't use them yourself and in reference
to backslash n remember I just said
skips a line we're also going to have
backslash T and what that's going to do
is create a tab of different lengths
depending upon the computer that you're
using if you ever want to use a
backslash inside of your printf just put
two backslashes and then of course if
you ever want to use a regular quote
just put a backslash and a quote so
those are all those guys so let's try to
actually come in here and actually use
print F because printf is a little bit
deaf
maybe some things that you've seen in
the past we're going to put double
quotes inside of here again now let's
just do something simple like let's just
say this will print to screen and then
we'll just put in here two backslashes
two line breaks anyway and now that we
have that all set up we're going to save
that and like I said see tutorial one
dot C then we're going to bounce over
here inside of the terminal and to
execute our program first let's just
make sure it's there there it is and to
compile I mean what we're going to do is
go GCC and then we're going to take this
guy right here paste it inside of there
here is your actual way of making this
all show up and of course it's going to
end with the dot C and hit enter and
whenever you do that you're now going to
see that a dot out shows up there dot
forward slash and we're going to go a
dot out this will print the screen
prints out to the screen so that's how
we handle printf let's do a couple more
things with print out let's say for
example we want to take our age that we
defined up here this 38 and we want to
print that out how exactly are we going
to do it that's a little bit different
than maybe you've seen another program
so I'm going to say I am and then I'm
going to put in a % and a D and then I'm
going to type in years old put two new
lines inside of there close that quote
off and then type in age and that % and
D is what's going to be used whenever
you want to use integers inside of C or
you want to print out integers anyway
we're gonna have to come back over here
and we're going to have to recompile
that and then execute now you can see I
am 38 years old so wherever we have the
% and the D age is going to be taken
from here and put over there so that's
how that's going to work and we are
going to use different conversion
characters that's what these guys are
called depending upon the different data
types that we want to use so I'm just
going to copy this guy right here and
let's say that I want to print out a
long int inside of here I'll just type
in big number then we're going to put in
a percent sign and we're
put in LD and then here I'm going to put
in super big num like that and there you
can see super big num prints out on our
screen have a couple of these different
conversion characters that we're going
to be working with there let's print out
our little pi value time is equal to and
to print out a float there it's a little
bit different what we're going to do
here is a % just like always
however if we want to define exactly how
many decimal places we want to show up
we're going to put a period here or a
decimal and then let's say that I want 5
to shown up that's exactly how that set
up I'm in here type in PI value which is
the name of our variable and of course
don't forget to put the f inside of
there next to float come over here like
that execute it and there you can see
the PI print it out and indeed it did
print out 5 decimal places which is nice
now remember we also have doubles inside
of here well doubles actually use the F
as well let's just come up here and look
at it there's a whole bunch of different
numbers there's at least 15 of them
there here I'm just going to type in big
pi is equal to and remember I said we're
still going to use F with the float
except in this situation I'm going to
type in point 1 5 4 15 decimal places
and then here I'm going to type in
really big hi compile execute there you
can see really big pi print it out and
I'm sure there's 15 numbers there I'm
not going to bother counting them just
know there is so that's how you work
with doubles remember doubles and floats
the same exact thing we're still going
to use F for both of them characters of
course are also going to be different so
let's say something like the first
letter in my name is and then we're
going to come in here and put a % again
but this time we're going to put a C
inside of there and then we're going to
type in first letter for that which of
course is this guy up here it's going to
be the letter D I'll save it execute and
there you got first letter my name is
Dean so moving right along here if we
want to print out a string I'm going to
show you a couple different ways to do
this let's say my name is then I'm going
to put a percent sign and
an S and if I'm going to do it this way
I'm going to type in Derek like that
there you can see my name is Derek shows
up there on our screen now to create a
string this is where it gets a little
bit weird you're actually going to
create a character array so let's say
that I wanted to create a character
array or a string called my name well
I'm going to actually have to create
enough spaces inside of it and in C
everything starts at the zero index and
works its way up so just think of the
array as a bunch of boxes just like
before and there's going to be a letter
in each one of those boxes so if I want
to do my name I'm going to need at least
12 characters five for my first name one
for the space between my first and last
name and five for my last name and then
I'm going to need what is called a
string terminator you have to always
provide room for this guy right here and
this is considered one character inside
of your string array very important the
reason why is that just tells see that
this is the end of our string so always
make sure you have enough room for at
least one more character whenever you're
creating these guys and then we're going
to come in here I'm going to type in my
name like that and there we go I just
created a string and you could also do
the exact same thing by getting rid of
that right there
and it's going to create a string array
that's going to be big it's a character
or I should stop calling it a string
array it's going to create a character
array that's going to be big enough to
hold this as well as the string
terminator and then of course I could
come in and do something like my name is
and I can put a % and an S just like
before and in this situation type in my
name and there you can see my name is
Derek Venus hey shows up now it would be
nice to be able to assign a new value to
a character array but you cannot do that
there's no way that you can set that up
to work so instead if you want to change
the value you have to use STR cpy string
copy and then put in your string and
whatever you want the new value to be
and the reason why we brought in string
dot H
is because of what we're doing right now
so that is how we set it up so we have
that and there you can see my name is
Bob Smith shows up and we're actually
going to delete all this stuff and
continue on because I'm going to show
you how scan F works and what scanf is
used for is for receiving input from the
user so I'm going to create a new
character here and I'm going to call it
a middle initial then what you're going
to want to do almost always is use print
F to actually ask a question of the user
in regards to what information you
actually want I'm going to say what is
your middle initial and then we get to
scanf and scan ups a little bit weird
which what I want to do here is put a
quote and a space % and see because
we're trying to get a character from the
user and then you're going to want to
put an M / stand inside of here like
that and then wherever you want to save
this information that they are going to
want to input which is going to be
middle initial this guy right here
more on the ampersand later on so that
is how you're going to receive input
from our users then I can come down here
and say something like middle initial
and it's going to be a character of
course and then here we don't need the
ampersand we're just going to put in
middle initial execute it's going to say
what is your middle initial I'm going to
say J and it's going to say middle
initial J right there I probably should
have put in a space here but either way
now what we're going to do is create a
string array because with scanf you're
only going to ever be able to accept one
value at a time unless you specifically
note that you're going to be getting
more than one value at a time so you
tell scanf what's coming in see it knows
there is a character coming it doesn't
know there's anything else so even if
this was a string this would not work
and actually going to see that strings
our hand a little bit different with
scanf so this is basically saying I'm
getting one value and I want it saved in
this variable if they would type in more
than one character or more than one
number with a space between it that
information would be
nord and we're going to get into that
more later on so let's create ourselves
a character array and let's call it
first name and I'm going to give it 30
spaces and yes you can define more than
one variable at a time and we'll say
print F what is your name like that
actually I'm going to come up here throw
in a new line just to keep the code a
little bit tighter here and then what
I'm going to do is go scanf and quote
end space and then what do I want I want
a string and then space and then another
string so you have to define exactly
what you want whenever you're using
scanf we're going to be getting into
other different ways to receive input
later on so first name and last names
where that data is going to be saved and
then we can do something like printf
your name is % string presents on
character % string new line new line and
then inside of this we're gonna say
first name middle initial last name like
that like that then we can come over
here execute what's your middle initial
J what is your name I can actually type
in my whole name and there it is it was
smart enough to print out everything in
the right order that's pretty cool you
could also do something like accept
slashes inside here so let's say I
wanted to go into month/day/year printf
put your birthdate and remember you just
have to define exactly what scanf needs
to look out for whenever it's getting it
so we're going to get a birthdate so
that's going to be an integer and then
there's a slash and then we're going to
get another integer and another forward
slash and another integer and of course
don't forget to put your quotes inside
of there and then you're going to have
your ampersand again and we're going to
have month day here I like that let's
also throw a couple new lines inside of
this let's then come in here and go
print o throw a newline inside of there
and then we're gonna say a birthdate and
we're going to find exactly what it's
going to go on the screen so we got that
but we have to put the slash in
ourselves of course another slash to
Newlands and then we're gonna go
month/day/year what's your middle
initial J there minimus there it is
what's your birthday 12 21 1974 and
there you go that print it all out that
way now of course there's a whole
bunch of different ways you can use
mathematics inside of C as well else
let's go and get rid of some of this
information you can perform addition you
can perform subtraction you can perform
multiplication you can perform division
and sometimes you can perform modulus
which is going to return the remainder
of a division between integers integers
can't do that with floats let's go in
here and create a couple of these guys
so I'm going to call this guy number one
give it a value of 12 this is another
way to initialize your different values
inside of C let's say this is 15 and
then let's say this is num ant's number
answer and then we're going to create a
float and I'm going to call this decimal
one give it a value of one point two
decimal to give it a value of 1.5 and
then decimal answer again come in here
throw a couple different print apps
inside of here then we're going to go
integer calculation float calculation
put a % d up there put uh % F down here
and then for this guy what we're going
to do put a column of course and we're
going to go num2 and we're going to do a
division and then we're going to come in
here and do num1 and down here we're
going to do pretty similar thing where
you know decimal to division decimal 1
and then for this guy I'm also going to
do a modulus and go num2 modulus num1
and execute and there you can see an
example of using some math functions
inside of c now of course order of
operations is going to matter inside of
c as well so of course we're going to
have to use parentheses to make our math
work the way that we want it to work so
let's say that we come in here and go
without parentheses and then perform
some calculations like 3 plus 6 times 10
and then this would be with parentheses
and execute and you can see exactly how
that changes and of course the order of
operations is going to pay the most
respect to parentheses then it is going
to pay attention to the negative sign
the not symbol which we're going to get
into later increment and decrement which
are also getting into later
multiplication division modulus then
addition then subtraction and of course
relational operators which we'll also
get into later and let's create
ourselves a random number and give it a
value of one now there's a whole bunch
of different shortcut ways to perform
all of these different operations as
well there's plus equals and what that's
going to do is actually add whatever the
number on the right of this whatever it
is to itself let me give me an example
rather than just talking about that then
I'll show you the different shortcuts
let's say we wanted to go one plus
equals two and then put something inside
of there a shortcut way to add two to a
number is going to be random num
2 so that's a little bit of a shortcut
and there you can say 1 plus equals 2 is
going to be equal to 3 so it just added
2 to whatever its value was now you may
ask yourself well why didn't I just put
random number in here instead of putting
in 1 there are you gonna see in a second
the reason why is because of how C
performs calculations and so forth and
so on
so I'll just put it in here like this
kind of a neat little thing to think
about and I'm going to go random num
then I'm going to go random numb or
equal to 2 and you can see that 5
actually shows up the reason why is it
actually performs the calculation b4 and
puts that value in here and that is the
reason why I didn't do things the way
that you saw them and like it said
before these shortcut is available for
of course doing additions it's also
available if you want to do subtractions
from themselves also multiplications
also divisions also modulus if you are
working with integers and then if you
want to just quickly add one to a value
you could just put the variables name
inside of here so their name plus plus
and what that's going to do is increment
it and if you put two negative signs
that's going to decrement it or decrease
it by the value of one and that is also
another thing that's kind of interesting
inside of C let's say that we go in
example number is equal to 1 I'm going
to show you a
different ways that we can play around
with these increments and decrements and
things to look out for
now you remember up here what it did was
it perform this calculation first and
then took that value saved it into
random number and then displayed that
value on the screen just like you see
here over here well using the increments
and decrements you can actually put
those pluses and negatives on different
sides of the variable to determine
exactly when they are perform if you
want them to be incremented before they
are displayed on the screen put them
before the variable we're just going to
come in here like this and d-x num and
then here we're going to put those two
symbols right there and then just to see
exactly what this looks like if you put
it in a different position % D here
we're going to increment after the fact
and actually we're going to change X num
to 1 in the mean time like that X num X
num like this and there you can see
exactly how that works here we're going
to increment it and then print it out on
a screen and down here whenever you put
the addition or the incrementer after
the value it's going to display it the
way that it's originally before this
operation print it to the screen and
then increment it like I said before you
can do the same thing with two negatives
or a decrement and then the final thing
we're going to do here is to show you
what it means to cast a value very
simple to do to come in here and create
ourselves an integer number example and
I'm gonna give it a value of 12 and
let's say that I create a float number
example to give it a value of 1 point 2
3 4 let's say I want to go number and
print this out here on the screen
actually stood a little bit different
let's just make them both integers there
this will make it a little bit easier to
understand let's say that I then want
this information to be displayed as a
float what I'm going to do I'm in here
and type float and you would put in
whatever datatype you want to show up
there so if you want an integer division
to show up as a float you would do that
and you can see that's exactly what
happened and there you go and I'm going
to leave it with that because that was
an immense amount of information on the
C programming language so if you have
any questions about anything I covered
here leave them into questions or
comments section below otherwise till
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
