7 of my android development tutorial
today we're going to continue making my
XML parsing multiple activity stock
quote picker and if you missed the
previous part of this tutorial part 6
there's a link to it in the upper
left-hand corner and if you want to see
all the tutorials in this Android
development tutorial playlist then look
at the link in the upper right hand
corner now I'm mainly going to create
everything that's needed in the main
activity dot Java file in this tutorial
and then in the next tutorial I'll
finish up everything else that's left
after that so let's get into it okay so
the last time I left you off we had this
guy was what we were planning on
creating and in this part that you total
I'm pretty much going to create
everything here because last time I just
left you with an interface that pretty
much doesn't do anything so as I look at
this tool here that we have what exactly
am I going to have to do well I'm not
going to have to do anything with this
textview area over here where it says
enter symbol so I'm not going to have to
create that however I'm going to be
getting input from this editable text
area and I'm going to have to get
information from this button as well as
these other two buttons and then this
whole entire thing is a scroll view so
like for example if I type in Microsoft
in here and then come back up here and
hit enter it's going to pop in right
here so I'm going to have to figure out
how to populate this scroll view so all
that information works and then on top
of that I'm going to have to set it up
so that if they click on the web button
right here it's going to automatically
send an intent to open up the web
browser and get me more information on
Microsoft just like it did right there
so knowing all of those different things
I know that I need to create the edit
text stock symbol edit text editable
text area and be able to catch any type
of click events or any events in general
that it would issue I'm also going to
have to create click listeners for enter
stock symbol button as well and also we
have another button which is delete all
symbols which is down here which if I
click on that it's going to delete
everything and that's called delete
stock stocks button on top of that if I
want this information that I store
inside of here to remain there whenever
the application closes and then reopens
I need to set up share
preferences and what that's going to do
is save key value pairs for me I'm also
going to have to update my scroll view
and that's going to be with any new
stocks and also save those new stocks
inside of shared preferences and I'm
also going to have to display a web page
dynamically that's going to use the
stock that they enter and then on top of
that let's say they come in here and
they just hit enter and it won't enter a
symbol see this little dialog box pops
up here with an inner message I'm also
going to have to set up that dialog box
so that's just a sampling of all the
different things I need to create in
this and I'm just going to close this
out let's get into the code ok so here
we are inside of mainactivity.java and
that is where we're going to create all
the programming for our main activity
where everything's going to start and
that of course is in the source folder
right here and all the code is available
in a link underneath the video actually
all the code from the whole entire
tutorial is available there so what am I
going to need to do well let's just go
through here and I'm gonna throw in a
whole bunch of things that I either do
need or may need either way it's very
important to think about all these
different things whenever you're writing
a program now one thing I might want to
do is to store a unique message using my
package name to avoid any conflicts that
is going to represent the stock symbols
that I am going to be working with or in
this situation the current stock symbol
that I am working with because that
would be very useful to be able to pass
over whenever I want the webpage the
open or whenever I want to parse XML so
if you want to do that we're just going
to go calm example and then in this
situation I'm going to call this stock
quote stock right like that
and this information will be available
to any of the other activities if I
should you need to use it now I also
said that I want to use shared
preferences so that I will be able to
store a key value pairs so that whenever
the application is closed I'll be able
to reopen all of these stocks that were
previously entered because that's very
useful to do that we're just going to go
shared preferences and I'm going to call
this stock symbols entered and of course
it gives me a little error message and I
just have to zoom in here and go import
shared preferences now on top of that
I'm also going to be using a table row
inside of my scroll view that is going
to hold all my stock symbols and buttons
or a table layout so I'm also going to
define
that because I'm going to need it to be
able to update my scroll view and go
bounce out and import that as well and
then we have our editable text areas
edit text and if we bounce over here
into layout activity main and double
click on that and then scroll down
inside of this thing you're going to see
an editable text area and it is called
stock symbol edit text so I'm just going
to copy that because I like to use the
same exact name so that I don't get
confused because I'm easily confused
sometimes and then import the edit text
library we need I'm also going to want
to do the same thing with buttons and
like I said before I'm going to need to
create a button inside of here that's
going to handle whenever a new stock is
either entered or whenever we want to
delete all of them and if we pop over
inside of here we can go into the
graphical layout click on enter and then
if I come over into this guy enter stock
symbol bla bla bla button I can just
copy that and then bounce back over into
activity main and paste that in there
and there we go I got the same name
again and I'm also going to come in here
and do the same thing for delete stocks
button and make sure we spell that right
ok so I have all those set up and that's
pretty much all I need to setup at this
point in time so I'm now going to go
into on create and initialize everything
so that everything works whenever we
start our application because this is
going to be where all the magic starts
now the very first thing I'm going to
want to do is retrieve any save stocks
that have been entered by the user and
to do that I'm going to go stock symbols
entered is equal to and that guy comes
from this stock symbols entered right
there and then to get them I just need
to go get shared preferences and what am
I going to get I'm going to get the
stock list so I'm going to go stock list
and then after that what there's a
couple different things you can put here
you can put mode private and what that
means is that this data is only going to
ever be accessible by your application
and this is the most common thing
anybody ever does and the other two
options that are available would be mode
world readable which would mean that it
would be readable pretty much by
anything and the other option is mode
world writable and on top of that you
could actually declare that it's both
readable and writable by putting this
little pipe symbol inside of there and
that's just in case you want to do that
but mode private is
only the most common thing to use here
in this situation then what I want to do
is initialize all the different
components that I have so I'm going to
have stock table scroll view I'm going
to have stock symbol edit text and all
these different guys so I'm just going
to copy those so I don't make any typos
come back down inside here and paste
those in there then just get rid of all
this extraneous information and then to
set up this table layout I need to go
table layout then I'm going to go find
view by ID then we're going to go R
which is a reference to this R Java file
that's over here inside the gen folder
this is where all of the different IDs
for every single component is going to
be stored and never mess with that and
then I just go ID dot and then all the
information actually pops up inside of
here so I'm looking for stock table
scroll view and there it is and there we
are now that's been initialized now to
save some time just going to copy this
and paste that in here for all these
different pieces ok so the next thing we
got to setup is the stock symbol edit
text area and I'm just going to call it
edit text and then come down inside of
here and it's going to be stock symbol
at a text of course because that's the
name I had before and there it is then
we have our button setup so I'm just
going to go button and I'm going to do
button here as well and then get rid of
this put in a period and guess what it's
called it's called enter stock symbol
button so just come over here and go
enter stock symbol button and there it
is then we're gonna do the same thing
here except here we're gonna go delete
stocks button come over here delete
stocks button see there it is so you
don't have to think that much whenever
you write down all the different names
for all your different components that's
what I have sitting in front of me
normally whatever I'm doing this so what
else did I say I need to do after I
initialize all these different things
well I'm gonna have to come in here and
set up click listeners for these two
buttons so that's pretty easy so we're
just going to go it enter stock symbol
button and to add the click listener I'm
just going to go set on click listener
and then I'm gonna go enter stock button
listener just like that and of course it
gives me an error because that hasn't
been created yet and then I'm pretty
much going to do the same thing here for
my next button except this is going to
be delete stocks button and then here
I'm going to go the same exact thing I'm
going to go delete stocks button
listener save that and then after this
I'm going to update all my save stock
lists for my scrollview there's another
method that I'm
have to create here in a second it's
going to be update saved stock list and
I'm just going to pass it a value of
null because this is going to update the
scroll view area if null is passed in
and otherwise it is going to add a new
stock to the scroll view if null isn't
entered in instead we have a string go
inside of that actually I'm just going
to create it right now so you see
exactly what I mean
so let's say I go private void update
saved stock list and like I said it's
going to receive a string which is going
to be a new stock symbol that we want to
add to our scroll view then the very
first thing what I want to do is have a
string array inside of here that's going
to hold all my different stocks and what
it's going to do is get all my saved
stocks that were saved from before if
they exist and to do that I'm just going
to go stock symbols entered and I'm
going to go get all key set and then I'm
going to convert them into an array and
I'm going to say that this is going to
be a series of strings that have been
entered into this guy and of course make
sure I spell this right so stock symbols
entered and of course stock symbols
entered comes from this guy right here
stock symbols entered say it's coming
from the shared preferences which have
the key value pairs inside of them okay
so now that I got that set up I'm going
to sort all of my stocks in alphabetical
order so that I will be able to display
them and they will be easily searchable
if we have a bazillion stocks on this
I'm just gonna go stocks string and then
you just go case-insensitive order which
is just going to ignore the case of the
characters whenever the sorting process
goes on and then what I need to do is
make sure that null wasn't entered like
it was right here say this guy so I'm
going to have to handle that situation
so if new stock symbol is not equal to
null well that means a new stock symbol
has been entered that I need to put into
my scroll view so if I want to do that
I'm just going to go insert stock in
scroll view and go new stock symbol and
I can go arrays binary search stocks and
what this is going to do is put them in
order inside of the array
I'm gonna go new stock symbol don't try
to memorize all this stuff just there's
a lot of copy and pasting you can do and
in a second I'm going to create this
method right here insert stock in scroll
view so let's move this up a little bit
now else in that situation that means
they entered null and in that situation
I just want to output all of these save
stocks so I'm just gonna go I less than
stocks length and then just increment
that and then in that situation I'm
gonna go insert stock in scroll view
again because we want all those stocks
to be displayed and here we can just
display them one by one and also say
what index they're going to go into
because this guy up here is handling
putting them in alphabetical order up
there and there we go
now I'm going to have to create insert
stock and scroll view here in a second
but the first thing I'm going to want to
do is to provide a way to save my stock
symbols so I'm going to create a method
here called private void save stock
symbol and it's going to receive a
string which is going to be a new stock
and the very first thing I want to do is
check if this stock is indeed new so I'm
going to go stock symbols to make sure
that we don't enter the same stock
symbol multiple times and I'm just going
to go get string new stock null and then
I'm going to come in and go shared
preferences and call editor and what
editor is going to do is it's going to
be used to store my key value pairs now
in this situation the key and the value
are both going to be a stock symbol but
of course we could go in here and put
the stocks name the Corporations name or
whatever you'd want but either way just
to keep everything simple I'm just going
to keep it this way right now and I'm
just going to go preferences editor is
equal to I'm gonna go stock symbols
entered and edit now that we have that
set up I can go preferences editor put
string new stock and then and this is
going to be new stock as well because
remember I said the key and the value
are going to be exactly the same which
really isn't that uncommon and then I'm
going to go preferences editor apply
which is going to store the key value
pairs inside of there and there we go
and then what I'm going to do is if this
is a new stock I want to make sure that
I add all of my components for it so I'm
going to go
I'm going to go is stock new this guy
right here I'm going to go null and then
in this situation I'm going to go update
saved stock list and pass in new stock
to that and of course update save stock
list is this guy right here and that is
just going to pass that stock in there
just like we did before now the next
thing I need to do is create inserts
talk in my scroll view so I'm just going
to come back down here and I'm going to
go private void and then paste that in
there and this guy is going to receive a
string which is the stock and it's also
going to receive an array index for
where and the array it should be stored
then I'm going to have to get the layout
inflator to inflate my laid out is equal
to and to do that I'm going to go get
system service context then we go layout
inflator service and then come down
inside of here and go import and then
you're going to do the same thing for
layout inflator and make sure that
that's set for layout inflator and
that's that for layout inflator then
come down here and go import and there
we go
and now what the layout inflator is
going to allow me to do is actually to
set or create a stock row from this guy
over here layout stock quote row
remember these guys will click on
graphical layout remember this is going
to have the stock symbol there's that
stock symbol and here's the quote in the
web dynamically what the inflator is
going to allow me to do is to set this
guy right here inside of my scroll view
and of course the scroll view is going
to be this guy remember there were a
whole bunch of different stocks listed
here that's a scroll view so it's going
to take this row and dynamically insert
them inside of there every single time a
new stock centered and to do that we're
going to have to go view new stock row
inflator inflate then I'm going to go
our layout stock quote row which stock
quote row that's this guy up here comma
and then I'm just going to throw it all
inside there don't worry about that and
then of course come in here and get all
these libraries as well and now that we
have all that setup what I'm going to do
is create the text view for my scroll
view row and this is all done pretty
much dynamically so I'm going to go text
view new
stalk textview is equal to now of course
we're going to cast this to textview
then go new stock row dot find view by
ID just like before I'm going to go r
dot ID dot and then this is going to be
stock symbol textview so just come in
here and go stock symbol textview there
it is okay then put a semicolon at the
end and you're done with that now what I
want to do is actually add the stock
symbol to my new stock symbol textview
area and of course that's just set text
we've used that a couple times for and
I'm just going to put stock in there and
there that is that text U is set we
don't need do anything else with it then
I'm going to need to initialize my
buttons so I got stock if you look at
these guys here this is what I'm working
with stock quote button this guy right
here well I'm just going to come over
here and go stock quote button C using
the same exact names again pop back over
into this no use some type and O's out
and actually I'm going to pop back over
here again and go quote from web button
come down here and copy that as well
and then bounce back over cuz we're
gonna have to initialize both those
buttons and there we go I'm just gonna
copy this save myself some time paste
that in there base that in there except
of course these are going to be buttons
most everything else is gonna be about
the same here we're gonna go stock quote
button just copy that there because it
has the same name as it has over in the
actual interface we created and then
we're gonna do the exactly the same
thing here for the quote from web button
it's nice thing again keep the names the
same least it works for me some people
hate doing that and then if I also want
to set up click listeners for these guys
just going to go stock quote button just
like we did before set on click listener
and here I got to create this in a
little bit get stock activity listener
which we have to create that and pretty
much same thing for the quote from web
button base that their base that there
and this is just going to be changed to
get stock from website listener which
I'm also going to have to create here in
a second and then after I have all of
those guys set up I'm going to come up
here to the
view that I'm creating new stock row and
then after I have all of that set up I
want to go to my scroll view
which is way up here there we go stock
table scroll view then come way down
here and add this new view to it and to
do that I just go add view and it's
going to be new stock row and array
index which is just going to be the
order it's going to be inside of my
scroll view so pretty neat so then I'm
just going to look at all these little
red marks over here and figure out what
I missed so let's just scroll it up and
I'm going to create all these other
different methods enter stock button
listener okay seems like a good enough
place to start so I'm just going to copy
that come down here and I'm going to
handle that by going public on click
listener enter stock button listener and
then go new on click listener and just
do this in line of course you have to
get libraries and of course come down to
the end put a semicolon and then it's
going to give you a little error message
you need to add unimplemented methods no
problem does that for you then you just
need to define what you want to do
whenever somebody clicks on that button
which is also going to be pretty easy
first thing I want to do is to check if
there's a stock symbol that has been
entered into my edit text field and to
do that you're just going to go if stock
symbol edit text and then go get text if
you want to get the text out of it and
then you can also check the length of
that text to see if it's greater than 0
which means that there's some
information stored in there which means
there's a stock symbol inside of it and
in that situation what I want to do is
save the new stock and add its
components so just go save stock symbol
which we created earlier here screwed up
see stave stock symbol this guy we just
have to put our new stock symbol inside
of there to get this guy to work and all
we need to do is go into this guy's and
a point and typing it out again that's
the edit text field and if I want to get
the value that's inside of there I'm
just going to go get text of course and
then I'm going to convert it into a
string in there that's going to enter it
inside of there and then if I want to
clear my edit text box after I do that
no problem I'm just going to come in
here paste set my text to nothing I'm
covering a whole bunch of different ways
of doing things inside this tutorial
then on top of that
let's say that I want to force the
keyboard to close so that we can see the
whole entire scroll view that is
completely filled with stocks well if
you want to do that just go input method
manager I mm is equal to and definitely
don't memorize this input method manager
and then get system service and then
inside of that put context input method
service I believe right yeah yes indeed
all right yes okay and then of course
get some libraries and that's going to
force close the keyboard for you and
then to actually force this keyboard to
close you just go I mmm hide soft input
from window and then window token is
going to be stock symbol edit text this
situation paste that in there and then
you're gonna have to go get window token
like that and then you're going to for
flags just put 0 inside of there and
then you're done with that now else if
stock symbol edit text area is not
greater than 0 which means they didn't
enter anything now I'm going to show you
how to create a dialog box
an alert dialog box to do so you're
going to go alert dialog builder and I'm
just going to call this builder is equal
to a new alert dialog builder and then
you're going to go main activity dot
this and now that we have that created
we can come in here and set the alert
title for example and you saw that
before whenever I try to enter nothing
and clicked on enter whenever I was
putting a stock inside of their set
title of course is called set title and
to do so I'm actually going to pull
something that I put into my strings.xml
file which is invalid stock symbol which
you can see right there there it is now
that I have that set I can also come in
and set the value for a positive
reaction from the user so something that
would be considered positive which is
basically going to be true or false or
however you want to refer to it but one
thing you could do is use ok r dot
string and then
put a period and okay and there it is
and then finally putting all inside of
here there we go that's the positive
reaction then if I want to also put a
message inside of the dialog box I just
go set message and I go whatever it was
that I stored in my strings dot XML file
dot let's see what this a missing stock
symbol which is this guy so that's the
message it's going to show up and then
if I want the alert dialog box to be
displayed I just go alert dialog the
alert dialog is equal to builder dot
create like that and then we're going to
go the alert dialog show and that puts
it on the screen that's how you create
alert dialog boxes inside of Android now
something else I'm going to want to do
before I forget about it is to come in
here and show you how to delete all the
stocks that are inside of my scroll view
extremely easy just go private void and
we're gonna call this delete all stocks
like that and to delete all the stocks
so I'm just going to go stock table
scroll view which is the name of my
scroll view and we go remove all views
because all of those table rows are set
up as views and there you go that's all
you need to do that will delete
everything in the scroll view area now
let's get back to all these other red
dashes so I'm going to have to come up
here to this one and there's another one
delete stocks button listener to come
way back down here now that way you have
delete all stocks set up that's going to
be a lot easier here we're just going to
go public on click list Center and paste
in delete stocks button listener is
equal to new on click listener like that
don't forget put semicolon air and
pretty much going to do exactly the same
thing on click listener add-on
implemented methods just like that very
convenient and then for this guy to get
him to work all I need to do is called
bleed all stocks so get that base that
inside of there
bleed all stocks there you go that's how
to clear up that scroll view and then of
course if I delete all the stocks out of
the scroll view I also wanted to clear
out all of the information that's in my
shared preferences file and to do that
I'm just going to
Oh shared preferences editor preferences
editor is equal to and what do I want to
delete here stock symbols entered dot
edit like that semicolon and then to
delete everything I'm just going to go
preferences editor paste that there and
go clear and then you have to put apply
in there as well and that's that okay so
now that bleep button works as well so
now what do we got to do we got to come
back up here to these little red dots
figure out what else I forgot get stock
activity listener sounds like a good
thing to cover copy that boom down here
do the same thing again then this guy's
gonna be public it's gonna be the same
thing so it's just copy that's all in
click listener don't want you to think
there's anything different here paste
that in there got that then we're gonna
go new as well just copy this as well
onclicklistener copy paste that in there
and there we go come down here put a
semicolon come over here add-on
implemented methods got it plead all
that information roll that out of space
anyway
and we have to figure out what we want
to do so if they want to go and get the
stock information which is gonna be the
parsed XML data I'm gonna set this up
right now even though we're not gonna
really get into it right now
but what I want to do is I want to get
the text that's going to be saved in my
text view next to the clicked button and
what that is is going to be the stock
symbol remember I'd had the symbol here
and it had two buttons next to it I want
what's in the text view which is going
to be the stock symbol so to get that
I'm going to go table row and I'm going
to call this table row is equal to cast
this to table row and then I'm going to
say that I want to get the parent item
for that guy and then I'm going to go
text view stock text view cast at the
text view and then inside of this what I
want to do is search for the matching ID
which is going to be the text view
that's going to contain the stock symbol
that I want to look up hopefully that
makes sense sort of a roundabout way of
grabbing the stock symbol but it's also
kind of an interesting sort of thing to
know about if you ever need to do that
its stock symbol text view there it is
and then put a semicolon at the end and
now that I have this text view I come in
and go string and to get
a stock symbol I'm just going to go
stock textview like that and then go get
text and I can get the stock symbol that
it saved inside of that text view area
so it's kind of a neat thing to do and
there we go and then if I want to start
a new activity I need to create an
intent intent to start a new activity
and I'm going to go main activity this
and then the class that I want to call
is going to be called stock info
activity and like I said its class and
that is the guy that's going to startup
that is the goal anyway of course for an
equals sign in there and then of course
import my libraries that I need okay and
this guy is going to allow me to open
this new activity it's going to have all
this stock information inside of it
which is going to be really cool then
what I want to do is if I want to pass
over the stock symbol which of course I
do if I want to figure out what XML file
to dig up and then parse so if you want
to pass information to the new activity
you're about ready to open you just go
intent put extra and this is where stock
symbol going to come up here and the
value I'm going to save that as is going
to be the stock symbol which is the
string that I took out of that textview
so that's stock symbol and that's going
to pass that into the new activity that
I'm going to be creating and in the next
part of tutorial going to create this
part which is going to make everything
work then after I have all that set up
to start a new activity I just go start
activity and then pass in intent and
there that is now the only other thing
that I think I got here though the red
mark is or is it there it is how are we
going to get the browser window to open
up whenever we click on it and show news
for our stock oh here I'm going to go
public on click listener just repetition
from doing this all the time make you
remember most of this stuff and of
course this is new on listener like
da-da-da-da-da like the got that set up
and what I want to do if I want to open
up my browser window add-on implemented
methods with my stock news information
I'm going to come in to the on click
area and we're going to be using an
intent
again to do this basically what I want
to do is grab the symbol out of the
textview just like we did before I can
put this in a separate method all by
itself and I probably would do this in
real life
but either way for now this is going to
work so basically going to do the same
thing again which if you didn't quite
get it the stock quote row this right
here is a textview say i have this
called textview and these are going to
be dynamically populated inside of
activity main.xml all in a row so what
I'm doing here is saying that I want to
get a table row creating that I want to
get a parent for the current view where
the click listener was triggered so this
is the table row that is going to
contain the web button that was clicked
here's the web button this is surrounded
by a table row see this is the guy that
I want so basically I'm saying is I want
to get the parent table row that
surrounds the web button that you just
clicked that's what this does right
there then from that I want to get the
text view that's inside of that same
table row and then I want to get the
string of text that's inside of the text
view and save it as a strength okay so
if you didn't get the first time
probably at that time if not again leave
a message then what I'm going to do is
because I want to open up a URL I'm
going to call this stock URL inside of a
web browser I'm gonna go get string and
I want to get the web address that I'm
going to be pulling this information
from and I have that saved in
strings.xml and it's Yahoo stock URL so
there that is and then at the end of
that I want to put the stock symbol and
that is how I am going to get that
information since I haven't really
looked at it here that much let's go
over here to strings.xml double-click on
that and where is Yahoo there it is see
Yahoo stock URL and this is the URL that
I went to open and right after this s
right here is where my stock symbol is
going to go ok so that's what that is
pretty cool so now that I have the URL
that I want to open I just need to
create another
intention to get the browser to open up
the URL that I just created here I'm
gonna call it get stock web page and I'm
going to go new intent intent and to
trigger the browser to open you're going
to go action view comma you RI dot parse
and pass annular stalk URL put a
semicolon at the end and then to start
the browser window just go start
activity and pass in get stock web page
so there is fifty million different ways
to do a whole bunch of different things
a lot of fun making this tutorial course
all the codes available link underneath
the video and the whole entire finished
program is also available to link
underneath the video it's all free of
course the next part of the tutorial I'm
gonna handle creating the other activity
which is going to parse all the XML data
and finish up the whole entire project
please leave any questions or comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
