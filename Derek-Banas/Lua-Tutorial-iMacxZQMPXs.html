Lua video tutorial in this one tutorial
you're gonna learn pretty much
everything you could ever want to know
about the Lua programming language and
into the description underneath the
video I have a cheat sheet that has
everything that I talked about in this
tutorial and I have a lot to do so let's
get into it
okay so first thing you're going to want
to do is install Lua so you can either
install these binary files here you can
just go to Lua
- users dot org forward slash wiki /lu
binaries like that or if you're on
Windows you could go to code.google.com
/p Lua for Windows you can use either
one of those I am on OS X doesn't really
matter everything here is going to be is
exactly the same no matter what
operating system you're on but you can
see right here is everything going to
need to install and you should have no
problem with that so let's start writing
some code ok so on the left side of the
screen I have where I'm going to be
inputting all the code basic text editor
sublime on the right side I have my
terminal and if you are on Windows this
would be your command line so let's just
jump right in here and you're going to
have the extension of Lua for all of
your files and this is just Lua Tut Lua
right like that
now let's do a hello world so we're
going to say print hello world just that
simple
save that jump over here and this is how
we're going to execute our programs just
Lua and then the name of your Lua file
and boom hello world so hello world is
out of the way that is how you would
print to the terminal now you're going
to be able to make comments just like
this or you can make multi-line comments
like this you can see how they popped up
right there so multi-line and there we
go
comments are out of the way now your
variable names can't start with a number
but they are going to be able to contain
letters numbers and underscore and we
just create one right like this
basically Lua is going to dynamically
type based off of whatever you save in
this variable so this automatically
becomes a string because this is a
string right here and your strings of
course can either be double quotes or
you could have them be single quotes
doesn't really matter another way for
you to be able to print stuff out and
is to go io right like this and you
could say something like size of string
and then you could separate that if you
wanted to put the string inside of here
and on top of that let's say that we
also want to get the size or number of
characters in our strings we would just
put a number sign and name in this
situation and then there's going to be a
bunch of things you can backslash this
is going to be a new line right this is
just a short easy way for us to be able
to throw a new line in here which is
just going to skip us to the next line
there's a couple other little back
slashes you can use there's new line of
course you can also do a backspace you
could do a tab of course you're going to
need a way to be able to print a
backslash inside of something like i/o
right you're also going to be able to
print quotes double quotes like this and
also single quotes and those will be
used in situations in which you have
double quotes here but you want to put a
double quote would say right here that
would allow you to do that and we need
to do this because otherwise it would
not know where the string ended and if
we file save that executes it you can
see size of string is 5 that
automatically prints out for you now an
interesting thing here is even though
this is defined as a string currently we
can just as easily come in here and go
name is equal to 4 like that and that is
not an error so you'll be able to start
off as a string and then convert the
data or the variable over into an
integer we could then come in here and
say something like my name is and name
like that you see my name is 4 comes out
there no errors are thrown other
programming languages would throw errors
however now Lua only has floating-point
numbers or what they call just simple
numbers and the biggest integer that you
could store inside of Lua is this
gigantic guy right here and if we can go
and add one to that you're going to see
that indeed that is true so let's go and
try to print one more than what we have
there with big num and you can see it
comes back out as a negative number so
this is as big as it gets in regards to
integers you could easily come in here
and then check the type of this variable
by just surrounding it with type and
calling the function type jump over here
and you can see big number prints out
there
number prints out right there so you can
see that everything integers or
floating-point numbers are all
considered just basic numbers inside of
Lua
now as we all know floating-point
numbers or as some of us do anyway
floating-point numbers are not
necessarily precise so let's come in
here and check the precision basically
with a floating-point number you're
going to have your digits be precise up
to 13 digits so that just means like
this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 like
that and then we could come in and add
another digit to it so it's just throw
in 12 zeros and then tack 5 onto the end
of it and float precision and you can
see that it is precise indeed right to
that point if however we tacked on
another additional digit onto there and
reran that you're going to see that it
lost precision so your floating-point
numbers are precise up to 13 digits
which is normally more than enough now
let's say that we wanted to come in here
and create a string that is going to go
over multiple different lines and at the
same time also keep any white space that
you would type inside of here you would
just put those two opening brackets like
that and you could type in I ma or ever
write like this and you're going to see
if you run this it's going to not only
print out the whole entire string but
also pay attention any white space and
any new lines that would occur within
that long string let's go in here and
throw in another string there's my name
if you wanted to combine or concatenate
strings inside of lua you can just go a
long string like this is equal to and
let's just use long string here you
would just put two dots inside of there
and name take that throw that in here
instead and you can see that it went in
there and automatically tacked on the
other string just with this little
operator that we have right there just
so we can cover other data types that
are available we also have boolean z' so
able to drive let's say we want to
monitor that and a boolean is going to
either allow us to use a value of true
or a value of false and of course we
could come in here and also check the
type of this so is able to drive like
this you can see it comes back as
boolean another thing that's a little
bit odd about Lua it
doesn't go out of its way to try and
show you error so let's come in here and
let's try and get a type of made-up
variable so made-up variable has been
basically just created right there in
that line it's not been defined with any
value and you're going to see right here
that everything in lua by default gets
the value of nil if it does not get a
value assigned specifically by you
inside of your code there's a rundown of
a lot of what you need to know about
variables now let's go and take a look
at some math functions okay so basic
math functions we have in little we can
add subtract multiply divide and this is
the modulus and let's just go ahead and
save that and execute it and you're
going to see exactly the results we're
able to produce here just pay attention
that this is a modulus operation right
here and not what is commonly known as a
remainder operator if it was a remainder
operator it would actually give the
value of 2.2 and this just is the
remainder of a division by 3 so what it
does is automatically cuts that off to
just make you aware that everything else
here is pretty straightforward in
regards to this basic mathematical
operations it's also important to know
that you cannot perform common shorthand
notation like let's say we had number
plus plus can't do that you can't do
negative negative and of course if you
can't do those you're not going to be
able to use this or this just common
things that are in other languages that
Lua does not have currently and this is
version 5.3 of Lewis so it's the most
current at least as I'm speaking right
here another thing you can't do is this
type of short notation which is normally
equivalent to number is equal to number
plus 1 if you want to do this inside of
lua you are actually going to have to
instead type that out there's a whole
bunch of built-in math operations inside
of lua these are some of the most common
ones that you're ever going to see see
right here we have floor ceiling max min
sine cosine dah-dah-dah-dah and i'll
show you some examples of how all of
those work here's a whole bunch of math
functions we're gonna check the flooring
the ceiling the max minimum power and
square root see exactly how all those
operate the only difference between
floor and ceiling is the floor is going
to round this number down ceiling is
going to round it up and you can see
here max
give me the maximum men's going to give
you the minimum and there's power and
square root functions as well something
that's rather neat is using random
numbers and you will probably use random
numbers a lot in your programs let's go
in here and generate a random number
right now so let's just go right and you
would do that with math dot random right
like this and let's say that we want to
come in here and generate a random
number between 0 &amp;amp; 1 random and that is
all that we would do but that's a little
bit boring you may also have noticed
here there's no semicolons at the end
you could put semicolons in there but
they are not needed in any way let's go
instead and create a random number
between 1 and 10 we just come in here
type in 10 and then you could also come
in here and also define random numbers
in very specific ranges so let's say we
wanted to go random number between 5 and
100 there you go 5 and 105 and 106 acute
those they all work pretty simply the
thing that is kind of useful is we're
going to be able to set our seed value
and that is just going to help us
calculate a random value and how we do
that is just go math.random seed and the
best way to do that is to use OS dot
time right like that and that is going
to generate for us a nice random value
the thing that is interesting is we can
come in here and print our float values
another way so let's just use print I'm
going to be bouncing around a lot just
to show you all the different ways we
can use these things if we wanted to
format a string we just go string format
and let's say that we wanted to get pi
is equal to and then we wanted to import
directly into our string a value and
let's say that we wanted it to be 10
decimal places long F for float right
like this and we could also get the
value of pi by calling the math library
right like this you're going to see that
we got the value of pi to 10 digits
automatically sort it out for us also
however be aware that this is only going
to have a precision of 13 digits
anything over that and it's going to
start watching itself up and that's just
the way floating-point numbers work in
almost every programming language okay
so now that we got the math
functions out of the way let's take a
look at conditionals okay whenever we're
using conditional statements we're going
to have relational operators as well as
logical operators and the relational
operator is going to be greater than
less than greater than or equal to less
than or equal to this is the funky one
well that's fine that's just equal but
not equal is actually going to be tilde
and equal to very important remember
that just tilde and equal to this one
right here which you may be aware of is
not used then your logical operators are
going to be and or or not spelled out
exactly like that and I'm going to
demonstrate how all of these work so
let's say you have an age which is equal
to 13 and let's take a look at if
statements and how they work now we're
going to be able to perform certain
operations depending upon the value of
age here we're going to swing to say if
age is less than 16 then make sure you
put then inside of there you're going to
see it automatically indents we're going
to say right and something like you can
go to school another thing to be aware
of is any variable that we would define
inside of our if statements for
statements functions so forth and so on
or to called
local variables and that just means that
they are local to this if statement and
the value that is set here cannot be
found outside of the of statement more
on that here in a second now if this if
statement doesn't come back is true
maybe we want to check something else so
we would go else if write like that no
space between there and then we could
say something like age is less than or
equal to 16 and let's say that we want
to check a couple things well this is
where our logical operators come in we
can say and and we could check another
one age is less than or equal to let's
just like it less than 18 like this then
make sure we put our then statement in
there and then we can come in here and
print something else out so we could say
something like you can drive and then
finally as a default we would use else
throw something else in there and you
can say something like you can vote
another thing we have to remember is
anytime we have an if statement we
always want to use end there whenever it
is finished now let's jump back to this
guy as well as also check out exactly
what goes on here if we would go
print like this and we would go local
variable you see what happens here
let's wrote this you can go to school
but this comes back as nil like I said
once you define a variable inside of
here a local variable this is inside of
the if statement and it cannot be
accessed anywhere outside of the if
statement and we're going to see more
about that later on just want to make
you aware of it now we come in here and
play around with logical statements a
little bit more just so we can check out
how all of them work say we want to
check if age is less than 14 and we
could use or which is going to give you
a value of true and then operate with
whatever is after the then statement if
one or the other of these is true say
age is greater than 67 like this and you
could just keep on going you can go I oh
right like this just keep shock just
keep typing everything's going to work
say like you shouldn't work and then we
can continue on the same line and then
end and don't forget to come in here and
put an age in like that and come up here
and execute it and you can see you
shouldn't work comes back because 13 is
the value right here this comes back is
true which means that we are going to
print you shouldn't work out onto the
screen now you can do this but it kindly
gets sloppy so watch out there just
wanted to demonstrate how the logical
operator works and also make you aware
that you may see people use really
sloppy long statements like that now
we're going to also be able to come in
here and format or convert from multiple
different variable types to other
different variable types so let's just
come in here and go print and string and
then use format again and I'm going to
demonstrate the night logical operator
as well so let's say not true what will
that do well I'm going to come in here
and if you want to put a string inside
of here you would just put a % and an S
like that however we're going to have to
convert our bowl into a string and how
we do a cast or conversion to a string
you can throw anything inside of here
throw a number or whatever and you can
see right here the not true part right
there if we save that you can see that
not true this logical operator before
the value of true is going to give us a
value of false you can also see how the
boolean
this guy right here was converted to a
string so we could use it inside of our
print statement now there is no ternary
operator inside of Lua and a ternary
operator normally looks like something
like can vote is equal to age greater
than 18 like this and otherwise false
that's what a ternary operator looks
like in other programming languages and
it basically just says if age is greater
than 18 we want to assign the value of
true to the variable can vote otherwise
we want to assign the value of false to
the variable can vote so we can't do
that however we can pretty much knock it
off inside of Lua how we would do that
is go can vote is equal to and we could
go age is greater than 18 and true or
false so it looks very similar to the
ternary operator and it works exactly
like the ternary operator and we could
say can I vote and we come in here and
go to string again and can vote let's
change this to can vote and you can see
right here the answer comes back as
false so there's an example of how we
can use conditional statements or
if-else and else as well as knock off a
ternary operator and it's also good to
know that there is no such thing as
switch inside of lua but you can also
basically knock that off with if and
else statements now let's go and take a
look at some strings and ways that we
can work with them okay so I went and
created a really really long string
right here for us to be able to play
around with and I'm just going to do a
couple simple little string operations
that are common and then as the tutorial
continues I'll cover some more so let's
go and say that we wanted to do
something like get the quote length
right like this we could come in and go
string uh deli N and then throw a quote
inside of there and then make sure we
separate everything with commas and you
can see right there the quote length
comes back at a hundred and eleven
characters we come in here also and see
that we can just go like this and throw
the number sign inside of there
and get exactly the same result this is
the most common way to check the number
of characters that you have in your
string by the way you could also come in
here and replace certain strings so
let's say what we wanted
replace and this is going to be bad
English but replace I with me for
example we could then go string dot G
sub like this and then you're going to
put inside of there the string that
you're going to want to change and the
value that you're going to want to
change and then the value you're going
to want to replace that with so we'll
say me instead like that and always make
sure that you close off all of your
brackets so make sure you have a closing
one for this one and file save and
execute you're going to see right here
replace I with me and it went and
changed all of the versions of I inside
of this great big giant string to me
instead so it says me change my password
incorrect and da-da-da-da-da another
thing that we can do is find any
matching indexes everything inside of in
regards to strings is going to have an
index every character so this is going
to have the index of zero this space
right here is going to have the index of
one this is going to have the index of
two and we'll be able to search through
this great big giant long quote and find
out exactly what the index is so we
could say something like index of the
word password and we're going to use
string dot find and again we're going to
pass in the string that we are going to
be searching for and then the word that
we're going to be searching for which in
this situation is going to be password
make sure we put a little comment side
of there and you can see right here
index of password is 14 so that's 14
characters into our great big giant long
quote is the location of a word password
and two other little simple things we
can do let's say that we wanted to make
all of these characters inside of our
quote uppercase we could just put string
upper or lowercase we could just go
string dot lower save that execute and
you can see right here made everything
uppercase and everything lowercase we're
going to get more into strings here in a
second but let's go and jump in and take
a look at looping and how that works
inside of lua i'm going to start off
with a while loop and what we're going
to need to do is initialize or create a
variable that is going to define the
starting value that we're going to be
leave looping through and then we're
going to say something like while i the
value of i is less than or equal to ten
we want to continue looping through or
executing code inside of our while loop
so let's just say we got IO right and we
just want to print out the value of I
there you go and inside your while loop
you're of course going to have to
increment the value of I remember we
can't do something like this not allowed
you have to type everything out and then
let's also say that we would want to
jump completely out of this loop and not
continue looping through it anymore
if for example I has a value of 8 well
then we're going to say something like
break and of course we have to put an
end right there that's going to end our
if statement but then we're going to
need another end that is actually going
to end our while loop and then we could
do something like print and throw a new
line in there see if we execute that
it's going to print out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
and it didn't continue printing up until
9 and 10 because right here we said if
it gets to the value of 8 we want to
jump outside of the loop and stop
executing all together also very
important inside of lua to understand
there is no continue statement so you
might be used to that in other
programming languages but it's not going
to work here another thing we can do and
this is more like the common do-while
loop in other programming languages we
have something else that is called the
repeat statement so we're going to say
repeat and we're going to continue to
execute code inside of here as long as a
condition is true and let's come in here
and also demonstrate exactly how you can
get user input from somebody so enter
your guess like that we could then come
down and store inside of the variable
guess whatever they enter in the
keyboard and that is how easy it is to
get keyboard input just IO dot read then
you're going to come down here and
you're going to define the condition
that this is going to continue looping
now we are going to want to convert the
guest that they made it's automatically
going to be stored as a string so we
want to convert it into a number
remember if we want to convert to
strings we type in string like that but
in this situation we want to convert it
into a number so we're just going to put
guests inside of there and then we're
going to say equals to 15 so this is
going to be a little number guessing
game in which it will continue asking
them for a guess until they enter in 15
we type in
that and then we are enter guess you can
say 10 it's going to continue to ask
until 15 is entered and then it's going
to exit so that is how to convert the
numbers and that is how to use the
repeat until or what is commonly known
as the do-while but inside of lua it's
known as repeat until now let's take a
look at four loops and they're a little
bit different what we're going to do
we're going to define an iterator just
like we did with the while loop
previously and we're going to give it a
starting value then we're going to give
it an ending value and then we're going
to say how much should it increment each
time we're going to put a 1 inside of
there and for that you can put it to you
put anything let's go and print the eye
statement you could also throw a break
statement in there as well you can go
ahead and check out exactly how that
would work and you can see it just
cycled through there and printed out 1
through 10 right on our screen now what
I'm going to do is this is a table which
we're going to talk more about here in a
second but it's basically like an array
in other programming languages it's just
going to be a variable that's going to
allow us to store multiple different
values inside of it and I jumped ahead
to this right now because I want to show
you how easy it is to cycle through all
of these different tables so here we'll
just go for and then we'll say key K for
the key let's just call it key just so
you can say n value because everything
in a table is going to have a key or an
a value or it's going to have an index
by default if you do not sign a key and
we could say something like pairs pairs
doesn't matter you can put anything you
want inside of here it doesn't matter
what the name of that is and we could
say months and then we could say do like
this and then we could cycle through our
table just like we did cycling through
indexes and let's just say in this
situation we just want to print our
values out to the screen and of course
we have to end our for loop right like
this and of course make sure that we put
value inside of there and not V and if
we execute it you're going to say that
it prints out all of the different
months with a space in between each one
of those months and of course we're
going to be able to do more interesting
things with tables and things like that
but this is just a quick way for me to
demonstrate all those things and since I
brought up tables why don't we go take a
look at how a table works basically as I
said tables going to take the place of
arrays dictionaries tuples and such in
other programming languages and how we
can
create a table is just go in here and
say something like a table and then put
two curly brackets like that there you
are there you have a table we could come
in here and add values to the table
using a for loop so we can add them just
you know on their own but this is just a
quick way to throw a whole bunch of
values inside of there so we'll say a
table and everything is going to be
stored inside of an index this is going
to increment through different values of
I and it is going to just assign those
values to I and this is the index so the
very first index in our table is going
to have the value of one just like you
see right there and then of course we're
going to end that and we're going to be
able to come in here then and access
those using the index that we assign so
let's say we want the very first value
stored inside of their index you're
going to see that we have one there once
again because we assigned it that way
could also be 0 or it could be anything
else
and you can see first comes back is 1
right like this so that's one way to
access values inside of a table you
could probably guess exactly how we
would find out the number of items that
we have inside of our table let's just
come in here won't you guess okay times
up and let's just put a number sign and
table inside of there and that is
exactly how we're going to be able to
access those values and you can see a
number of items is equal to 10 just like
you may have thought we could also come
in here and insert a value in the side
of a table we're going to put table
don't let this confuse you a table is
the table table is library we're going
to use here and if we want to insert a
value we just go table insert to find
the table we want to insert into we then
define the index so we want to insert
into and then the value we don't want to
insert and there you consume it didn't
do anything let's come and print that
out and then you'll see it go like this
and first and let's just let that set
for one and we like this and now you can
see the value of the first index inside
of our table is now 0 could also come in
here and change this to 10 you see
everything was moved up as well so
there's 9 instead of 10 which is would
have originally been set for we could
also come in here and take a table and
convert it into a string and then define
how we want all the different items to
be separated let's just use print again
here how we would do that is table
concat concatenate or combine same thing
and table and then we could
on how we want all those items to be
separated let's say we want to be
separated with a comma could do that
come over here and there you can see
exactly how that prints out you can also
see the zeros in there because we
inserted it in there another thing we
can do with tables is remove an item at
a specific index we would just go table
remove and define the table we want to
remove and the index we want to remove
from copy this just so we can print this
out again and you can see we went and
remove the zero out of there and we
could also come in here and create
multi-dimensional arrays so let's go
multi or multi-dimensional table sorry
about that again we're going to create
our table right like this and we'll use
a for loop to come in here and populate
this whole entire thing so we'll say 0
through 9 do then we go I'll tie table
like this we're going to define and
index we want to save inside of there
and that is also going to be a table
create another for loop that is going to
also populate this guy so we'll go 0
through 9 again and do and then a multi
table and we'll say I and you're also
going to be able to come in here and
pull values from these using exactly the
same thing let's say we want to store
them as strings to string I and then we
want to also throw I and J inside of
there
just for the heck of it and then we can
go end and then finally and this for
loop now we're going to be able to come
in and access the values that are stored
inside of there of course by using the
indexes as well so let's say table and
we wanted to get whatever is being
stored at the index of 0 0 inside of our
multi-dimensional array go like this or
alt a dimensional table sorry about that
and we can get 0 and 0 like this and you
can see it comes back as 0 of course we
could come in here and go 1 and to save
that and you get 1 &amp;amp; 2 right like that
that's how everything is stored inside
of the multi-dimensional array and like
I said before we're going to use pretty
much the same exact format for our for
loop as you can see right here to cycle
through and print out all of all items
inside of our table like this and you
can see that every item is printed out
there right there on our screen and
exactly how they are formatted good like
that and you could say the 0 0 index so
this is the zero index where both of
them and the
zero-one and so forth and so on you can
go through and play with that and get a
little bit more aware of exactly how
tables are set up inside of lua and
exactly how to use them
so let's jump over and take a look at
functions okay so a function is going to
allow us to reuse our code as well as
better organize our code and we're going
to just create a function by just typing
in function and then we give it a name
like get some something like that if you
want to pass values into a function to
perform operations on them we can do
something like number one and number two
like that and if you wanted to perform
an operation and then send it back to
whoever called for our function to
operate that is exactly how you would do
it and then you would type in and we
could then come in here and I'm bouncing
back and forth between using print and
the write command just to show you how
to use them and we could do something
like five plus two is equal to if we
want to put a decimal inside of there we
just put a percent sign and ad like that
and then we would call our function with
get some like that and then pass in five
and two separate with a comma and there
you can see our ants aren't exactly how
we're able to call that function now
let's come in and create another
function let's have this one called
split string and it's going to receive a
string passed into it we're then going
to create a string table like this say I
said I'm going to keep coming back to
all these different things I wanted to
define a local variable inside of this
and then let's cycle through the string
and store anything except for spaces
inside of our table how would we do that
well we would go for and our string in
and then we would type in string dot G
match and then pass in the string that
was passed into our function this guy
right here and then if we wanted to
basically capture all the strings up
until the point in which there is a
space what we're going to use is a %
this is going to represent the beginning
of a string or a bunch of characters or
numbers or whatever that's what this
little caret symbol represents and then
a % and s this is what is known as a
regular expression I have tutorials on
regular expressions and I'm probably
going
do another one here pretty soon so
basically what we're saying here is we
want to cycle through the string that
they pass into our function and we want
to start capturing characters up until
we reach a space and that is what we're
going to be storing inside of our string
table you can see here as we execute it
exactly how that's going to work
so we're cycling through the string
we're going to go to string table and I
for the index for our table and we're
going to be pulling out each of those
strings and storing them temporarily in
a variable named str1 and all we need to
do is increment our value for i and then
end okay so we have all of those set up
and now let's also show you how we can
return multiple values from a function
we would just go return and we can
return our string table which is going
to contain a bunch of values but then we
could also send back the number of
matches the total number of words that
we found inside of our string and maybe
this might make more sense if we typed
in word right here and then we typed in
word right here so either way it works
and that's the way it operates and of
course the end or function we put end
and then we'd be able to return or
receive those multiple values that are
returned from this function right here
called split string by just going split
let's just say string table so this
value right here is going to be stored
in this guy right here and then the
number of strings inside of there or a
number of words whatever you want to
call it and then we just call our
function like this and let's just keep
it simple and let's just say something
like turtle let's just pass in two of
those guys we could then come in here
and cycle through everything that was
passed back inside of that table 1 again
number of strings we're going to keep
cycling through there this is the
maximum number of strings and that's the
maximum amount we're going to loop
through do and then we could print out
on the string on the screen let's go and
format this guy and we can print our
index separated by the individual words
that were also passed back inside of
there
so let's see J and then we'll go to
split string table this guy right here
and then throw the index inside of there
find a thing we have to do of course is
and our for loop and if you win inside
of here you can see that it returned the
and turtle and then nil
there's always an extra little nil
inside of there whenever we create
tables and we could of course get rid of
that by just going number a string minus
one and you can see that it just prints
out the thought and turtle that's how to
go in call a function how to have it
return multiple different values how to
split a string into a table and how to
return that value over here and save it
into multiple different variables and
then cycle through it
so there's a whole bunch of different
ways we can use functions inside of lua
let's go and talk about ver attic
functions this is how we're going to be
able to receive an unknown number of
parameters inside of our functions again
just create a function and let's just
call this get some more if we don't know
how many different parameters or
attributes or whatever that could be
sent inside here we're just going to put
three little dots inside of there and we
can do something like local sum is equal
to zero we could then come in and go for
this is the key and this is the value
once again in pairs this is going to be
passed in here as a table then we're
going to put curly brackets one two
three it's going to automatically just
keep cycling through there or depending
upon the number of attributes or
parameters that were passed inside there
you go some is equal to some plus
whatever value is passed inside course
and that with an end and after it's done
go return the total sum and then close
off the function and then we could print
all this out on a screen call get some
more you're going to be able to pass as
many things in here as you could
possibly ever want to let's just keep it
as six and it gave me a little bit of an
error you can see right here get some I
can type in some more like that and
there we go
sum is equal to 21 so that's how we're
able to pass in an unknown number of
parameters and then use it now another
thing is kind of interesting inside of
lua is a function is a variable in that
we can store them under variable names
as well as we store tables and we can
also pass and return them through
function so let's demonstrate that let's
say double it there is a variable we can
actually put a
function inside of this so let's say it
gets a value of x and then we can just
say return x times two and then put the
N function on there so we have basically
just made double it a function it is a
variable also however you can see right
here if we just go print and double it
like this and then pass in a four so
automatically going to pop out an eight
now going along those same lines a
closure is a function that can access
local variables of an enclosing function
so let's go and let's create one so
let's go function let's just call this
outer func because this is going to be
an outer function that is going to
contain our closure you can see exactly
why this is interesting so let's create
a local variable I equal to zero and
then let's put an inner function inside
of it so return function like this and
then inside of this guy let's go and
increment the value of I and then return
so this is a function inside of a
function this is a closure and the
reason why it is a closure we have to
end this and we also have to end this
one now whenever you include an inner
function in a function that inner
function is actually going to remember
any changes made to the variable inside
of the inner function now let's go and
let's store our function inside of a
variable called get I so we'll go outer
func like that so there we stored it
inside of there now what we're going to
be able to do is go print get I like
that and it's a function and then do
exactly the same thing again the reason
why this is a closure is you're going to
actually continue to increment and store
the changing values of I that are inside
of here as you're going to see right
here and there you can see value of I is
starts off as 1 but then whenever it's
called a second time it is going to
increment it even though we assign the
value of zero right there so that's an
example of a closure and exactly how
they work and how they store values as
they are being called multiple different
times so now let's go and take a look at
a similar thing which is called a KO
routine now a KO routine is very similar
to a thread in other programming
languages except
that they cannot run in parallel and a
co-routine is either going to have a
status of running suspended dead or
normal and you're going to see what all
those look like so let's create a KO
routine how you do that is by just
coming in here and going co-routine and
we're going to say create and inside of
this I'm going to put a function and
then inside of this I'm going to say for
I is equal to one give it a starting
value and ten is going to be the ending
value and one is going to be the
increment and then inside of this we're
going to say print I value of I and also
let's go print co-routine status just so
we can see the changing statuses from
running suspended dead or normal now we
do that is pass in co-routine name
inside of there close that off then we
can say something like if I is equal to
five then and if we want to pause or
yield over to another go routine we just
type in go routine yield and then we're
going to end or if statement on the next
line we will end our for loop and on the
next line we will end our code routine
so there we go
have all those saved if it makes a
little bit more sense come in here and
go like this and like that now if we
want to come in here and check our code
written and see what its status is
whenever it very first starts we'll just
go co-routine status like that and KO
exactly like this and you can see it
starts off as suspended now we can call
for this code routine to resume or start
executing and then we can come in here
and also check the status after we tell
it to start running and you can see it
starts off as suspended starts coming
out here and printing out all these
numbers and it comes right up to five
and you can see it's also technically
running right there that's the status
until it hits five and the reason why is
it says if I is equal to five we want to
yield this code routine and stop its
execution
now let's come in here and create
another coat routine that we're going to
run at the same time very much like we
would do with threads sequel to KO
routine and we're going to create
one and this one's going to go function
create a function right inside of here
create another for loop and go I is
equal to 101 start it off at 101 and
have it count to 110 and increment by
one and do and print whatever the value
of I is each time and then and our for
loop as well as end our co-routine and
now we can see that if we go in here
again and go co-routine resume like this
let's just have this vco2
like that but then also do exactly the
same thing or restart or continue
execution inside of our original code
routine that we created and you can see
the process here starts off as suspended
gets up to five running then it gets
suspended jumps over to the other code
routine which doesn't get suspended or
doesn't have to yield its time at all
goes through its entire process and then
whenever we call the co-routine to
continue execution you can see that it
continues executing until it is finally
dead and you can see right here if we
come in and get the status of this code
written right here it is in fact dead
after it has done or executed all the
code inside of it so there's an overview
of co-routines now let's take a look at
something that a lot of people are
confused about because there's not much
good information online about it and
that is file i/o now there's many
different ways that we're going to be
able to operate on files and you can see
all the different ways right here we're
going to either be able to have the file
set as read-only which is the default
we're going to either overwrite or
create a new file a which means we're
going to append or create a new file
this is used this is used for read and
write of an existing file overwrite read
or create a new file and then append
read or create a new file I'm going to
come in here and actually start opening
files and storing things inside of them
so we can see exactly how this operates
if we want to create a new file that
we're going to be working with we just
go IO open right like this and then
we're going to give it a name let's say
I call this test Lua like that and let's
say that I want to have the opportunity
to create a new file because I know this
doesn't exist right now and then I want
to also be able to overwrite and read
from that file so I'm going to just use
that guy right there
because that works for all the things I
want to be able to do and there you go
you just created a file and you're able
to write to it and read from it and also
make it now if we want to come in here
and write some text to the file we just
go file right and we'll say a random
string of text and we can use new lines
inside of here for our files as well and
let's say we want to put some more stuff
in there so we'll say write again and
we'll just say something like some more
text throw another new line inside of
there we can use seek now to move back
to the beginning of our file by going
file seek like this and then we're going
to type in set and then the index where
we want to jump because everything is
indexes inside of string so we want to
jump back to the beginning or a file and
that's how we do that and then if we
want to go and read everything from a
file we'll just go file read write like
this and then we'll put a star inside of
here and an a meaning that we want to
read everything from our file okay so we
wrote to our file we created our file we
jump back to the beginning of our file
and we're going to read everything from
that point final thing we need to do is
close our file and there we go it popped
up a little bit of an error I keep the
errors inside of here just want to make
sure we put our quotes inside of there
because I think whenever you see me make
an error that's going to help you keep
from making errors and you can see right
there print it out random string of text
and some more text right like that now
let's say that we wanted to come in here
and also continue working with our file
but we want to append data to the end of
our file how do we do that well we can
just leave this named as file because
Lew is real nice about stuff like that
and we'll just say IO open and again
we're just going to type in the name of
the file that we want to work with and
then in this situation I went to a pen
so I'm going to say a plus like that I
can of course come in and write some new
information to our file and let's just
say even more text again remember you if
you want to read from a file you have to
jump back to the beginning of it so
we're going to use seek to do that and
we're going to say set and then we're
going to say exactly where we want to
jump to you can put any index in here to
jump around all over inside of the file
and then we can say print and of course
we're going to read data
our file and we want to get all of that
data inside of there right like this and
then finally we want to close our file
if we do all that it's a random string
text and then some more text comes in
there and then even more text gets
printed out on our screen so that is how
we're going to be able to work with our
files in side of Lua now let's take a
look at modules okay so basically a
module is like a library that is full of
functions and variables and you're going
to be able to create it and then use it
inside of your program so let's go and
let's create a module so we'll just come
in here and go new file and I am going
to save this guy using the name convert
dot lua of course and then save that so
let's create a module it's very
important that your module name and your
file name are exactly the same and to
create one I'm going to go local convert
the name of this guy and there is our
module and then inside of this I can put
a function let's say I want to do
something like convert feet to
centimeters so we'll go feet to
centimeters and this function is going
to receive an attribute of feet and then
it is going to return whatever that
value is times thirty point four eight
leaf that's right and end and then you
also need to return the module and save
it and that is how we're going to do it
just make sure we have convert here
convert here and convert here very
important and also the name of the file
has to be converted or convert well now
we can come over and do something like
convert module doesn't need to be named
convert module name whatever you want
and if you want to be able to get access
to that they have to be in the same
directory of course we're going to say
require and convert right like this and
then we'll be able to come in here and
work with this module function that's
this and I'll say that we want only
three decimal places that's how we do
that with a floating-point number and
there is centimeters and then if we want
to call our module just convert module
just like we created right there and
then follow that with feet two
centimeters which is the name
the function we have in the module we
pass in a value of 12 and you can see it
gets back the answer of forty two point
four eight zero centimeters there's a
quick example of how we can work with a
modules inside of lua now let's take a
look at meta tables now a meta table is
going to allow us to define how
operations on tables should be carried
out in regards to adding tables together
subtracting multiplying dividing
concatenating comparing tables and so
forth and so on let's come in and create
a table and put some default values in
it so I'm just going to go a table like
this and create my little table and then
I'm going to use a for loop to jump
through here and just fill it up with
stuff let's just say one through ten two
and a table and of course we're going to
use the same indexes here and just store
whatever the value is inside of there of
course close that off so there we go we
got a table now we're going to define
our meta table and how we're going to do
this is go MT and then we're going to
define how table values should be added
and you're going to be able to find like
I said before adding you're going to be
able to also define how table should be
subtracted how they should be multiplied
how they should be divided how they
should be if you want to use the modulus
and how they should be combined which is
the same as this guy right here which
we've talked about previously I'm just
going to focus on a couple of these so
I'm going to go add there's two spaces
right here by the way there's two
underscores alright so we're going to
define how these are going to be added
together we're going to go function and
we're going to say if you pass in table
1 to tables I'm going to define here
exactly how they are going to be added
together I'm going to create a some
table like this which is going to be the
table that is going to be returned and
I'm going to go for Y is equal to 1 and
I'm going to cycle through the number of
tables that we have right here and just
do that for me and then let's say that I
want to also come in here and check to
make sure that the table values are not
equal to nil well I can just go table 1
like that and get the
that is number it's not it's the tilde
sign not equal to nil can do that and
both these have to be true for the Stork
I can say table 2 and then also put the
Y inside of there not equal to nil well
then I will do some stuff well make sure
that we put this guy over here close
that off and then put then there we are
open this up a little bit better what am
I going to do if I got what I need here
well I'm going to start adding stuff to
the some table so some table the value
is going to be stored inside of the same
exact index is going to be equal to and
this is just what I decided how I want
to you can decide how you want to add
table values anyway this is the way that
makes logical sense to me so table 2 so
I'm going to take the values that's in 1
and 2 and then store them inside of a
brand-new table this got right here else
let's say that one of these came back is
no what I want to do in that situation
we all want to say some table Y and
let's say that I want to store 0 inside
of there I make the rules in this
situation so that's how it's going to
work because that's how I decide it will
work and we don't close off our if
statement we want to close off our for
statement and then after we have created
our brand-new table with all those sums
inside of it I want to return that guy
right there and then I want to end this
I'm going to say end and then I'm going
to put a comma right after that now I
can also come in here and define how
table values are going to be checked for
equality and how we can do that is to
underscores again put EQ inside of there
is equal to function and I can go table
1 and table 2 like this and then I can
just go return table 1 get the value
inside of it and make sure that it is
equal to table 2 and get the value out
of that as well and if both of those
come back then we know that that is
going to work for us
and of course we have to come in here
and we want to end this guy right here
so you end in a coma another thing we
can do is we can also check if it is
less than and I'm going to let you use
that as your homework assignment to
figure out exactly how to make sure
that these values work for whether a
table is less than or all so if it's
less than or equal to another object
right there then also figure out exactly
how subtraction and multiplication and
division works a hint hint hint it's
going to be something very very similar
to this guy right here okay so now that
we have our meta table all set up we
need to attach the meta methods to our
table how you do that is go set meta
table and there's a table we're going to
assign it to and there is our meta table
so met set meta table right like that
and then you come in and check if they
were equal so a table is equal to a
table that's going to work of course and
it had a little bit of a bug up here in
the a table change that to uppercase
right like that and then down here
inside of the Equality check make sure
that those are equal fix that and if we
do that execute you're going to see that
this comes back as true just as you may
have thought with this right here and
now we're going to test what we did in
regards to adding tables so we're going
to create a new table called add table
and then we can go add table is equal to
and then we just pass in a table we can
pass in different ones but it doesn't
really matter and a table and you've
seen this before you can just create a
simple for loop that's going to allow us
to cycle through our new add table we
just created right here and whenever we
execute it it's going to add all those
values together in our brand new table
and print them out on the screen
so there's meta tables and meta methods
and how we can work with them now let's
take a look at object-oriented
programming or at least lewis version of
object-oriented programming okay so just
so to make this very clear lua is not an
Opie language and it doesn't allow you
to define classes but you can in some
ways fake it using tables and meta
tables so what we're going to do here is
we're going to create an animal table
right like this and I'm going to define
all the default values for everything
inside of it so we'll have a height and
a weight equal to zero and we'll also
have a name the default name is going to
be no name and then we'll also have our
animal
types of objects also have a sound
what's a 7o sound okay so there is the
table we have created for animal where
the object that we are trying to create
inside of here now we have to define a
function for our table that's going to
allow us to initialize this guy how we
do that is with function animal and I'm
going to give it the name of new and it
is going to receive a height a weight a
name and a sound very similar to an
object-oriented programming language
we're going to have to do now is set our
meta table and we're just going to throw
in a junk table right there and then
animal right there so that's how simple
it is to create that meta table now if
we want to refer to height weight name
and sound for our animal objects we use
self because we don't know what the name
of it is so we're going to say like this
and we'll just go and create that we
need to do that for all of the other
different attributes we want for our
animal objects so we're also going to
have weight and change this to weight
and then we're going to have name and
then finally sound so we're creating it
in very similar way as to what you have
seen in other programming languages and
this is going to initialize it create a
new animal object and after it
initializes everything it's going to
return that animal object course end the
function with end say we wanted to come
in here and also create a function that
is going to allow us to print out
information about our animal objects
let's call it - string it's not going to
receive anything and we can then go
animal string like this and string this
is another way using string format that
I haven't showed you and we could just
go % s ways and then let's get a weight
for our animal pounds is % F inches tall
and says and let's get the sound that
it's going to make then if we want to
import all those things for our specific
animal object we're going to go and get
the self name and so weight and so white
and then whoops make sure we do this
right so height like that
and then finally self sound that is a
way for us to import all of those
specific things for our animal into the
to string function here and then we can
you just go return animal string and end
that function so this is an object
function inside of here and this is how
we initialize it and this is all the
defaults and the meta table we define
for it so it's all very very similar to
things we've seen in the past let's go
and create an animal object let's call
it spot how we do that is we would go
animal and we call our initialization
function and let's just pass some junk
values inside of here
there's his name and then his sound
let's say sound is wolf because that
makes sense okay so we just called for
our animal object to be initialized we
could then come in and go print spot
wait like that and then we could also go
print spot and then if we want to call
the function we just go to string like
this to string it doesn't have to have
that name it's just the name I gave it I
said it was unexpected let's put this
quote inside here that should fix it and
there you can see it works so 15 comes
out that is how we're accessing the
weight with the dot operator right like
this and then we can call that function
which is automatically going to get all
that information about spot and print it
right there on our screen so you may ask
yourself well does inheritance work
inside of lua well yes it does and this
is how we're going to use it so let's
say we want to create a brand new object
called cat we can inherit all of the
functions defined inside of our animal
object just by calling new right like
this there we go now we have all that we
have the to string we have the height
weight name and sound all that stuff
inside of our new cat object we can of
course come in here and overwrite any of
the functions so one of the functions we
want to overwrite let's say we want to
overwrite new and how it works inside of
our new cat objects well we're just
going to come in here and replace animal
with cat let's say that our cat objects
are also going to store in favorite food
and not just height weight name and
sound well we're going to set our meta
table here to be cat instead of animal
and then the only thing we need to
change down here is to come down and
grow
this guy right there throw that down and
let's get favorite food and let's also
store that inside of it right like this
and it's going to return and
everything's going to work exactly the
same we could then also come in here and
override our to string function if we'd
like let's go and get this remember we
just changed this cat new instead of
animal new throw that right there and
we're going to do the same sort of thing
for two string we're going to say cat
two string and then how this guy is
going to change is we're going to say
something like says whatever and loves
and let's get his favorite food inside
of here so there that is we'll just go
to self favorite food and now let's come
down and create a cat so let's call it
fluffy and we'll just call it with cat
new just like we did before
now let's just keep it simple 215 fluffy
fluffy says meow of course and Fluffy's
favorite food is tuna and of course
we're going to be able to come in here
and go print fluffy to string call that
function and you can see fluffy weighs
15 pounds 10 inches tall and says meow
and loves tuna so there you go guys
there is a ton of information about Lua
hope you guys found that interesting of
course in the description is a link to
all the code and a cheat sheet as well
as links to all of the individual pieces
I talked about about Lua so please leave
