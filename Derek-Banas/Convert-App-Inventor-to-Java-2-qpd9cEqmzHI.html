my tutorial on how to convert App
Inventor apps into Java apps today what
we're going to focus on is finish making
our Java app I'm also going to show you
how to install a I to live complete I'm
going to show you how to catch events
make the phone vibrate get latitude and
longitude open up the settings window
also show you how to open other
activities convert text to speech catch
when a user shakes to their phone get
permission use features how to set up
the manifest file and a whole bunch of
other different things what I'm going to
do first is to show you exactly where
you can go to learn more about how to
implement everything else you could ever
want to implement using all the tools
I've been using in this video so let's
go look at it ok so here is the API you
can go to 3 n portal comm four slash
Bridge API I'll have a link in the
description and here you're going to
find everything this is how I learned
how to put all this together so if you
want to learn about the accelerometer
and the different functions available
just click on that come over here and
you can see all of the different things
you're going to be able to do with the
accelerometer and it's pretty easy to
learn like I said it's just basically
the same thing that I've been covering
in this tutorial so now let's jump over
and finish our app ok so here is all of
the blocks and basically what I'm going
to need to do is catch all of the
different events I chose you previously
how to trigger the events this time I'm
going to catch them all and make them
all work very first thing we're going to
do is handle the zombie button click and
whenever it's clicked we are going to
have everything vibrate or have the
phone vibrate anyway then we're going to
check if the provider has GPS
capabilities if not we're going to send
them to the settings window where
they're going to be able to turn those
on and then we're going to open up a
notify window of course if they do not
have GPS setup and we're then going to
get the latitude and longitude and then
use text-to-speech like you have right
here to speak out everything so let's go
back into eclipse ok so here I am inside
of Eclipse and basically what we're
going to need to do here is come in
and make this thing right here work
event dispatcher we are going to have to
create a method or a function called
dispatch event that's going to handle
all of these events for us and this is
actually pretty easy to set up all we're
going to do is right-click inside of the
little window and then go to source and
then we're going to go to override
implement methods and click on that and
this window is going to pop up and
inside a forum you might have to click
that to open it we're specifically going
to look for dispatch event components
string object this guy right here and
we're going to put it after define and
hit OK and it's going to put all that in
there for us and there we go
I'm going to come in here and we are
going to delete this because we're going
to handle that in another way give
ourselves a little bit of space then
we're going to handle what exactly is
going to happen when the zombie button
is clicked so we're going to say if and
we're going to say component this is how
we find out if the button was clicked on
equals and then we're going to type in
zombie button which is the name for our
button and then we're going to
specifically check to make sure it was a
click event that was sent here we're
going to say event name equals and then
inside of here
we're going to type click and there we
go and the click of course is going to
come from right here
there's click there's the word click
that's where that came from
and then zombie button of course is what
we have up here right there okay so
that's how we handle that event now all
the things we want to do whenever they
is aam be buttoned is clicked on well we
want to go in and have the phone
vibrates Oh zombie moan sound and then
we're going to click that and go vibrate
and we could always come in here and
just double click on that and that's
going to open up vibrate we want to
vibrate it for 500 milliseconds and
there we go and it's done next thing we
want to do is we want to play the moan
sound so we're going to go Sambi moan
sound right like this and then we're
just simply going to type in play right
like that and it's done now before we
want to go and get the
latitude/longitude data we want to check
if the provider is set up as GPS and to
do that we're going to go g
yes provider name which we created are
in the last part of the tutorial and
then we're going to go location sensor 1
and say hey we want to get the provider
name and that's all we need to do and
put a semicolon there at the end then we
want to verify that the provider name
that came back was GPS so we're going to
say if and then we're going to put a not
sign in here or an exclamation point
which is basically going to give us the
opposite of whatever this was so what
we're going to say is GPS provider name
check if it equals GPS GPS and if this
comes back as true it's going to turn it
into false which means that everything
inside of here is going to be executed
put your little bracket there again now
if we want to open up a notifier all we
do is go show alert and then we can type
in whatever the message is enable GPS in
settings right like that another thing
we could do is actually go and open up
the activity settings that are going to
allow us to do that to do that we just
go activity starter 1 and we define the
action that we want to use here and in
this situation it's going to be Android
dot settings dot location and in the
previous App Inventor tutorial I
actually showed you how to look up all
this stuff we have to zoom out here a
little bit and location source settings
right like that then of course put the
semicolon there and now that we said
what we will actually want to have open
we just go activity starter one exactly
like we do in App Inventor and start
activity and it already knows which one
because we told it let's go look over at
App Inventor
if we come over here inside of App
Inventor where is it
look at this looks almost exactly the
same activities starter here we define
the action here we show what we want to
have open then we go start activity so
pretty easy now what we want to do is
retrieve the latitude and longitude data
and you can see over here where we are
getting the provider name GPS and
da-da-da-da-da-da and then right here
where we're going to go in and actually
get the latitude and longitude and set
that go back into eclipse let's make it
so we're going to go latitude is equal
to and we're going
have to turn a double which is basically
a number with decimal places on it into
a string and then we go location sensor
one and if we want to get the latitude
we just type in latitude right like this
and there it is put a semicolon at the
end and then we're gonna get longitude
pretty much in exactly the same way
whoops forgot to come in here and put a
dot there we go we're going to get the
longitude now copy paste that in there
longitude and longitude perfect now if
we want to convert this text to actual
speech and it will actually read it out
like you saw in the last tutorial just
go text-to-speech one dot and then speak
and then we want to put our message
inside of here so we're going to go
Zombies latitude is put a space inside
of there put a plus sign and then just
put in latitude which is the name of
that and then we can say zombies make
sure you put space in there
zombies longitude is put another space
in there and then put in longitude put a
semicolon and you're done that's all you
have to do for text-to-speech and then
we're going to type in return true which
is what this thing was complaining about
up here right there where it says
boolean okay and actually if you come in
here and put your mouse over this you're
going to see a drew turn statement right
there okay so that's what's going on so
you have to make sure that you either
return a true or a false now what we're
going to do is we're going to say else
because we have other events we want to
catch if the component equals and let's
catch the accelerometer sensor one and
shaking is what we want to catch this
time to come up here they are shaking
right there all right I'm back down
again whoop a little bit too far and the
event name is equals and here we're
going to say shaking that means person
shaking the phone and we want to do
something different put another bracket
here come in here and what we want to do
here is we want to play our zombie
attack sound and we just go play like we
have very viously
and then we want to return true again
and then after this we say return false
and that is all the code we need to do
here basically the only other thing we
need to do wait a second think i saw
this error let's just go return add a
return statement and there's another
false whoopsie I forgot that false and
it fixed it for me so
it's beautiful okay so everything here
is perfect and we're going to save that
and the last thing we need to do is go
in and set up what is called the
manifest file so we'll go over here to
Android manifest and open that up and
here it is we just have to make sure we
have everything properly set up the only
thing you might have to worry about here
you might have to change this but it
says hello zombie and that's perfect
it's all lowercase you could actually
come in here to the minimum version and
lower that to five and that's just the
Android version you're going to be
working with then what you're going to
need to do is get permission to use both
the GPS and vibrate so why don't you do
what I do just go into Google and then
say permission to use GPS and then type
in Android perfect then I'm going to
come in here and I can see right here
GPS Android location permissions love
stackoverflow and we're just going to
come in here and I can see right here is
the code that I want to get I'm going to
select all of it
copy that jump back over into eclipse
and then right after right here where we
set the different versions and really
want to work I'm going to paste this in
here access fine location uses
permission then I'm actually going to
put a couple more inside of here I'm
going to go and type in course location
and then I'm going to type in Mach
location and these are all the things
you could possibly ever need in regards
to getting location data and then I'm
also going to type in location extra
commands and then I also want to get
permission to be able to vibrate and to
do that you're just going to come in
here and type in vibrate and there you
go now I have permission to do all the
things with my app that I need to do and
I don't know if I show you this or not
let's jump back over here if you want to
look up all the different permissions
that are available to you manifest
permissions just click on this guy right
here and you're going to see all of the
permissions if you just search for
whatever you're trying to get permission
to use it's going to pop up inside of
that ok back inside of here another
thing I want to do here for the icon it
has I see launcher right there well my
icon is actually icon ping is what I
want to use so I'm going to come in here
and just type in icon there we go
for my theme I'm going to get more into
this at a later date but I am
specifically inside of this going to
just type in and
loyd style forward slash theme no title
bar and then I want this to be
fullscreen perfect make sure this is set
to mainactivity and then I also want to
lock this into portrait mode so I'm
going to go Android screen orientation
is equal to portrait and that is it
everything else is perfectly fine so I'm
going to save that and we are done the
whole entire Android app is finished but
I promise you I was also going to show
you how to install a I to live complete
which is basically a version of App
Inventor that adds a whole bunch of
additional functionality while at the
same time you don't need to be connected
to the Internet to hook it up so let's
take a look at that all right so to
install a I to live complete you're just
going to have to go to sourceforge.net
forward slash projects a I live complete
files AI to live complete I have a link
in the description then you're going to
go to files and then you're going to go
to this guy right here and download this
zip file ai to live complete sip and
then whenever you do you're going to get
the zip file you're going to open it up
and then if you are on Windows all you
need to do is open up the folder and to
start the server you're going to double
click on this inside of the folder
that's going to start the server for you
and then the build server which actually
converts everything into an actual
Android app is this guy right here
you're going to double click on that and
open it up and a window is going to open
up a little terminal window you have to
keep those terminal windows open if you
ever are on Linux or on a Macintosh
you're gonna have to go change directory
to wherever you put this file that you
just unzip and if you type in LS then
inside of your terminal you're going to
see all of these files right here you're
then going to have to type in change mod
and make all the SH files executable
Windows users by the way you're done you
don't need to do anything else you don't
have to do any of this stuff and then
after you do that you just type in dot
forward slash start AI server dot SH and
all of this stuff is going to come on
your screen and then at the very very
bottom you're going to see development
app servers now running and then what
you're going to need to do is do the
same thing for the build server so dot
forward slash start build server dot sh
in the same well actually you're going
to have to go
back in type in change directory because
you're going to have to keep the
terminal window open you can't close if
you close it the server is going to shut
down so you're gonna have to open up a
new terminal window go to that directory
and then this time type in dot forward
slash start build server dot sh and if
you have any trouble at all chances are
you're using an old version of java to
find out if you're using an old version
of java just type in java for it slash
version and more than likely 1.6 is
going to pop up so what we're going to
do is we can go look at the different
oracle versions of Java that are
available to us if we go to change
directory library this is on a Mac it's
going to be different of course with
Linux but this isn't even needed but
then you can also go into system library
Java virtual machines and it's going to
show you our sex versions of Java and so
forth and so on and you can see right
here that's where the 1.6 is and the 1.7
is what you need if you don't have Java
at all you're going to have to install
it and I trust you can do that so
basically what we need to do is make
sure we are running java 1.7 and not job
1.6 this is if you get any errors
whenever you execute those previous two
commands so what you need to do is go
and download Java and install it and the
quick way to switch over to Java 1.7 if
you don't want to change it everywhere
is type in export Java underscore home
equals exactly what you see right here
and then what you're going to do is type
in 1.7 right like that
okay and then type in Java version
you're going to see 1.7 is the version
it's being used and then you can come in
and type in dot forward slash start
build server dot SH and everything is
going to execute after you do that
you're going to go in your browser to
localhost colon 8080 eight eight and you
can actually see that that location well
I don't actually have it here let's go
to the next one it's actually in the
terminal going to show you to go to
localhost colon 8080 8 8 then you're
going to type in your email address and
click on login and whenever you do this
is what a I to live complete looks like
okay so tougher to ton of things on the
last tutorials I hope you guys really
enjoyed it please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
