22 of my learned program series and this
part of the tutorial I'm going to
basically make a calculator from scratch
the reason why I did this is you guys
have been asking me to make a real app
in one video and show the entire process
and you also asked for a live coding
video so pretty much this is a live
coding video nothing's been done ahead
of time I just edited out everything so
you don't have to sit through a two-hour
video instead you can just watch
whatever this video ends up being in
length and of course in the description
is a link to all of the code and a
transcript of the video and you should
get that and of course it's all free and
the only thing I did ahead of time was I
drew what I want the calculator to look
like so you're gonna see the entire
process in this one video and I have a
lot to do so let's get into it okay so
you can see right here this is the
calculator that we want to design and
it's going to work like a calculators no
point in me going into that so this is
what we're gonna shoot for and if at all
possible I'm gonna put this PDF on my
website and you can get it and put it in
front of you so that you can also look
at that because all of this stuff is
very important so that you understand
what's going on alright so when I start
an application what I do is I create
what is called a use case description
and what this is is it's going to
describe everything the app does
step-by-step and I always do this no
matter what the application is sometimes
I make a sequence diagram for more
complicated applications but this isn't
that complicated so I'm not going to do
that now however in later videos I most
definitely will so what we're gonna do
here is we're just going to list out
exactly what's going to happen whenever
the user is using our applications so
the user is going to click a number
button alright so that's the first thing
that's going to happen then after they
do that the user clicks a math button
and then the user clicks another number
button and this is very important to
understand this process with a simple
application because as we get into more
complicated applications they will make
more sense if you start out simple and
then
user clicks an equal button and the
result shows all right so this is the
entire process of our application well
this doesn't tell the whole story but
it's very important to get here first
now what we need to do is think about
potential problems we could have so I'm
going to go through here I'm gonna say
note and we'll think about a problem
well since every button is going to
require the previous button to have been
clicked we want to make sure that the
click occurred so that's some type of
logic we need to put in our application
so we'll just say something like make
sure previous required button was
clicked ok so we know that that's
something we want to do so let's offer
what we know the user is going to do a
pair of water or are we going to put
this information in well we don't need
to worry about it for the number button
however we are going to have to worry
about it for the math button so I'm just
going to put a note 1 and I'm going to
say make sure the entry has a value all
right so that's one place that we want
to make sure that we cover that and is
it going to make it yes we're going to
also need that to be done here so we're
going to say note 1 once again and
everybody does these use case
descriptions completely different this
isn't some ironclad way and very often I
do them completely different just
depending upon the project so this is
just a guide nothing else so we're going
to say here make sure a math function
was clicked before we will get to the
equals so we don't need to worry about
doing this with number we want it
because the numbers are going to be
picked
they'll here we don't need anything to
be clicked and here we technically do so
it's better to try to have this logic be
in these two boxes and not in the number
button ok makes sense hopefully makes
sense all right so I think that we have
that covered now let's think of
something else that we might have an
issue with so Note 2 Oh what else might
happen
well maybe we want to make a way to
track which math button was clicked last
okay so we'll say
type that out a way to track which math
button and you could pause the video and
actually create your own notes where you
think you would potentially have
problems that would be great to do that
as a test here so which math button was
clicked last that's something that I
we're definitely going to need to do
because we need to know if we're going
to be adding or subtracting multiplying
or dividing whenever we get down to the
equals part so where are we going to
handle this logic well I personally
think we should handle the logic here
once again with our math button so I'm
gonna say how can I track that I can
track it numerous different ways and I'm
writing this code on my head so you know
this might not work but you know I'm
just going to go through the process
obviously skip to the end of the video
if you want to see the final application
see if it worked
so I'm putting myself on the line here
so I'm going to say that I want to
switch boolean values representing math
buttons to false on entry all right so
entry of the this is going to be a
function there's going to be a function
specifically for handling number clicks
this is going to be for math button
clicks obviously number and equals okay
so we know we're going to have at least
three functions we are going to create
and you might want to come up here and
say something like that at least three
functions needed all right that might be
something that you want to put as
another note all right so is there
anything else we need to handle in
regards to which math button was clicked
and so forth and so on well I know that
I have a GUI interface and I'm going to
be passing information based off a
button click so I'm going to say here
that I want to have button pass in the
math function press so every time they
click on a button it is going to pass a
the math button that was clicked on into
this function and you could go up here
and do something like an attribute for
this you could say something like self
is going to be passed inside of here and
then math function all right so that
could be something else you could do
whatever makes it work best for you all
right so all right so we're doing a make
a way to track which my
but was clicked last well what should we
do with these other guys the math
function clicked on is not going to
impact number in any way but it
definitely will be equals because when
equals clicked on I am going to have
that guy go and perform the result
because they result shows so I'm going
to say down inside of here but I want a
check which math function was clicked
obviously because so that I know what
type of operation reformed and I want to
provide the correct solution is there
anything else we need to think about um
well note 3 is there going to be
something well whenever they enter they
click on the number buttons
well they might just click on one of
them but they could also click on
multiple number buttons so I have to be
able to handle that inside of the entry
box so that could cause potential
problems so something to think about
um I'm just going to say think about a
way to handle the user entering both
single numbers and multiple numbers so
with this guy up here with the the math
buttons it's and we only they're only
going to click on it once and that value
is going to get passed inside of the
math function it's going to be handled
up here they could click on it multiple
different times so we think about how
we're going to handle that right there
and I'm going to put this whole entire
thing on my website so in the
description click on that get it in
front of if you want to look at it so
how are we going to handle this I'm
going to say with each number button
press add the new value to the end of
the first and then update the entry okay
so each time they hit an additional
button that additional number is going
to be passed into the number function
and it is going to update the entry all
right so we could say something now we
know that this guy right here is going
to be getting so and it's also going to
be getting past the number that was
clicked on it all right so anything else
we
to do well note 3 think about a wait
handle user entering business ok so I'm
thinking that note 3 has absolutely
nothing to do with equals + + + so we're
not going to worry about that is there
anything else we need to think about let
me just think here um this is why
editing out pauses is a good thing well
I think that I also want to track the
first number in the entry box after the
math button is clicked so if they hit a
2 and then they click on + and then you
click on 3 well I'm gonna need to know
that they clicked on 2 first so I want
to track that so track the first number
in the entry box after a math and when I
say track I mean store it after a math
button is clicked all right so that's
something else I want to do so where are
we going to handle that guy well I think
the best place to handle that is in the
math function so the math function is
going to be the sole place where we are
going to say store the value that was
entered into the entry box previous so
if this women say store the entry value
on entry to this function so whenever we
get into the math button part it is
going to store that value so what does
that tell me well that tells me that
this is going to be a class field I'm
going to have the whole calculator is
going to be an object so everything we
create here is going to be a big class
file and I want to store the values for
entry previous to them changing inside
of a class field so I know we need that
is there anything else I'm going to do
well whenever the math buttons clicked
on it also makes sense to clear it so
that they'll be able to able to enter in
their new number so I want to clear the
entry field after they click on the math
button and I'm going to do that inside
of the math function that we have here
is there any place else that we need to
worry about tracking that number now
because the math functions going to
it and we don't need to worry about it
is there anything else there may be
there may not be I mean forget things
we'll find out but whenever you do this
in the beginning this dramatically cuts
down on your debugging issues later on
so I'm going to say what else could be a
problem well there could be division
problems caused through integer division
that's something one way because if
we're going to be dividing between
integers that's going to cut off floats
and that it up so we'll say something
like what about the vision problems
caused by an integer division how are we
going to handle that that's a big
question mark so what can we do well one
solution is just to come in here and
always whenever we're working with a
number convert to a float each time we
retrieve or store values in the entry
all right so that's going to solve that
and is there anything else see anything
else that I can think of that we could
possibly have right now this is
everything right now to me this is every
single thing we need to know so this is
my use case description this is my
starting off point and this is going to
dramatically cut down on errors so I
have this and what you should do is get
it put it in front of you and refer to
it as I'm writing the code because I'm
going to print this out and put it in
front of myself as I write the code so
now I'm going to jump over and start
writing some code okay so this is the
calculator we want to make and the very
first thing I'm going to do here is I'm
going to create my interface for my
calculator so let's just get rid of that
all right so what are we going to do
well we're gonna come in here and we
want to import some things so we'll say
import and import enter I want to style
these so that we can review what we did
in the previous parts tutorial and then
we're going to create our calculator
class so count alright so as we refer to
our use case description we know that we
want to store the current value to
display in our entry so I'm going to
call this calculator value and I'm going
to give it remember we're using all
floats also referring to our use case
description so that's what that guy is
going to be we also
as we refer to our use case description
we wanted to have a way to track the
last math button that was clicked now
there may be better ways of doing this
but whenever I'm programming when I'm
first creating something I want to work
create a system that works first that is
my ultimate goal then I went to
streamline and refactor which means the
same exact thing as streamline and make
my code a little bit neater but now I
just want this to work so I'm going to
say something like I want to have weight
of tracking all of the different math
functions that were clicked on so we'll
say a head and also subtract obviously
and is there anything else I don't
remember anything else being there so I
can't see it my use case anyways right
now so remember I want to create the
interface for this so let's create the
interface for this and where we're going
to create our interface is in the
initialization function for our class
and this guy is going to get self passed
into it and it's also going to get
passed route because it needs route to
the route object to be able to work with
our interface so what are we going to do
here
well I want to self as a way of
referring to our object and I want to
hold the changing value that is going to
be stored in the entry window inside of
a TK inner string variable so I'm going
to call this entry value and some things
I use here might be used in the
application and some things may be
thrown out this is just me writing code
based off my use case description I'm
going to create this guy and route and
value is going to be equal to nothing
right now so it's a string value that's
why we have double quotes inside of
there I'd also like to class this up a
little bit and define a title for my
application and to do that I'm just
going to say route title and calculator
all right so we have that I would also
like to have my calculator not be
changeable I don't see any reason why
the user should be able to change and
change the width or the height of this
guy so I want to define the width and
height of my window but I have
absolutely no idea how big it's going to
be so I'm just going to create something
and then change it afterwards
so I'm going to say root geometry and
we'll say something like 400 width by
400 height I know that's wrong but we're
just going to do it and see how it turns
out and like I said I want to block
resizing this guy so I'm gonna go resize
a bowl and I'm going to set the width
resizing to false and the height
resizing to false okay so we'll just
work through creating what we already
drew I'd also like to customize the
styling for the buttons because that
picture that I drew doesn't look at all
like the standard way of styling so we
go style is equal to 2 to K this is all
from previous parts of the tutorials so
if you haven't watched them they might
not this might not make sense this is
how you create a custom style either way
so we'll say can style configure and
then to refer to a ttk styling for our
different widgets we go T button and I'm
just going to come in here and say
something like font and I'll say serif
and let's have it be 15 and see how that
turns out and also I want to throw some
padding inside of this equal to 10 once
again that might be totally terrible but
we're going to see how it works out also
come in here and let's do styling for
our entry because we want to do that
also let's have the font be roughly the
same if it's to make it a little bit
bigger so let's take it up to 18 so that
works and leave the padding be this
exactly the same and now it's time to
actually create the different parts of
our different widgets here so the very
first thing I want to do is create a
text entry box that's going to be
displayed at the top of the screen so
I'm going to call this number entry and
I'll get a ttk so that it can get the
styling for this guy and I'm going to go
routes and what else do I want to do for
this well one thing I want to do is I
want to tie it to this guy that I have
up here this entry value so that
whenever the entry changes here it's
going to automatically change there to
do that we just come in and we say text
variable and look at that I was smart
and didn't use camel case
and we're going to tie it to entry value
and I want this to be a certain width
I'm just going to use my default that I
always use 50 and see how that turns out
now you're going to have to put handle
the gridding of this with the grid
geometry manager outside of here if you
don't do that if you put dot grid at the
end of this and get out of that that's
going to cause problems because that's
going to return none so we want to be
able to change this value so and get the
value inside of there so we have to do
this stuff the gridding of it separately
so we'll come in and throw this here and
we will then say grid and this is going
to be row zero obviously it's the top
and we want to say that it is going to
span over for columns all right because
we have four buttons so that should work
out perfectly fine underneath there and
that's all we need to do now we need to
worry about the number buttons again
refer to your calculator as I am doing
here the calculator drawing is what I
mean so I'm going to say so button seven
is going to be equal to t TK button and
I do that so that I can get the styling
that I defined here T TK button what you
do and put a period in there there we
are and then to create it we go route
and the text inside of it is going to be
seven just like we have in our little
drawing and then I want to be able to
call a function I'm going to think about
what's a good function name for this guy
let's put this on a separate line I
think a good name for it would be
something like button press maybe number
button press but that's kind of long so
I'm just going to call it button press
for now so we'll say so and button press
is going to be the function that is
going to be called and what did I do if
you got to put command inside of here
and equal to and I'm going to do this as
a lambda and soft button press and
whenever the button is clicked on it is
going to pass in the number seven so
that we know which one of the buttons
was clicked on and in this situation I
there's nothing to change with the
button let's go in here and change that
it's nothing to change with the button
so I can just
put grid on here and not worry about
anything else so I'm going to say grid
and Rho is equal to one and I want this
to be inside of column zero all right so
there is all that stuff let's see if we
can move this back and obviously single
quotes and double quotes don't matter I
keep getting that question all the time
so that's the only reason I bring that
up all right so let's create the next
one it's going to be exactly the same
except you know obviously it's going to
be eight so let's just change this to
eight and I like to keep things on
separate lines with spaces in between
them I know some people are irritated by
that sorry and this is going to be on
Row one however this is going to be in
the second column or column one and then
create another one and let's have this
be nine and this be nine once again
everything else here is going to be the
same change this to nine and this is
going to be column two and then we're
going to have to do same sort of thing
for our division button but this is
going to be a math function so it's
going to be a little bit different so
I'm going to call this self button
animal call it div and the text inside
of here is going to be like this and
lambda and what am I going to call the
instead of button press this is going to
be the math button press well we just
call it math button Russ that works and
what's going to be passed inside of it
well we'll just pass in the division
right there
and Row one is going to be fine and the
column needs to be changed to three and
that looks like that's getting somewhere
so what I want to do is I actually want
to test this and I want to see how it
looks now that I created my first row
I'm going to go and I'm going to test it
so outside of my class I am then going
to first get our route window object so
route is equal to Tk
and then what else we're going to do
we're going to create our calculator
object and we do that by going calc you
later and we pass route inside of it and
also we do routes and Mae
Loup because that's going to keep our
application running alright so let's go
and run it and see what happens and we
run it and you can see that it looks
kind of okay there are some spacing
issues it's not wide enough and so forth
but everything else looks perfectly fun
if I click on this is going to cause
errors because functions that I tied to
it aren't do not exist
so let's come up here and let's look at
what we need to change the root geometry
let's take this up to 4:30
and that's 400 and let's run it and come
down here and open it up and that looks
a little better all right so we have
roughly the same amount of space here as
we do on the right side and everything
else looks pretty okay alright so we're
going to stick with that we have no idea
what the height needs to be because we
need to add in all of these other
different things and I also would like
to keep these separated so I'm going to
come in here and I'm going to say
something like first row so that we know
that that is our first row of buttons
and then we're going to have our second
row of buttons I obviously would
normally put in more comments than this
but for now this is what we got and now
we have our second row now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to go and
basically copy and paste this stuff and
just throw in this extra stuff
underneath here so that you don't have
to waste your time watching it all I'm
going to be doing is changing these two
four five six and seven and put in
multiplication and all that stuff so I'm
going to pause the video make all those
edits and then come back and you'll see
all the changes okay so here I am back
and the only thing that is different
here is right here we have our equals
button and I put in a function called
equal button press everything else is
exactly as you would think we just
increased the rows as we create
additional rows and I also left homework
inside of here you're going to have to
come in here and figure out how to make
the Clear button work it's homework it's
very simple you should be able to do it
no problem just want to give you some
homework because you people asked me for
homework all the time I have no idea why
all right so there's homework for you
all right so we have all of the
different buttons created and let's run
it and see what happens once again of
course that
is in the description alright so we have
this obviously the height is completely
wrong so let's come in here and let's
change the height and see how we can
make it a little bit better let's change
it to 200 just to see what happens
roaaar and we'll open it and it's too
small so let's go and do something like
220 and control R and let's see it and
it's not perfect but it looks about
right
alright so there is the finished
interface for our calculator and I think
it looks pretty good we could obviously
move the pixels around or whatever but
you can do that alright so now what we
need to do well we need to refer to our
use case description and we need to go
in and create the functions we need so
the very first function I want to create
is my button press function and that is
going to be called any time a number
button is going to be pressed so let's
create that and let's do a button press
and what I normally do here is I just go
and write all the code because I went
and did the use case description and
everything should be perfectly fine so
can't get out of that habit alright so
let's go here well the very first thing
I want to do based off of referring is
to the use case is I want to get the
current value in our entry so the
whenever they press the button this is
these are number buttons not math
buttons or equals buttons these are
numbers buttons and value is going to
pass in that number so what I want to do
is get the current value in the entry to
do that I go entry and value is equal to
self and number entry and call the get
function and I'll get that for me and it
will store it in entry value all right
so we have that and the next thing I
want to do is if they hit multiple
number buttons I want to put the new
value they hit to the right of the old
number that was inside of there so we're
going to say entry and value plus equal
to and the value that they passed inside
of it then I want to clear my entry box
something to say itself and number entry
and do
leads zero and and I cover this in
previous tutorial that's how you delete
an entry right like that and then I want
to insert the new value into that box so
I'm going to say a self number entry and
insert and then 0 and entry value all
right so when I hit the number buttons
is going to go and get the current value
that is inside of there if it does exist
and it's going to continue adding as the
additional number buttons are pressed
and that's all I need to do because that
is all my use case says I need to do all
right
so let's see if my use case works out
and if it's a good use case next thing I
want to do is I need to handle the logic
when math buttons are going to be
pressed and I already know that this is
going to be called math button press
because that's what I called it when I
was creating my interface and the value
in this situation is going to be one of
the math buttons and whenever I code and
talk I type self twice alright so we cut
that done and now by referring to my use
case I know that I only want to go in
here and do something if a value is
already in the entry and remember I also
looking at my use case know that I want
to work with floats so that brings
something to mind I need to create
another function that is going to check
if the values in the entry boxes are
floats so I'm going to create a custom
function called is float because this is
not built into Python and this is going
to receive a string value and it is
going to return true or false if that
string value is a float so we're going
to say try and then I'm going to say if
the string isn't a float that whenever I
go and try to convert it into a float
we're going to throw a value Ariel so
I'm going to say float and throw the
string value inside of there and then I
know if an error wasn't triggered there
that I can return true otherwise I know
the
I am going to want to catch that value
error and in that situation I want to
return false because I know that it is
not a float okay
so value error all right so now I have a
way to convert things into or find out
if a number is a floater so back to our
math button press function so I only
want to do something if the entry has a
value or not so here I'm going to say is
float self is float I'm referring to a
method inside of here and I should make
that static but I'm not going to worry
about that right now I just want to get
this program running so I'm going to
convert what is inside of there into a
string and we say cell number entry and
then call get on that guy I think I got
all that right so if we do have a float
value inside of here well the very first
thing we want to do is make all of my
previous triggers these got guys up here
I want to turn all those back into false
because I know that my current math is
going to be here and this is just by
based off of going off of my use case
might not be perfect but we're aiming to
just follow the use case that is the
only reason why we're doing this all
right so so and so and there we go
so we set all those back to false
because we have the last value that was
clicked on here all right so now what
else can we do well we want to get the
value out of the entry box for our
calculation so I'm going to say self
calculate value and equal to and
remember we're going to always convert
everything into floats so we're going to
say self and entry value and we'll call
get once again and now what I want to do
is depending upon the value they passed
inside of here I want to set these
triggers if they match to true so we're
going to come in here and we'll say
something like if value passed in is
equal to the division I want to put some
information out here in
my output window as well just to make
sure that things look like they're
working right everyone so long I get it
inkling that maybe I should do that so
I'm going to do this this is just for
debugging purposes so I'm going to say
that that was pressed and then I'm going
to go self and a DD vision trigger and
set that to true then I'm going to do
that for everything else so let's just
come in here let's copy that come down
here and then we'll change this into L
if value is equal to a hand we'll do
multiplication this time and we'll say
multiplication was pressed and this is
going to be multitude rule let's set a
rule like that and like that
and then let's do the next one so like
this and L if is equal to and this time
we will check for an addition and we're
going to add addition here and we'll say
add trigger and we'll set this to true
and then otherwise paste we're going to
just come in here and just do else we'll
just be lazy with this and say else and
we'll say subtraction is going to be
used by default and sub trigger the only
way this function is going to get called
is if one of the math functions was
clicked on so we should be okay here and
we'll say that that is true as well then
what do we need to do well refer to our
use case description well we're gonna I
have written here that I want to clear
the entry box every single time we come
in here after we get the value inside of
it of course so I'm going to go number
entry and I will call a delete and
little delete what is inside of the
entry box currently and that's it that
based off of what's in the use case
description is all that I need to do for
my math button press function so that
leaves us with our equal button press
function so this is going to perform a
mathematical operation by taking the
value before the math button is clicked
and the current value and then it's
going to perform the right calculation
by checking what math button was clicked
last
so that's it so we're going to go define
and equal button press and nothing's
getting past in here because we know
every single time we work with this it
is going to be the equals button there's
no other way to get inside of this
function and now what we need to do is
make sure a math button was clicked
otherwise we don't want to do anything
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
say yeah so add trigger or self sub
trigger or if any of these are true self
multiplication trigger or self division
trigger if any of those are true well
then we're allowed to do some stuff
inside of our function based off of what
I think then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say if self add trigger well
then I want to perform a different type
of calculation so I'm going to create a
guy called solution and I'm going to go
self dot calculate of the value and
remember we always want to work with
floats so we're going to say float and
get the current value inside of our
entry window and we'll say get like that
and that will be our solution and then
I'm going to do the same thing over and
over again for all of the different math
functions so let's just come in here and
we'll say l-lift and this time we will
do the subtraction so we'll do the
subtraction and here I'm just going to
go subtraction like that and that's all
we need to do and let's go like this and
I'll lift and right about now I'm
starting to think well boy I hope this
compiles and runs properly now I'm going
to do the multiplication and we will
multiply this guy right here and then
otherwise we're just going to be lazy
for now and we'll say else and we will
go and do the division for this guy so
we'll say else by default we're going to
do a division alright so now to be safe
I want to print some information like I
did previously with this guy PRC so that
I can track what button was pressed I
want to just print all the information
out on the screen obviously I'm going to
delete this as soon as the application
looks like it's going to work so I'm
just going to print and I'm going to go
self and I want to print out the
calculation value inside of here and a
space and I'm going to get the self
entry value and we'll get that guy like
this and then after we get that I'd also
like to print out on the screen well not
put another space and I want to print
out my solution so we can track that so
this is just me preparing for potential
debugging issues and by referring to my
use case I see that I also want to clear
the entry box and put the solution
inside of it obviously
so we'll say number entry and I'm going
to delete what is in there currently if
there is anything inside of there and
then after that put the solution inside
of there so we'll say solución number
entry and we will do an insert and 0 and
solution
alright so based off of every single
thing I have in the use case description
I have covered everything so now it's
time to check if our code is going to
work for us so let's run it ctrl R and
let's hope and pray that it works all
right so here is the calculator and
let's see if it's going to work for us
so we're going to just go and click on 7
and we're going to click on plus and
we're going to click on 7 and it goes
equal hey look at that and it's a float
now let's divide it by 2 and see what
happens 7 beautiful now let's multiply a
times 4 equal to 28 looks like that
works as well
minus 8 equal to 20 plus 6 equal to 26
divided
9 equal to 2 point look at that maybe we
might decide we want to you know shrink
that down plus 1 equal 2 and it looks
like it works guys divided by 6 equal 2
and it looks like it works so that is
absolutely awesome
of course I might have missed something
your job and here we have all these guys
which well maybe or maybe we don't need
them doesn't matter but what I leave for
you to do for homework is to go in here
and test to see if you can break it
divided by 6 is equal to I don't know
divided by 100 trying to break it and it
looks like it works plus 1 is equal to
looks like it works all right so go in
there test it play around with it maybe
add some additional mathematical
functions to it make it your own make it
your own calculator and for homework of
course your job is to make the Clear
button work so if you guys enjoyed it I
enjoyed making this tutorial it's a
blast and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
