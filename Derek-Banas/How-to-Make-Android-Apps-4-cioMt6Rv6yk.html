4 of my tutorial on how to make Android
applications today we're going to cover
the action bar options menu main dot XML
dialog fragments and a whole bunch of
other different things if you haven't
seen any previous tutorials I have a
link to them in this video as well as in
the description underneath this video
and you should definitely watch them
first so I have a lot to do so let's get
into it ok like always open up Android
studio and go new project and I'm going
to leave this set for API 8 even though
I am going to want to have it be 11
later just to teach something and I'm
going to call this menu examples this
one's going to be very easy to learn and
we're going to come out here and click
on next we're not going to do anything
else there we're going to leave this be
blank activity as well I'm probably
going to cover fragments in the next
tutorial actually I'm going to cover
them to a certain extent in this
tutorial and then leave our main coding
activity be mainactivity.java and
activity main is going to be our layout
file and we're gonna click on finish and
let Android studio and Gradle do its
work ok so everything's loaded up and
what I'm going to be referring to here
today is the action bar that's this gap
here and then we're also going to have
an options menu what you're going to see
here in a second now this time I do not
need activity main.xml for the first
time I do however need main activity
Java I'm going to go in here and get all
the rest of them we're also going to
need main XML which is them in the menu
folder so of course that makes sense to
have going to be playing around the
drawable folder and we're also going to
be making a change in the Android
manifest file ok so let's start off in
main dot XML there you can see there is
our options menu or our overflow menu
whatever you want to refer to it as it's
going to show up in the upper right hand
corner I'm referring to this over here
if you're using Android 4.0 or above and
otherwise it's going to show a way down
here at the bottom of the screen with
older versions of Android and to make
this menu all you need to do is create
this menu tag actually it's created for
you and then what you're going to do is
all the different items you want inside
of it you're gonna put it between item
tags that's pretty much it pretty simple
of course you're going to be able to
click and catch those events and do
certain things but for now everything
here is peachy keen wonderful you might
also notice here that everything says
Android except for this guy right here
it says app well app is your personal
namespace or the thing that makes your
application unique and the reason why we
have that let's jump over into
mainactivity.java is because this guy
right here is going to give us support
to use the action bar for older versions
of Android and in that situation you
need to refer to your own unique
application that didn't make complete
sense don't worry about it it's a little
bit more technical than I'm used to
covering so far right so if we want to
create let's say an exit item let's just
come in here and let's type in item and
let's give it an ID let me enjoy do all
the work for you and I'm going to call
this guy exit the app yes I'm going to
also show you how to exit applications
and we can close that off if we want to
and you can see it's a blank space and
it's a blank space because it doesn't
have a title so let's go and give it a
title and I'm just going to simply call
this exit and of course Android is going
to fill that in there just the way I
like it
however it's going to say that it
doesn't like the idea that I am not
updating my strings.xml file with exit
so come over here click on this and
extract string resource and then we're
going to call this guy options exit text
just for the heck of it and that's going
to update our strings on XML file and we
are going to be doing things the right
way now let's shrink this down a little
bit or actually it's underneath this
side over here we don't need that open
quite so much then we'll be able to see
what we're doing now the next thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to go show as
action and you might catch what's going
to happen here what we're gonna do is do
we want to show this on the action bar
meaning horizontally across the screen
if possible or do we want to keep it in
the options menu well in this situation
I'm going to say that I want to show it
as an action bar item and then you have
different options like if room and if
you also don't want to just show an icon
but you also want to show the text
you're going to type in with text and
that's all that is to that but you can
see there is an error here and the
reason why is we need support for that
older version of Android so we're going
to come in here and we're going to
change this to okay once again if that
didn't make total sense don't worry
about it
some people get confused by the concept
of namespaces it's sort of like a social
security number it's what makes your
application unique now another thing is
up here I have ordering category 100 if
I want my exit to show up under settings
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
order in category and I'm going to type
in 101 and then the exits going to show
underneath the settings and then we can
also come in here and give an icon
number I refer to icons before and I'm
going to go and move some icons over
into my drawable folder so we can use
them okay so from a previous app I had
used these and I'm just using them
because they're on hand off because
they're wonderful and I'm just gonna
click on the night one here and the
sunny one here and then I'm going to
import those into my drawable folder I'm
going to go into menu examples and then
after that I am going to go into app and
then I'm going to go into source and
then I'm going to go into main and then
I'm going to go into resources and
there's a drawable folder I want and I'm
going to just paste these 40 by 40
little icons inside of there so there
they are you can play around with
whatever size works for you okay so back
into Android studio okay so here we are
again and let's just verify that I have
those in my drawable folder open this up
and there they are Knight and Sonny so
if I want to use those here just like I
talked about previously when what I do
is come in here and I'm going to go
drawable and then let's say for exit I
want to have the night one let's type in
night and there it is and let's say that
I want this one to have an icon as well
and give it the sunny one just for the
heck of it and I'm gonna go drawable and
I'm gonna say sunny and there you go
both of them have icons you can see that
this one says that it's never going to
show on the action bar and this one says
that it's going to show if there is room
another thing that semi interesting with
this guy is let's say that I wanted to
be able to select multiple things up
here not just one or the other but I
want to have checkboxes to say add
multiple different filters to a photo
how would I do that well I would just
come in here for group just go group
like this and then come to checkable
behavior like that and if I want to be
able to select multiple ones I'm going
to say all and if I only want to be able
to select one at a time I'd go single
and that's
and we would close that off and we would
go and surround every every item that we
want to be checkable with that closing
group tag and you can say say they
showed up now they're checkable those
are different things you can do with the
options menu as well as the action bar
so now let's jump over into
mainactivity.java and make this stuff
work okay so here we are there is our
support library for the action bar let's
go move this out of the way so we can
see a little bit better now down here in
the oncreate options menu it's pretty
much going to do exactly what it says
it's a method it's going to create the
menu inside of our application and we
don't really have to do anything here
again this is going to inflate our menu
get inflator and go inflate and guess
what main that's a reference to main XML
which is what we've been using and we
don't need to do anything else it's just
going to show up so that brings us to on
options items select it what that means
is what happens when one of those
options is clicked on well we're going
to define everything you can see here
the action settings are already defined
but they pretty much doesn't do anything
except return true so what we're going
to do is have these guys actually do
some things like open up dialogue boxes
close the app and things like that just
to demonstrate so basically what we're
going to do is come down here and say
else if and then we're going to do the
same exact thing again we're going to
say if the thing that was clicked that
ID that's where we get it from get item
ID that was clicked if it's equal to r
dot ID and then we're going to put in or
exit the app which is what we named that
specific option for them to click on and
then inside of here I'm going to close
the app if that's clicked on and to do
that it's very simple you just click on
finish but also remember to type and
return true and also make sure that you
type in equals and not just an equals
sign and there you go now this guy is
going to exit the app if that option is
clicked over inside of our options menu
now what we're going to do is we're
going to create our dialog fragment or
our dialog pop-up so to do that we're
going to come over here into Java and
we're going to create it right here
inside of this I'm just going to go in
this and I'm going to right click on it
new and I'm going to say Java class and
it's going to open up right here and I'm
going to call this my dialog fragment
good enough name click OK and there it
is now to create a dialog inside of
Android you're going to have to extend
the dialog fragment like this now to get
dialog fragment inside of here when you
come up to the top and we're going to go
import Android app dot dialog fragment
and then if we put our mouse overtop of
this it's going to say class requires
API level 11 so that means we need to
increase the minimum version of Android
inside of our androidmanifest.xml file
but we're also going to have to do a
couple other different things and we're
going to just come in here and we're
going to go uses and then we're going to
define SDK and then we're going to say
minimum STK version and in this
situation I'm going to say 11 and then
I'm also going to go target SDK version
and in this situation I'm going to say
19 then I'm going to close that off but
that might not necessarily get rid of
the problem let's come back in here and
let's save it just to make sure no it's
still giving me an error how do I solve
that well in that situation what you
have to do is go to build Gradle and
click on that guy right there and then
minimum SDK version we're going to
define this as 11 and then we're going
to say save that and sync now see so
sync now up here click on sync now and
there it goes everything's updated and
you can see that the error went away
with the dialog fragment now what we're
going to do is to create a dialog what
we're going to do is right click on this
and we're going to come down here to
generate and click on generate I'm going
to say we want to override methods and
the specific one we want here is on
create dialog so just search through
this guy and you can see on create
dialog is right there so let's just
double click on that guy then we need to
build our dialog box to show up on our
screen or our dialog fragment and to do
so we're going to go alert dialog and
then we're going to specifically call
builder and the Builder we're going to
call it the dialog and then we go equals
new and this is going to call alert
I log again and the Builder is going to
show up inside of there and then we need
to pass the activity that this fragment
this dialog fragment is going to pop up
on top of and to get the activity that
the fragment is going to be working with
or working inside of we just call get
activity and then don't forget to put
your semicolon at the end don't put an L
put a semicolon and there you go
so that is going to allow us to build
this dialog box that we want to be able
to use if you then want to be able to
set the title for your dialog box you
can go the dialogue and set title there
we go set title and then you're just
going to type in exactly what you want
to show up and I'm just going to type in
sample dialogue again all this codes
available in a link underneath thee or
in the description if you want to
actually put your message inside of here
let's go the dialog and set message that
should do it and then you're just going
to type in hello I'm a dialog or
something like that as you can see there
and there we go
another thing we can do is add our text
as well as be able to sense a click on a
positive button so just go the dialog
set positive we go then we have to type
in what message we want on that button
and then Android studio is going to do a
lot of work here for us we're going to
say new dialog interface and you can see
the onclicklistener pops up there we
want that and it's automatically going
to build everything that we are going to
need some reason the only thing it
doesn't do is put a semicolon at the end
there but we can forgive it for that and
there we go let's move this out of the
way so we can see a little bit better
and there is everything this is going to
be where we're going to put information
in regards to what happens whenever they
click positively on okay in this
situation I'm just going to keep this
very simple I'm going to spell toast
right I'm going to go toast and I'm
going to say make text and then make
text again to get the activity that we
need remember we're not in
mainactivity.java we're over inside of
midol dialog fragment I'm gonna go get
activity there that is and then I'm
gonna say what I want to show up here
I'm gonna say clicked okay
to keep that simple and then of course
we have to define how long we want this
to show up on our screen so we just go
toast up sorry that's obscuring that a
little bit and I spelled toast wrong
again toast and then we're going to say
length short and then of course call
show and there we go that's what's going
to show up if they click on the ok
button so what happens if they click on
the negative button not a big deal
just go the dialogue again and in this
situation we're going to go set negative
button and the message we want on there
is cancel and then we're going to do
exactly the same thing we're going to go
new dialog interface onclicklistener
it's all right there did everything for
me come down here close that off and
this is going to be another toast that
we're gonna pop up paste out there and
we're going to say clicked cancel ok so
that's how we're going to open and close
our dialog boxes so pretty easy so how
are we going to set it up so that
whenever they click on the action
settings over in mainactivity.java that
it's going to open up that dialog box
for us we're going to come in here right
like we did before and we're going to
have to create a dialog fragment which
is just a fragment you can place overtop
of the current activity and a fragment
by the way is just basically an
interface block that you can place into
an activity or on top of an activity or
so forth and so on
but to do that the fragment manager is
needed because it's going to allow you
to interact with the fragment so I'm
gonna call dialog fragment and my
fragment and then I'm going to use my
customized fragment dialog fragment
whatever which is called my dialog
fragment and nothing needs to be passed
to it and then if I want the fragment to
show up on the screen whenever they
click on settings I'm just gonna go my
fragment show and I'm gonna have to get
my fragment manager again it's going to
allow me to interact with the fragment
get fragment manager and then I'm just
going to type in da dialog doesn't
really matter what you put in there and
that is basically it guys alright so now
that we did all that let's go and
execute this very very simple thing it's
basically just action bar options menu
and a dialog box when to keep these
tutorials very very simple and hence I'm
not going to jump through
a bunch of different topics too quickly
now you can see right here the
application opened up setting is going
to open up and if we click on settings
the dialog box is going to open up and
if we click on cancel you see a little
toast that shows up right there come
back up here again click on this click
on select there's a little checkbox
click on settings and there it is a
little I'm a dialog da da da da click on
OK and toast comes up clicked ok and
then if we click on exit the application
is going to exit as it is doing right
there so that's everything guys if
anything confused you or if you have
trouble with the app of course all the
code is in the description under the
video and there's more comments in the
code than there it and then I even say
in this video so please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
