1 of my Inkscape video tutorial I've
been getting a lot into how to design
interfaces in my android tutorial and of
course it's always great to be able to
get a free piece of software that is
almost as good as Adobe Illustrator so
in the next couple tutorials I'm going
to show you exactly how to do most
everything inside of Inkscape so I have
a lot to do so let's get into it okay so
the very first thing you're going to
want to do is go to Inkscape dot org and
download Inkscape and in what's awesome
about it is it works on any operating
system and even better yet all of the
key code shortcuts or exactly the same
for every operating system so if you're
using Ubuntu Linux Mac OSX windows
anything it's going to work and you can
get all that at Inkscape org and it's so
easy to install not even going to bother
showing you how to do that let's just
start using it ok and this is basically
Inkscape and i'm going to go through
what all of these different things do
here and across the top and all these
things over here and the swatch is down
here and everything one of the very
first things I want to do however is you
are given a default page that you are to
work with if you would like I'm going to
get rid of it all together how you do
that is you come down here where it has
document properties and click on that
and then this dialog pops up here since
I want to get rid of that I just want to
go to show page border and say no and
while we are here you can see that we
can set our default units and this is
going to be for our rulers and pretty
much everything else and we can also
define all of our different letters and
document types we want to use create
custom sizes and do all kinds of other
different things but I am done with that
so I'm just going to close that for now
when I said rulers I was talking about
these guys up here and if you want to
turn those on or off you just go control
or control R they're back on and this is
where we would change our default units
as well now I'm going to step through
all of these guys over here one by one
and talk about shortcuts and roughly
what they do this right here is our
selector tool and the shortcut for it is
s very very easy to remember and this is
going to allow you to select move
scale skew all kinds of things in
regards to moving around with your
objects then we have our node tool which
shortcut is N and if you can't remember
nu can just think of how the letter n
looks kind of like lines connected with
points and that's how I remember that
and of course that's going to allow us
since we are using vector art or a whole
bunch of nodes with lines between them
that's going to allow us to edit the
nodes change a straight line into a
curve do all kinds other things we'll
see more about that later then we have
the tweak tool right here which looks
kind of like a wave and the shortcut is
W it's going to do all kinds of really
funky crazy things which are better
explained just by showing how they work
then we have our zoom tool which is Z
which is going to allow us to zoom in
zoom out zoom to the page size zoom to
fit all of our different objects and so
forth and so on then we have our
rectangle tool shortcut is are going to
allow us to draw rectangles which in a
second I'm going to show you how to do
that then next we have our 3d tool which
shortcut is X and the way I remember
that is because we're going to be
drawing in a 3d dimension that makes you
think of XY diagrams which look like a
cross or an X shape then we have the
ellipse tool of course draws ellipses
circles and a whole bunch of other
different things arcs all kinds of stuff
you'll see of course the shortcut for it
is e then we have our polygon tool or
star tool that is just going to be
either shift 8 or the star symbol and
that's how we're going to pop that up
gonna look into that in more detail here
in a second then we have the spiral tool
and when I see spiral I think insane and
the shortcut for that is I of course we
have our pencil tool which the shortcut
of course is P for pencil and we have
our Bezier curve or however you
pronounce that and that's going to allow
us to draw our points in our lines and
so forth which is the best tool if we're
using vector art or working with vector
art so of course being the best tool the
shortcut is B and there that is then we
have the calligraphy brush we have the
text tool which of course is T whoops I
forgot the calligraphy brush that is C
then we have
our spray tool which is an awesome
spray can so of course the shortcut is a
then we have our big eraser which of
course is going to be shift e or capital
e because it's our big eraser and we
have our fill tool and this looks like
paint being spilled and what would you
say if you spilled paint uh-oh shortcut
is you then we have our gradient tool
which is G then we have our eye dropper
shortcut is D and then we have this
thing called the diagram connector which
I've never actually used but if you want
to use it the shortcut is o and if we
move down inside of here you can see
here are our swatches that we can drag
and drop on all of our objects as well
as fill and Stroke oh here stands for
opacity this little eyeball right here
is going to toggle if we want to see our
current layer or not can also toggle
through the layers with this guy over
here and if we zoom out and zoom over
here you'll see a whole bunch of
different things that I almost never use
this is for new reason why is ctrl n
opens up a new document so why worry
about that ctrl o or this little folder
shape is going to open up a document we
previously worked with there's the Save
symbol which is ctrl s almost everything
is controlled by the way print is ctrl P
this guy right here is going to allow us
to import and I don't even know what
that symbol is oh it's control I know
that's easy to remember it's going to
allow us to import different graphics as
well as SVG files or scalable vector
graphics but don't worry you'll be able
to use EPS and PDFs and a whole bunch of
other different things this guy right
here is going to export let's shift ctrl
E and we could export in ping that's the
normal way to do it then we have our
undo and we have our redo which I don't
really normally worry about those except
for ctrl Z which is an undo this guy
right here is going to copy our
selection to the clipboard this is going
to be cut this is going to be paste
which of course we use ctrl X and ctrl V
all the time this is going to zoom in so
that whatever we have selected is
showing on the screen this is going to
zoom in to make sure that all the
objects are on this
this is going to zoom in to make sure
that the document itself is on the
screen and yes those work even if you
don't have a little page drawn inside of
your canvas window this guy is going to
duplicate any object that you might have
and that's just ctrl D for duplicate
this is going to create a clone which I
almost never do basically what it means
is if you create an object and then you
say I want to create a clone of it if
you change one object the other one gets
changed if you decide you're not happy
with that anymore this little guy right
here it will allow you to break those
objects apart this guy right here is a
snap to grid this is a snap to guide
which we'll get into here in a second
this guy's going to group which is ctrl
G or ungroup objects which basically if
we group them that just means if we move
one we move the other and ungroup
basically takes that away all right and
that is all I'm going to cover for right
now I am however going to open up a
whole bunch of dialogues here one way to
do that this is going to be the stroke
and fill dialogue let's click on that
and you will see there it pops up say
fill and stroke then we can also go to
text but for some weird reason this
doesn't dock so you know that's kind of
silly but of course we're going to need
that this guy right here is for layers
let's open that up as well this guy
right here is for editing the XML
document which everything inside of
Inkscape is an XML document we're not
going to worry about that right now and
this is going to allow us to align and
transform our objects so we opened all
of those different guys up this is an HD
video so if you can't see it view it
full screen and everything will be
wonderful now what I like to do when I
open up all these dialogues actually I'm
going to open up a couple more let's go
over to view first and scroll down
through here and we can open up our
swatches library as well and that just
opened that up right there and then I'm
going to go into object and I'm also
going to get rows and columns which is
way down here rows and columns there it
is so now I have every dialog all here
in one place but it's kind of a mess you
might think well what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to click right here at
the top of this drag it until it's
centered and drop it then I'm gonna do
that with all of them it's going to
click inside of here drag until it's in
the center can't tell if you can see
that there's like a square there drop it
and do exactly the same thing for the
layers drag in the center drop it and
then do it for the fill drag it put it
in the center and drop it now what I'm
going to be able to do is switch between
all those different types of tools just
by clicking these buttons and that's the
way I like it you might not and your way
is the best way so just do it that way
across the top of the screen you're
going to have what is called the tool
control bar and it is going to change
every single time you change your tools
so that's why it's called the tool
control bar and we'll get more into
exactly what happens up there whenever
all that gets selected and mainly the
other shortcuts that I use all of the
time while I'm just thrown in rectangles
here is control a which selects all of
our different objects zoom in here on
them undo like I said before was control
Z so there I got rid of it there I
brought it back with control shift Z you
can zoom in or zoom out on the screen
quickly by just pressing plus or minus
on your keyboard if you want to throw
grids up on this screen you just hit the
number sign which kind of looks like a
grid which is very very useful and
guides you know you could either just
come over here let's get the selection
tool s and then you can drag a guide out
however you would like and then of
course we have the group which is
control G they are together if we move
one we move them both or control U which
is an ungroup and there is a couple
other ones that I use all the time but
I'm not gonna just spend this whole
entire tutorial showing you shortcuts
and we're going to go over their
shortcuts a whole bunch times if you
want to get rid of the guide you just
click on them and drag them off the
screen and they just go away ok so now
I'm going to go through some of these
different tools that we have over here
and the first woman to cover is the
rectangle tool so I'm going to hit R
just to bring up that shortcut and then
we can draw a great big giant rectangle
on the screen now if I want to edit this
guy well I can go and hit the S buttons
for select and you can see that these
little arrows pop up and they basically
say well you are able to scale this
rectangle however you would like
if however you'd like to rotate it click
it again with the selection tool
you'll be able to rotate it right like
that also another thing you can do let
me zoom out here a bit is you can skew
the rectangle and how we're going to do
that is go to the middle parts and you
can see how I am skewing it and Inkscape
normally is not this slow their only
reason it's slow like this is because
I'm videotaping this while I'm talking
and using it let's delete that and
switch back to rectangle again now if
you hold the ctrl key while you are
drawing the size is going to change in
increments see how it's sort of like
jumps say in increments and those
increments would be two to one or three
to one and when I say that I mean that
the height is going to be one and the
width is going to be two or three in
that situation if you don't hold the
control key it's just going to allow you
to do pretty much anything and you can
think about this throughout Inkscape and
know that this will pretty much always
be true if you're holding down the
control key you're basically
incrementing something whether it is
incrementing ever increasing sizes for a
rectangle or what have you that is
normally what the control key does
whenever you are using it in Inkscape if
you instead hold down the shift key
while drawing a rectangle it's going to
draw from the center of the screen
instead of drawing from the top to the
bottom
see how that's different versus holding
the shift key comes out of the middle
like that and in general that's pretty
much all you're going to do with the
rectangle for now you're going to skew
it you're going to rotate it you're
going to increase the size of course we
are going to get into gradients and
changing colors and all that other stuff
here in a minute then just to briefly go
over it this is the 3d tool and the
shortcut for it of course is X and this
guy is going to allow you to draw
three-dimensional objects and basically
just click and three-dimensional squares
basically as you can see there on your
screen if you want to move this around
you can see there's a little X here and
if you click on it while you are still
in the three-dimensional tool you can
see that it is moving around in
three-dimensional space that's kind of
neat now on this three-dimensional shape
there are things called handle
that or these guys right here and with
them you're going to be able to size
your three-dimensional space and also
going to be able to project them into
the z space or increase how far they go
away from you or however you want to
think about that
you would also be able to change the
color for this three dimensional space
by holding down the control key and
clicking one of them that would allow
you to come in here and then change the
color for one of those if that's
something you'd want to do then we come
into the fact that this gap here has
changed angle Y in this situation for
our three-dimensional shape is going to
represent let me just click this whole
thing the angle of this which is called
a vanishing point so if we change that
you can see that the angle for that top
X vanishing point as moving that way the
red lines in this situation are also
these are all vanishing points are going
to make changes on the X dimension while
the Y vanishing point are going to make
changes on the Y vanishing points and
there's basically four handles that are
going to allow you to reshape the sides
while the other four are going to change
the depth so these are the handles and
allow you to change the sides and these
are the handles that are going to allow
you to change the depth as is that one
right there like I said before the
center handle or this X shape here when
clicked is going to allow you to move
the object around and if you hold down
the shift key while you are using it
it's going to allow you to change the
depth of the three-dimensional object I
don't worry if you can't remember all
this I'm basically just covering
everything just to make sure you get a
basic gist of how these tools work then
we get into the ellipse tool which is
over here and the shortcut for it is e
of course of course with this guy you're
going to be able to make ellipses you're
going to circles and you're going to be
able to make arcs and also like pie
shaped type things if whenever you are
using the ellipse tool you hold down the
control key this is going to constrain
your drawing and there you can see that
it's making like a pie shape if we come
up here
and decide we would instead like it to
be an ark click on that and now it's an
ark and if we decide instead we'd like
it to be a circle we click on that and
now it's a circle just like before if
you hold down the shift key when drawing
an ellipse it's going to draw it from
the center like you see right there and
if you want to make sure that you draw a
perfect circle lip still remember is a
shortcut want to hold down the ctrl and
the Alt key at the same time that's
gonna make sure that it can strange the
proportions to make sure that it is a
perfect circle now just like the
rectangle the square tools are going to
change the scaling for our ellipse and
in this situation the circle is actually
going to be different ends of an arc so
we can click on it and we can create a
pacman shape like that and then this is
going to be the endpoint and we can go
and move that around as well
everything's pretty consistent inside of
Inkscape so basically after you learn
how to use one tool you'll pretty much
be able to walk your way through how to
work with the other ones and of course
you can also change the starting arc
position and the ending one by playing
around with that and you can zoom out
and we can do it again say of course you
have to select it and you can see there
see how it's moving around so that is a
very useful tool now we'll go into and
take a look at the star or the polygon
tool shortcut is star of course shift
eight there it is of course it is going
to allow you to do all kinds of funky
things actually this is a pretty useful
tool let's go and reset all of our
settings for this guy
by just clicking there and there you can
see that we have a basic star shape it
also has squares on it and those are
handles that we can use to change the
way that our star looks pretty cool very
very adaptive if we delete that hold
down control guess what it does it
constrains it so that it only moves or
rotates at 15 degrees at a time shift is
going to draw it from the center just
like it always does and then we get to
these funky guys up here and exactly
what they do
now corners is pretty self-explanatory
it's basically going to increase the
number or decrease the number of corners
in your polygon shape or your star shape
you're also going to be able to change
your spa
ratio with star and you can see that
that's just moving those center points
out and eventually it will become a
regular polygon if you keep doing that
by smoke gray show I mean that guy right
there
and basically as you play around with
Inkscape you're going to find that these
guys specifically the polygon and start
tool are best played with and
experimented with but I'm going to show
you it because a face value it doesn't
really look like it does much but you
can create numerous different types of
shapes just using this polygon tool so
we could do something like let's just
draw this right that and then let's say
that we want to change our number of
corners to I don't know 500 like that
and you can see that it created this
funky sort of object II weird thing kind
of neat just playing around another
thing that you could do let's just
delete that for now is let's say that
you needed to draw like a path of rocks
or something like that what you could do
is switch into your polygon tool and
then let's just leave five corners as it
is let's go into round it because we
want more of a rounded type polygon if
these are going to be rocks and let's
just increase that I don't know two
point three for example and then let's
take randomized and take that up to one
point seven so they've been one point
seven like that zoom out and then let's
change to a more rocky type of look
color wise and we can just start drawing
well that's up I know why cuz that's a
star well this is how you'd make a
puddle type thing kind of funky looking
for weird starfish patek something I'm
looking for selection tool delete jump
back into our polygon tool star and
let's jump over here and click on
polygon there we go now if we want to
come in here and draw some rocks you can
draw these are all yellow rocks but you
can see that it's sort of like a rocky
pattern that is completely randomized
and really funky and there is just a ton
of different really cool things you can
do in regards to this inside of Inkscape
if we want to change all our colors
let's just select everything this is a
solid color and then let's say we want a
reddish brown
quite get all of them oh there's a nice
brown and there we go
looks kind of rocky type so that is the
star and polygon tool then the last I'm
going to look at here is the spiral tool
which is this card here remember I for
insane click on that and we can just
start drawing some spirals now the big
thing about the spiral tool is these
guys and understanding how these three
guys work in fact you're probably not
gonna use the spiral tool that much but
what the heck were here so let's go and
look at it first you have turns now as
turns is increased basically what it's
going to monitor or change is how many
full circles we're going to draw before
we get to the outer end and by outer end
I mean this point down here that's the
outer end so let's go in here you'll see
as we increase that you're just going to
have a bigger spiral drawing drawing
drawing divergence or this guy right
here controls whether as the spiral
whines if the distance between the arcs
is going to change so if we have our
spiral here you can see as I increase
that it's tighter in the middle and then
as it gets outwards it is bigger or has
bigger spaces in between it and then we
have inner radius and what that is going
to do for us is it's probably better
explained by just saying if it's a zero
meaning that the inner radius is set to
zero that means that the spiral is going
to start in the center of our spiral now
if we increase that you're going to say
whoop too much there we go
it's basically going to draw the spiral
in so inner radius is basically just
going to control where exactly with our
spiral the spiral is going to start
drawing so that is a ton of different
things in a good overview of some of the
tools inside of Inkscape in the next
part of the tutorial i'm going to walk
through all of these different guys how
the fills and all the rows and column
swatches align distribute layers fills
and strokes and a whole bunch of other
different things work please leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
