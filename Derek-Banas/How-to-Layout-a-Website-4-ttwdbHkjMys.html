4 of my how to lay out a website
tutorial in the previous tutorials which
you haven't seen them they are above
here on the screen you should definitely
watch them before you watch this one
otherwise you'll be confused I have made
the top header I've made the left
sidebar and I made both of these middle
parts and in this tutorial I'm going to
make the right sidebar and the footer so
let's zoom in Ellen here and see exactly
what we're going to be making this guy
right here where it says free ebook well
I'm going to jump in here and all of the
code or a link to the code is underneath
of this video and what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create a div guess what
that is going to contain all of the
information for my right sidebar so I'm
going to call this right sidebar give it
a name and it's going to be referenced
by an ID because there's only going to
be one right sidebar and what do we do
we put a little comment so we know where
the right sidebar ends and then each one
of these boxes in the right sidebar is
going to be contained in a div that is
going to be called right container and
let's comment that all right the first
thing I have to do is create the free
ebook that you see right there on the
screen so what am I going to do again
I'm going to just create another dip and
it's going to be called banner title
just like it's been called everywhere
else I've used it going to put an h4 tag
and I'm going to type in free ebook
right like that and then inside of there
paragraph tag ID is equal to ebook form
close that paragraph tag but it's so
tiny I don't really see any reason to
put a comment there and then I'm just
going to bold email unbold it or a break
statement in and then for now I'm just
going to put in sort of like a junk
input I'm going to convert this into a
wordpress theme so this will work for
now until I do all the PHP for that
that's going to allow people to actually
enter in this information and get their
free ebook and all that stuff and don't
forget to put on the break statement
inside of there and then I'm just going
to copy this paste it in there and type
in name and I'm just going to change
email to name and everything else is
going to be the same and if I want to
put that little submit button in there
input tell you it's equal to submit
value is equal to submit and that's all
I need to do for that guy and then the
final thing I'm going to do here put
another paragraph in there class is
equal to let's say you wanted to tell
people how wonderful this ebook is
well I'm gonna put some lorem ipsum
inside of here copy paste that inside of
there and I have no idea how long this
should be I'm just going to cut it off
right there and then I'm going to close
off that paragraph tag and now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to start
styling this so you can see it all get
put together so now I'm going to scroll
up to my style area and of course this
is going to go into a separate file here
but it's fine for right now I'm gonna
say right side bar which is the
container or the div that contains all
of this information right here and let's
style this guy well I'm going to float
it left again even though it's the final
piece because it lines up better that
way and margin left I'm gonna leave that
at zero pixels for now and margin right
I'm going to set that for 10 pixels see
how that works out and then right
container which is going to contain each
one of these individual little blocks
inside of here background color is going
to be white which is simple FFF and
border is going to be the same as
everything else that I've created so far
with this webpage it's going to be three
pixels and it's going to be solid and
it's going to be black and again margin
it's going to be 10 pixels I think
you've lasted this long you know that
I'm pretty much estimating all these
things I could have measured them all
out inside of Illustrator or some other
tool like that but I didn't I just like
to estimate so I normally am in a mad
rush to get everything done and padding
as two pixels all I'm doing here is I'm
using all the same numbers as I have
used for all of the previous guys as an
example and then we have a book form and
that's the form that's right here dial
that a little bit position it relative
and I'm going to move it up from its
whatever position it is into negative I
don't know 20 pixels we're going to see
in a second if this is right or not and
from the left two pixels because I've
been using that a lot say yes is where I
am reload and you can see that this
guy's going inside of here and I can see
right away that my padding is going to
be off actually for all of these so I'm
going to have to move all those around
but that's the only thing I'm going to
have to adjust it looks like is padding
you can see pretty much everything else
is sort of lining up let's zoom in all
right see there it is look at that the
banner is perfect because I did that
before so I'm going to have to move this
guy up some the email on the form and
all
stop and I can see here that this guy is
not up as far as I wanted it to be and
the reason why is I spelled relative
wrong and now you can see that it's
positioned pretty nicely so what do I
got to do now I have to move this
excerpt up that's going to describe the
wonderful ebook excerpt and
position:relative and we're going to
move it left to pixels because that's
how much I've moved everything else so
that should be right and top looks like
it has to go up a good bit let's try
negative 30 because we've just tried
down and it worked and in color for the
text well I know what that is because
I've used that everywhere else like that
gray and then font size again I've used
this same ten point font size everywhere
else it's worked yep looking pretty good
one thing I have noticed is the right
container is a little bit too far down
so let's shave a little bit off of that
let's try 6-9 there you are lines up
real tight with everything else there on
the screen and that's all we need to do
for the styling we can zoom back down to
this guy now we know that we got the
book part and all that stuff all set up
real nice so what do we have to do now
we have to put those social icons social
network icons these guys right here we
have to put those into place so that's
not a problem right after end of right
container I'm going to create a new div
and this div is going to be called well
it's going to have class name of social
icons and I'm making a class because I'm
not sure if I want to put these down in
a footer or not and if I did I'd want to
keep them the same way and use all the
same styling and all that stuff so
everything looks nice that's why I'm
doing it then I have to go and actually
get these guys and here are the social
network icons and I'm going to of course
give them all the same widths and all
the same stuff so I have to say source
is equal to DA images forward slash
Facebook logo dot ping all is equal to
Facebook let's just say doesn't matter
width is equal to 40 pixels height is
equal to 40 pixels class is going to be
equal to social network and then I'm
going to copy this and actually the RSS
feed comes first
so no big deal no reason to stress out
and in this situation we're just going
to put in RSS instead of Facebook and
spell social network right that would
help pace two more of those in there and
in here we're just going to say Twitter
and Twitter and in here we're going to
say LinkedIn because that's name of it
just out
- put a little - here in front of images
just little mistakes when I make
whenever I'm doing this and we're going
to get a dot social icons this should be
easy things going to be a hundred
seventy seven pixels because it's been
done that way last time margin left I
know I want to have a little bit of a
margin because there is a margin there
and let's just say 15 pixels that's what
it looks like and then padding around
these guys or around whole entire box
here see how that works
reload needs to move over a little tiny
bit more let's try 17 reload and that
looks just about perfect let's throw it
on 18 and then just quit
alright so that's looking good now we
can screw all the gun here again right
after socialite Collins and what we
going to do we're going to create all
those affiliates and what I decided to
do was actually to make these all
self-contained boxes and so that's what
I'm gonna do here I'm going to show you
exactly what I mean here
alright so jump back and do this and
then we'll go Dave glass is equal to
philia container was that all these are
actually going to be really tiny
but I thought what the heck do them
anyway and this is going to be so simple
because all I have to do is basically
create the banner part of this so I'm
going to go do of class is equal to when
I go banner idle just like I did before
then we go h4 affiliates goes off the h4
tie goes off the div and now I have to
decide how many of those I actually want
to use so let's say alright so want to
copy these affiliate container copy
let's try 4 then I have to stylize this
guy so let's scroll back up into the
style area alright and its affiliate
container tab background color is white
course order it just like before 3
pixels solid black margin right zero
pixels for now see where it works out
and then margin left 10 pixels because
that's what we've been doing elsewhere
and margin - bottom I don't know let's
try 10 pixels see how it works and then
with 177 because that's what I did in
the last one and height I don't know
let's try hundred fifty pixels and
padding two pixels and let's see how
that works
reload all right looking pretty sure
this is perfect okay I love that
everything looks like it's lining up
pretty pretty nice I think I want my
margin bottom yeah let's throw a little
bit more space inside of there
so margin-bottom let's take this to 15
instead and see if that lines up a
little bit nicer a little zoom out real
oh it's not quite right let's take it to
20 reload and there you are that's
looking almost identical to what's on
the left side of the screen and then
what I need to do basically what I have
a problem with here is I have some extra
space on the right side so what I need
to do is mess with the padding in
between all of these different blocks to
get all that the line up right so let's
just jump in and just do it so let's
look at this guy right here middle
column I see that there's no margin left
on this so let's throw margin left in
there again this is completely out of my
head let's try 20 pixels reload
all right that's too much so let's let's
try 10 I think it's too much
reload all right so that's a little bit
tighter so let's try that with
everything
let's just go coffee and let's go for
right sidebar and margin left and paste
that in there I'll say actually 20 is
probably don't work all right so let's
just take it to 20 right now 20 and then
we'll jump back up to middle column
change this to 20 again pase and you see
this guy bounce down here that's because
it kind of collapsed on itself so we can
make that work let's jump down here
again right sidebar let's change this to
19 let's try to 18 I'm just scrolling up
and down up and down up and down middle
column margin left let's change this to
18 I'll say up there it is it's back
into position looking pretty tight so
then what I got to do is I got to get
rid of this border which I have no
reason to have only had it there to see
exactly where my order was for the page
wrapper boink and everything's lined up
everything's really really tight
everything's spaced well looking nice
all right so let's throw the footer on
there and end this guy I'm actually
going to jump outside of content wrapper
because that's this purple part right
here I'm going to create another div and
its ID is going to be equal to footer
and there's not going to be anything in
there so I don't need to say end of
footer I mean sometimes I just get silly
and let's say I want to put like a
copyright symbol you put anything you
want down here mine just to throw
something in there because the big part
is I want to do styling on a footer so
let's roll back up to the style port and
with the footer I actually want to use
the same gradient I use the menu bar to
sort of tie everything together so let's
jump over into the menu dot CSS code now
let's copy that so I'm going to go into
background and I'm going to copy all of
this information down to here so this
handles the whole entire gradient
system jump back over into this and an
hash footer boink alright so now we're
going to have the exact same footer that
we have for the menu bar system so
everything's gonna sort of tie together
and let's say that I want to do a little
bit of margin left 10 pixels I don't
know I'm just sort of playing around
here now I'm pulling everything together
like I said there's a link to all this
code and stuff underneath here and I'm
gonna load it left to make sure it butts
up to the left side of the screen width
let's try a thousand pixels it'll tell
me if it's wrong padding - left
5 pixels height I don't know again this
isn't really in a matter because there's
nothing down here I'm just gonna say
hundred pixels text a line and this is
why none of this stuff really matters
because I'm going to text align in this
Center that's just gonna Center
everything on the screen color I'm gonna
make a white text color and padding
these are some common things you would
use but since this is very very very
simple it's not gonna matter so much
let's file save it just see how it looks
real Oh and you can see there is the
footer yeah get rid of this padding left
let's just kill it
alright it's gone let's just kill
padding all together margin left don't
need that either I'll say there it is
tight tight tight so there you go that's
how I style the right sidebar as well as
the footer section you have any
questions or comments leave them below
in the next part of this tutorial I'm
going to create the single pages
whenever somebody would click on more
I'm going to show you exactly what those
individual pages don't look like and
then I'm going to turn this whole entire
thing into a wordpress theme till next
