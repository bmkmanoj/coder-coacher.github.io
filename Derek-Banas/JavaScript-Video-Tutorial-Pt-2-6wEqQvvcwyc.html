2 of my JavaScript video tutorial in the
previous tutorial which if you didn't
see definitely watch it and there's a
link to it here on the screen I covered
pretty much every single thing there is
to do with JavaScript as a core language
but I disregarded some things on the
browser because I didn't want that video
to be an hour long today I'm going to
devote this video to handling events you
can see here on the right side of the
screen you can see that this text is
changing whenever I put the mouse over
it you can see I'm making paragraphs
disappear and reappear based off of
whether these are clicked or not I'm
also you can maybe see down here I'm
testing where the mouse is on the screen
at all time and also I'm checking for
different key presses as you can see
here and checking which mouse button is
being clicked countless numbers of
different things all in one video to
Taurus so let's just jump into it and
first off what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you some different things
I'm going to manipulate this brain that
I have here on the screen as you can see
here as this is being resized the brain
image is automatically changing as well
maybe not a pretty way but that's not
really the goal goal here is just to
show you a bunch pretty much every
single event handler and an example of a
bunch of different ways you can
manipulate said and lards as you can see
all kinds of things are popping up on
the screen ok let's get into it first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
come in here and I'm just going to
create a style for an h3 tag and I'm
just going to call it h3 style doesn't
matter just giving it a name and you
give it color gray boom that's done if
you don't know what that is
watch my CSS tutorial basically what I
did was I just said anything that's
labeled with this ID right here should
have the color gray and now I'm going to
move on here and I'm going to show you
some event handlers like for example I'm
putting this right inside of my body tag
I'm going to say on three size right
like that so whenever the browser is
resized that's what that's saying what I
want it to do is call a function called
change image I'm going to put a
semicolon in it and just like that and
then on top of that you can also put
multiple different event handlers inside
here here I'm going to say onload I want
an alert box to pop up that says website
loaded bunch of other requests I got
were from you guys to do some inline
I was script well this is basically how
you do that as well there you go those
are two event handlers this one's going
to call change image a function I'm
going to create here in a second and
this one is going to pop an alert box on
the screen whenever this is loaded and
of course you want to put a double quote
here in the end and actually I'll show
you see how this pops up website loaded
well that's exactly what this guy does
and I'm going to show you what some of
these other guys do going to jump down
here inside of the JavaScript coding
area and I'm going to show you what
change image looks like so I'm going to
create a function which you learned
about in the last tutorial and I'm going
to call it change image same as we got
right here it doesn't accept any
parameters and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to say document get element
and you do this all the time in
JavaScript what we do is we tell the
interpreter that we want to wrap and
manipulate different items on the
webpage based off of what their ID is
and this guy's name is going to be
little brain or the ID associated with
it then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to put dot style and I'm going to
say that I want to change the height of
this graphic to 35% of whatever the
current browser window is so that's what
that's doing document refers to the web
page itself get element by ID which is
this brain right here that is called
little brain and I'm going to change the
CSS style that's what the style on here
means I'm going to specifically change
the CSS property not called height and
as the webpage is resized which is going
to be called because the on resize event
is going to be triggered I'm going to
change the height as well as the width
of the graphic on the screen one second
you'll see exactly how this is done I'm
also going to change the width by the
same amount now this is going to cause
some distortion but that's not really a
big deal and then I want to end this
with return true and then I want to come
down here and close the function okay
super this guy's really actually almost
done I'm actually going to jump down
here where I have no script defined and
I'm going to create the image itself by
calling image source is equal to and I'm
going to point at a graphic that I call
little brain dot pain and here I'm going
to give it a name ID is equal to see if
you can guess what it's going to be
called little brain right like that and
as you can see right here that's the
same thing here
so I'm creating an ID called little
brain and here I'm referencing that ID
right there and then I'm also going to
give it some more event handlers
on-click means when the mouse clicks it
it's going to call a function called
alert mate which I'm going to create
here in a minute and another event
handler that's available to you with
JavaScript is double click so on and you
can see it follows the same premise
stores off with on and then on double
click here again I'm going to do inline
JavaScript and what I'm saying here is
that I want to call an alert box to pop
on the screen and say you double clicked
right like that close that off and then
forward slash and close off the whole
entire image tag so now we're going to
be able to go in here and mess around
with these I'm also going to create
another thing called alert me so
function alert me point point no
properties are passed to it and then I'm
going to say alert message is equal to
document paying reference to the webpage
that is currently on the screen little
brain tang reference to the ID which is
right here
and I'm saying that I want to know what
the source for it is and the source is
right here then what I'm going to do
within this alert box that pops up I'm
also going to grab current height for it
I'm doing string concatenation here
right now document dot little rained on
height and then just to make my life
simple I'm going to copy this and here
I'm going to say width I'm going to
close that off with a semicolon and I'm
going to come in here label that width
as well okay new line width
da-da-da-da-da so this is just creating
a string that's going to be full of all
this information so then what I'm going
to do is I'm going to shoot it out to
screen I'm going to do that is to open
an alert dialog box and inside of that
alert dialog box is going to be the
string that I just created
return true I'm going to close off that
function and just that little bit of
coding that I just did right there we
jump over here you're going to be able
to see what exactly that does you can
see right here page at localhost says
web site loaded so that opened up on the
screen and you can also see as I resize
this window if the brain is going to
stretch and automatically no matter how
many times I do this it's going to
continue to move around the screen and
also if I click on it double click you
double click pops up on the screen so
pretty cool some really neat little
things we just did there I'm going to
show you how to capture mouse movements
and countless other little things up
here I created a
3style that class so now I'm going to
show you how to change automatically the
color and the information inside of a
web page on the fly first what I'm going
to do because I think this is less
confusing is I'm going to jump down here
after the image and create an h3 tag and
I'm going to give it an ID equal to h3
style which is the name of that CSS
class that I created before your ID and
then I'm going to assign some more event
handlers on mouse-over that means this
is going to be triggered when the mouse
goes over top of this series of words
I'm going to call a function I'm going
to create called change color right like
that so all you did on Mouse out which
is an event handler that is triggered
whenever the person moves their mouse
off of the image I'm going to call that
change again maybe not the greatest
names imaginable but sort of doing this
on the fly really like that and I'm
going to give it a name of roll over
here in the beginning and then I'm going
to jump up here I'm going to create the
functions that I just typed in down here
so I'm going to create two functions one
is called change color and the other
one's going to be called change again
well function change color nothing's
going to be passed to it I'm keeping
this as simple as possible because
actually what we're doing here is kind
of complicated so I'm paying reference
to the webpage and I'm saying get
element by ID the idea I'm going to use
this time is going to be h3 style which
I've created in multiple different
places here style dot color is equal to
red what I'm doing here is just changing
the text color to red that's it but you
could change it to anything you could
change any CSS property in this way
what's really cool is I'm also going to
change the text in there pane reference
to first child if you understand that
everything inside of the web page is
called a node it's looked at as a node
we're going to get more into this later
on you can just consider a node a box
remember everything in CSS is a box from
previous tutorials and here basically
what I'm saying is that I want to change
the text that is inside of the node for
the h3 tag that's going to pop up here
on the screen to the words excited
that's what this says
and this is all document.getelementbyid
d first child and node value these are
all JavaScript
you'd use them over and over again if
you ever want to change any text in any
of these nodes or little boxes that
contain information on the screen okay
so I'm going to create another one I'm
going to change again remember function
change again gonna create another
function here in JavaScript try to keep
this neat document and just to save
myself some time I'm gonna actually just
copy this so I'm come in here document
and here I'm going to change the color
back to gray so when they move the mouse
off see on Mouse out change again it's
going to call this function and it's
going to say change the color back to
gray so that's what that does and then
on top of that I'm actually going to
change the text that is in this h3 tag
again so just let this be the same
except I'm going to type in board jump
down here return true that just means
that everything worked fine with the
function that's all I'm doing with that
you can see again this pops up because
the page loads but if you put the mouse
over top of this text it's changing to
red and it's also changing the text that
is inside of that h3 tag so that's how
you do all of that so what are we going
to do now we're going to jump down here
after the h3 tag and I'm going to show
you how to create and manipulate and
make visible and appear and disappear
paragraphs so I'm going to create a junk
paragraph and I'm going to give it the
ID which we need so that we can pay
reference to it in our JavaScript code
of first this is a paragraph and I'm
going to copy this I'm going to create
three paragraphs and I'm going to call
this one second and I'm going to call
this one third and then what I'm going
to do is I'm going to create a form
scroll that up and I'm going to give it
a name of form e X also very important
if you want to pay reference to any form
elements inside of JavaScript you have
to actually mention the name of the form
that contains anything you want to
manipulate and here what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create some checkboxes
that are going to manipulate these
paragraphs that I just created so how do
I create checkboxes a type in type
checkbox' and I'm going to have to give
it a name first para is the name I'm
going to give it and I'm going to say on
click is equal to show Terra it's going
to
the show para function I like that close
off that tag type in first paragraph
okay great so that's just a checkbox
that's going to call a function called
show para whenever it is clicked on and
then I just have to come in here and
change these names I'm going to change
this a second this is the third second
third go to make sure I close my form
keep that all nice and neat and then I
have to create what this function called
show para easy enough jump back up here
where we have our JavaScript code define
that we want to create a new function
called show para make sure
capitalization is the same and then what
am I going to do same thing again a
reference skip element by I D and then
the name of the element is going to be
called first and then I'm going to make
it disappear by changing its visibility
based on whether the checkbox is checked
or not so here I'm paying reference to
the webpage and then the form which is
called form X first
para and I'm asking it if it is checked
or not and now I'm going to use a
conditional operator here which we
talked about previous tutorial and if it
is checked I'm going to say that I want
the visibility to be set for visible and
if it's not checked I'm going to say I
want the visibility to be set for hidden
and then what I'm going to do here I'm
just going to come in here and copy that
guy if you want any of this code it's on
the website by the way the chances are
if you were thinking that you've
probably already left if you wonder why
I do these tutorials so quick it's
because I get constant requests to make
quick tutorials it's what I do
second third this can all stay the same
so based off whether the checkbox is
clicked on or not designates whether the
visibility of the paragraph is either
visible or hidden that's it
and then what do I do I go return true
and of course I also want to come in
here and change those to second and
third reload and then based off of which
of these guys is checked will designate
which paragraphs show up on the screen
it's a pretty crazy crazy stuff but I'm
going to show you next you more
complicated and I mean need more room on
my screen so I've got to get rid of all
this guy and I'm going to create another
guy inside of here it's going to be
called text input not really important
and I'm going to come in here create an
HTML text box type text obviously name
is going to be equal to text input and
here I'm going to show you another event
handler it's going to be on blur
that just means whenever this text box
loses focus meaning that the person
leaves the text box I'm just going to
open up and under alert and it's going
to say on blur triggered as I said I
wanted to show you as many of these guys
as humanly possible and I'm also going
to trigger something else called
on change and this is going to open up
and another alert and then I'm going to
trigger another event called on focus
and reload this and you can see here
text input whenever I click on it on
focus is triggered on focus is triggered
again
over and over and over and over again
and that was planned it's just pretty
much to show you that whenever you are
triggering on focus events and on blur
events that these shouldn't really be
calling alert boxes in order being
performed in line they should actually
be calling a function that has an end to
it and you can see here the on change
event was triggered whenever I typed in
the D and then moved outside of there
and again onblur triggered because it
lost the focus on the page now I'm going
to show you some stuff that's really
cool I'm going to keep my little text
box that I have right right here
wherever I'm going to give it a name
Mouse X and we get rid of this stuff and
this is going to constantly update on
the screen as the mouse position changes
and if I have the x position of the
mouse I also should get the Y position
for it which I'm going to and I'm going
to put that on the screen also so then
I'm actually going to because I need
these text boxes to be created before I
can store passing information to them
I'm actually going to put some
JavaScript code down here after the form
so to make life a little bit easier I'm
going to copy this guy right here the
link okay so let's come down into the
script area what I'm going to do now is
I'm going to show you a way to check
which browser you're using because
Microsoft Internet Explorer works
differently than all of the other ones
so we're going to say navigator dot app
name is equal to Microsoft Internet
Explorer let's just basically just
checks it asks the browser specifically
are you Microsoft Internet Explorer
and if it is it comes back through
otherwise it comes back false and then
what we're going to do is we're going to
say if you wonderful browser if you are
not Microsoft Internet Explorer I love
you and make your life real easy and I'm
going to come in here document and again
this is a JavaScript function not
something I created I'm going to say
that I want all of the events in
relation to mouse movement which is
event mouse move to be passed to the
document so that I am alerted whenever
they occur and there's a whole bunch of
these guys I'm going to also say that I
want to capture all events in regards to
the mouse button being pressed down and
I'm actually going to show these guys
later on but these are just the events
that's all they are these are the event
names in uppercase letters preceded with
event dot that's all it is you can do
this and capture all of the different
events in this very specific way ok so
that's what I'm doing I'm saying I want
these events passed to me I want to
handle them and then what I'm going to
do I want to say if the mouse is moved
I want that event passed to a function
that I'm going to create called Mouse
POS or Mouse position and I'm actually
come in here and also say on Mouse down
so whenever the mouse button is pressed
down I want you to call a function
called mouseclicked which i'm also going
to create and then I'm going to come in
here and just give these mouse click is
equal to zero it's going to zero these
guys out and also VAR key clicked equal
to 0 and var Mouse X is equal to 0 I'm
just create an empty variable names here
then when we use a is there a good
practice to create them before you use
them alright so what do I need to do
here I need to create a function called
Mouse POS I need to create another
function called mouse clicked let's do
it function Mouse p OS again this is
going to be a function it's not going to
be passed any parameters then I'm going
to say if you are not Microsoft Internet
Explorer Mouse X should be equal to e
which is a reference to the event in nan
Microsoft Internet Explorer browsers so
anything but and right
like that I'm going to change them on
the flock
so whenever the mouse is moved this
event is going to be sent to my document
and it's going to call Mouse POS this
function that event is going to be
handled from there the event information
that occurred or the mouse movement is
going to be passed to this function
right here and then I'm going to change
the value of the variable for mouse X
and mouse Y using this event here and
you can see those two variables are
right there so I want to fly them and be
changing these guys as they move really
cool and useful else if you are
Microsoft Internet Explorer now sex is
equal to and this is how you pay
reference to events in Microsoft
Internet Explorer body dot scroll L EFT
so instead of this nice short thing at
this wild absolute mess right here
that's why all right one and then just
tame it change this to scroll top so
that's how you monitor mouse movements
using Internet Explorer and everybody
else and then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to call the document or the
web page and on the fly as I do this I'm
going to change the value of the text
box called mouse X to the value of mouse
X or this guy right here it's very cool
that this just works like this I just
come in here change this to Y and change
this to one and then what I'm going to
do I'm going to return true right like
that so you can see him telling pretty
complicated things extremely easy and
you can see here mouse X and mousey or
mouse Y one little error here in
function Mouse POS I want to make sure I
put an e inside of there right there
that's the event being passed that's it
and if we jump over here and reload you
can see that my mouse x and y positions
are being tracked as they move around on
the screen ok so I'm going to create my
last two little guys here so that will
also be able to attract mouse clicks as
well as keyboard clicks and I just have
to make a couple little changes meaning
mainly that I'm going to come in here
and create a couple more text boxes so
I'm going to come in here copy that
paste going to change the name of this
to key press because I'm going to
monitor any keyboard presses and then
I'm going to come in here change the
name of this to
mouse button this is going to monitor
any mouse clicks in it accordingly okay
and that's all I need to change there
and then go back down to my JavaScript
code and I'm gonna have to come in here
I'm going to monitor any mouse down
events right like that I'm going to call
mouseclicked if the mouse buttons are
pressed or I'm going to call Mouse POS
if the mouse is moved and I'm also one
mouse down meaning the mouse is clicked
I'm going to call the function called
mouse clicked and now I just have to
create these different function that's
it so if I want a monitor key presses I
got to create a function called key
pressed and don't repeat the error that
I made before I want to make sure I take
e I accept e into this function which is
the event itself and all the information
in regards to that event then I'm going
to say if you are Internet Explorer e is
going to be equal to
window.event key clicked is going to be
equal to e key code else if you are not
every key on the keyboard has a number
that's associated with it I'm going to
show you how to change it from a simple
number into the actual code itself key
clicked you would do that is by calling
string from character code this is a
function inside of JavaScript what it
does is it turns character codes into
the actual character itself that's what
that does and then I'm going to say if
key not clicked turn false then that's
just saying that it didn't work document
dot form e x dot key press to add value
this is a reference to the text box
called key press and the value stored in
it and I'm going to give it whatever the
value of key clicked is which is going
to be a character that they clicked on
the keyboard and if we got here
everything worked out and we can close
it now I'm going to create the last
function that we need here and this is
going to handle if the mouse is clicked
again that's at the event code if you
are the evil Microsoft Internet Explorer
and here just to change it up I'm going
to call switch statement and any keys on
the mouse that are pressed in Internet
Explorer are referred to as event dot
button case it was a zero
then I want to change the value stored
in the textbox called mouse button to
the value equal to left meaning the left
mouse button was clicked on and if one
is passed that means the middle mouse
button is clicked on otherwise we're
actually just going to say default and
just say the right mouse button was
clicked on owls
if they're not using Internet Explorer
we're going to do is just copy this
whole entire switch statement paste and
if you're not using Internet Explorer
the way that you reference the event is
e dot which and here the number is going
to be one this is different between
everybody except Microsoft Explorer
everything else is exactly the same just
have to change that the one in that the
two just how they differ change that to
true and then and then in that guy
and if I reload it you can see it's not
only tracking the mouse positions but
it's also on-the-fly capturing anything
that I click on the keyboard as well as
any mouse clicks that I make here on the
screen all right so that's pretty much
every single event inside of JavaScript
except for a couple I disregarded these
because I personally don't use them all
the time you might on all the other
event handlers just so you know are on
abort and that is called when a page
load is interrupted on error is called
whenever a page error occurs on key down
is called whenever the key is pressed
but not yet released on key up is called
whenever a key is pressed and released
on mouse' is used whenever you want to
track whether the mouse has been
released on reset called whenever reset
button is clicked on submit which is
almost identical is called whenever the
submit button is clicked and on unload
is called whenever somebody tries to
leave the webpage so there is pretty
much everything you ever wanted to know
about event handling inside of
JavaScript you have any questions or
comments and you've them bundu otherwise
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
