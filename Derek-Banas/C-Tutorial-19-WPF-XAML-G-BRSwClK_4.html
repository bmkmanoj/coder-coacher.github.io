19 in my c-sharp video tutorial and this
part of the tutorial we're going to
start talking about GUI interfaces so
we're going to talk about WPF zamel
properties message box event handling
resources layout managers and a whole
bunch more I'm going to give you a rough
overview of a ton of different things in
this video and then in later videos I'm
going to create some applications like
always all the code is available in the
description underneath the video and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so the WPF or Windows presentation
foundation is going to be used to create
graphical user interfaces like I said
and zamel which is going to see a lot of
which stands for extensible application
markup language is going to be used to
create the UI using sort of something
that looks like XML and as you're going
to see sam'l is going to allow you to
define buttons boxes animation 2d 3d
graphics and a whole bunch more but
we're not going to get into all those
different things right now I'm going to
get in here and just first off show you
how to start one of these or create one
of these WPF projects you're going to go
to file and new project and then you're
going to come down here and open up
visual c-sharp and you're going to open
up Windows classic desktop and WPF app
like that
and you're going to click on down here
and we're going to give this a name so
I'm going to call this WPF tutorial and
that should work and I'm going to hit OK
alright so the first thing is going to
open up you're going to see main window
dot zamel and then your half main window
to exam about CS this was going to be
where the code is and this is going to
be the presentation layer and if we move
this down here you're going to see all
of your zamel code so let's move that up
and then I'll go through basically you
don't need to worry too much about all
of this stuff right here I'm not going
to get into it that much right now what
this guy right here is doing is defining
the namespace that all of your code is
going to be under main window is going
to be the name for your little window
you have right here and of course height
and width is going to define the height
and width of your window and grid is
going to open up by default that's going
to be your default layout manager we can
jump over here and look
this codes going to see it loads all
these different modules inside of here
and this guy right here is going to
initialize and display the window
whenever you run your application now
you're going to be able to come in here
and do a couple different things you're
going to be able to change the title for
example for your window just directly
inside of your code so you can change
this to a low world or something like
that and you can do a whole bunch of
different things you can see here as I
hit the dot it shows all the different
things I'm going to be able to change
you can see there is a lot of them so
what I'm going to do is just change one
more thing just to show you something
else I'm going to show you how to change
the start up location and we're going to
define window start up location and we
are going to say that when our
application runs we want it to run in
the center of the screen now I'm going
to jump back over into sam'l and open
that up and like I said you're going to
be able to come in here also and define
the title the size whether it can resize
or not I'm going to go and just change
couple these different things for us so
along with height and width and the name
which we changed over in the code we can
say we want to define the resize mode
and let's say that we want this to be
set to no resize that means that they
can't resize it and like I said you can
see all the different options as you
type this in directly we can have size
two contents and this is pretty much I'm
going to cover all the different things
you can do inside of here in regards to
the application itself and let's say
size two content and have that set to
whatever the width and height of all the
components are inside of here
you can define that this will be the
topmost window at all times no matter
what opens up inside of it I'm going to
set that to false because that can cause
a little bit of problems but that is an
option that's available to you I'm going
to define the windows state and you can
see here like I said it's either going
to start off maximized minimized or
normal which is going to be whatever
your height and with this you could also
come in here let's say I wanted to come
over and I wanted to create a icon I
could come
in and let's say add and go and get a
folder inside of here and we're going to
call this resources and then what I did
was inside of Windows I searched for an
icon file and I just copied and pasted
it or I'm going to paste it inside here
so I'm going to say paste and you can
see right there favicon dot ICO you can
use any icon you you can find that you
have tons of them on your computer so
just search for one of them and then I
will be able to come in here and set the
icon for it also so let's change this to
icon equal to and then you would go dot
/and resources which is going to point
at that resources folder that you just
created right there and then favicon and
ICO and that's going to set the icon for
your application you could also do let's
say we wanted to change you can do so
many different there's so many events on
what I'm going to do here is go mouse
move and I'm going to need to
automatically create an event handler
it's going to change the title to the XY
position of wherever the mouse is moving
so I'm going to just click on this guy
right here and you can see window Mouse
move shows up right there I'm going to
save that jump over here and you're
going to see that window Mouse move
shows up right inside of here and now we
can define exactly what we want to do
inside of there whenever the mouse moves
and what I specifically want to do
inside of here is like I said I want to
change the X and y position and display
it in the title and I can do so just by
referencing the title like that is equal
to e which is our event get position and
get position like this and then we can
go this which is going to be our mouse
and then let's convert it to a string
and we're going to do a whole bunch of
these this is just something cool well I
just threw that in there let's just run
it and see what happens all right so the
application is going to load whoops
can't do that yet I'm gonna have to
actually come in here and throw some
content inside of our application before
I can run that so let's come in and
let's change a couple different things
here I'm for ado that let's come in and
I want to talk about resources a little
bit because I want to go and pull some
resources I'm trying to cover a
bazillion different things now you're
going to be able to store data as a
resource and
use it over and over again just by
coming in here and going window resource
like that and then we can throw a string
inside of here so we'll say something
like this string X and then we'll go key
is equal to and this is just going to be
like the name that we're going to be
referencing this string ass so hello
again get rid of that extra quote we
have there and then inside of here we
can put whatever our string name is and
I'm going to have this be hello again
and then just save that and let's change
this to sis and then this is give us an
error because we need to load some
things so we're just going to check on
that right there and what we need to
load is exactly what it shows right here
so I'm just going to say preview changes
and then click on apply and that's going
to go away
all that's fixed now we're going to be
able to use resources and like I said
before grid is a layout manager in which
there are a whole bunch of them there is
also the stack panel which is what we're
going to use right here you can see that
automatically updated both of those
little tags and there's also the canvas
and the dot panel which I'll show you
here is the tutorial continues now we're
going to have the stack panel set up so
that it is automatically going to stack
every single component that we put
inside here and this is going to look
ugly but don't worry about that so I'm
going to go orientation is equal to and
let's just have it set up for vertical
so that everything is going to show up
vertically on the screen all the
different components and let's start
throwing some components inside of there
so we can come down we could either type
in let's do it both ways so I could come
in and I could do a text block like this
and then let's have the you're mainly
going you're not going to use the stack
panel that much you're normally going to
use it inside of other layout managers
but I just want to cover all of them so
what we're going to do here is have
vertical alignments be equal to Center
and there that is another thing that's
neat to know is you're going to be able
to change all these other different
things over here in the property section
so let's close us off at the end there
and then you're going to see all the
different layout options that we have
here orientation vertical and blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah but I'll get
into those as we continue
so going to go text wrapping and have it
all wrap on the screen that makes sense
for me I'm going to throw some text
inside of here this is going to be the
content that shows up and I'm going to
use hello world just to do something
different and let's do vertical
alignment and let's set this to top and
then just as an additional thing let's
go and set the font size and let's make
that equal to 40 and as you can see as
I'm typing all this in it's
automatically going up there on the
screen we're also going to be able to
come in here and use the resource that
we defined right here this string right
here and how we can do that is come down
inside of here and let's just do another
text block just to do something that's
just very easy and then here if we want
to use that text block instead we're
going to go text and then inside of the
quotes we're going to say static
resource and string hello again is going
to show up which is the name that we
gave that resource of course we can set
the font size and all the other
different things we have here and let's
have the horizontal alignment also be
centered one rather than type all that
out like this and then we'll close off
that tag and you can see how low again
shows up there we can also come in and
let's open this up down here and let's
click on toolbox that's what I'm
clicking on right there we can also drag
and drop these guys there's button I'm
going to drag and drop it up here so
just drag it up onto your screen and
drop it it's automatically going to show
up right there I'm also going to be able
to define other things inside of my
resource section like let's say I want
to default for all the buttons that I
use I can do that so let's come in and
trying to cover pretty much everything
how you define default styling for
components is you come in and you say
style and then you define the type of
component you're going to be working
with which is going to be button and
then close that off and then inside of
here you define all your defaults so I'm
going to say setter here and I'm going
to define the property that I want to
set as a default and let's say that I
want my margin to have a value that is
equal to
one I can just do it like that and close
that off let's do this for a couple more
different things here just so you can
see a couple of them so also define the
font size and as I'm changing these
you're going to see the things up here
are going to change as well so let's
change this to 40 and let's set let's
also do vertical contents alignment it's
already going to have a value of center
but I'm just doing it and then you can
also change the font family so let's go
font family and let's set this to
consoles alright so there we go went and
change a couple different things you're
going to see that they as I change the
styling inside of this resource section
that is automatically going to update
all of the buttons that are available
for us to use
so let's come down here and let's change
this name I'm going to change this to
close window I'm going to show you how
to go and track an event and how to
close your window using a component
let's go and give this a name though
first so that we can refer to it and how
you do that is by going X colon and then
name and then this is going to be equal
to I'm just going to keep it simple and
call this button one commit here and
define a couple other different things
let's go height and let's get rid of the
content section here
let's go height and let's define that as
40 width is going to be equal to 90 get
rid of that extra quote that's causing
problems see how that changed horizontal
alignments and let's make that sensor
content is going to be equal to closed
window because that's what it's going to
do you can see it's not quite fitting so
why don't we go and change that a little
bit more let's change this to 200 up it
needs even more space all right so let's
go change this also changes the 60 I'm
just doing this on the fly so a little
bit off and let's change this to 250 a
it needs to get bigger let's change it
to 300
what I'm doing is overriding the
defaults that I set up in the resource
section for this and then let's also
come in here and define a click event so
we just type in click and then this
guy's going to pop up inside of here and
I can just double click on it it's
automatically going to save that and put
over in my code section where I will be
able to update it before I leave though
I'm going to show you a couple other
different little tricks we can do let's
throw another button inside of here and
why don't we just go and copy this
instead of typing it all out I'm going
to grab this guy right here copy it
paste it inside of there and I'm going
to call this I'm going to change this a
little bit we call this button open file
to show you how you can open the Open
File dialogues to automatically open up
files so let's change the content on
this to open file now let's change the
click event here to button open file
click and then I'm also going to show
you how you can open the save file
dialog so let's paste that inside of
there and let's just change this from
open to save file and then change this
to button save file alright so we're
back over in the coding section and
let's set up button one so this will
work for us what I want this to do is
whenever the user clicks on it I'm going
to open up a message box and tell them
that the app is closing and I'm going to
close the application so to open a
message box you just go message box like
that and show and then we're going to
say something like as a app is closing
and that's going to open up right before
the app closest and to close your app
you just go this and close and there you
go you just close that window now
because I went and defined those click
events without allowing the application
or visual studio do that for me I'm
going to have to come in here and
actually create these on my own but
they're pretty simple I just copy this
so it's going to do basically the same
exact thing so let's paste that inside
of there and then let's just change name
this so this was change that to button
open file click that was the name that I
gave it over in this am will file and if
I want to open up a open file dialog I
just go open file dialog that's going to
give me an error saying that doesn't
exist so I'm going to come down here and
go show potential fixes and this is the
one I use I need and it's automatically
going to go and put that in there for me
so now what I can do is go open dialog
equal to
new and we can go open file dialog to
create that and then to open it we can
just go open dialog like that and show
dialog and I will open that up and
you'll see what that looks like here in
a second and we also we're going to show
you the save file dialog so let's open
that up and just change this to save and
everything else stays exactly the same
except this is going to be saved file
dialog to change that and let's change
this one and let's change this as well
and it'll change this one also save
dialog show dialog is still going to be
the same as it was before and now I did
a whole bunch of different things so
let's run it too and let's see how this
works out oh there's an error what was
the error that the lien windows is not
containing a definition for button open
file click make sure that it went and
got the right module inside of here
I I thought it was going to give it to
me oh yes it did there's that one right
there I see what I did inside here I
have to go button open file click and
button there now it should be fixed and
there you can see it open if I click on
open file like this it's going to open
up the open file dialog like you've seen
before man we'll just hit cancel right
here I left that as open file no big
deal this is the save as dialog you can
see how that works
oh you can also notice here that as I'm
moving around the X&amp;amp;Y coordinates are
changing up there in the title kind of
neat and right here you can see that if
I go and click on close window the
message box is going to open up I'm
going to click on OK and the application
is going to close so a whole bunch of
different things we've covered right
there now I'm going to go in and focus
in on the different layout managers we
have available to us so here I am back
in the Samuel area and what I'm going to
do is I'm just going to get rid of the
stack panel here all together delete
everything that we created and I'm going
to replace it instead with a canvas now
the canvas is normally not used on its
own but it is quite useful and I'm going
to set the you can see all the different
colors that are available that to
automatically pop up inside there I'm
just going to be simple and use grey
inside of here you can see everything
changed grey up there you're going to be
able to come in and adjust a whole bunch
of different things and what makes the
canvas
layout manager different is it allows
you to place components and absolutely
wherever you drag-and-drop them and it
is not automatically going to
dynamically resize if you resize the
window everything just going to stay
exactly where ever you put it so here
I'm going to define my height as 350
just do something and my width is going
to be 525 it's basically the same as the
window that's going to be there and then
inside of here I can go and drop
whatever I want so let's open up the
toolbox again and let's say I want to
get a label so there's a label right
there I'm going to drag it up here and
wherever I put it that is where is going
to stick say you can see it's right
there just as isolated in so let's
change it a little bit let's change this
to a name and let's you can see as we
move this around canvas left and canvas
top we're going to change everything's
based off of this zero position up here
in the upper left hand corner and let's
go and get a text box also so it's open
this up and get a text box drag it up
here and drop it just wherever you want
to put it that seems perfectly fun and
you can use the arrow keys to position
it if you think it looks better in some
other position and for this guy I'm
going to change the text right here and
I'm going to change it to enter name
just to add something in there and I'm
also going to add a name property to it
so that I will be able to grab the
information out of it that's inside of
there and the name when I give this is
user's name and it let's also come in
here and grab a button out of here so
let's grab a button like this guy right
here and throw it up inside out of there
you can see my styling isn't working all
that wonderful let's go and get rid of
it I just put that in there just so that
I could cover that and show that it was
possible to do it so let's just go in
here and delete the default styling for
our buttons there you go now it looks a
little bit better and let's change this
content right here to send and what I
want to do with this is whenever is the
user clicks on send I want them to
automatically open up a dialog that is
going to say hello whatever their name
so I'm going to add another click event
to this so I'm going to say click is
equal to and let's go and create
something for it so let's go new event
handler so just double click on that and
it's just going to be button click I'm
going to change it to send button click
though bounce over into the code and one
thing I'm going to have to do inside of
here is I'm going to put a string inside
of here
that's going to hold the user's name so
just users name is going to be like that
to find outside of the main window and
then let's find button click and let's
change it to send button click and then
to get whatever the name was that they
entered inside of there I just reference
its name users name text and I'm going
to save it to my string we can come over
here and look at it again users name is
what I gave this see users names right
there so let's come back and side here
and then I'm just going to output it in
a message box exactly like that so let's
save that let's run it see how it
changed you can see right here it opened
up if I come in and select this let's go
to that and type in Derrick and click on
send it's going to say hello Derrick
okay so another way to grab text out of
a component and use it to display in
other components and now why don't we
take a look at the wrap panel so I'm
going to delete canvas just like I did
before and we're going to type in wrap
panel and open that guy up now the wrap
panel is going to allow components to
flow as the window is resized and kind
of like some of the other ones that I've
talked about layout managers anyway most
of the time wrap panel is only going to
be used as a sub element but I just want
to show you what it looks like of course
we can come in here and change the
background and tons of different
properties let's just set this to gray
again just to be a little bit boring and
I'm going to set my orientation in this
guy to horizontal that's just going to
define how it's going to wrap the
information and then I'm just going to
go in here and throw a couple different
things in so I'll go label and contents
is equal to and we'll say name and close
that off I'm going to jump over into the
code first because I foresee an error
that says this doesn't exist anymore
we're just going to delete that all
right all gone and then we'll throw in a
a text box again and name is equal to
and let's throw a user's name inside of
there just to do something and the text
for this guy is going to be enter name
just like we did before whoops
now startup enter name there we go
and let's define our width to be equal
to I don't know just 150 there we go and
we can also throw a button inside of
there just to add a little bit more
content and the content for this is
going to be send and then we'll go
define our width again is equal to 75
and we will define click now we don't
need to define click event all right so
let's close that off and then you can
see what it looks like or how wrap panel
works let's start that you can see it's
right here
and if we come in here and resize it
whoops I said no resize all right let's
close that up let's jump like inside of
it so right here where we have our
window remember I said right here no
resize let's just get rid of that all
together all right save that let's run
it again trying to do 50 different
things here once alright so there it is
now we will be able to resize it so now
you see how that works and you can also
see how the wrap pane will see how it
has the window size changes it's
automatically going to fill all of the
content all right so another layout
manager and for the last layout manager
I'm going to cover I'm going to talk
about grid panels and the reason why
you're going to use grid panels a lot is
because they are very flexible and
everything is basically just going to be
pasted or placed inside of cells that
are made up of a whole bunch of columns
and rows so let's come in here and let's
get rid of our wrap panel delete that
and there's a good reason why they give
you grid by default inside of Visual
Studio whenever you're working with your
layout manager so what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to basically how you
define how the content is going to be
set up is you add rows and columns by
adding things called row definitions and
column definitions and I'm just going to
go in and start making them so we're
going to come in and we're going to go
grid and then we're going to
a row definitions and then inside of
here you're going to define what's going
on so what I'm going to do is try to
define or create a calculator so I'm
going to go row definition and I'm going
to say that the height is going to be
equal to star now you can put a fixed
height inside here which would be a
number you know like 20 30 whatever you
want it to be you could put a star in
there and what that means is it's going
to take all of the spaces available or
you could type Auto inside of there
which means that it's going to take all
the space needed by the component so
there's a whole bunch of different
options available to you now for my
calculator what I'm going to do is I'm
going to need I'm thinking six rows so
let's go create six of these and you can
see they automatically drew them on the
screen up there so there's six rows and
then what you need to do after you're
done with that is to find the number of
columns you're working with so I'm going
to say grid and column definitions there
that is and now you need to define all
the column definitions how many columns
you want I'm going to say I need four
columns so I'm going to say column
definition and I'm going to say that the
width is just like before going to be
equal to star so it's going to take all
of the space that's available and then I
just come in here like that
and paste in I said for there's four of
those and you can see how everything is
laying itself out there now what you
need to do is come in and define where
the components are going to lie inside
of your grid system I'm going to don't
drop this down here so let's say across
the top I'm going to want to get a text
box just because I can do it here let's
go and drag and drop a text block up
inside of there so it's fine text block
or I'm going to use a text box so I'm
going to drag this up here and I'm just
going to drop it inside of there you can
see how it was placed inside of there
now what I want to do is come down here
and actually define what's up with this
so I'm going to get rid of the margin
altogether because that's kind of
productive what I'm trying to do or
actually let's change it a little bit
better let's say that I want to define
that the margin is going to have two
pixels of margin on the left and the
right
and five pixels of space on the top and
the bottom so we can just go to five
like that then what I need to do is
define exactly how it's going to layout
inside of our columns so I'm going to
say that I want to use grid row and that
is going to be equal to 0 and then grid
column span that means how many how many
columns it's going to take up I'm going
to say that it should take up 4 so it
goes completely across the top of the
screen then I'm also going to come in
here and get rid of our height property
and get rid of width so that
automatically is going to fill all the
space and now get rid of vertical
alignment don't need that get rid of
horizontal alignment don't need that
either and now you can see the text box
I created where our numbers are going to
go fills in all the space and there's
the margin and all the other stuff so
now what I need to do is come in and
actually start putting in the buttons
that are going to go underneath of it so
I can drag a button up here if I'd like
to and then resize it sometimes that's
more trouble than it's worth I'm just
going to go in and create a button
completely from scratch so I'm going to
say button and the content for this
button is going to be the number 7 and
here I'm going to say horizontal
alignment and I'm going to set that guy
to left this is going to start in grid
Row 1 which means this is 0 this is the
number 1 row Here I am going to use the
vertical alignments and I'm going to set
that to top I don't need to define
column of span because by default it's
only going to work with one column and
I'm gonna say that the width is equal to
something like 130 think I'm dividing
that up right and the height is going to
be somewhere around 50 and I'm going to
close that off
and there you can see through in my
number and it's pretty much lined up
pretty well ok so now I need to do that
for a whole bunch of additional buttons
this isn't perfect but it's you know
good for what we're doing so I'm going
to need 1 for 8 I'm going to need one
from 9 and I'm going to need another one
for the plus sign so I'm going to change
this to 8 I'm going to change this to 9
I'm going to change this to the plus
sign and then to get this to actually
work I just have to define what column
for these for all the
additional ones I need to define the
column that is going to be resting
inside of so right after this I'm going
to say grid and then call them and well
I don't want to overwrite that so let's
get rid of that space like that and grid
dot column there it is and I'm going to
have this go in the first one and you
can see right there how those are all
lining up I'm going to copy this and
change the other two as well let's
change this to two and then come in for
our last one and change this to three
and there we go got our text box and we
have all of our numbers now what we're
going to be able to do is just copy this
because we're going to use the same
format over and over and over again so
let's just copy every single one of
those copy paste that inside of there
here I'm going to get a grid column and
I'm going to change this to zero for our
very first one so let's put that inside
of there change that to zero right like
that we have to change our rows every
row now is going to be two so let's go
and change all of these to two two and
two and then we need to change the
numbers that are assigned to all of them
as well so let's go up here and this is
going to be four this is going to be
five and this is going to be six and
then we are going to come down here and
throw in a negative and you can see all
of those are all lining up and if we run
this of course I could do all the
additional ones but I think you're
getting the point
there is our calculator there's our
textbox and there are all of our buttons
that we will be able to use to interact
with our application and you can see as
I resize them it is automatically
filling in all of the different space ok
so there is a rough overview of a whole
ton of different things about how to
create GUI interfaces using WPF and
zamel inside a visual studio with
c-sharp and of course I'm going to make
a whole bunch of different applications
here demonstrating exactly how this
works and like always please leave your
questions and comments below of the last
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
