make pita bread pita chips sun-dried
tomato hummus baba ganoush and chickpea
sweet potato rice so I have a lot to do
so let's get making it now for best
results I used both whole-wheat flour as
well as regular old white bread flour
and I'm gonna add one and a half cups of
whole wheat flour and then I'm gonna add
one and a half cups of regular old white
flour I like to use the bread flour
though and then to that I'm going to add
two and a half teaspoons of quick rise
yeast as you see and then I'll add one
and a half teaspoons of regular old salt
you can use any salt you want and then
I'm gonna add one teaspoon of sugar
I like this organic sugar but you can
use anything and then we're gonna start
blending it to combine and then we're
going to add in 1 and 1/3 cup of warm
water and of course wipe down the sides
every once in a while and we're gonna
let that blend until it forms into a
ball you're gonna see it form into a
ball right there and then we know that
we're pretty much done and then we want
to spread that out on some regular old
white flour and then knead it for a
little bit and you're gonna continue
kneading it over and over and over again
until it looks like that then we're
gonna take it put it in a bowl and then
cover it with a cloth that is soaked in
warm water and let it sit for one hour
after one hour it's going to pretty much
double in size and we're gonna go in to
get some flour throw that down on
whatever you're gonna roll this on pull
off about a golf-ball size chunk roll it
up in your hands till it forms into a
ball and then put it down on your flour
and roll it out until it's about five to
six inches in width you're going to want
to also pre-heat your oven to about 500
degrees right about now as you're
rolling all this out you're going to get
some flour put it on a non-stick pan and
then take all of your pita breads and
put them on there and after they cook
for right around seven minutes they're
gonna look like this they're gonna look
like pita bread and now it's gonna be
time to make our sun-dried tomato hummus
you're gonna get two 15 ounce cans of
chickpeas one's gonna be drained and
one's not gonna be drained you're gonna
add both of those to the blender and
then you're going to get two tablespoons
of minced garlic as well as two
tablespoons of lemon juice and add all
of those to the blender you
going to add one teaspoon of ground
cumin as well as one half of a teaspoon
of paprika you can use any type of
paprika that you have on hand and then
you're gonna add four tablespoons of
toasted sesame seeds or you'll have to
toast the sesame seeds that you have
available to you and then we'll add 1/4
of a cup of fresh chopped basil to this
and then we're going to blend it and
then near the end of it I'm going to add
in 1/2 cup of drained sun-dried tomatoes
and then add salt to taste okay so you
have your sun-dried tomato hummus which
is awesome now we're gonna make publican
us what we're gonna do is get one
eggplant and peel it and then cut it
into 1/4 inch rounds this is then going
to go into your broiler for seven
minutes under the broiler and then we're
gonna throw that into our blender and
then we're gonna get ourselves three
tablespoons of toasted sesame seeds and
add those to the blender as well then to
finish everything off we're gonna get a
half of a tablespoon of lemon juice add
that to the blender then we'll get some
minced garlic add one tablespoon of
minced garlic we'll also be adding some
fresh basil one tablespoon of that and
blend it up and this is what it looks
like there's bubblegum Uche now I'm
gonna make a chickpea sweet potato rice
dish that is absolutely amazing we're
gonna get about 1/4 a cup of water throw
that in a pan and then we're gonna cook
3 onions for right around 5 minutes and
then after the onions have started to
stick to the pan we're gonna get
ourselves one cup of veggie broth and
throw that in a pan and then to that
we're gonna add 2 teaspoons of ground
coriander as well as 2 teaspoons of
ground cumin then we're gonna stir all
that up until it's very well combined
now we're gonna add an additional three
cups of veggie broth make sure you use
vegetable broth don't use water this
tastes much better and now trust me on
this now you want to add one cup of
orange juice to the pan as well as 2/3
of a cup of pretty much any type of rice
I just used generic rice here you could
use jasmine rice and then you're gonna
use 3 cups of sweet potatoes that are
roughly cubed and finally to finish off
everything you're gonna get 2 15 ounce
cans of garbanzo beans or chickpeas
these are going to be drained and then
you're gonna bring that to a boil and
then cook it at 20% for 40 minutes and
here you go you're gonna have yourself
an awesome soup as well as pita bread
with a sun-dried tomato hummus
