3 of my Inkscape video tutorial in this
part of the tutorial I'm going to talk
about layers strokes fills tweaks the
tweak tool gradients the best da tool
the Pathfinder tool and a whole bunch
more if you haven't seen part 1 or 2 you
should definitely check those out and I
provide a link those in the upper right
hand corner now I have a lot to do so
let's get into it now in the last part
of the tutorial I talked about layers
briefly in this part I'm going to talk
about them a little bit more let's click
on the layers tab right here and here
you're going to see layer and this is on
the first layer this rectangle I created
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
come in here and add another layer and
like I said previously you're mainly
going to use layers whenever you find
that you are always editing just some of
the objects together and you're not
editing other objects with them or you
might create layers just so it's easier
to select certain objects without having
to worry about accidentally selecting an
object that is on another layer of
course you can change the position in
which you put your new layer in I'm
going to have it be above current and
I'm going to hit add you can see here I
am now selecting layer two and if I go
and draw another rectangle and change
the stroke color on it it is now gray it
is on another layer then layer 1 which
is going to hold our blue rectangle now
since I have that selected I can come
over here and do things like change the
opacity on it and lower it and you can
see the opacity changed on the entire
layer or raise it back up I can also
hide it just look down here there it
went away there it came back and I can
also lock it and that will keep me from
being able to select it or edit it click
on that to unlock it again and of course
I can also come over here and lower it
to the absolute bottom underneath of all
the layers or since there's only two
layers that will do exactly what I
needed to do and then finally if I
decide that I no longer want the layer
of course I can hit the minus sign and
delete it I'm gonna leave blend mode for
a later part of the tutorial because I
have a ton of other things I want to
focus in on one of those things I really
want to focus in on our fills and
strokes specifically quickly this is
going to be no fill this is going to be
just a flat fill this is going to be a
linear gradient or a gradient that goes
from left to right or right to left it's
going to go
in one direction going to have your
radial gradients which are going to
start from the center and grow from
there then you're going to have patterns
and then you're going to swatches which
I'll get more into here later
first off RGB stands for red green and
blue and that is how we are going to
create colors of course as we increase
these colors they are eventually going
to get lighter and lighter and lighter
until they become white a in this
situation stands for alpha or opacity
whether you can see through the color or
not if you come down here a little bit
you're going to see your hex code right
here and of course the hex code is just
the first six digits or letters and then
the final two in this situation are
going to deal with opacity whether that
matters to you or not blur is best seen
in person which I'm going to show you in
a second and then of course you can
change opacity on your individual fill
now that I have this selected I'm just
going to use the blur tool and you're
going to see that it blurs which works
really great if you're trying to do
photorealistic or very realistic
artistic images other than that you may
not need it unless you just use it as a
simple effect that's pretty much all you
need to know about RGB and we get into
HSL or hue saturation and lightness and
there's opacity again and this is
basically here for when you want to find
that absolute perfect color by tweaking
the saturation and the lightness and
that's pretty much what you'll always
use this little dialog specifically for
and we get to CMYK now Inkscape provides
for the use of CMYK but since Inkscape
really isn't suited for guaranteed this
is going to look exactly the way it
looks on the screen when you print it
out CMYK is kind of here for the people
that prefer to use CMYK over using RGB
it's not really good for guaranteeing
that something gets printed
exactly the way that it looks on the
screen so leave that however you'd like
it then you have a color wheel which I
almost never use and then finally you
have CMS or the color management system
which is really just an experimental
feature and I'm going to skip it for now
now since we're specifically dealing
with color or in this situation a
rectangle which I am particularly fond
of and you have it selected and you want
to change its color real easy you could
just come down here
and click on in this and it's going to
change its color if you'd also like to
change the stroke first I'm going to go
into stroke style so we can see this
changes to ten hit enter you can see it
has a stroke if you want to pick a
stroke from the palette underneath here
hold down shift and now it's green if
you want to just change the fill for an
object it's selected just click and if
you want to change the stroke hold down
the shift key and click you can see that
is changed if you can't see any of this
beautiful screen
it's an HD video the swatches dialogue
over here of course may be something
that's more convenient for you to just
cycle through to find different colors
and of course if you want to change and
open up different types of swatches that
is available for you however for the
most part I just use the Inkscape
default swatch library the dropper tool
is actually quite cool and by the
dropper tool I mean this guy right here
and of course we get it with a shortcut
of D but I'm going to create another
rectangle over here now if I have this
guy selected and I change to the dropper
tool and click anywhere or more
specifically in this rectangle you're
going to see that that changed the fill
color and if I hold down the shift key
with the dropper tool you're going to
see that it changed the stroke I can
undo that with control Z another thing
it's kind of neat is let's go and grab
this and pull it down here so we'll be
able to see it when i zoom in if you
have the dropper tool selected and you
go over top of a color you're going to
see that color show up right there and
you're also going to see some other
information pop up like click to set
fill shift + click to set stroke and a
lot of the other different types of tips
that I am telling you about in this
tutorial and that's true of a lot of
these other different tools that we use
they're going to give you a little bit
of information in regards to the things
you can do say for example as I'm
drawing this rectangle those numbers are
changing down there and then it also
says with control to make square or
integer ratio rectangle and shift to
draw around the starting point so that's
sort of bad English but either way it's
a little bit of a tip that you can look
down briefly down here and see some tips
on how to more specifically edit the
current tool you're using another thing
that's kind of interesting in regards to
the dropper tool let's say you create a
whole bunch of rectangles
inside of here and I am going to give
them a similar type of color let's just
select that and let's go like this and
let's go like that all different colors
but they're all kind of close to each
other what the dropper tool is going to
allow you to do is first hit D and then
let's select one of these things first
I'll that one selected so this is going
to be the one that is going to change
now I switch over to the dropper tool
now if I went to this color to be a mix
of all these other colors so that maybe
it blends a little bit better I just
click and hold and drag a circle and
it's going to give the best closest
average of all the colors that I
selected so try that again there you can
see and there you can say so it sort of
averages out all the colors that come
within the circle with the dropper tool
it's another neat thing then the final
thing is in regards to pick an assign
almost always I'm going to leave pick an
assign selected but there might be some
weird reason why you might not want to
basically to cut to the chase if you
want to be able to click on a color with
the dropper tool and not only copy the
color itself but also the opacity of
that color leave it these both selected
otherwise I'll tell you specifically
what pick and assign do but it might be
a little tiny bit confusing if the
droppers pick button is off what it's
going to do is pick the closest color
without regard to opacity so it's
basically going to throw out opacity if
this isn't selected if the droppers pick
button is on like it is right now it's
going to pick the actual color as well
as the opacity of said color then if
pick is on and assign is off the opacity
part is going to be thrown out after you
select that color however if you're in a
situation where I am where I have pick
an assign both selected at the same time
if you click on a color it's going to
copy both the color and the opacity so a
whole bunch of stuff right there but
basically I hope that makes sense just
like anything just play around with this
tool and you'll learn a lot from
Inkscape now what I'm going to do is
show you some of the cool things you can
do with the tweak tool so I'm going to
create myself a whole bunch of wreck
it's very easy to get confused by the
tweak tool because very often it does
things and you don't really realize it's
doing things but either way so I'm going
to create a whole bunch of duplicates by
hitting ctrl D and I just hit it a whole
bunch of times then I'm going to go into
the selection tool and select it then
I'm going to come over here to rows and
columns and then I'm just going to let
this be rows and columns for and let the
spacing be 15 pixels and hit a range
there you can see it drew a whole bunch
of these guys out on the screen now I'm
going to switch over to the tweak tool
by hitting W basically what this is
going to do there's a whole bunch of
different modes width is going to define
the width of your tweak tool so let's
take it down you can see that a trunk
and force is specifically kind of looked
upon as if you are forcing a hand
against objects or forcing something
against objects how much force is being
applied there's a whole bunch of
different modes this mode is just going
to move objects in the direction you
move your tweak tool this guy is going
to move the objects towards a cursor
this is going to move the objects
randomly so just think like a fingers go
into the objects and sort of moving them
around this is going to move them away
this is going to move them towards the
cursor this is going to move them
randomly this is going to shrink objects
this is going to rotate objects this is
going to duplicate objects or if you
hold down the shift key it is going to
delete them so the first one I'm just
going to click on this and show you what
it looks like say it's sort of moving
them let me zoom in here a little bit
say it's sort of moving the objects
around to make them less static and
boring let's undo that and if I come up
here this is going to move the objects
towards so let's zoom in again there you
go you can see that's moving towards the
cursor it sort of adds some randomness
to design which very often is something
that's useful can also come up here this
is going to randomize things there you
go sort of like randomly jittering them
around and then you can also have them
shrink as you go over them shrink shrink
shrink sorry shrink say it's very subtle
said you might want to watch this video
in full screen to see it and then this
is going to rotate the objects well zoom
in here and as I move across they are
slightly rotating with each of those
features also if you hold down the shift
key they're going to do the opposite so
in this situation they are rotating
or clockwise rather than clockwise if
you hold down the key it's going to do
the opposite of whatever you tell it to
do well of course in these situation
that doesn't apply but in regards to
rotating and also shrinking or enlarging
it most definitely is going to do that
duplicate tool kind of is confusing
because it literally duplicates on top
so you I just did it I just duplicated
and you didn't see them but if I hit the
Select key you're going to see that
there are duplicates and then if you
hold down the shift key it is going to
delete objects as you move over them say
deleting them okay these guys right here
this one this one this one and this one
are really subtle they're going to push
paths around so if I have the tweak tool
selected you're going to see that the
paths are being pushed around ever so
slightly you could say there they are
they're sort of like moving apart from
each other and this is going to cause
paths to be attracted to each other so
this is definitely a tool that you want
to play around with to see exactly what
it does but basically it just makes
boring things less boring then you have
something that's really cool this
selection right here is going to change
the paint color for you I can just drift
over these and slowly change the color
for my objects which again add some
interest to them and this is going to
dinner the colors around inside of here
kind of mess around with hue and
saturation to do a little bit more
dramatic sort of effects and then the
final one here is going to blur objects
so so there it goes it's blurred and
lured and basically what you're going to
be able to define with the tweak tool is
do you want to be able to change the hue
the saturation lightness in the opacity
and of course if you just want to change
saturation well you would just select
saturation and turn off you lightness
and opacity and so forth and so on so
that's the tweak tool pretty much
everything you can do with the tweak
tool but really you're only going to
learn it if you go in and play around
with it so kind of neat though and that
is going to bring us into fill and
Stroke I'm going to talk a little bit
more about the stroke in this situation
so there you go I created a rectangle
and I'm going to specifically come in
here I'm going to zoom in so you can see
everything here I'm going to change the
stroke on this to ten oops
10 and hit enter now you can see it a
little bit better and then the very
first thing we're going to talk about is
joins which is basically how these paths
join to gather currently we have
regular old join which is going to come
to a point which you can see right there
now if I select it again then I can come
in and select this and then the path
will curve ever so slightly or I can
select that again and bevel it just by
clicking on that and there it comes out
to a bevel type shape another thing you
can do is I can make this pointy and
just find the meter limit which in
essence is going to turn this from a
point into a bevel just take the whole
way down to zero and now it's a bevel
all right so that's basically how all
those different tools are working and
change that to for cap is going to be
defined let's just go and create a
stroke basic Bezier tool
drop that in there and there it is and
then change this to ten so that we can
see it a little bit better and there we
go now the cap is currently set for
square which is exactly what it is or
but as they refer to it I can also make
it round
now it's round or I can make it square
and then sort of protrude off of the top
of the stroke we could also come in here
and come in and define that we want it
to be dashed in some way like that and
you can define the distance between the
dashes or the dots or all these other
different options that are available to
you by playing around with this number
right here so there we go and how that
affects that you can also change the
starting markers which would be at the
end of the point or the beginning of the
point I'm going to leave it set as none
you can also have the mid markers which
normally causes a little bit of
goofiness you can sort of change the way
the line looks as well as the ending
markers and you can see there's a whole
bunch of arrows and dots and all sorts
of different options that are available
to you so kind of neat can also blur it
you can also change the opacity that's
pretty much everything you can do in
regards to strokes except for changing
the stroke paint type and I already went
over RGB HSL CMYK and so forth and so on
and that brings us to gradients now I'm
just going to create another big giant
rectangle in this situation and unlike
other tools gradients can be applied
both to fills as well as two strokes
inside of Inkscape and in general
whenever you change
a different gradient which I don't want
to do it with the stroke here I want to
do it with the fill there now it's a
gradient by default whenever you click
on gradient or you say I want this to
have a gradient fill what it does is it
goes from the original fill color to
transparent that's what the default
gradient inside of Inkscape does also as
you can see the default gradient is a
linear gradient you can come in here of
course and change it into a radial
gradient if you'd prefer but I'm going
to stick with linear just for now and of
course you can change the gradient tool
by clicking on G and change the gradient
just by pulling around on the handles as
you see I did right there and with the
radial gradient there's actually going
to be three handles so you're going to
be able to move the grade in around
using the center sort of handle you're
also going to be able to move the
gradient around using these other
handles like that like I said I'm going
to stick with the linear for now now
every gradient has a series of stops and
in essence if you want to have multiple
different colors in here you're going to
have to change the transition by editing
those stops so what I'm going to do in
this situation is create a rainbow so I
have the gradient selected and I'm going
to come in here and hit edit and that's
going to bring this guy up right here
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
say that I want to add six stops so one
two three four five six and I can change
the different colors and so forth if I
would want to inside of that it just
bounced out now you're going to see
there are six dots here on our screen
sort of spread out I'm going to grab
those individual dots or stops and move
them sort of an equal distance apart
from each other and for each one of
these stops you're going to be able to
define the start color the end color and
transition from opacities and so forth
and so on I'm just going to click on the
very first stop and then I'm going to
come down here and I'm just going to
pick a red color you can see that the
red change right there then I can click
on the next stop and change it to say an
orange color there it went from red to
orange I'm going to click on the next
stop and if you can't say this is what I
mean by stop see I'm clicking on that
change that to a yellow color click on
the next stop change it to a green color
or maybe I'll click on that green that
really stands out
select the next one and
click on a blue color and the next one
and select a purple color and then
finally click on another one and click
on a violet color there we go
that is a basic rainbow gradient and I
think in general you get the gist of how
gradients work and of course just like
anything it's going to be something that
you learn more about as you play around
with it one interesting thing you can do
with gradients is repeat and basically
what that's going to do is if we would
pick reflected what it's going to do is
keep alternating the direction of the
gradient until it gets to the ends or if
you hit direct it's going to repeat the
gradient from end to beginning and it
looks kind of nasty here let me just
show you let's leave this as none let's
deselect a rainbow or let's just delete
it even though it's quite pretty draw in
our rectangle right like that switch
over to gradient there you can see that
I'm going to create a couple additional
stops I'm going to hit edit and I'm
going to say add stop add stop come in
there and then what I'm going to do is
take the end move it over here like that
and then I'm going to give these a
little bit more defined type of color so
I'm going to change this tool white so
that you can see this a little bit
better change us to red and change this
to a violet and then leave this B blue
and then on top of that I'm going to
drag it in here a little bit then what
I'm going to do is get the gradient tool
and change this to reflected and you can
see what it does and then change it to
direct and you can see what it does see
how that's harsh so basically what it's
doing with reflected is as the gradient
ends it's sort of going to take what was
at the end and put it at the beginning
for the next part and then make let's
sort of like a smooth sort of transition
on your screen and that's pretty much
everything you can do with gradients and
I'm just going to skip over patterns for
now that's the final thing you can sort
of do color wise inside of Inkscape say
here is patterns and then here is
swatches which we've already pretty much
covered and these basically just make
different types of stripes on your
screen and different types of patterns I
mean that's what it's called and that is
definitely something that is best played
around with to see if it's any use to
you but to me
general patterns are kind of silly and I
don't really care for them and that
brings us to the final thing we want to
talk about today which is the Bezier
curve now with the Bezier curve tool
we're going to have basically four
things that are going to allow us to
edit it we're going to have a starting
node we're gonna have an ending node
then we're going to have two handles so
as I click that is the starting node and
then here is the ending right there and
then I'm going to be able to use my
handles to define what the curve is
going to look like and in essence that's
pretty much all you need to know about
the Bezier curve I mean it's something
else that we're going to be playing
around with a lot and I'm going to get
into more in regards to what you can do
with it such as draw different shapes
and so forth and so on I'm running a
little bit long so I'm going to skip
some of these other little tools but
it's very important to understand that
the fills for the curves that you draw
are going to fill out and show up on
your screen even if they don't connect
the ending point or the entire path
isn't completely drawn so let's go in
here to fill and change it to a fill now
you can see there's no stroke down here
but the fill still filled it in and I'll
push some of the talk about the Bezier
tool to the next part of the tutorial so
that I can fit in a whole bunch of
information in regards to how the
Pathfinder functions work inside of
Inkscape so let's say we have two
rectangles I'm just going to draw two
rectangles here on the screen
and when I talk about Pathfinder tools
I'm talking about paths Union difference
intersection exclusion division and cut
path now basically these are extremely
functional and you can pretty much see
exactly what they do just by looking at
the little shape next to their names
inside of Inkscape so if I get rid of
these strokes by selecting both of these
objects and then clicking down here on
this little X as I hold down the shift
key that's going to get rid of those
strokes then what I'm going to be able
to do is come in here and click on path
and Union and what it's going to do is
it's going to turn those two shapes into
one new shape which is kind of
interesting and very very useful you can
also select both of them come into the
path tool again come down to difference
which is basically going to delete
whatever is on top from the object
that's on the bottom so path
and difference and there you can see
that deleted undo and then with
intersection what's going to do with
both the objects selected if we click on
intersection it is only going to leave
those parts in which both of these
objects overlap right like that could
also do exclusion which is going to do
the absolute opposite of intersection
which it's going to delete anywhere with
these two objects overlap right like
that division is going to delete the
object that is on top and then on top of
that put like a cut mark in the object
that remains as you can see right there
now I can come in here and select this
and pull that away if I'd like and then
finally cut paths when you click on it
is basically just going to leave the
path for the objects and if we would
come in and create a stroke for them
you're going to see that that stroke is
there and where it overlapped it is
going to have a stroke that you can sort
of like pull away so there is a rundown
of numerous things in regards thanks Kay
in the next part of the tutorial I'll
focus more in on the Bezier curves and
paths and all the other things I haven't
covered yet please leave your questions
or comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
