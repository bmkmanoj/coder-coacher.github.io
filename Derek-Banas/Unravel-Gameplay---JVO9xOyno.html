random livestream Friday I have to get
everything already here this is unravel
which I thought was a good game to play
after my crochet video Kazuto huh which
everybody thought was kind of funny
bring your chats unravel J yes yes right
all right so just like always it's a
puzzle game of course and I've never
played it so I have no idea what's going
on I'm unprepared and let's go new game
first thing I'm going to do is turn the
volume down yeah this came as loud I
suppose sit here what's going on
and this is going to be a little old
lady knitting no that's all we saw
myself
always awesome thank you guys for
joining me then there goes
game is beautiful Mecca
I don't know does anybody know what that
means like hmm no I did
no they just started off hey I got my
little guy no I don't stream on twitch
this is just something I do for fun just
to talk and do things and swear
and here is a blurry notebook with
broken pictures in it if I ever
contemplated world domination no I have
no idea I have no interest okay this is
a puzzle game like everything else I
play except for Resident Evil what can I
do here I've never played this game I
have no idea how to play it so you are
watching me learn how to play it missile
and weeds let's see what fissile and
weeds is I play it's some sort of
tutorial
this stream is just you guys chat talk
to me mess you can ask me questions you
can talk you can do whatever you want
yeah the music's good it's a volume good
I was gonna turn it down but now I think
it's sorta okay
maybe not
yeah I played portal
I normally play games that I actually
I'm gonna turn the volume down just
slightly here cuz I think it's a little
bit too much let's turn that down just
slightly
okay so master volume back use yarn less
oh okay cool
no I have not played undertale
I'm normally up to play just about
anything but I don't really like things
that are heavy on stories because I want
to talk and you know interact with you
guys oh I just ran out of string oh
there's some string up there you need
more yarn use our to the lasso they are
and then I get my yarn back I thought
it's a beautiful game you'll jump higher
the farther if you run Sabba ba Chaka
Billy hold o to grab things move the pot
more to the left
what pot
okay hold l2 to grab your yarn tail and
climb back up using the left stick
how do I get up there hmm so sly could
do this
so my supposed to push this over here
hmm already hitting something that I
don't know what to do that way
told me it's alright okay so that's how
you do that and then how did I get over
this before
oh I climbed up like this and then I ran
and jumped okay good and then
well I can pull this over
all right well I figured that out
good all right so it's a little bit
challenging press R to - laughs huh oops
oh I just found water I'm getting it is
you tell me any good I don't like udemy
you dummies my enemy I don't like
anybody that charges online for
education
not saying that it's not any good I've
never heard I'm not patting my own oh
yeah Sam I have to pay better attention
to this game here I am NOT saying that
it's not any good I'm just saying that
I've heard people tell me I've never
used it but I've heard people tell me
that my videos and other videos on
YouTube are just as good as anything on
udemy so why paperwork surfaces the
glitter like this can be fun use the
left stick to climb okay
press X to jump in and lasso all right
press square to attach yarn try making a
yarn bridge
in Newark
ah
okay so I'm just doing like this add
catch so I was holding it
hold the lipstick down and release the
slingshot off of yarn bridges
okay call the mechanics in this game are
fantastic they like it
much better than I played a game not
that long ago you can't hear was a
little nightmare or something the game
look fantastic but the mechanics were
just the worst the same
I'm gonna have to do something tomorrow
that a lot of you guys could properly
really help me with i but whoa I got
conned into I don't want to say con
because I really don't mind doing it but
I am a soccer coach and I know about as
much about soccer as I don't know so I
had to watch a bunch of YouTube videos
to learn how to play soccer how funny is
that
keep forgetting about that mechanic you
can tie knots while climbing press
square to attach your yarn okay now what
am I supposed to do yeah soccer whoops
is a lot more popular in other parts of
the world than it is in the United
States which kind of stinks I kind of
agree why am I having a problem oh now I
was just talking about how your
mechanics are so fantastic
okay so I'm trying to do I see what it's
a it wants me to do that again all right
cool
hey you come on ya football there you go
pull the left stick down and press X to
jump down from certain platforms
hold l2 and use the left stick to climb
down safely on your yarn tail
Oh
forgot what it just told me to do all
right okay
this is definitely not easy see the
whirling light it means that you'll
start here if you quit and come back to
this level
this is a little bit more complicated
than it seems
I got Morgan awesome sadly I am NOT
gonna have my zelda video up tomorrow I
but what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
put all of these sprites I've pretty
much drew Zelda in sprites so I am going
to put all those up on the website
tomorrow and so you guys can have it I'm
a little eat all the sprites and now
what I'm doing is is making the entire
game board it's just taking way longer
than I ever expected it to be their ever
expected it to so that's why Zelda is
taking so long
am I supposed to use these apples for
something just press o to grab objects
how do I get it thick
let's try doing
buying a dog here
maybe I was overthinking this
let's grab this Apple
I have not made an excel tutorial what
are you going to do after you finish how
to make game series I don't know I
seriously don't know
what am I gonna do now it's around
that's not good
I just have an idea I think I have a
knot tied here right can I get the
apples on this make a bridge and then
pull it
push the apples on there what's it
well there's another one right there
I'm happy I thought this was gonna be a
really easy puzzle puzzle again and it's
actually a little bit complicated which
I actually am very happy it's a little
bit complicated the American football is
dramatically different than that
American football dramatically is not
really there's not even any comparison
I used to be hardcore into football and
then my my team we we got a what what's
called a quarterback some people don't
know what I'm talking about something
wrong we got a guy who is I don't even
think people realize but people I live
in place called Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
and so my local football team is called
the Pittsburgh Steelers and I think I
need more apples I don't know anyway our
quarterback it was basically like the
leader of the whole team is like a royal
jerk like a complete idiot and I don't
like him and because I don't like him
and then I've heard conformable stories
about it I stopped watching football
together
I guess I need more apples
somebody was just telling a story about
how their professor
was talking about how important the
language Pascal is to water program
maybe they really think it is hey Pascal
sorry
well I gotta turn this music down again
I don't think that it changed anything
it's it's in my ear it's like blaring
let's turn it way down here
now what I'm gonna do is get these
apples here
Oh
see I I don't know I don't really agree
with Pascal being a very good place for
anything I don't teach their own if you
like Pascal then that's that's good it
works for you it works for e I'm not
gonna say anything I mean I just it
doesn't work for me don't expect the
Pascal tutorials what I'm trying to tell
you
I knew it at one point but
yeah the music's fantastic it was just
too loud
okay get all these apples I'm just
guessing what to do if you're wondering
I've never played this game so I have no
idea yeah fast girls the future of
programming yes COBOL is amazing also I
would be willing to do a Fortran video
even though I don't really think Fortran
this is really worth learning either but
if I was gonna teach any of those older
languages portrait well I mean I thought
Lisp oh okay well I got my apples in
here and now I'm gonna do this whoops
and that's gonna fall down and then
hopefully this is gonna prop me up and I
can do it no it's not it's not mandatory
to know multiple programming languages
at all if I ever heard of Maul bulk oh
I'm gonna I'm gonna drowned again I keep
reading the chat instead of paying
attention yes I've heard of Delphi I
doubt there's a programming language
that exists that I haven't used I'm
older than a lot of you guys so I've
used just about everything I've used
Modula a DES trying to think of really
arcane bizarre things I believe I've
used anyway if any of you guys know
anybody on YouTube that you think has
really good soccer tutorials tell me
I found one guy his name is Little John
whoops now looked at Macedo what will
joke was it will John I think that's
will John I really liked his videos some
people just don't really know how to how
to teach you know like they they go well
this is how you do it and they do it
like real fast
I don't need tutorials like that where I
can't see what they're actually doing I
need ones where they're really good
yes see if somebody puts see - - I've
actually believe there actually is
something called see - - I believe there
is something I never learned it but I've
seen it yeah if you want to make a game
make again how long do you have in two
years
geez I'm in this game that you're
looking at right now took two years to
make and I believe it was an indie
developer so you could make this game in
two years technique that I mean you know
really dedicate yourself to it why not
this is a puzzle game and that's what it
is it's so that's all it is why did I
start a YouTube coding chin I don't
really consider my channel to be a
coding channel I mean that's what I do
mainly because that's what I know the
most about but let's see if I can do
this now without dying awesome okay I
did it
if you ever get stuck hold down to
restart a section okay good
whenever I started my channel there was
a massive amount of unemployment in my
country the recession it was very bad
recession and I wanted to start an
educational company that would train
people on how to use skill how
specifically skills that would best
improve their opportunity to get a job
and I held I had classes for like $30
you could attend to class and I don't
know I just thought it was something to
do oops that was like my big idea and it
did not work it was a massive failure
I'm backed up there so I had all this
stuff that I had created and I decided
to put it on YouTube for free and you
can find a lot of it and nobody pays any
attention to a lot of it because I'm
running out of yarn what's that what's
going on there think I'm on it did I
miss a yarn I think I did yes I did
my marketing videos one of the very
first things I ever did they maybe I'm
supposed to break this or something nope
whoops
oh there's yarn downer so I actually
made a marketing book and you can
actually see it it's on my website for
free hundred percent for free and that
is his sales that's all kinds of things
and so that's what I did I decided
basically all this stuff that I was
charging next to nothing for I decided
to instead basically just give it away
for free because I didn't want it to go
to waste so that's the reason why I
started my youtube channel was to
provide people with job skills and now
is it no I do not sell anything on udemy
people have already asked me that I sell
nothing
I literally sell nothing and I'm not
sponsored by anybody I'm not
now push the son
I get paid that with five-second
advertisements that's what I that's what
I did if I can climb up here and then
put it tie a knot I think I did
I don't know maybe I don't even need
this bicycle let's see what's going on
over here and yeah I guess I didn't yet
well thank you very much how old am i
I'm 42 years old
am i did have I been demonetised no I
have not the people that have been damad
oh what's this little thing over here
there's like a little
okay let's climb okay the people that
have been demonetized
rightly or wrongly I think they they
deal with things that are issues topics
that are good you know I'm not saying
that they're guilty or anything they
could be construed to to be negative you
know like the white supremacists people
and you know people cause and calling
for oh look there's this but I can't
actually ride the bicycle trying to
figure out what to do here with us
Oh can I jump down so yeah I have never
done anything even near being
controversial I've only ever made one
thing that could be construed as as
political and I deleted that video so I
don't what to do with this
well actually I made another I made
another video that could be construed as
political that's still out there I can't
figure out how to do this what I think I
want to do is tie a knot in this but I
can't figure out how to get up there to
do that
well thank you for the compliment if
there is violence or something in a game
then they get no money that's not true
yeah I've tried to pull it but my
strength I have to create a not to be
able to tie it and I don't believe I
don't know how to how to see it won't
allow me to create a knot hmm
complicated here is there anything else
like a time not to know I can say
violence won't really get you
demonetised unless you're you know
violent towards real people what will
get you demonetised
is violence towards people or saying
really nasty things about people I don't
know what to do with this bicycle hmm
infused there's a wheelbarrow there you
can't pull it what's the best game I
ever played
I think Resident Evil 4 is the game that
I enjoyed the most trying to move it by
swinging that doesn't seem to be working
mm-hmm schemas drove me nuts
trying to push it that doesn't work ah I
guess I could pull it I'm stupid
hey everyone so while you Justin brain
doesn't work okay but is it going fast
enough No
I'm very motivated to learn things I
don't know do you think your job a
tutorial is enough to get a job javis
kind of become like an enterprise
language like that's the thing it does
more than anything else and and I never
really covered the enterprise part of
Java that much so hmm
you know what maybe climb on this
so no I don't think my my java tutorial
alone will get you a job in Java I'll
climb out there you don't
why aren't there more scientists and
geniuses today in your opinion hey
there's a lot of a lot of scientists
probably more scientists right now than
there is in any common history far as I
know I don't know mmm-hmm this game is
really perplexing me yes I have a Kotlin
video tutorial I have the number one
callin video tutorial I think last time
I checked it's not opening it
no climb on the bucket first there's a
bucket where's our bucket somebody said
there's a bucket there's a bucket you
don't know
I miss something
data structures are important in
programming because they're like best
practices that's why this is glowing
hmm this game is rather hard I mean it's
not terribly harvest definitely not that
straightforward either my supposed to do
something with fed bark No
I'm from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
hmm
let me see here okay okay so you guys
think that I can go
you think I can jump that high ah I did
it hey I did it
oh now I'm riding on a bicycle
all right now I need hmm there's another
one of those things up there
do I use a lot of math for programming
not calculus math but yes
oops
and I don't mean to say that programmers
don't do calculus math or that calculus
is some way not important it's just not
something I personally do that much with
now if I went and did a machine learning
Y tutorial like you guys say you want
I'd have to do it immense amount of
calculus am I supposed to go over there
whoops oh geez oh I can die I just found
out machine learning is a lot of
calculus
Wow this is not easy
geez okay
how to improve logical ability in
programming I haven't learned to program
tutorial series it's all about problem
solving that's all it's about well it's
about Pascal or not pass kes Cal it's uh
it's about Python also but Wow jeez
controls are crazy in this game I don't
know is there something here oh wait a
minute
wasn't there a thing here I don't know
maybe I'm losing my mind and moved that
up hmm did I not go far enough
can I jump her No
my PHP tutorial is pretty well updated
yes I've programmed our Gallina
I guess I have to do it again and
because I'm always asked this is water
every time I drink something everybody
always asked hmm
getting better this is a fun game guys I
mean if you have him I can't really
whoops
it's a ha see I thought there was a red
thing there now I know there isn't all
right now do it yes I have a PHP MySQL
tutorial
I have a PHP tutorial I have an
object-oriented ph2 a PHP tutorial and I
have a PHP MySQL tutorial and I have a
MySQL tutorial you say yeah I have all
those things
alright this time I'm gonna be smart I'm
gonna go down my yarn a little bit as
far as possible yeah yeah I think I did
it never do it
Wow I was I was a little bit hard but it
was a lot of fun I have to say I enjoyed
this game whoops
what's down here oh that's where my yarn
is okay
this game is fantastic and I have not
said that and no I'm not sponsored to
say that I mean in it's better than
limbo I think oops
normally whenever there's one of these
things I have to tie stuff to climb up
there this is probably gonna be one of
those bouncy things
whoa
I don't really know any other speaking
languages I used to be able to speak
German and I used to be able to read
Mandarin and I could read German but I'm
out of practice I haven't done that for
a very long time and I used to be able
to read Spanish and I'm not not real big
on learning the I like reading what is
this thing coming here is it gonna eat
me I guess not
well what I did lose my blog hmm oh
there's a thing here let's pull that
down whoops
that's not good my block probably is not
supposed to be under there
no I have not played Ori in the blind
forest
I wasn't only able to speak Chinese in
reserve which should I learn first gala
or elixir I don't know it depends on
what you want to do I guess am I
supposed to get the block
oh I just jump on it that's all I need
to do super chat button I have no idea
what that means
there's nothing for me here
no I'm not German yes I'm working on it
as a Maron tutorial that I have no idea
when I'll be able to do it
the Samarin to tutorial will come after
the there's that little groundhog or
something okay he can I just run let's
try running I know my supposed to yeah
this game is put the Block on it to jump
yes let's put the block here oops
and see if that will that's funny
that didn't make sense to me because it
doesn't make sense a block can
so anybody watching Twin Peaks I just
started watching it that is the most
ridiculous I'm talking about the new one
it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever
seen I think he makes no sense and
that's really saying something for David
Lynch like it it I've never seen
anything that makes less sense than the
new Twin Peaks it is amazing and I
haven't finished watching it so don't
ruin it if that's even possible to run
that the show is so ridiculous I need to
do one of those bridge things or not
Bitcoin
I used to own Bitcoin and Menotti
somebody gave it to me and then the and
the thing it wasn't that much the thing
that where it was stored the Bitcoin was
stored went out of business or something
and I didn't realize it went out of
business
yeah it was not good that's my
experience with Bitcoin I once had a
little bit of Bitcoin money and lost it
all so I'm supposed to do hmm oh there's
something under here I supposed to get
this maybe what is that what's it say it
says
tea I think oh there's a thing down here
what is this
we'll get out of the way over here box
what's the sign down here
yeah there's something down here to my
sister for us
hmm
this is another one of those things has
me
no Bitcoin mining from what I've heard
is a waste of time
because I don't want to do because of
the cost of electricity I guess if you
could get free electricity like if you
rent it or something in your clique
tricity but I think your your landlord
would probably catch on
huh
so I feel
like I should put this here I'm somehow
supposed to get this box on here I don't
know why let's say okay so I'm on this
oops
get that box up there hmm
yeah I know
let's try put it here I'll walk
yeah supposedly if you have a free
electricity you can make some money with
Bitcoin but
ah I think I think I got it all right
hey I did it alright good I love this
game I really do
I can't say that about many games either
whoa I just broke everything like I
don't know how fun it is to watch it but
I love watching this somebody just said
something about the Deep Web I I just
finished the the book about Ross
Albright who was the guy that started
the Silk Road great story all right cool
I guess that's the end of the thing that
was fun I don't know about you guys but
I really enjoy playing this I put a
little Stamper on there and I got a
glowing ball yeah it's a puzzle puzzle
platformer I love it
well the Silk Road was all about selling
the illegal drugs and guns and hitman
crazy stuff oh now there's stuff in here
it says how beautiful this was when it
was new and how beautiful it still is
even though time has made it different
sutas and there's like some little kids
and there's some little kids and another
little kid so it's basically where I was
exploring I don't know for some reason
this game makes me think up and now it's
getting blurry again I mean this is all
broken up that cool
alright kind of makes me feel like this
game is going to have a sad story in
some way
this is where I was sisal one of five
secrets found boy you better not next
time
somehow I don't think I was able to
climb this way last time and now I'm up
here and this is the sea and this says
Barry Meyer alright well guys thank you
for joining me
um this is a fantastic game I love this
game
and I have not said that I said that
about any game I've played I loved
Resident Evil 7 I liked the witness and
the Talos principle but I love this game
it's just so cute and it's so nice and I
can't recommend it enough so in the 20
bucks so ya know either way thank you
guys for joining me like always I always
hang around and talking to chat after I
am done doing a live stream tell me if
you want me to continue with this game
cuz I will because I enjoy this game
this game is fun and I would definitely
continue playing it in the next room
tomorrow I still don't have Zelda done
but tomorrow I will upload my zelda
spreadsheets that I had hand-drawn it's
literally like a lot of Zelda hand-drawn
and I hope to have the first part of my
zelda game up on on Wednesday so and
then once I start making it'll go up
quick so well like always guys please
