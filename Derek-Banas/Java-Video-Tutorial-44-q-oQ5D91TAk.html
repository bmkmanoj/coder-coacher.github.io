44 of my java video tutorial series
today I'm going to talk about parsing
XML data using Java now there are a
bunch of different ways to do this and I
don't really know about your interest so
leave comments below if you want to see
more about this stuff but I'm just going
to try to do a real kind of basic
tutorial what you need to understand if
you haven't watched my XML tutorial
definitely watch that because if you
don't understand X and all you will not
understand what's going on here I have a
link to that above so every element
inside of this XML file that you see
here on the screen is considered to be a
node and that's exactly what we're going
to do is break all these elements into
individual nodes now the only thing that
might confuse you is this node for
instance has an attribute as does this
one right here and the actual data or
the value inside of these elements are
also contained in nodes so everything
you see here TV shows show name and the
actual value stored inside of the name
tags are all going to be set together
inside of nodes so I'm just going to
jump into it leave any questions you
have below in the comment section and
also the code just like always is
available underneath the video to play
around with the first I'm going to do is
I'm going to import a library and sax
stands for simple API for XML now what
you need to understand about this guy is
it is only going to allow you to read
from the XML file you're not gonna be
able to write back to it but it's very
good to use whenever you have very large
XML files and then we're going to go or
and bring in this Dom library and this
is going to allow you to read the XML
file actually directly into memory where
all of these different individual nodes
that I talked about previously are going
to be stored as objects and with this
library you are going to actually be
able to write back to the file and then
finally I'm going to import Java X XML
parsers and this is going to allow you
to go and get those XML elements and
store them as Dom objects it's basically
just going to create a whole bunch of
trees instead of what you have here this
is kind of a tree structure as well just
each one of these guys is going to be in
its own individual little object you're
going to be able to access then we got
to go public class Java lesson 44 I'm
going to go public static void main
string just like always and actually in
the code that is available under the
video here I show you a couple other
different ways to interact with
XML data using traditional storing the
information inside of objects so if you
want to see that go look so the first
thing we're going to do is create a Dom
free structured object inside of memory
and I'm going to call it XML doc and
with this guy you need to define exactly
what XML file you're going to want to
use in my situation store it in the
source directory right like that and
then you're going to get an error
message because get document is not
defined so that's no problem we're just
going to come down here and you can see
here create method get document click on
that and there went and created it for
you so that saves you some time and I'm
using eclipse just like always and I'm
going to call this doc string and then
since we're going to try to access a
file that may not exist we're going to
have to throw everything inside of a try
block just like always need a document
builder Factory and this is an API that
allows you to convert the XML into the
Dom object tree that we talked about
before
everywhere and it's created now we need
to define exactly some constraints in
regards to how this document object tree
is going to be created so we're going to
go factory we don't want to get our
comments in this situation and store
them as individual nodes because that
would cause all kinds of confusion so
let's just define that as true and I'm
going to copy this and then we're going
to say we want to also disregard
whitespace kind of long and then we also
want to validate that the XML data is
set up properly so we're going to set
validating also to true and if it's not
validated XML it's going to send back a
whole bunch of warnings then we're going
to provide access to the document data
here with document builder like that now
we're going to be able to access all
that information that was stored in the
XML file and return builder and this is
going to actually parse all the XML data
and send it back so that you'll be able
to play around with it and all we're
going to do here in this situation is
tell it where the XML file lies and that
is in doc string which was passed over
whenever we first set up this method
inside here now any time we have a try
block we need a catch block and I'm just
going to be lazy and catch every
exception in this situation just go X
and just print out the basic sort of
error messages there you go so this is
going to go in there it's going to take
the XML file that we have based off the
constraints that we defined right here
and it's going to
kickback a Dom object that we're going
to be able to bounce around inside of
and manipulate the elements that were in
previously in the XML file now let's say
that we wanted to be come in here and
get the root element and print it out
the screen and the route based off the
XML data over inside of here is going to
be tv-show just say root bounce down the
next line and then we can just go xml
doc get document element and then just
say get node name remember everything's
a node and that's going to bounce out
and print our root element for us if we
save it and execute it you can see root
is TV show shot it out right there on
the screen now what we're going to do is
we're going to create a list of nodes
and we want to get each of the
individual shows and store them inside
of this node list because every
individual block is called show inside
of the root element called TV show get
elements by tag name and you just have
to tell it what the tag name is and it
is show right like that
there's the XML CTV shows the root
element and then show is what we're
going to grab because show or all the
individual elements that have all kinds
of information and we want to pull
information from we could also get the
number of children in the root element
and that's going to be very beneficial
if we want to be able to cycle through
all this information let's say we want
to print out exactly how many there are
number of shows and there are enough
methods to drown a cat inside of there I
mean there's it's never-ending so I'm
just going to cover some of these things
here and if you guys say you want to see
more just tell me below and I will show
more and then you just go list of shows
and say get length and there you are
that's going to print that out and there
you get a number it shows is equal to
four now we're going to come in here and
define the element name that we want to
search for so in this situation we're
going to search for the element named
network and we're also going to search
for an attribute that lies inside of
there and it is country look at the XML
this is what we're looking for this guy
right here called network and there is
the attribute in this situation it's us
and there's a whole entire thing right
there so that's what we're going to be
searching for inside here and we're
going to do this in a separate method
it's going to be called get element and
attribute like that and we're going to
pass it or node list and then we're also
going to pass it or element name and the
attribute name that we're going
be searching for so of course we're
going to have to come in here and
actually create this guy just copy this
and we'll scroll down here right here
before the closing brace throw that guy
inside of there and we're going to go
private static void get element and
attribute and we have to define exactly
what's being sent here so this is a node
list a list of all of our nudes this is
a string and then the attribute at the
end is also going to be a string so
that's all the information being passed
to us so again we're going to be trying
to access something that might not exist
so let's go and throw that in a try
block then we're going to start cycling
through all of the nodes that are in the
node list is less than list of Joe's and
we're going to get length again so we
know how many nodes we got here then
we're going to iterate I or that the end
and then we have to cycle down through
the XML document to get all of the
different individual pieces of
information and the only thing that's
going to confuse you here is you have to
understand this is a node all release
part as well as this is a node so you
just want to keep drilling down until
you get the exact data that you want so
we're going to create a node it's going
to be the show node list of shows and
we're going to get the first node inside
of there the first show then we're going
to convert it into an element to gain
access to all the different element
methods that we're going to want to be
able to use here so I'm going to call
that show element and I'm just going to
cast that to type element and the
element is just an interface that's
going to inherit from node and like I
said before it's going to provide me a
whole bunch of methods to access all
that node information and there we are
then what we need to do is just create a
list of nodes that have the name for our
element that was passed over in this
situation is going to be network so
we're going to create a list of nodes
that have the name Network so we're just
going to go a node list create another
node list and I'm going to call it
network list but of course that's just
to help you understand exactly what sort
of lists I'm making here you wouldn't
normally do that show element it
elements by tag name and we're just
going to say we want to use whatever
they asked us to use so element name
right look okay so now we got that guy
now we want to get the first and in this
situation the only element inside of
here so we're going to go element
network element and then we just need to
cast this to type element and we're
going to go
network list and say that we want item
zero and we know it only ever is going
to contain one element so that's
perfectly fine we don't need to iterate
through that or do anything else with
that then we're going to create a node
list again omote list and this is going
to return a list of all the node
elements so basically what I'm asking
for is this guy right here
see Network I'm asking for all the child
elements which in this situation is only
going to be ABC it's only going to be
have one inside of there so again I'm
going to be referencing it as item zero
remember each of those is a node even
the values inside of the elements are
nodes if you get that concept you'll get
everything else here network element and
then get child nodes and that's what's
actually going to get me and then I'm
just going to see if they set an
attribute value whenever they call this
method I'm going to say has attribute
and I'm actually going to have to
provide it with the full attribute name
and if it did if they did send us an
attribute I'm going to say a limit name
plus sign us out of there for the colon
bounce down to the next line and then
I'm going to have to cast this to be a
node it's throwing all kinds extra stuff
up there so I'm going to say node and
then go element list and I want the zero
index because there's only ever going to
be one I just need to close that off and
then I want to say I want to get the
value that is stored inside node and
then let's trim all of the excess
whitespace off of it I'm down to the
next line as attribute and if you want
to get the attribute for an element you
know a network element get attribute and
then pass it the attribute name right
like that okay well that's all fine and
good unless they did not define an
attribute so we got to put an else
statement inside of here in this
situation I'm just going to do this
paste that there and in that situation
we're just going to print out the
element name and then of course since
there's a try block we need a catch
block so let's just bounce up here grab
this I'm right here and paste that in
there and then if we execute this guy
there you can see it printed out Network
which is the element name as well as the
attribute assigned to it and the link
underneath this video I have a whole
bunch of other different code that
parses XML data like I said if you guys
want to have me cover this to a further
extent and get into XPath and a whole
bunch of other different things just
leave a comment down below and I'll do
that
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
