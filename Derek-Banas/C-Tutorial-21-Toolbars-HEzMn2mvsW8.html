21 of my c-sharp video tutorial in this
part of the tutorial we're really going
to focus in on toolbars but we're also
going to be covering toolbar Trey's
combo boxes a lot more on icons when
explained exactly how I use them in part
20 because I caused a little bit of
confusion and a whole bunch more as
always all of the code as well as a
transcript of this video is available in
the description underneath this video
and I have a lot to do so let's do it
get into it okay so I'm using the exact
code from part 20 here and I'm just
going to be adding to it so you need
that code so go to part 20 and download
that code alright so what we're going to
do is we're in here where we created the
menu you can see here are all the
different menu items and we're going to
be adding a menu toolbar and you can see
right here is our doc panel and here is
our menu and if we follow this down
you're going to see that we are going to
be putting it right after the menu
closes so to create a toolbar you're
going to have to create a toolbar a tray
like that and I'm going to call doc
panel once again and doc and then this
once again is going to be equal to top
so it's going to fit right in there and
then we're going to put the toolbar
inside of that area so what we're going
to do next is just come in and go
toolbar and I don't need to set any
attributes for this guy
and I'm just going to start throwing in
my buttons so I'm going to say button
and we're going to give this the name of
toolbar open and then if you want to
throw in a tooltip you can do that and
that means if they put their mouse over
it it's going to allow them to see
exactly what it does and if I want to
tie into an action here what I can do is
just go click and menu open and click
which is exactly what I use previously
whenever I use just the regular menu
system like we have up here now if you
want to put an icon inside of there
which more than likely you do what
you're going to do is go image and
is going to be equal to and then you're
going to point out in my situation I
created a folder called resources and
here are all of the different guys I
have inside here these are going to be
used as icons you can see the open icon
right there and where I got that is here
here is the link I talked about this
previously but I'm actually going to
show you what it looks like so what
you're going to do is just go to that
page click on download and then I'm
using the 2013 you can try 2015 you do
whatever you want so you're going to
download those zip files and then you're
going to be presented with a folder and
there's a whole bunch of different
things inside of here so let's say that
I wanted to get a cut an image it's
going to represent cut I can go into
actions and fit map and then inside of
here I just scroll down and I look for
cut so where is cut so it's a little bit
further and there it is sort of a couple
different icons I can use for cutting
now what I did was I just went and right
clicked on it and I went coffee right
like this and then we can minimize that
and then I went over into resources and
right clicked on it and went to paste
right like that okay and then I change
the name to cut so that's all I did
so let's delete that out of there
because I don't need it and it's going
to say yes and it's gone okay so that's
exactly how I got those now how you
reference that folder just like we did
previously is we're going to say
resources forward slash open dot fit map
because that's what it's called and then
of course we are going to close that guy
off now we're going to be doing this
same thing for all of the other
different options what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to copy this let's
come down here and paste this in and oh
by the way you can see that the icon is
right there so there it is and it will
work okay so let's just paste in another
one let's say we want the next one to be
toolbar save and we'll set change the
tool tip to save file and then this
one's probably called save click menu
save click it's exactly what we used
previously and then the resource we're
going to use as an icon is going to be
save bitmap and you can see save that
map there it is right there and you saw
what it looked okay so let's just go had
more of these guys up next we are going
to cover how to cut so we're going to
come in and go cut and we're going to
get rid of the tool tip because it's
kind of you know if you don't know what
cut and copy and paste means you know
that's a problem so for the click event
in this situation we were going to get
rid of it altogether so let's just get
rid of that and then what we're going to
do is instead go commands and equal to
application commands and cut so you're
going to be doing a different thing here
for that and here we will use our cut
bitmap and let's just copy this and
we're going to do the same you can see
there it is it's showing-up and i'll
demonstrate what it does here in a
moment paste that inside of there we're
also going to have the ability to copy
so we can throw coffee in there and then
we'll just change this to copy and then
resources and this will be coffee as
well and after I do that you can see the
copies up there alright and then we'll
do another one for paste so we'll go get
this and paste and change this from cut
to paste and then change this to paste
as well so there that is and you can see
all of the icons we just added so pretty
simple to do another thing that is quite
useful sometimes you might want to
separate the different icons you have on
your toolbar so what we're going to do
is just go separator like that and then
close that off and there you have a
separation between all of these commands
over here and what I'm going to do next
is throw a combo box inside of there so
you can put anything you want inside of
your tool bar any of the things you can
use anywhere else you can use in a tool
bar so let's say I want to do a label
inside of here and I wanted it to have
the name of font size I can do it and
there
is right there fontsize okay so after
that what I want to do is put a combo
box inside of it that's going to allow
the user to select the font size that
they want to use and then I'll have it
update in the code so we're going to go
name like that and what we'll be
updating is font size right down here so
we have that set for 12
so my combo box is going to have the
name of what should we have it call it
combo font size sounds like a good name
and then what you're going to do to get
the changes with your combo box is
you're going to have a selection changed
it's going to be one of the guys you are
going to be calling and we can come over
here and just double click on this and
have that automatically be created for
us except that is going to complain so
what we're going to do is just highlight
that change that to an uppercase C jump
over into here and change this to an
uppercase C there we are
jump back into the sample code and also
we're going to have to all be able to
collect whenever the drop down menu is
closed so they're going to click to open
the drop down menu and then click to
make a selection and it's going to close
so we want to catch that event as well
so I'm going to go down drop down closed
in in that situation I'm going to you
can also just type in whatever you want
here I'm just going to get like this
stuff so I'm going to double click on
that and I'm going to change this to
combo font size drop down closed and
then we'll close this off right here
like that and then we will put all of
our information inside of there let's
jump over into the CSS code though make
the change here because we made that
uppercase so let's save that jump back
over into zamel and then I'm going to
put all of my drop-down or my combo box
options so I'm going to go combo box
item and I'm going to put 10 inside of
there and then I'll just throw a couple
more inside of there so go let's try
like 4 so we'll say 10 and 12 and 14 and
16 are going to be all of the different
options you can also have one of them
set by default so since I have
down below I have one size set to twelve
well I can come in here and set that as
the one that's selected by saying is
selected and then marking that as true
so that will be automatically selected
in a combo box and you're going to see
it's highlighted automatically by
default and then the toolbar and the
toolbar tray are going to Cle closed and
that's it that's all we need to do so
now let's jump over into the CSS code
and let's make the combo box work and
see what else we can do here all right
so here is our code and what we're going
to want to do here is we're going to
want to create a variable inside here
that's going to be used to track it the
font size combo box is going to be
closed so I'm going to say private
boolean combo font size closed and by
default it's going to be set to true so
let's leave it that way because it
wouldn't make sense for it to always be
open and then inside of this guy I want
to change the font size of the text box
after the combo is closed but what I
want to do is I want to first go down
here and create another function that's
going to handle changing the font size
in the text box whenever it's selected
so I'm going to call this change text
box font size and of course it's always
good to put comments inside of there so
that makes sense so basically what this
is going to do is I'm going to go and
what I need to do is convert the combo
font size data into a string so whenever
I retrieve it let me go font size let's
just make that all lowercase just relax
it all right and what I'm going to do is
I'm going to say combo font size
selected item and then I'm going to
convert that to string now what that's
going to do is it is going to give you
sort of a string that's going to be a
little bit junky and what we really want
is just one little small part of the
string which is going to be the actual
font size so what we are going to do is
actually output this
that we can see exactly what type of
data is being sent in so I'm going to
put this as font size like this and then
inside of here I'll put font size that's
returned and I know that I'm going to
need to correct that but for now this is
going to be perfectly fine just so that
we can debug this okay so that's all
that's going to do for the moments so
back up into the combo box or the
situation which we need to handle
whenever a selection is changed in our
combo box so what I'm going to say is if
combo font size now let's change that
again so this will be combo font size
closed so let's throw that in there
instead if that comes back is true then
I'm going to come or go and call change
TB font size and have that guy execute
for us which is this guy down here
change up TP font size okay and then
after we do that I'm going to say that
the combo font size is going to be
closed so I need to set that to true
because we know that once the selection
is made the combo box is most definitely
going to close on its own so what's all
we need to do for that and for this one
what we're going to do is verify that
the combo is closed and call for the
font size to be changed so for this I
need to go combo box and combo let's
just call it combo box and then you go
sender because the combo box is in a
call for this to execute combo box and
then I'm going to say combo font size
closed is going to be equal to not combo
box is drop-down open and then I'll call
for the font size to actually change her
in this situation it's just going to
display some information on our screen
actually it makes more sense for this to
be TB so let's change that and I'll also
change that so that's going to execute
that so for now what we're going to do
is just display the current font size
whenever this is executed or whatever
it's changed let's run it and see if I
make any little errors somewhere and you
can see right here it comes back at
system windows controls combo box item
for the font size not something we want
and we will fix that but we come up here
and here is the font size you can see 12
selected by default we can change it to
10 and here you can see the 10 pops up
so what we want to do is we just want to
get those last two digits off of there
and use those and you can see that
popped up as well and you could also see
that if we come in here some random text
and we go and well the font size is
going to change but let's go like this
and let's do cut like that you can see
that works you can see that the paste is
going to work and you're also going to
see that the copy is going to work like
this and paste and you can also see here
that it's going to open up the Open File
dialog right there and this is going to
open up the save file dialog box right
there and then we can close this and now
we know what we need to get out of this
guy right here so that we will be able
to change our font size so what we just
need are the last two digits so how we
can get that is I'm just going to say
font size is equal to font size and I'm
going to call substring on this don't
know if you remember substring or not
covered this quite some time ago and
then I want to go font size length minus
2 and that is going to give me the last
two digits which is going to be actually
this is substring say I make mistakes
also it's going to give us the last two
digits which is going to be the font
size that was selected in the combo box
well now what I'm going to do is just
use switch and font size and then
depending upon what they selected that
is going to give me different answers so
it's going to make this and of course I
can say case and if the value is equal
to 10 well in that situation I want to
change the text box which is called text
box dock over in these amyl code and
size is equal to 10 I like this and then
I can come in and say break and
I'm going to need one of those for all
of the other ones let me go over here
though and show you where I define the
name for the text box each text box doc
right there stomps back over come down
here and let's change this to twelve and
then we'll change this to twelve and
then we're going to have to do that for
all of the other different options so
we'll also do it for fourteen and we'll
also do it for sixteen
so there's fourteen and there is sixteen
and that's all we need to do and let's
run it and test that it works we don't
have that message box opening up new
that's good thing and then we can come
in and say something like some random
text like that and if we change the font
size to ten you can see it's shrunk
sixteen you can see it's going to
enlarge sixteen whoops made much a
little mistake here I forgot to change
these okay so ten twelve fourteen and
sixteen there that is save it to
annelids run it again just to do and
there it is and now we can come in again
and test it out some random text and we
can come in like this change it to ten
it shrinks change it to sixteen it gets
large change the 14 shrinks again all
right so there you go guys
that is a whole bunch of different
things we can do with toolbars and hope
you guys found that useful and like
always please leave your questions and
comments below of the last till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
