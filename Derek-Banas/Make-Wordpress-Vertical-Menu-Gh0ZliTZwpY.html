you how to do countless numbers of
different things but most importantly
I'm going to show you how to make a
vertical menu system like you see right
here that you can use on a wordpress
site or any other type of website I'm
also going to show you a ton of things
you can do with jQuery that I haven't
covered in the past and it's save time
continue to make additional tools for
our WordPress sites and websites in
general remember this doesn't have to
just be done with WordPress
now what I'm talking about here is if
you go under appearance and click on
widgets inside of WordPress and you drag
over one of these pages widgets and drop
it in there this is what is ultimately
going to show up on the page it's a div
ul Zell is a whole bunch of anchor tags
now of course you can copy this format
and this all that I'm going to talk
about here is going to work on any other
website which is going to be really
great well if you do that this is how
all this information is going to appear
on the screen so my job in this tutorial
is to take this and turn it into this
all of the code is available in a link
underneath this video so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to scroll up here
into the Style section basically all I
have here is the div and all the other
contained information that's going to go
into a menu system that's built for you
by default in WordPress and I'm going to
go into my style type text towards our
CSS area and I'm going to start defining
some things here with what you see on
the left side of the screen and we could
watch how it's changing I'm just going
to copy this guy right here because I'm
gonna be making most of my changes with
him and it's a class I'm gonna start it
off with a dot and then I want to target
the UL that surrounds everything which
is going to be sidebar menu as you can
see right here so this is what I'm going
to be making some changes to first off
okay so I want its margin to be zero so
I'm gonna put that in there padding to
be zero so that it doesn't mess with
anything that surrounds it list style
type is going to be none because I want
to get rid of those bullets and fonts
I'm just going to use a real basic bold
13 pixels and Arial of course you can
have this be whatever you want and as we
go through this you're going to see that
this is very easy to change and let's
say we won making 180 pixels and we file
save it reload and here you see it's
just a list I got rid of all of the
bullets and lined up everything in a row
which is good now what I'm going to do
is come in here and
specifically start styling the anchor
tags that lie deep down inside of this
and so that you can see this a little
bit better what I'm going to do is I'm
going to open it up okay so on the left
side of the screen you see all the code
and you're going to be able to easily
tell what I'm going to be styling so
whenever I style
art-blockcontent-body UL li a a and it's
going to be
art-blockcontent-body which is right
here and then UL which is the second
line and then Li and a here is the
anchor tag that I'm going to be styling
all right so I'm going to leave that
open just so I can use it as a guide now
what I'm going to want to do is display
this as blocks and that's just going to
allow me to position that anchor tag the
way that I want it to then you have to
put overflow:auto don't really worry
about this this is an Internet Explorer
issue so don't really worry about it
then you got color white
that's my text color text decoration I
want to put none inside of there rid of
those highlights padding I'm gonna put
six pixels so that it's nicely centered
inside of there and border bottom I'm
going to put one pixels if you've any
questions leave them in the comment
section below and I'll do my best to
answer them and then I'm going to do
pretty much the same thing border rights
so copy it leave everything else the
same and you can see that the text
totally disappeared and the reason why
is cause of this guy right here color
white I changed everything to white so
if I want everything to re up here let's
open this back up again we can use this
as a guide now what I got to do is come
in here and start defining the default
backgrounds for all of my menu items so
let's copy this guy again and then what
I want to style all I want to style that
you will Li a for any links then what
I'm going to do is I'm not highlight
this copy and then I'm going to change
this from link to visited and then after
that I'm going to change it to active
get rid of that guy right there and
start defining my CSS code so you'll be
real simple I'm just gonna say
background image and this is how you put
an image inside of a menu I get asked
that question all the time just sticking
it in a background images and I have an
image called horizontal menu item and
that's gonna be the background right
like that it includes off that now you
can see everything's being listed out
right there now what we got to do is
come in here and define the background
whenever somebody is hovering over one
of these guys see nothing is showing up
right now so I'm just gonna copy this
here let's scroll it up you're doing
lots of copying and paste in here and
we're going to change this to hover so
we're going to change the background on
the button whenever the mouse hovers
over it save ourselves some time come in
here grab this guy and let's change this
to horizontal menu hover which is the
name of an image it's a little bit
different and then let's say I want to
change my color to black reload and now
you can see when I roll over these
images that they are all being
highlighted just a couple little silly
changes making some pretty dramatic
changes alright well now I going to do
some styling on my sub level menu items
and you're not even gonna see those
right here but so what we're gonna do
copy your content body again the div
that surrounds everything
I'm gonna go UL li UL so what am I doing
here
if I go art content body well that's the
day of the surrounds everything where
it's here then we got you well that's
sidebar menu and we got li
well that's not gonna style that but it
is gonna style this guy right here
here's the UL this is the child element
the pop out for the menu so we're gonna
style that guy so what are we gonna do
come over here and I'm going to position
it absolutely on the screen and be a
position based off of the document
itself then I'm gonna say width I'm
going to find the width is 180 pixels
just like above and top I'm gonna leave
at 0 that's the distance from the top of
the screen and that's not gonna matter
because I'm then gonna go in here and go
visibility
I'm gonna say hidden what does that mean
that means it's going to lead off the
screen you know see it and as you can
see it just did so now what I got to do
with jQuery code is make those guys pop
back up whenever you roll over these so
that is it that's all the CSS code you
need that's because jQuery is extremely
powerful
basically when I come in here in the
script area and I'm going to define that
this code is going to run whenever
jQuery is loaded or whenever the
document is loaded I mean so this in
essence says when
the document is ready for me to do stuff
with I want this function right here in
run and end my jQuery I got to close off
this little curly brace close off that
bracket and then put us in a call then I
can start writing some code my first
function is going to trigger when the
mouse hovers over a main menu item
whenever I put my mouse on here instead
of just highlighting like it's doing
right now it's actually going to make a
pop-up come out here and again I'm going
to pull up the actual code to make this
a little bit easier to work with all
right so what am I going to do what I
need to do basically here is look for an
Li item which is going to be this guy
right here is an example of an li item
and here is another example of an li ID
on a list item okay well what I want to
do is I want to search for a list item
that has a ul inside of it if it has a
ul inside of it that means I need to
create a new menu in this situation
there is no ul inside of it see opening
list tag and closing list tag so I'm
definitely not going to make this pop
out a menu because there's nothing to
display all right so I got a
specifically come in there and target
that well in jQuery I want to come in
here and go side bar menu Li a and what
I'm doing here is I'm targeting the
anchor tags inside of this ul sidebar
menu right there and then I'm targeting
the Li that exists inside of it and then
the a alright that's going to give me
all the anchors that lie inside of Li
items well I don't want those I want the
Li item itself so I'm going to say
parents and it's going to get me the
parent element for the anchor tag which
is Li you can see that right there let's
say I want the parent that has this is
another jQuery code a ul inside of it
and then on mouse-over I want to run a
function so whenever the mouse cursor
goes over top of this guy we're going to
run ourselves a function pretty easy to
understand I'm going to use a function
called offset and what this does is it
returns the top and left relative
positions on the dock for this Li up
here so it's going to tell me how far
from the top of the document this li is
and at the same time how far from the
left side of the screen so this is easy
I'm going to create a function called
tag offset and it's going to be equal to
and I'm going to say this so I'm
covering all
kind of stuff with jQuery this is a
reference to Li so I'm going to say I
want the offset values for that Li tag
and something that I'm not going to use
here but might be useful because I use
this a lot myself let's say you want to
know what tag this is currently
targeting well it's really easy just
create a variable called get tag name
and then you're going to type in this
and this is used just to make sure that
you're actually targeting the right tags
with your jQuery cut and you type in tag
name like I did right there see what it
is you could do something like a alert
get tag name or something and shoot that
on the screen so that's a useful sort of
little piece of code you probably may
want to use so then I'm going to get the
distance from the left for this li item
so I'm going to say offset left is equal
to I'm going to say tag off set dot left
and that's going to give me that guy I'm
gonna say offset top is going to be
equal to and I'm say tag offset and tag
offset comes from right here so I'm
going to say tag offset top instead now
I know exactly where that guy is being
positioned and the reason why that's
important is I want to be able to
properly place my menu on the screen so
like this guy right here is saying if I
want to properly put this menu where it
says about me and contact me in the
right place based off of where this guy
is so I'm finding out how far from the
top and how far can the left
this guy is and then I'm going to
position this based off of that
information hopefully that makes sense
then I want to move the new pop-up a
hundred pixels to the right side of the
screen and I'm doing that because the
first pop-up menu is 180 pixels wide so
pop out offset left is equal to and it's
just going to be this guy plus 180 easy
enough then I want to get the ID for the
first ul contained in the Li so the
first ul and that's when we this guy
right here so I want to grab this sort
information that's what I'm shooting for
how I do that is I'm going to say close
parent is equal to when I say this I'm
going to use closest in essence going to
give me the first one that it finds
closest ul and I want the attribute
it's to be the ID that's what I want
returned and the reason why this is
important you might not understand let's
jump over here again alright now if we
look at what I got here on the screen
here you see about me and see how it
opens up this third window well I need
to treat those situations when there is
a third item to open differently and
that's the reason why I'm trying to get
the ID for this ul so that I can
properly position based off of it's a
first this is a first menu item this is
a second menu item this is a third menu
item over here where I live so I want to
use the attribute ID for the ul to
figure out if I'm going to be making a
second-level menu or a third level menu
and as I make this you're going to see
it so I'm going to say if closed parent
is equal to sidebar menu being the UL
that's going to surround everything then
what I want to do is go this and I want
to find an unordered list and I want to
specifically find the first unordered
list and I want to change some CSS code
inside of it for one I want to make it
visible so to set my visibility back put
a colon inside of that to visible and
then I want to set left to be equal to
and I'm just going to go off out offset
left I'm going to copy that guy paste
that inside of there and then follow
that off with pixels inside of quotes
and another comma and I also want to
position it from the top so I'm going to
say off set top and then I want to
position it from the top
also distance from the top of the
document and put a colon inside there
and go off set top plus and end pixels
and then close that off goes that off
put a semicolon all right now what I'm
going to do is say else and in this
situation I'm going to be making my CSS
changes to the third menu item and not
the second menu item so I'm going to be
making changes to this guy over here and
and not this guy right here I need to
find the offset for the UL that
surrounds the third level pop-up I'm
going to call this second offset is
equal to and I'm still going to save
this and remember this is a reference to
whatever had the mouse go over top of it
and then I'm
to say find ul and in this situation I
want to find the last ul and it's going
to be the last one because it's going to
be a third pop-up third-level pop-up and
I want to find the parent that surrounds
that guy to get the offset values for
then we're going to do exactly what we
just did it's just going to change just
a little bit so I'm going to say second
offset top it won't be equal to I'm
going to say second offset dot top - off
set this is going to give me the
distance from the top of the document
and I have to get rid of this
information like the offset top for this
specific guy right here and subtract it
get my stuff to line up properly like
you can see it's lining up properly
right there scroll this up so we can see
a little bit better and it's easier to
understand this if you actually have the
code in front of you and then I'm going
to go second off set left is equal to
and I'm going to get the distance from
the left side of the screen and it's
just going to be off set left - 10 and
then I'm pretty much doing exactly the
same thing so I'm going to actually copy
this just a couple little changes here
and there now that I got all my new
offsets all set up and run and right
right after this I'm going to paste into
there that and then in this situation
under left I'm going to say second
offset left so let's just copy that so I
can offset left right there paste it in
and then offset top is going to be
second offset top let's just copy that
and paste that in there and then I have
to close off the whole entire function
what's going to end up being like this
I'm not done yet and jump over here and
reload this guy and you can see that
this is all popping out here which is
great except when I put my mouse off of
it it's still there which is causing a
catastrophe so let's fix that that's not
a problem I just need to come in here
and define what should happen whenever
the cursor goes outside of the menu item
so I'm actually going to use this guy
here I'm going to copy it scroll back
down cause premature everything's gonna
be the same and in this situation
everything's going to be the same it's
going to be the same and just going to
change this to Mouse out then what I'm
going to do is actually highlight this
guy up here yeah just copy it to that
point right there because I just want to
set my visibility back to none there's
no reason to code that out
now - so instead of visible for
visibility this is going to be hidden
and then closed off the curly brackets
an a bracket nap bracket put a semicolon
in there and file save it and see if I
did the right things
reload up didn't come up and I know why
reason why is I need to close off this
bracket right here so I like that
I'll save reload and now you can see
that not only there's a menu bar opening
the way that it should it's also closing
the way that it should so I hope that it
helps you answer a ton of different
questions I'm actually gonna be using
this in a new WordPress theme that's
going to be coming up next leave any
questions or comments blue of the last
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
