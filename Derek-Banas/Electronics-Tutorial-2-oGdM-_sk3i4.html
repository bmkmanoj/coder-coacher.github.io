2 of my electronics tutorial if you
haven't watched part 1 you should
definitely watch it first otherwise you
might be confused in this part of the
tutorial I'm going to focus in on all of
the little things we need to understand
to be able to create really awesome
things using electronic components I'm
going to cover current flow schematics
multimeters voltage drop series circuits
parallel circuits breadboard switches
series and parallel resistors and a
whole bunch more I'm going to start off
with about a one-minute review of what I
covered in the previous tutorial and
then we'll off and ready to go to create
a ton of circuits so I have a lot to do
so let's get into it now as we said
before electricity is just the flow of
electrons through a conductor and a
substance is a good conductor if it's
electron shell has many additional
spaces to hold additional electrons
protons have a positive charge while
electrons have a negative charge
opposite charges attract while like
charges repel each other a field called
the electrostatic field surrounds
charges and can exert force on other
charges and this is the reason why
electrons are forced through a conductor
the buildup of charges or the potential
amount of charges available is called
the voltage and the movement of these
charges in the same direction through a
conductor when an external force is
applied is known as the current and when
charges move another field is created
called the electromagnetic field the
force that pushes the electrons is
called the electro-motive force or
voltage and like water pressure pushes
water so does voltage push electrons
through a conductor and as well the
higher the voltage is the stronger the
electric current is that flows through
the conductor Ohm's law provides us for
a way to calculate voltage current
resistance and power and power is the
total energy consumed while doing work
over a certain period of time it is
measured in watts and every component
has limits in regards to how much power
it can handle and pushing beyond that
point will generate heat which will
ultimately destroy the component now
resistance in a circuit is similar to
the effect you get by adding a smaller
tap to your water tank like we use in
this example and resistance can also be
compared to how much harder it is to
pull a heavy odd
over a rough surface first pulling it
over a smooth surface and we're easily
able to figure out what resistance a
resistor has because resistors use a
color code system to define how many
ohms of resistance they provide and that
is an overview of what we covered in the
previous part of the tutorial very brief
overview and now I'm going to jump in
and start designing some circuits and
I'm going to put a jumper wire in here
and then I'm going to put in a resistor
that is yellow violet and brown or 470
ohms and every circuit requires three
things to work an energy source that
provides the voltage or force that
pushes electrons through the circuit a
load which is something that absorbs
this energy such as the LED you see here
without the load specifically the heat
energy can actually melt the wires and
cause the battery to explode so that's
not a good thing and also we need a
conductive path that connects the
provider of the electrons to load and
then back again and in this situation
the battery provides a flow of electrons
in one direction which is known as a
direct current while an electrical
outlet provides a fluctuating flow known
as an alternating current a breadboard
is going to be powered when the jumpers
attach to the positive and negative
rails on the breadboard and when
attached to one plug the whole vertical
rail can now provide six volts using
jumper wires and if a jumper wire went
from the plus rail to say the 1a point
inside of our breadboard then that power
is also supplied to one B C D and E but
not FG H I and J and that brings us to
understanding current flow now people
used to think that electric current was
the flow of positive charges so they
described current as the flow of a
positive charge from a positive terminal
to a negative terminal then they
discovered that negative electrons
actually flow from a negative terminal
to a positive the original however still
sticks through to this day and that is
what is referred to as conventional
current flow in which current flows from
the positive to the negative so if you
see a description of a circuit know that
it uses conventional current
and here we can see a schematic drawing
of the circuit that we created just a
little bit ago and we can see here the
battery symbol which is going to
represent both the positive as well as
the negative terminals the resistor
which is the zigzag kind of thing there
that looks like a hose with many kinks
in it as well as the LED which has an
arrow pointing in one direction because
a current can only flow in one direction
because an LED is a diode and what
differentiates this LED from a diode as
you can see the little arrows that come
out of the side which demonstrate that
this is an LED and it also emits light
now a multimeter is going to allow us to
measure changes in voltage resistance
and voltage drops among other things I'm
going to start off here by measuring
voltage with a direct current which is
the V with a straight line underneath of
it and you're going to measure the
voltage provided by the battery by
putting one probe at each at the points
where the battery packs wires enter the
breadboard and as you can see that is
going to come out to be around 6 volts
you can also measure the voltage across
the resistor by putting a probe right
where the positive terminal enters and
on the opposite side of the resistor and
as you can see here comes out to about 4
volts and you can measure the voltage
across the LED by putting a probe on
both sides the LED which comes out to 2
volts and that is the basic idea of
voltage drop in which the voltage drop
sums across the resistor and the LED
will equal the voltage supplied by the
battery the voltage from the battery
gets the current moving and some of that
voltage is absorbed by the resistor and
LED which causes the voltage to drop as
that energy is used up by all of those
components and in fact with all circuits
if you start at any point and add the
voltage drops and rises you come out to
a final of zero volts and this is known
as Kirchhoff's voltage law now to
measure current you must interrupt the
circuit between two components and then
you'll use your multimeter to complete
the circuit so first off you want to
turn the multimeter to DC MA and then
you want to pull up the jumper wire next
to the negative terminal and measure
from the LED to the exposed jumper wire
and whenever you do that you should get
something around 8.3
if you pull up the jumper between the
positive and the resistor you'll also be
able to get yourself a current which
will be the same current and you could
then go and calculate how much energy is
consumed by taking the resistors voltage
and multiply that times the current so
it would be 4 volts times 8.3 one which
comes out to 33 point 2 4 because of
Ohm's law and you're also going to be
able to measure resistance by changing
to the little ohm symbol and then turn
the power off on the breadboard and put
a probe on either side of the resistance
to get a resistance right around 470 now
how you connect your components is going
to determine how your voltage is dropped
what I'm going to use here is a simple
two point two kilo ohm resistor and I'm
going to create a series connection and
make sure that the longer wire of your
LED is facing towards the plus sign when
you put it in the breadboard and it's
important to know that with a series
connection each component is going to
carry the same current the voltage is
going to be divided among the components
and if one component goes bad that's
going to stop the flow of all other
currents and here we're going to see a
reading of 2.8 volts for our resistor
and we're going to get that by putting a
probe right where the positive terminal
enters and on the opposite side of the
resistor and then we're also going to
need to be able to get a reading of
around 1.8 volts for the first and the
second led of course and you're going to
get that by putting a probe on both
sides of the led and you're also going
to see that the total voltage from the
battery is going to be right around 6.4
and of course you get that by putting a
probe at the points right where the
terminals enter both at the plus and the
minus sign on the breadboard and now
we're going to make a parallel
connection and with the parallel
connection if one component fails it
won't affect the others and the voltage
across of each of the branch is going to
be the same and the current supplied by
the battery is going to be divided
amongst the branches and those branch
currents are going to have a total sum
of the total current supplied and
we measure the voltage for between the
resistor you're going to see that comes
out to right around 4.6 and the voltage
on the LEDs are both going to come out
to be around one point seven eight and
now if I pull one of the jumpers up I
can measure the current which is going
to come out to be about 2.0 milliamps
here by the resistor and then you can
see that I can pull up a jumper by the
LED and the other LED still stays there
because this is a parallel connection
and whenever I measure that I get a
voltage of around point nine milli amps
now I want to talk about some components
but first off want to talk about ground
and what exactly is it well you have
ground is either earth ground or common
ground earth ground is a direct
connection to the ground in your house
for example the third prong on an outlet
is going to connect to a metal post
that's going to make contact with the
ground underneath your house and this
just provides a dangerous current with
someplace to go however a common ground
in a circuit is labeled as the negative
terminal of a DC power supply and that
brings us to switches now switches are
either going to make or break one or
more connections and the connection can
either be broken or redirected down a
different path now there are many
different types of switches and I'm
going to go over a couple of them right
here and they are defined based off of
how they mechanically work and the
number of connections that they can make
the switch in the upper left hand corner
is either going to go down one
connection or another the next one is
going to be either on or off the one
after that is going to have two
connections or no connections and then
the last one is going to have two
connections on or another two
connections on and here you can see a
schematic diagram for a circuit that I'm
actually going to make here in the real
world for you and demonstrate exactly
how it works on a breadboard and I'm
going to start off by putting a little
jumper wire from the plus terminal there
and you can see our little switch it's
either going to be on or off and I
connected the jumper to the topmost post
on the switch and I'm going to put a
resistor in the middle most post of the
switch and there's the LED remember have
the longer part facing the plus sign and
I connect all those together turn on the
switch and there it works and now I'll
show you how to switch between two LEDs
using a switch I'm going to take my
jumper wire first and put it in the
second post of the switch and put a
resistor at the top of the switch and
then at the bottom of the switch and
then I'll connect the LEDs so that they
all line up let's go and get that LED in
there alright so there's the LED and if
we move the other one up and now you can
see if I switch I'm going to go back and
forth just like a turn signal and now
I'll work with a push-button just
whenever you put this into breadboard
make sure that it lines up so that those
are all horizontal on your breadboard
and you can see the jumper wire and how
that is going to connect to the
push-button if I move my finger out of
the way and there you go
got it inside of there then I'm going to
take a resistor and put it on the
opposite or diagonal plug and then put
an LED in and then whenever we click on
the button you're going to see that
we're able to make a connection and then
break that connection with the push of a
button and this is an example of how we
can use resistors in series
when resistors are connected in series
the total resistance is going to equal
the sum of the resistors and I have a 40
470 ohm as well as a 1k ohm resistor
here and I have it set up with a switch
so that I'll be able to switch back and
forth and see how the resistance change
as well as the current and everything
else and with the switch in the utmost
position you can see here the resistance
comes out to 470 roughly now whenever we
have the switch in the downward
situation both resistors are now going
to be active and you can see if we check
the resistance you're going to come out
to right around fourteen hundred and
sixty ohms
now resistors in parallel are going to
be side-by-side versus one after the
other and in setting resistors up this
way you can actually decrease resistance
by adding resistors in parallel and
we're going to test this and then I'm
going to look at the calculations and
explain everything so we just put our
resistors in here with our little switch
and then I'm going to connect a jumper
wire to go across the little ditch here
and then we're going to get our narrow
led and plug that in there as well and
then we can get our multimeter in here
to come in and check the resistance and
if we check it you're going to see that
the resistance comes out to be right
around two on
and 34 ohm so why is that so if you're
working with resistors in parallel and
you know both of your resistances you
can figure out the total with this
simple formula here just take resistance
1 times resistance 2 and divided by
resistance 1 plus resistance 2 and you
can see the results there and if you
have one resistor and you want to get a
target resistance take your first
resistance multiply that times the total
resistance that you're aiming for
divided by the first resistance minus
the total resistance you're aiming for
and that will give you your other
resistance or the other resistor to add
to your circuit so pretty simple so
