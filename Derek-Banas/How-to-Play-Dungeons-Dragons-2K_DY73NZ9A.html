Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons tutorial today in one
video I am going to not take to the
basics of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons but I'm
going to teach you about 85 to 90% of
pretty much everything you will ever
need whether you're a player or a
Dungeon Master
so we're going to be learning all this
stuff by playing through an adventure
and I'm going to have a fighter a cleric
a rogue and a wizard and we're going to
interact and I'm going to specifically
try to do almost every single action you
can do as a player both in combat and
out of combat and basically the basics
you need to know is this is a d4 right
here and this is a d6 right here six
sides obviously and this is a d8 right
there and this is a d-10 I guess I
should do that d-10 right there and this
is a d20 that d20 is going to be the guy
that you use all of the time you're
going to use these other guys that a lot
as well and basically how I'm going to
be able to cover all of this information
in one video is I dramatically cut down
on the detail of the player sheet I cut
out all of the storyline stuff and all
that but we still have all of our skills
here as well as our saving throws we
have our AC which is our armor class
which means how hard it is to hit my
fighter or damage him initiation which
is going to allow the warrior fighter in
this situation to be able to attack
quickly 25 feet is the distance he can
travel 13 is his HP as hit points and
whenever that goes to zero he dies then
you're going to have 13 which is passive
perception which is going to deal with
whether he will be able to discover if a
monster is in stealth or something I'm
going to cover all the saving throws
we're going to walk through all of the
different skills even animal handling
I'm going to cover every single skill
and I abbreviated them all but I will
detail them whenever we walk through our
adventure so if you haven't completed a
player sheet you should probably do that
before you watch this tutorial but like
again I will cover every single thing
that's on the players sheet while we
walk through our adventure so you should
be able to pick up a lot either way on
top of that this is my ultimate goal my
ultimate goal is that if you watch this
video that you're going to be able to
get this right here this little sheet
one sheet and be able to play any
Dungeons and Dragons game just by
referring to the information on this one
sheet and of course I have a link to it
in the description and it's free so that
is the ultimate goal is to basically
condense the rules of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons
down to one sheet and now I have a lot
to do so let's get into it okay so here
is our game map and we have right here
the rogue the wizard the cleric and the
fighter and I put everybody in odd sorts
of positions so that I can have them do
all sorts of different actions now the
very first thing you're going to do
whenever you start a game is roll for
initiative and that just determines the
order that players make actions so the
road goes first the wizard the fighter
cleric and so forth and so on that's
what that's for and to figure out how to
do that you roll a d20 and you add
initiative to it this is initiative for
a rogue that's three so you can see
right here the rogue rolled ad 20 got 16
you add 2/3 to it and that determines
the road goes first and so forth with
the fighter the wizard and the cleric
now our rogue here is on the side of a
hill and then we have water here and
then he's going to have to climb up a
hill so that is the actions that he sees
before him or her the Rogue is actually
a girl now whenever you swim you're
going to move at half speed you can see
all the information right here and the
DC or difficulty class how hard it is to
swim through different types of water is
listed right there 10 is considered easy
15s medium 20 is hard and you're going
to use an athletics check to determine
if you're going to be able to swim
through this water and you can see down
here if we look at let exten or in this
situation subtract our athletics from
the d20 roll that is going to determine
if you succeed or not if you fail by
more than four that means you don't move
and if you fail by five that means you
go under the water if you are under the
water you're going to have to roll again
a d20 and determine if you're going to
survive or not all right and a lot of
this stuff in regards to difficulty
class it sounds complicated but it
really isn't it's up to the dungeon
master to determine what the DC is going
to be so if the if your player is
struggling the dungeon masters job
normally is to keep the player somewhat
alive not necessarily alive but you know
make it so that it's fun so if they keep
failing over and over and over again
change the DC's up so it's easier for
them to succeed so that's something
that's just changes as the game goes on
it depends upon the different players
and what goes on so basically our rogue
in this situation is going to roll a 16
and subtract one from that from our
athletics check we can see right here
and that means that she is going to
succeed in being able to go we look over
here how far can she travel 25 feet what
you're going to do is divide that by two
and round down that means she can travel
ten feet and if you look here she's
right there and each of these squares
here is going to represent five feet on
our game board so that just means that
she's able to move ten feet and now she
is in the middle of the water and now
based off of our initiative check that
we or our initiative role that we had in
the very beginning that means that our
fighter is going to act next and in this
situation the fighter is just quite
simply down here represented with the F
the fighter is just going to move
twenty-five feet or five spaces so the
fighter goes from there to there and
that's the end of the fighters turn now
there's nothing really else for the
fighter to do I mean it could look
around and it can play around these
other skills but for now we're just
going to have the fighter just move and
then give the turn over to the wizard
now our wizard is going to start moving
but a net trap with a DC 20 is going to
fall on him and what he's going to do is
make an athletics check to determine if
he is going to get trapped or if the
wizard is going to be able to jump out
of the way you can see here is our
wizard athletics check is mine
s1 and the wizard is going to roll he's
going to roll a seven with the d20 once
again d20 is going to be your main guy
all the time here if we subtract one
from that well we know the trap is going
to be a DC 20 so obviously go to six
versus a twenty and that means that the
Wizards going to be trapped so now
what's going to happen well that brings
in our cleric who now has an opportunity
to free the wizard if he said so choose
he moves over by the wizard and he's
going to try to free the wizard from the
net the freeing of the wizard from the
net we're going to say is going to be a
DC of 10 and cleric is going to roll a
20 in this situation which is going to
be a critical hit on the net and a
critical hit means that you can actually
attack twice and then what we're going
to do is we're going to basically I mean
what we would have done is take the DC 2
or the D 20 and then add 3 to it to
determine if we hit or not but if we hit
20 we always are going to hit so that
all succeeds then we're going to
determine how much damage we do and you
might want to watch this video
fullscreen here it's in 1080p so you
should be able to see everything
beautifully
now some dungeon masters may say that
we're not going to be able to use a
warhammer to cut through a net but I'm
just going to say that everything is
going to be perfectly fun because it's a
bludgeoning weapon and on a you know
piercing weapon or whatever I'm going to
say it's okay for us to cut through the
net with our Warhammer and what this
basically means is we are going to take
a d8 and you're going to roll it and
then you're going to add two to it so in
our situation our cleric is going to
roll in 18 we're then going to add 2 to
it and that means that we're going to
have a total of 20 damage to the net
since the net has a DC of 20 that means
that we are going to be able to very
easily cut through our net so that's
super awesome and now our wizard as well
as the cleric and everybody else is free
and now we're going to use the same
order that we did with our initiative to
see what happens next
now basically our Rogue is going to move
over one space because now she's on the
edge of a cliff and next time she's
going to have to
up the cliff or climb the cliff and to
determine that she was able to move the
road is going to roll a d20 once again
and she's going to roll it 20 in this
situation and that means she's going to
be able to move 20 spaces but in this
situation she's just going to move one
because she is impeded further progress
in regards to climbing up the hill so
the next turn she will go about in
climbing up the hill and I'll show you
exactly how to climb
now the fighter is in a situation where
we have a broken bridge here however
there are some scraps of wood laying on
the other side of the bridge what the
fighter wants to do is to run and then
jump across the bridge and then pick up
that extra wood and lay it down so it'll
be easier for everybody else to be able
to climb across that bridge so what the
fighters going to do is move one two
three spaces and then he is going to
roll a d20 and then add athletics check
again to it to determine how far he's
going to be able to jump in that
situation so he's going to take the d20
and roll it and he's going to get a six
he's then going to add four to it and
you can see right here how we figure
this all out so we got a six plus
athletics check so that is going to be a
four so he got a total of ten so if he
wouldn't have ran before he went to make
the jump he would actually have missed
it and landed in the water but if you
move more than two spaces before you
make the jump in that situation you're
only going to divide by five so that
means in that situation our fighter is
going to be able to leap two spaces and
land on the other side of the bridge and
succeed he can then with a bonus action
lay down some boards or whatever so that
everybody else will be you know have
less of a problem in regards to climbing
across the bridge now we're basically
going to just move our wizard as far as
we can move it so there goes the wizard
six spaces I am then going to move my
cleric and put him right up next to the
wizard it's always a good idea to keep
your wizards and your rogues protected
by the fighters and the clerics and now
we're going to see exactly how the Rogue
is going to be able to climb up this
cliff now whenever you're trying to
climb up a cliff once again what do you
think we're going to use
we're going to use the athletics check
again versus a d20 or we're going to
take the Athletics and add it to a d20
so basically the rogue is going to try
to climb up the rock wall that's going
to have a difficulty class of 15 she's
going to roll and she's going to get a
four and if we come down here to
athletics check again with the rogue
you're going to drop that down to three
and that means that she is going to fail
now in the situation in which you fail
at doing something athletics you can
make a saving throw and that is going to
determine if the rogue is going to fall
and hurt herself or not so in this
situation the rogue is going to roll
trying to defeat a difficulty class of
ten and she rolls in 19 so that means
that she is going to be okay and she's
not going to fall or hurt herself in one
way or another and you can see the
different difficulty classes for the
different types of walls that we would
be climbing up if it's wet nice II would
just add +5 to whatever these guys are
right here and if you have a climbers
kit which our rogue does not you would
add +2 to your you know increase your
overall score once again d20 + athletics
modifier if you fail by five or more
which our rogue did you're going to have
to make a saving throw and that is going
to have a difficulty class of ten and to
determine if you would succeed or not
the saving throw in this situation if
you're doing something athletics is
going to be a d20 plus your dexterity
and that is going to basically come in
anytime you're doing something athletic
wise and you're trying to save yourself
from falling and we'll get more into the
saving throws and provide more example
as we continue if she however would have
failed in her saving throw she would
have taken one D 10 that means roll the
d 10 dice one time and for every ten
feet she fell she would take damage and
of course that would decrease her hit
points depending upon whatever that
number would have been and now it is
going to be time for our fighter our
fighter is going to move and then he is
going to notice that there is a
non-player character here standing here
on the side of the water and our fighter
decides that
that he decides that he wants to ask the
non-player character if there is danger
nearby or non-player character says nope
there's no danger nearby just fish
so if our fighter would like to maybe
decide if the non player character is
being truthful or if they have any
motives or if they could provide some
type of clue what he's going to do is
make an insight check once again that
cheat sheet I showed you at the very
beginning that is also in the
description underneath the video that's
free get it because it has little notes
about what type of skills you're going
to use to get information from a
non-player character for example like
why you would use insight so our fighter
in this situation decides that they want
to make an insight check to decide if
the NPC is being truthful or not now
your DC is normally going to be between
10 to 20 and in this situation I'll just
use 10 because I'm trying to gain
insight from somebody that's not very
threatening so it should be pretty easy
so I'm going to roll a d20 and then I'm
going to add insight to it and my
insight is right down here and that's
going to be plus 1 so that means I
scored 17 and the fighter gains the
insight vit D NPC is lying now the
fighter has moved and the fighter has
also performed in action so in this
situation we're going to deem that his
turn is over now that's going to lead us
to the wizard and the wizard is going to
walk six paces and of course remember
the fighter put boards down there so we
don't need to jump in that situation
then it's time for our cleric to move
and the cleric is going to move five
spaces and in this situation he's
hanging off the side of the bridge here
so everything's okay I promise the
cleric in this situation now that we
know the NPC was lying decides that he
wants to try to intimidate the NPC and
now the NPC might be getting nervous so
let's increase his difficulty class in
regards to succeeding on an intimidation
to 15 now the cleric is going to roll a
d20 he's going to score a 5 we're going
to look over here for his intimidation
that's going to be a 3 that's still
going to be 8 which is less than 15 so
in this situation we will deem that the
cleric cannot intimidate
NPC and that brings us to round four so
back to our rogue who just recently fell
down the cliff trying to climb up it and
she is going to try to climb it again
now remember here is our information
this is a rock wall so we're going to
say this is a DC 15 and our rogue is
going to roll in this situation she's
decided to be smart and she has a rope
on her she decided to throw the rope up
and that is going to give her an
additional plus 2 which is going to
increase her success and whenever she
rolls she rolls in 11 minus our
athletics and in that situation she was
going to be able to succeed in climbing
up our rope and that's the reason why
she's up here above the cliff and this
brings us back to our fighter now our
fighter has determined that there's no
point in fighting with the NPC anymore
and trying to get any information but he
decides that he would like to look for
any scattered food that might be here
before we enter our dungeon so what our
fighter is going to do is do a survive
or use these there's a survival skill to
try to find some type of food and you
can see right here survival for our
fighter is plus 3 and our fighter is
going to roll he is going to get a 12
he's going to add 3 to it and that gives
you a total score of 15 now how we
decide how the survival works again the
survival notes are going to be on our
cheat sheet if you're we're going to
give survival or the opportunity to find
additional food ADC of 10 so if you go
and score a 10 that means you get an
additional one day's worth food and any
two points you would get is going to
feed another player or yourself four
additional days you're also going to be
able to use survival to avoid getting
lost or to escape from hazards like
quicksand and things like that or you
could also use a survival check to
predict the weather which I have never
used ever and but whatever that's in the
rulebook and so I decided to cover it so
once again our fighter role 2:15 so that
means that in essence she had or he
a14 which means he's going to be able to
get enough food for himself as well as
two additional days with our survival
skill so that's pretty cool and we could
jot that down on our little sheet or
more than likely you're going to use a
legitimate character sheet you could put
that in your inventory or whatever and
that brings us over to our wizard now
our wizard is going to move six spaces
way up here going to be very brave
wizard in this situation and then what
the wizard is going to do is roll an
investigation check and you can use
investigation to look for clues or
hidden objects and we're going to say in
this situation that the investigation
check is going to be a DC 15 which is a
medium check Wizards going to roll get a
19 plus five for investigation which is
right here I have it abbreviated plus
five and that means that the
investigation is going to be successful
and the wizard would then discover
Goblin tracks so the dungeon master
might determine that you know give you
additional information but for this
point I'm just going to say that all the
players should be aware that there are
probably going to be goblins coming so
preparing what other way you would like
that brings us back to our cleric is
over here hanging off the side of the
bridge and the cleric is going to move
five spaces and then he's going to not
give up and try to persuade the NPC so
he's going to come over here and with
the persuasion check you're basically
going to just try to persuade them to
give you some type of information in a
nice way so what he's going to do is
roll a d20 and he's going to score a
twenty so he doesn't have to add in the
persuasion check or anything like that
that's plus five so he's very very
persuasive our cleric but either way he
is going to be able to persuade the NPC
to give them a little bit more
information and what the NPC says in
this situation which is more valuable is
that there are three goblins nearby so
all of our players know that goblins are
come in and specifically we're going to
see at least three of them so we should
be prepared for that situation
now our Rogue is going to be sneaking up
here the NPC does not know that the
rogue exists and next to our NPC is
going
be a pile of fish so our rogue is going
to move five spaces once again 25 feet
each of these blocks is 5 feet right
next to the pile of fish in this
situation our rogue is kind of sneaky
and decides that you would like to steal
some fish how you can steal some things
if you're a rogue is to use sleight of
hand and I'm going to say that that is
going to have a DC of 15 and we look at
sleight of hand it's right here so plus
7 so our rogue feels pretty confident
that she'll be able to steal some fish
and she rolls and she gets a 4 so even
if you have the 7 to that that is only
going to give you 11 and we were
shooting for 15 so she is going to fail
in this situation the MPC is going to
accuse the rogue of stealing and so the
rogue decides that she would like to
make a deception check so deception
check is right here and she's going to
roll in the deception check DC is going
to be 15 let's just keep it the same
because it's a little bit heated and
she's going to roll an 18 add a forward
to it and in this situation C succeeds
and the NPC decides that she was just
admiring the fish and everything's cool
so there you go some more examples of
some skills and how we can use them we
then move on to our fighter and our
fighter is worried about our wizards so
the fighter is going to move up here in
front of wizard and and his turn the
wizard in this situation isn't going to
move but the wizard is going to make a
history check about the dungeon ahead to
see if there's any type of information
that can be gleaned using a history
check and in this situation let's just
say the history check TC is going to be
10 we're going to roll we're going to
get an 8 we're going to come over here
to history there it is for our wizard
and that is plus 5 so in this situation
we'll have 8 plus 5 and the wizard is
going to remember that the dungeon
contains much in the way of gold and
ancient powerful weapons ok so basic
stuff and I'm not going to get a lot
into the different intelligence checks
because they're more story based than
anything else and I'm trying to keep
this less about story more about
actually learning the intricacies of the
actions and things like that but you can
see right here
the screen the different types of
information you can get from these
different skill checks and you can see
arcane this is arcane right here history
was right there investigation is right
down here
nature is over here and religion is
right there all right so our wizard
found out some information and now we'll
move over to the cleric now our cleric
is going to notice that there is a dog
at the entrance for our dungeon and the
cleric is going to move in five spaces
and here is the dog non-threatening
little doggie sitting outside of a
dungeon for some reason and the cleric
decides that it wants to use the animal
handling skill and just to shake paws
now you can see right here I'm not going
to get a lot into animal handling which
you can do a lot with animal handling
especially at higher levels and what we
want to do here is we want to perform a
trick that our dog knows so we're going
to assume that the dog knows how to
shake paws and so the dc-10 for that or
the dc4 that is going to be ten so our
cleric is going to roll get an eleven
plus three for our animal handling which
is right there and succeeds and the
cleric shakes the dog's paw and that's
it and like I said you can look in the
players handbook and find out more about
all these other different things you can
teach the dogs tricks and do all kinds
of things but just be aware this is a
really complicated type of skill and
it's very specialized and you know it's
gonna take some work to get it more into
that so I'm not gonna dwell on it so
that's the end of round five and now
let's move into round six in this
situation our rogue is gonna move five
spaces and she's going to pass our NPC
who is down here that she really likes
to pick on and she's going to decide
that she wants to try to pick the NPC's
pocket so as she walks past our NPC she
is going to try to pick his pocket and
she rolls and she gets a one which is a
critical miss but we're lucky because we
have rogue and the rogue is lucky and
that means anytime you roll a one you
get to re-roll so she gets another
opportunity to pick the NPC's pocket she
rolls and in this time she scores
a 16 we're going to come again over here
to sleight of hand and add seven to that
she's going to succeed and we're going
to say that she's able to still one
silver piece and you could put that over
in your inventory just be aware the DC
is going to depend a lot whenever you're
picking pockets is going to depend a lot
on how large the object is so now let's
move over to our fighter our fighter is
just simply going to move five spaces or
a wizard is then going to move six
spaces and our cleric is going to move
five spaces so the clerics up above so
that can accept some damage he has an
ACA of 18 which is good the fighter has
an AC of 19 we're going to get more into
what AC and armor class does whenever we
get into combat here very soon and that
brings the end of round six now let's
move into round seven and the Rogue is
just going to try to catch up to
everybody and she is going to move five
spaces and then the fighter is going to
move five spaces and sees that there is
a wooden door that is going to block the
entrance to our dungeon and what he's
going to do is try a strength check on
the door and move up inside of here and
like I said it's a simple wooden door so
it's going to have a DC between 13 and
23 and he's going to use a strength
check to determine if he's going to be
able to break through that and in this
situation I'm going to say that the DC
for the wooden door is 19 and our
fighter is going to have a proficient
strength of four and on top of that he's
going to have a crowbar in his inventory
which is going to give him plus two so
he is going to roll a d20
and he scores a wonderful five which
he's going to add four to it from our
strengths that we have right here the
saving throw strength and all that's
going to be exactly the same as on the
player sheet so I just referred to that
just to keep it simple it's a little
confusing but it works out nonetheless
so he's gonna have five plus four plus
two which is going to get a villain 11
remember we wanted to get a 19 so he
uses a strength check and fails
now our wizard is going to come in here
and try to change up our luck wizard is
going to decide to cast a fire bolt on
the door so basically to smash the
object
then use a strength check and you can
see right here on the screen all of the
difference hit points that all these
different things have so we know exactly
how much damage we're going to have to
do to smash the door rather than just
push it open and it's good to know that
inanimate non magical objects don't have
saving throws so in this situation our
wooden door I'm going to say has hit
points of 10 and our wizard is going to
roll one detent you just have to trust
me on this on page 90 of the basic rules
it says that the damage that our wizard
is going to be is going to be one d-10
worth of damage and we're going to roll
and get it eight and that is going to
draw up our doors HP down to two and now
we leave it for the cleric to hopefully
get through this door the cleric is
going to move upwards and then hit the
door with his Warhammer so he is going
to remember it is a inanimate object so
he's going to succeed on his hit and now
he just has to roll for damage and the
damage on this yeah I'm gonna say that
he puts his shield down uses his
Warhammer as a two-handed weapon it's
going to roll a d-10 and then add two to
it like you can see right here he rolls
a nine plus two and that is going to
smash our door in and that also ends
round seven and now we move on to round
eight our Rogue is just going to move up
a couple additional spaces our fighter
is also going to come in here and move
in a couple additional spaces and get in
order so that we'll be able to protect
the rogue in the wizard wizards going to
move six spaces behind the fighter and
gain cover we'll get more into cover
here in a second and the cleric is going
to come in here and move five spaces
now that's ends that round now we're on
to round nine and the Rogue is really
trailing behind here and all the other
players want the rogue to catch up so
they decide to pass on their turn and
allow the rogue to move up so that the
rogue is right next to them
now the rogue is aware that there are
probably three goblins hiding in here
somewhere
so the rogue decides that she is going
to perform a stealth check now we're
going to say to the dungeon master how
much am I going to have to roll to be
able to hide and
juh master is going to say that you need
to roll a nine to hide so the role or
the rogue is going to roll and the rogue
rolls a six and she is going to get
seven from Stealth which is right there
and we now know that she's able to
perfectly hide behind a rock and be in
stealth mode our fighter then is going
to move five spaces ahead knowing that a
goblin might be nearby our wizards going
to trail up behind and hide behind our
fighter and our cleric is going to come
up here and also hide and these are
rocks here in my poorly drawn map if
you're wondering what these little grey
things are right here and this begins
round eleven and what we are going to do
in round 11 is we are going to be facing
off against three goblins however the
players don't know this right now the
goblins obviously do so what we need to
do in this situation when there is a
face-off is check to see if players are
going to be surprised by the goblins and
in the situation in which a player is
surprised that means that they can't do
anything for the round however since the
Rogue is in stealth she cannot be
surprised so everything is all cool for
the rogue and we don't know what's going
to happen to our wizard or fighter and
our cleric but we will know in a second
now you're going to roll a d20 and
that's going to represent the goblins
ability to surprise and that number is
going to be added to the goblins stealth
modifier or if the stealth modifier is
not listed then you're going to just use
dexterity to decide if the goblin is
going to be able to surprise or not so
the goblins we know that there are three
here or at least the dungeon master
knows that and they are going to roll a
d20 get a five and in this situation we
know that our goblin has a stealth
ability this is taken right from the
basic rules book which is also free
which is cool and we know that they have
a self of six so we learn from this that
our players are going to have to roll a
12 or more otherwise they will be
surprised and you can see right here a
monsters ability to surprise is the 20
plus dexterity or stealth we have
stealth here so we're going to use that
and the players ability to sense stealth
is going to be the d20
the perception modifier and the
perception modifier right here for at
least for our cleric is going to be five
and that's one of our skills now our
fighter and our wizard and our cleric
remember the rogue isn't going to be
surprised because she stealth are all
going to roll and you can see right here
all the additional information so our
fighter is going to roll a six plus a
three which comes from the perception
this is the cleric remember that's five
and that is going to fail with a score
of eleven remember that we have to get
it a twelve the fighter is also going to
really well the fighter failed obviously
the wizard is going to get a fourteen
and the Wizards not going to be
surprised the cleric rolls a seven plus
three so our cleric is also going to be
surprised so what that means is our
fighter is not going to be able to act
this turn neither is our cleric
however our wizard and our rogue will be
able to interact with each other
as well as our goblins of course we'll
be able to interact and now what we're
going to do is roll for initiative for
our goblins as well as our rogue and our
wizard to determine the order in which
we will be able to play so we have our
initiative roll Goblin run rolls a 11
Goblin two rolls a nine
goblin three rolls a nine the rogue
rolls a ten and the wizard rolls and 11
and so knowing that information we're
going to be able to determine the
actions whenever we actually fight
against each other and I have a little
note over here the initiative if it
isn't filled out is actually the same as
the dexterity as you can see right there
okay so now let's move on and let's go
and start an attack so I'm going to say
in this situation that the wizard is
going to be able to attack first and
since the wizard wasn't surprised the
wizard is going to be able to see our
goblins over here because they don't
have full cover and the way cover works
is the wizard in this situation is going
to have half cover because he is going
to be behind the fighter and what that
means is they get a plus two of AC armor
class harder to hit if the fighters in
front of it as well as a plus two
dexterity saving throw so add to the
dexterity saves as well as add to two
class and you can see right here if
there was 3/4 cover that means +5 AC as
well as dexterity saving and in the
situation in which something is fully
covered that means it can only be
attacked with an area of effect spell so
in this situation our wizard decides
that he wants to try to attack both of
these goblins right here with acid
splash now acid splash is a spell and it
has a range of 60 feet so we can
definitely hit from there and what it
does is it allows you to choose one or
two monsters if there are within 5 feet
each other these two are right next to
each other so that's going to work and
in this situation it says in the spell
that the monster must succeed with a
dexterity save versus spell save and
spell safe if we come down here and look
with our wizards going to be 13 and if
it should fail that spell say that means
that the goblin is going to take 1 d6 of
acid damage and this is going to affect
both goblins because they're right next
to each other of course
so goblin 1 is going to roll and score
in 18 and then we're going to take the
dexterity which is plus 2 for a total
score of 20 Plus on top of that we're
going to have half cover which is going
to add plus 2 and that means that the
acid is going to miss goblin 1 goblin 2
rolls gets a 12 + dexterity the goblins
all have exactly the same stats so plus
2 and in this situation we're going to
say that the goblin 2 is going to have
3/4 cover because not only is he covered
by the rocks here but also by the Goblin
and so we get 12 +2 dexterity plus 5 for
3/4 cover and again the acid misses
there as well just understand I'm
playing these different spells more to
show you the different types of spells
not necessarily because I thought that
was a great idea to do acid splash
alright so the wizard had an opportunity
to attack and failed miserably now it is
time for goblins ones opportunity to
come in here and attack now remember is
the it's that goblin one is going you
can see here I put some information in
regards to how that attack went now
goblin
one in this situation has half cover
because he is behind a rock so he has
plus 2 to his armor class and Goblin one
decides that he wants to attack the
fighter with a short bow as you can see
right here is all the information on the
Goblin short bow and our fighter in this
situation is right here and the fighter
has an armor class of 19 so that means
to be able to do any damage to the
fighter the Goblin is going to have to
score more than 19 points to be able to
damage our fighter
so our Goblin is going to roll and score
16 and then what we're going to do this
is a ranged attack for our short bow
we're going to add the plus 4 to that to
get a total attack of 20 and that means
we're going to hit our fighter then we
come down here to determine how much
damage we're going to be able to do so
the Goblin rolls for damage with a d6
and scores a 3 + 2 and that is going to
drop our fighters hit points from 13 to
8 okay so goblin 1 succeeds where the
wizard fails now it's going to have the
opportunity for our rogue to attack now
our rogue in this situation has
advantage because she is in stealth
now having advantage means that you're
going to be able to roll twice and pick
the best number from it but in this
situation the what our rogue is going to
do is use sneak attack which is going to
allow her to do an extra 1 d6 of damage
and that's true if there's any advantage
and the one situation which rogue
doesn't need advantage is if a monster
is engaged with another player at the
time and they're distracted so sneak
attack allows you to do an additional 1
d6 of damage if you are a rogue and you
have that capability obviously so the
rogue decides that she wants to try to
sneak attack because she's in stealth
and she's going to do this on goblin 1
and you can see right here that the AC
or armor class for our goblin is 15 so
she is going to try to attack goblin 1a
up here and with our shortbow she can
shoot this guy 80 feet so that's 80 feet
she'll definitely be able to hit him
with that and the AC also is going to be
5
teen plus two because remember of goblin
one has half cover so the royal rogue is
going to roll score a fourteen plus a
five range attack bonus which she knows
we have because that's right here plus
five so that's pretty awesome so that's
going to get a 19 which is going to hit
our goblin and now our rogue is gonna
roll to determine the damage and she
gets a five plus two so she does seven
damage and the HP for our Goblin is
seven so that means that she kills the
Goblin so in this situation sneak attack
didn't even matter if she would have
wanted to she could have done an
additional 1d6 of damage but she didn't
need to because the goblin is already
dead unless you want to shoot another
arrow out
so the goblin one is dead and I have all
the additional information here in
regards to how all that worked itself
out if you would like to pause and read
that otherwise we're going to move on to
goblin - and what goblin - is going to
do now goblin - decides that he wants to
attack our fighter and specifically
goblin - is going to attack the fighter
with the short bow remember the fighter
still has a 19 AC and the goblin is
going to roll and get a 2 plus a 4 for
range attack you can see right there the
range attack with short bow and is going
to miss our fighter so our fighter is
not going to take any damage and then
that brings us to goblin 3 and goblin 3
decides that he wants to attack the
cleric once again with a short bow the
cleric in this situation is going to
have an AC of 18 the Goblin is going to
roll score a 19 plus 4 for range attack
once again and hits then the goblin
decides that they have to determine the
damage roll a 1 d6 as you can see right
there plus 2 and this is going to do a
total of 5 damage to our cleric which is
going to drop the HP of the cleric from
12 to 7 and that ends our round and now
because nobody is any longer surprised
we are going to do an initiative roll
with every single character that is
currently on our map so we're going to
have an issue
roll and Goblin three is going to roll
total of 22 remember initiative is the
20 plus whatever the initiative is
there's the initiative for the Goblin
so Goblin three rolls 22 and you can see
all of the other different initiative
rolls and then we're going to determine
who goes first depending upon who has
the highest initiative roll now Goblin
three gets to go first and decides that
he wants to attack the cleric with a
short bow once again the cleric has an
AC of 18 the goblin rolls a 1 which is a
critical miss and anytime you have a
critical miss a whole bunch of horrible
things can happen to you unless you're a
rogue and I have a whole list of all the
different things here that can happen if
you have a critical miss and what you're
going to do in that situation is get a
d20 and you're going to roll it to
determine what horrible thing happens to
you so I roll in this situation and I
roll a 13 so I'm going to come down here
and go 13 to 14 and that means that our
goblin 3 this guy down here is going to
be knocked out for 1.d4 rounds I'm going
to roll a 1 d 4 which remember is the
pyramid-shaped die and I'm going to roll
4 so that means that our goblin is going
to be prone knocked on the ground
unconscious for 4 rounds and more than
likely is not going to do anything else
for the rest of the playthrough now we
move on to goblin - goblin two decides
that he wants to continue attacking the
fighter with the short bow and the
fighter has a 19 a C and the Goblin is
going to roll a d20 and add in 4 for a
ranged attack got an 18 + 4 and that is
going to hit the goblin is then going to
do some damage so does a or gets a d6
rolls that guy and that comes back with
a score of 5 + 2 which is going to drop
our fighters hit points to 1 so our
fighter is not looking too good right
now almost dead now it's time for the
wizard to be able to do something here
and the wizard is going to move forward
well just before I continue on with the
wizard I want to talk about what happens
in the zero hit point scenario now in
that round if the fighter would have
gone down to zero hit points what he
would have did is roll a one d-10 as you
can see right here and then add his
constitution to it which is a 5 and if
he rolled over a 10 for 3 turns in a row
that would raise his HP to 1 if he would
instead fail three times and he could
try once per round to try to come back
to life or survive from death then in if
he would have failed scoring less than
10 that means that he would ultimately
die and be dead forever so that is how a
zero hit point scenario works and how
you can be killed and then basically
stabilized over numerous different
rounds so now we can move on to our
wizard and what our Wizards going to do
now our wizard in this situation is
going to use fire bolt on goblin 2 and
first what he did was move over a number
of spaces so he could get a direct line
of fire so he doesn't have to worry
about cover anymore and the fire bolt is
going to have a total range of 120 feet
and our wizard is going to use a spell
attack bonus in any situation in which
the spell doesn't say that the monster
takes a dexterity save or a constitution
save or some other type of save so in
the spell description if it doesn't say
that the monster needs to take some type
of save in that situation always you are
instead going to use our spell attack
bonus for our wizard or a sorcerer or
whatever ok so that's very important to
understand that confuses some people so
if it doesn't say that the monster takes
a some type of save then use this okay
kind of simplifies it a lot so what
we're going to do here is get a d20 and
we're going to roll that and then we're
going to add a spell attack bonus versus
our monsters ac to decide if we hit so
our wizard is going on roll a 7 and then
we're going to add our spell attack
bonus to that which is a 5 and vs. a 15
AC that means that our wizard once again
fail
and doesn't hit our goblin now it's time
for our cleric to come in here and do
something and our cleric is going to
move three spaces next to goblin to
cleric is upset cleric is going to swing
the one-handed Warhammer the cleric has
a shield on the other arm and the Goblin
is going to have a 15a see the cleric is
going to roll a 12 ad in the attack
bonus which is three down here as you
can see in the bottom right hand corner
that is going to score 15 which you have
to score the AC or higher to be able to
hit so 15 does hit and then the cleric
does a d8 worth of damage plus 2 as you
can see you down here
d8 if it's one-handed Warhammer + - and
that means that it does a total of 8
damage which kills goblin - so goblin 2
is now dead and this brings us back to
the rogue remember the rogue has
advantage if the Goblin is knocked out
however if you really look into the rule
books if the goblin or a monster in
general or anything is prone which means
they're down on the ground
that gives the attacking person a
disadvantage so what happens when you
have advantage but you also have
disadvantage they cancel themselves out
so that means that the rogue is not
going to have advantage nor disadvantage
and also on top of that since the rogue
attacked on the previous turn the rogue
is no longer in stealth so the rogue
etat decides that she wants to attack
with her short bow and here's some
information on advantage and
disadvantage goblin 3 in this situation
is still going to have 15 AC and the
rogue is going to roll 14 plus 5 which
gets 19 that means that she was able to
hit the goblin the rogue is then going
to roll for damage and get a 4 plus 2
and that's going to drop our goblins HP
to 1 so we got two goblins dead and one
living here still onwards and that's
going to bring our fighter in here and
the fighters going to move three spaces
and attack the awake goblin remember the
goblin was knocked out but whenever it
was attacked it wakes up fighter is
going to take a bonus action in this
situation and return some lost HP
and he's going to be able to do that
because he has second wind down here and
what that means in that situation is the
fighter is going to be able to roll one
d-10 and then add one to it for his
level and that means he is going to
return 11 HP so that's going to bring
him from one HP up to 12 so almost to
max Max's 13 I believe and then the
fighter is going to attack the Goblin
with a longsword he is going to roll a
14 + 4 attack bonus you can see that
longsword and that's D 20 obviously plus
4 and then determine how much damage you
get roll d 8 get a 5 add 2 to that and
that's going to kill the Goblin so now
everybody's dead and now we can move on
now what I'm going to do is basically
just prepare for the next round of
horrible things to happen so I'm just
going to say that all the players can
move to whatever position they want to
move in in this situation as the dungeon
master you're allowed to do anything you
want basically and also I'm going to say
that the cleric is going to cast cure
wounds on our fighter and going to roll
a d8 in that situation and we are going
to then determine that we're going to
take the d 8 + 5 for the wisdom a cleric
special spell casting tool is going to
be wisdom versus the wizard which is
going to be intelligence and we're going
to be able to cure for a total of 2 + 5
and that's 7 however we're not going to
be able to go above his max HP so that
just brings our fighter from 12 HP the
whole way up to 13 HP and also the rogue
is going to roll and go into stealth
mode once again because we have no idea
what we're going to see on the other
side of this door now the robe walks
over and pushes on the door and the door
is locked
and so the rogue decides that she is
going to try to pick the lock which in
this situation we're going to say has a
DC of 10 or once again I'm going to roll
D 20 which is going to give us an 8
we're going to add our dexterity to it
which is 5 and that means that the rogue
is going to be unlocked be able to
unlock the door however we're going to
find out then as we push the door that
we cannot get through the reason why we
can't get through is a monster is
holding the door shut so in this
situation the fighter is going to try to
enter a strength contest now contests
are going to occur
rona player and monster are trying to do
the same thing so how we're going to
determine success or not is my fighter
as a strength modifier of +4 so strength
modifier +4 as you can see right there
+4 and we're going to combine that or
compare that to a goblin strength
modifier which is negative 1 the fighter
is going to roll a 7 plus 4 for the
strength modifier to get 11 goblin is
going to roll an 11-1 and score of 10
the fighter is going to throw the door
open and the goblin is going to run away
so now we will move on we got into our
inner chamber here and we will discover
some more things maybe now would be a
good time to do an initiative role or
you could just stick with what you
previously had I decided to do an
initiative role and in this situation I
scored or the wizard came out first and
what the wizard is going to do is move
six spaces and then the wizard is going
to perform a perception check and that
is going to be specifically use let's
say the wizard says I think this looks
kind of weird here and I want to inspect
what it is
so perception is going to tell the
wizard if this is something to be
worried about or not and we'll say the
dc4 that is 15 and the wizard rolls a 14
and we'll come down here to perception
which is plus 2 and that means that the
wizard is going to be able to discover
that there is indeed a trap here but not
do anything about it
fighters then going to move in three
spaces fighter can't really do anything
but the rogue can come in here and try
to disable the trap so the rogue is
going to move in three spaces and we're
going to say that the DC to disable the
trap is going to be 15 the Rogue tries
to disable the trap and rolls a three
even with plus five which in this
situation would be our dexterity that's
going to give us a score of eight which
means that not only did the rogue fail
but he failed miserably this got a score
of 15 and he scored an eight that means
he missed by more than five that means
that he sprung the trap
whenever you spring the trap that means
that the rogue has to take a dexterity
save to decide if he is going to die or
not
so the rogue makes a dexterity save
and that's going to say let's say the
dungeon master says that's 15 so that he
can kill off the rogue and the rogue is
gonna roll and get a 5 + dexterity and
fail again so he was trying to get 15
and he got a 10 so now what's going to
happen
well the cleric is going to come in and
try to save our a rogue who just failed
miserably so the cleric is going to move
in for space and the cleric decides that
he wants to make a strength save to try
to keep the rogue from falling in the
pit so he's trying to do something with
strength you know grabbing a body and
holding it from falling into a pit he's
not doing something necessarily
reflexive so the cleric rolls gets a six
plus one for a strength save as you can
see right there and the rogue falls in
or the pit everybody fails okay so the
cleric ah da da da da
so the rogue tries to reduce damage and
in this situation the damage that can be
done we're going to roll one d6
for every ten feet fallen and in this
situation we'll say that that is for
falling damage so in trying to reduce
that for falling damage the rogue is
going to roll a d20 which is going to
come up with a score of six we're going
to add in acrobatics and acrobatics for
our rogue let's where is our rogue I
don't know pretty rogue there she is the
rogue right here athletics is going to
be negative 1/2 is going to give us a
total damage that wasn't done to our
rogue of 5 which means since she had 4
done door and 5 was negated that means
our Rogue is safe so our rogue didn't
take on damage and she was very lucky
and that is an overview of a vast
majority of the things that you will
need to know to play Dungeons and
Dragons now there are a couple more
things Constitution saves you're going
to hear about them all the time oh what
a constitution save in this situation
here's an example a ghoul can force you
to make the Constitution safe so a ghoul
claws our cleric let's say and the
cleric tries to make a dc-10
Constitution safe by rolling let's say a
19 what that means you're going to do is
take whatever your call
institution modifier is the Constitution
modifier 19 +3 and if you fail you're
going to be paralyzed and if you don't
fail you're not going to be paralyzed
and another thing you might come across
is wisdom save the phantasmal killer is
going to try to charm our cleric into
seeing the most fearsome creature
imaginal in this situation the cleric
must make a wisdom save of DC 15 to
recognize that it isn't real
takes a d20 rolls it gets an 8 plus 5
wisdom there's wisdom right there and in
that situation fails there you go guys
that is an overview of pretty much a
vast majority of the different things
you can do with Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons
hopefully I was able to clear up a lot
of things and I will make it a little
bit more likely you'll be able to jump
into a game and enjoy yourself rather
than scratch your head all the time like
I said before refer to the cheat sheet
that it is in the description and like
always please leave your questions and
