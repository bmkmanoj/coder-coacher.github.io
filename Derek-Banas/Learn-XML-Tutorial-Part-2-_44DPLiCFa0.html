learn XML tutorial part 2 if you didn't
see part 1 you should definitely take a
look at that first
this tutorial continue to cover XML and
all of its capabilities XML stands for
extensible markup language I hope you
got this one point from the last XML
video XML does one thing really well it
organizes and classifies your data so
that it is usable by a wide range of
devices and software packages that is
the most important concept to understand
in this video I'll explain how XML
influenced HTML to create the newest
version of HTML called
XHTML I'll then explain what well-formed
XML is and document type def so why do
we need XHTML I created a whole video on
the difference between HTML and XHTML
you may prefer to watch that for a more
in-depth discussion but here I'll cover
all the most important points so why is
XHTML now widely used one simple reason
the HTML provided people with the
ability to display information in
browsers XHTML opened up the
possibilities of providing content on
many more internet output devices by
using XHTML you will also find it easier
to connect with databases and other
structured data and because XHTML is
highly structured you can better
guarantee that your information will be
displayed exactly the way you want it so
how do you turn HTML indexed HTML first
every tag must have a closing tag tags
that don't have closing tags like
horizontal roll or break etc must have a
forward slash inserted in them like this
all tags must be lowercase like you can
see here in this paragraph tag not like
this all tags must close in the right
order also for example this would not be
a legal way to use tags in XHTML where I
create a paragraph tag then a heading
tag then close the paragraph tag before
I close the heading tag this would not
be legal in XHTML if you assign an
attribute in a tag the values must be
surrounded by quotation marks also also
every XHTML file must have a valid
doctype declaration meaning instead of
starting the page with the HTML tag as I
have it here it must start
instead with an HTML tag that resembles
what I use here is an example bad things
happen when you don't define a doctype
if a browser doesn't see a dog type
defined it will lay out your website
based off what is called quirks mode
this means your web page will look
completely different on every browser
and more than likely will look broken to
anyone that visits your site in the
doctype above you can see the words
XHTML 1 - transitional . DTV I'll go
back and show you see right here here is
a transitional tag that I'm talking
about this signals to the browser that
it should expect your webpage to follow
the rules described in that document
type definition 8 DTD specifies what
tags and attributes are allowed in your
web page markup there are two possible
dtds
you can define an XHTML if you're going
to only style your pages with cascading
style sheets use the XHTML strict DTD if
you may use HTML for presentation in any
way stick with transit you want your
XHTML to be processed if so your XML
markup must be what is called
well-formed that just means it can't
violate any rules established in XML
doctrine however if you do break any
rules the XML processor will cease
processing your xml Mart so what roles
must your XML follow to be well-formed
you need to include an opening XML
declaration you need to create a route
element that will surround all of your
other elements every element must have
an opening and closing tag every empty
element must end with a forward slash
just like I described with the XHTML
above all the values assigned to
attributes must be surrounded by quotes
just like it XHTML
and now I'll briefly go through what a
document type definition is you create a
document type to define the rules that
must be followed in your XML markup a
DTD defines what elements are required
and what attributes can be set and what
their potential values can be you are
now most definitely entering the next
level of xml development probably the
most important question you can
about the feedings is do you need one if
you are only creating small XML files
the answer is probably not if however
you're working with large sets of data
that require very specific usage the
answer is probably yes now I'll go
through some DTD jargon first you have
XML declarations every DTD must start
with this line that I have right here
this tells the processor that this is an
XML version 1.0 file and the character
encoding used is of type utf-8 and that
no external file is required for this
document to work that's what I define in
the standalone attribute element types
define the elements name and the data
type of that element then you have
attribute lists which define the element
it is associated with the data type and
all the fault values for all the
attributes for the element then you have
entity declarations entities help you
eliminate repetitive information in your
XML by referencing data that can be
found in an external location and
finally you have notation declarations
which locate an external program that
interprets data that an XML interpreter
cannot an example of this would be a
JPEG file the video file anything that's
not basic text in part three of my learn
XML tutorial I'm gonna completely cover
everything there is to know about
document type definitions till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
