my C++ tutorial series and this part of
the tutorial I'm gonna cover the bubble
sort we're gonna take a look at
recursion factorials Fibonacci numbers
how to overload functions and we're
gonna solve a whole bunch of different
problems like always all the code and a
transcript of this video is available in
the description underneath this video
and I have a lot to do so let's get into
it
alright so if you haven't watched any in
the previous tutorials you definitely
should start at part 1 otherwise you may
be confused ok and the last part of the
video I went and created this generate
random vector function that you see
right here and we're gonna use it here
with our bubble sorts and rather than
just do a basic bubble sort
I mean I'm obviously gonna show you how
a bubble sort works but I'm also going
to output information in regards to how
our vector is changing as we sort it all
right so that's just an added little
benefit that we have here so our bubble
sort is not going to return anything and
it's gonna be called bubble sort it's
just a way of sorting values in a vector
in this situation so we are going to
receive our vector here and we're going
to get a reference to our vector so that
we'll be able to change it directly and
then we're gonna come back in here and
we're gonna start creating it so let's
just paste that in there whoops and
there we go alright ok so in creating
this guy basically the way the bubble
sort is going to work is that you're
going to have an outer loop that is
going to decrease in size each time and
what I mean by loop is we're gonna have
a while loop on the outside so we're
gonna have two different loops and the
goal is to have the largest number at
the end of the list
whenever the outer loop completes one
cycle so let's just start here the very
first thing that we're going to need to
do for our bubble sort is we're going to
initialize I and this is going to be
equal to whatever the vector size is
that we have reference to minus 1 okay
so there we go we have the size and we
know we're gonna be working with that so
then we have to create
while loop so while I is greater than or
equal to one we are going to continue
cycling and of course we want this to be
here and to get rid of that all right so
just a little mistake alright so then
we're gonna have another loop inside of
this while loop and it's gonna say wow J
is less than I we are going to once
again continue cycling inside of it so I
am going to have this inner loop and
what it's going to do is it's going to
start comparing indexes at the beginning
of the loop so it's going to sort of the
basically I mean the whole concept of
bubble sort is that the largest number
is going to be at the end the largest
number is going to bubble up to the end
and then I'm just going to be comparing
all of the different indexes as I go
through it sounds confusing but that's
the reason why I'm also going to go and
print out every single thing that is
happening the entire time the sort is
working so inside of here I'm gonna say
is and I'm going to go and get the first
index that I'm comparing and place that
inside of there greater than and then
I'm going to get the second index that
I'm comparing to and I'll go vector and
then we're gonna use J and then we're
also going to use the back and we're
gonna use J plus 1 all right and that's
gonna output on the screen that has
nothing to do with the bubble sort
except it's going to print out over here
so that you'll be able to see exactly
what's going on with our bubble sort so
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to say if the vector J is greater than
or equal to the vector J plus 1 well in
that situation I'm going to output on
the screen that a switch is going to be
made between our our different elements
inside of our vector and to make that
switch I'm going to create a temporary
holding cell which is going to hold the
first item that is inside of our vector
then what I can do is
the vac and Jay which I just stored its
value and I can instead store in the
value of J plus one okay so I'm just
moving the values in the different
indexes around whenever there is the
need for a change so is equal to and
then get the value that I had stored in
temp so that's how we're gonna be able
to switch the values inside of our
vector and whenever that happens else if
that came back is not true well then I'm
gonna output on the screen that I don't
want to switch the values inside of our
array alright inside of our vector C
you're gonna see here doing it this way
just so it's very easy to see exactly
how a bubble sort works and then I'm
gonna do is increment the value of J and
then after I have that all set up I'm
gonna go for auto pay and get all the
whoops values in our vector and I'm
gonna output them on the screen so
you're gonna see every single change to
our vector every single time we go
through a loop somebody go and print out
all the values of K and I saw something
I might as this tutorial continues I
might show you a neat way of printing
out all of the values and a vector in a
really neat way let's try that I think
I'm gonna add that on as a problem that
just came up okay let's get rid of some
of this space here so that we can see
everything on the screen at once and
what I'm gonna do is at the very end
here I'm going to output
end-of-round and that just means that I
went through and compared indexes for
all of the different items that are
inside of our vector so I can just go
and do that and then after this I can
decrement the value for one and start
all over again with our outside while
loop alright so there is our whole
entire bubble sort with a lot of extra
stuff so basically the bubble sort part
is gonna be this and this not the printf
part and then we're also going to of
course check if it's greater than or
equal to the two two
some things and then if they are we're
going to move them around and then else
we're not gonna do anything and then at
the end we're gonna output all those on
the screen okay so to test this and then
so you can see how the bubble sort works
I'm gonna go up inside of main and call
for it to work so I'm just gonna create
a vector oh one other thing kind of neat
if you want to use the different
versions of C++ what you do here and
you're gonna want to do this is you're
gonna right-click on this come down here
to properties and I'm assuming you're on
NetBeans and then under C++ compiler
you're gonna want to click on this guy
right here and you're gonna want to put
this line in right here
I'm gonna copy it just in case you can't
see it I'm gonna say okay and that's
gonna force us to use the 14 version
2014 version of C++ so that is what
you're going to type there - standard no
spaces is equal to c plus plus 14 you
could also put 17 inside of there and
the compilers are going to recognize
some of the a lot of the 2017 changes to
c++ I know it's 2018 but they haven't
really taken effect in every single
compiler so you're gonna get different
results depending upon what so that's
why I'm using 2014 for right now all
right so well we're gonna do here and
the reason why I imported generate
random vector is I'm going to have it
generate a random vector for me here so
I'm gonna call this a vector values and
then I'm gonna call generate random
vector and I say that I want ten values
between 1 and 50 and that will generate
that and I don't believe I needed
anything else for my generate random
vector yeah everything looks like it's
fine so that was a useful little
function that we created in a previous
tutorial and then I'm gonna call bubble
sort and I'm gonna pass the vector
values and this is a reference to vector
values and then after that I'm going to
output on the screen the changed vector
after everything has been sorted so I'll
go vector values and then I can just go
standards outs
X and a new line
alright so there we go and over here
you're gonna be able to see precisely
how the bubble sort works so we'll just
run this and there you can say it
alright so cool and you can see here
that everything has been properly sorted
to 1014 see it's good sort alright so
what we do is we are going to compare to
246 and hopefully you can see this this
is how the bubble sort works see so it's
going to and 46 well is to greater than
46 no it isn't so don't switch anything
then what we're gonna check next is
we're gonna go to this line 46 and 33
run and compare those we're gonna say
it's 46 greater than 33 yes it is okay
switch see and that's what they mean by
bubbling up so it's going to move the
biggest number up here and then you can
see 46 and 14 and you see that the 46
moves up 46 moves up 46 and it's just
comparing index to index to index the
index to index until we get to this
point right here where the biggest
number in the entire vector is this
number right here 46 then once we have
checked every single index it's the end
of the round then what we're gonna do is
we're going to check the next one c2 and
33 and 14 and you're gonna see that 43
is the biggest number and you're gonna
see as we go on that eventually 43 is
going to get to the highest point right
here and you're going to also see that
we don't check this one with a waste
time computer processing time checking
43 and 46 we already know that because
the outer loop has already gone through
and check that and you can see over time
that's gonna check every single one of
the indexes inside of here until we get
to the very very end in which we see
that every single vector value is in
proper order and as you can also see it
doesn't matter if values are the same
alright so there is the bubble sort and
precisely how it works and also it
provides a demonstration I think a
useful demonstration for ways that you
could go and analyze how other
algorithms work other sorting algorithms
or other algorithms in general on your
own time if you want to figure out how
different things work well then just you
can see that you can just output a
little bit of information like that and
you can learn a lot
on your own and now that we got the
bubble sword out of the way I'm gonna go
over and I'm gonna talk a little bit
about recursion and how we can calculate
factorials
okay so recursion is just rolling into a
recursion spelled like there's recursion
okay so recursion is just whenever or a
recursive function is one that calls
itself and the one rule whenever you're
working with recursive functions is that
you are going to have to have an exit
condition otherwise you're going to have
an infinite loop so what I want to do in
this example is we are going to have a
function called get factorial and you're
gonna pass in a value like three for
example and how it's gonna figure out
the factorial let's go make that a
little KC or lowercase e is it's gonna
take three and multiply Amazon two which
is going to multiply times one and
that's how we're going to get our
factorial and how we're gonna do that is
we're going to use a recursive method to
get it so I'm gonna create a function
that is going to be called factorial
it's going to return an int and it's
going to return or receive a number that
it is going to perform some calculations
on so let's go down here and let's go
and create that and it's gonna be pretty
simple
so what it's gonna do is it's gonna
receive a number and here is going to be
the condition in which I am going to end
calling the function again so I'm going
to say if the number that comes in here
is equal to one well in that situation
I'm going to return one say that's a
situation in which we're no longer going
to call our function then what we're
gonna do is I'm gonna go int result is
equal to number x and I'm gonna call the
factorial function again see there's a
function calling itself so we'll go
number and minus one and there it is so
that might look a little bit confusing I
just know I all right so let's move that
down there mohnish let's move this out
of the way all right so that's better so
let's go like this and like that okay so
looks a little bit weird because it is
calling itself and then we're going to
go and get the result and we will return
the result from the function so
basically the way this function is
operating is the very
first time through let's say we give a
value of three is passed inside of it
what's gonna happen is we're gonna go
and get three times and we're gonna go
factorial is going to be equal to we're
gonna factorial and then it's gonna be
two is going to be the change say we
took number minus one okay so that's the
first time through what happens with
this factorial that comes down here well
that's the second time through and in
this situation it's gonna be two times
and once again it's gonna be factorial
and in this situation it's gonna be one
this time then we're gonna come down and
the next way through here is we're going
to have a value of one well what happens
when we have a value of one well you can
see right here that ends calling the
factorial function over and over again
so it's gonna return a value of one so
what it's gonna do is it's gonna return
one and that means that this is gonna
replace this so this is going to become
one and then this is gonna replace this
and that means that this is going to
become two and then you get a final
value equal to six alright so that's how
recursion works it always works that way
you have an exit parameter and then you
just call the function over and over
again I'm gonna give you another example
using Fibonacci numbers here in a minute
but let's come in here and let's
actually call this so I'm gonna go
standard and print this out and I'll
just use the exact example that I just
had factorial is equal to three and then
we can call factorial is equal to three
and I'll put this on the screen so that
we can see that it indeed works and if
we run it you can see factorial comes
back as six
just as I demonstrated in the example
and of course we can change this to
whatever we want let's change it to six
change this to six and you can see it
comes out to 720 so factorials get big
very very quickly and there you go that
is the first example of recursion
there's gonna be another example of
recursion if you have any problems just
make sure you've included all the
different different libraries that I
have imported here and you should have
no problems and now that I have that
setup that brings us to our very first
problem of the day alright so what I
want you to do is I want you to figure
out on your own how to do what I
mentioned previously which one
is to print an array horizontally on a
screen and what I want it to look like
is that I want it to look nice and neat
and to be displayed on the screen I'm
gonna grab this so there's no deforming
of this and there we go okay so your job
is to have an array this top row is
gonna be the indexes for our right and
then this is going to be nice and neatly
going to be all of the different values
stored inside of our array and I've
taught you everything you need to do
this and you can pause your screen right
now to go and create that otherwise I'm
going to create it right now or you can
get a little bit of a hint here I want
to show you what I'm gonna put in the
main function okay so basically the main
function is just going to be the
creation of a vector and there that is
go the vak is equal to and this is why
you need the C++ version 14 version is
the creation so I'm going to go 10 and
throw some just random old values inside
of here and 9 and 11 and 6 and 14 it
doesn't matter
there we go got all those in there so
that's created a vector with a whole
bunch of values and then you're gonna
create a function called print
horizontal vector and pass in the vector
and that's gonna give you a lot of
practice and a whole bunch of different
things so now you can pause your video
and try to make it on your own
okay what we're gonna do is we're gonna
define our function here or function
prototype and it's gonna be present
horizontal vector and it's going to
receive a vector that's gonna be passed
inside and it's going to be an integer
and it's more specifically going to be a
reference to the original vector so we
don't have to recreate that so there you
go there is the prototype so let's get
this and let's print this down here and
let's go and steal this so that we can
have it down here by our function so we
can actually see what we are trying to
make it's just a matter of breaking
everything down into steps
all right so throw this here throw our
curly brackets inside of here all right
so what are the very first thing we're
gonna need to do well we are going to
need to draw
in these dashes so how many dashes do we
have here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 18 total
dashes all right so what does that tell
us well we have three items inside of
our vector and that is 18 so that is
telling me that the number of dashes
maybe is going to be based off of what
the size of the vector x sex because
that sort of makes sense so I'm gonna go
and get dashes is going to be equal to
and I can go the Veck maybe if it was
something different you might have to do
something like a sealing with the vector
it's up to you you know if it didn't
come out from just a raw integer you
know non floating type number but I'm
gonna do it this way just in case we
decide that we want to change it all
right so there you go there's your
dashes what are we gonna have to do then
well we're gonna have to print the
dashes out on the screen so I'm just
gonna go create a simple for loop inside
of here and go and print those on our
screen so while n is less than the total
number of dashes that we have I am going
to continue to print out this
information so I'll just go standard see
out and then you know this is just going
to be dashes that's it all right so
after it prints all of the dashes then
what I'm gonna need to do is do a new
line so do a new line inside of here and
there we go all right so I got all those
done now what do I need to do well I
want to place these values inside here
but you may have noticed that there's a
space right here and then a zero and
then you can see a 10 so I need to line
those up properly so that they look nice
inside of here well if I want formatting
what do I have to do printf so I'm gonna
go and get all the different values
inside of our vector
I'm just leave this be n and while N is
less than the vector and if you don't
get this don't you know worry about it
as I've said the goal here is just to
get your brain to work in different ways
challenge your brain
than to also understand how I got my
results so what did I did well I'm gonna
need one of these dashes like that and
then after this what am I gonna need to
do I'm gonna play it like one space
inside of there and then I'm gonna put
some space inside of here to accommodate
two spaces whether they are there or not
and then I'm gonna put in another space
and then I am going to go and put in
inside of there all right so that's
gonna print that out and then I can just
go and print a new line plus I might
have to do a closing brace so we'll go
through here and do all those and that
and then a new line okay so that's all
I'm gonna need to do to make all of
those work then what do I need to do
well I need to do these dashes again
well we can just come in here and just
copy this because there are exactly the
same dashes as we have on the bottom so
let's go and throw those inside of there
and then for the very next line I'm
going to need to go and get all of the
vector values or actually those are the
indexes and I need to get the vector
values in this situation so I can go and
copy this and pretty much do exactly the
same thing once again so let's go like
this and the only difference is I'm
going to go the vector and throw an
inside of there and then guess what then
I have the dashes again and then I'm
done okay so good stuff not that
complicated of a problem and I think I
have all those set up properly and I
have this set up properly let's go get
this and you can pause the video if
anytime I'm going a little bit too fast
so you can run it and I'm tweaking them
over here and you can see there's a
little bit of distortion because the
vector so huge maybe we want to go and
actually shrink that down let's go run
it again and hmm see that went a little
bit too far wonder why that is
let's come down here and let's try
playing around with this a little bit
let's go get rid of this because I don't
really think I need it and let's try
changing this to five instead all right
got everything saved and you can see
that now it lines up perfectly alright
so pretty good stuff and there's an
example of how we can automatically
generate a horizontal vector on the
screen and make it look nice and neat
just a silly little problem but
problem nonetheless and now what I want
to do is show you how to jump generate
at Fibonacci numbers actually I think
you should do it so what I'm gonna do is
have this be a problem once again and
how Fibonacci numbers work is basically
they're gonna use recursion to generate
results with like such so if you have a
function called fib and you receive a
value of zero into it it's going to
return a value of zero then you're going
to have this is gonna continue on and on
and on if you have a value of one in
that situation it's going to return a
value of one and then the very next
value that is going to go inside of here
is going to be an addition of this Plus
this so we're gonna come in and we're
gonna copy this continue going on here
paste those inside of there so two is
gonna be whatever the two previous
numbers were added together so of course
that's going to be one and three is
going to be equal to the two previous
numbers there which is going to be two
and so forth and so on
so your goal is to create a function
that you're gonna receive one of these
values and it's gonna spit out the
proper value and of course you're gonna
use recursion to do so so what I'm gonna
do is I'm going to show you what the
main function codes gonna look like and
then I'll leave you to figure it out so
we're gonna have int which is gonna be
index sounds then what we're gonna do is
go standard and print this out so the
user is going to get this message
favorite nachi index and they're gonna
enter the index and then you're going to
of course receive that index value and
store it inside of index and then you're
gonna use print F to output
fib like this I guess it'll be uppercase
fib and then whatever the value is that
the user said they wanted and then it's
gonna be equal to and then you're gonna
output whatever the result was and of
course it's gonna be index
then fib and whatever the index is and
there that is and that's that okay so
now is your job to pause the video and
go and create fib alright so what it's
gonna do let's go get our prototype here
and receive ants index and then we're
gonna create this very few lines of code
needed to come in here and get this to
execute basically you're going to come
in and have your exit scenario so if
index is less than two well in that
situation you're just gonna return
whatever the index value is say we're
not calling the fib function else we are
going return whatever fib is and index
minus 1 plus and call fib again and
index minus 2 and that is how you're
going to calculate all those so we can
go in here and we can run it they'll say
get fibonacci index and I'll say 3 and
you can see the two comes back just as
we expected and we can run it again and
we could say 18 doesn't matter and you
can see that we get 2584 okay so there
you go hopefully you got that right and
if not don't worry about it and now I'm
gonna talk about how we can overload
functions okay so in C++ an overloaded
function is just going to have there
gonna be a bunch of functions that have
the same function name and the same
return type but they have to have
different parameters and I don't mean by
name I mean the parameter value is
actually or the datatypes gonna have to
be different so let's say we wanted to
create an area function that is gonna
work for both circles as well as
rectangles how would we do that and I'm
also gonna cover the switch statement
which somehow slipped through and I
never covered the switch statement so
I'll cover that also alright so by the
end of this tutorial series I will have
covered everything pretty much
imaginable about C++ so if you actually
want to learn C++ you are in the right
place
I'm gonna teach you not only the syntax
of C++ but I'm gonna teach you actually
how
program which i think is kind of useful
all right so there you can see we have
double these things have to be different
so we have a different number of
parameters or attributes assigned to
them okay if I instead just had height
like this that would not work because
you have to have two different data
types okay so there we are so now what
we need to do is go and define how these
operate so let's just come in here and
do radius and how do we do radius well
we're just gonna go return and do one
four one five nine times standard and
you remember how to get the power of a
value it's going to be pal just make
sure you have see math here whatever you
do that any radius and you're gonna pass
in two okay so there we go
we created that and now we're gonna have
to do the same thing for our rectangular
calculations and for homework maybe you
go in here and try to figure out how to
create area for finding areas of
trapezoids about that sounds like fun
work okay so we're gonna go return in
this situation it's just gonna be height
times width all right so there we go we
defined our two functions and here's a
switch statement well first off I'm
gonna go see out and I'm gonna ask the
user to area for our circle and woops so
they're gonna enter C for circle or if
they want to get the area of a rectangle
they're gonna enter our all right not
exactly the best the clearest interface
here but it's good enough for our
purposes right now and we're gonna store
that so that's going to be area type and
then I'm gonna go of course get whatever
they input inside of here so that's
gonna be stored in area type and then
here's a switch statement a switch
statements going to be used anytime you
want to perform different actions on a
limited number of conditions so the
conditions are going to be the N or a C
we do one thing then or an or we do one
thing if they enter neither we print out
an error message okay so we'll have case
they enter and make sure you use single
quotes here if they entered a C and then
you're gonna put a colon inside of here
then you're gonna perform certain
actions you're gonna go and you're gonna
do a our ask the user to enter the
radius we could have put this in our
function down below but I wanted to use
a switch statement because of haven't
done that and then we're gonna go and
store our radius and so we'll get our
this store in our radius variable and
then we can go and call for that to
execute so we'll go area is equal to
then call our area function that we
created down here and pass in the value
for radius and side of it and there we
go alright you know what you're gonna
need to do is go break what that's gonna
do is it's gonna break out of the whole
switch statement and stop checking other
things but we have another condition we
have the condition if they typed in an R
well in that situation we're gonna
change this to R let's move this up here
a little bit so you can see it better so
we're gonna say if they entered our well
we're gonna say enter height and store
that and something called height and
we're also gonna have width so let's go
and create that as well and then we're
gonna store this and the height function
and then we're gonna go get this guy's
well and paste that here and then we'll
go and store this as well paste that
there and this is gonna be width and
then this is gonna be width and there we
go an area is gonna be equal we could
keep this called
area and we're gonna go height and width
and that's going to automatically work
for us and then if they don't enter in a
seorin are in that situation we have to
give them an error message and we're
gonna call default is gonna be what is
called if neither of the other
conditions above are true so we'll go
default and in the situation which they
don't enter what we want them to enter
we're going to say please enter C or R
and this could be put into a loop
structure so it continues asking them
like this is good enough let's run it
and see if it works and you can see over
here that it says area circle or
rectangle let's say we do a circle and
then we do something like 0.5 and you
can see it did that calculation for us
and we can do formatting if we wanted to
have less or more decimal places and
rectangle and we could have 10 and 10
can there you can see that works and we
can run it again anyway we could type in
G and it's gonna say please enter C
you're wrong okay there you go guys
there is more
information about c++ hope you enjoyed
that and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
