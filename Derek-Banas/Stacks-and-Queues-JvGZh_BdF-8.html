3 of my java algorithms and data
structures tutorial today we're going to
talk about stacks and queues and in fact
not only we're going to talk about
queues we're going to talk about regular
queues and priority queues now the data
structures that you're used to using
like arrays and linked lists and trees
and so forth and so on are best used to
represent real objects stacks and queues
however are instead used to complete a
task there like a programmers tool that
is used and then soon after discarded
and the difference between a stack and a
queue is a stack is going to allow
access to just one item being the last
item put into the stack and you can
think about this in regards to an array
so the last item put into the array is
going to be the first item pulled out if
it is used as a stack a queue on the
other hand is going to provide access
also to just one item however the first
item put in is going to be the first
item pulled out like I said stacks and
queues allow only a single item to be
added or removed at any one time so that
makes them very very fast so we have a
lot to do so let's get into it and a
link to all the previous tutorials in
this series is available in the upper
right hand corner you should watch those
first or you will be confused and of
course all the code in this tutorial is
available link underneath the video in
the description now the first thing I'm
going to create here is a stack and like
I said before I'm going to represent
this as if it is an array only so I can
show you how it will build itself
interactively over in the right-hand
side of the screen and this stack array
is going to hold all of the values that
are thrown on the stack now there are
different things you need to monitor if
you're using a stack versus a queue
stacks a little bit simpler we're going
to have to monitor the stack size which
is going to be the size of the array and
I am going to also monitor top of stack
because remember with a stack it's last
in first out so we want to know what
that's going to be and I'm going to set
that to negative 1
which is going to symbolize later on
that it is empty then after we have that
all set up I'm going to construct the
stack and it's going to get past the
size that it should be and we're going
to just have stack size set which is
just going to be the size of the array
stack array and we have to create the
array there that is and then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to fill the
array with a bunch of negative numbers
and I'm going to do so so that whenever
I'm displaying what a stack looks like
on the right side of the screen it's
going to ignore anything that has a
negative 1 inside of it and of course
have that B stack array and this little
tool is going to require me to get a
library so I'm going to get it and there
it is and that is all I need to do there
now with a stack if you want to put an
item on to the stack you are going to
push it on that is what it's called and
I'm going to push on a string onto the
stack then what I'm going to need to do
is go top of stack plus 1 before I go
and put something on there I have to
make sure I have enough room inside of
my array and that's what that's doing if
I do I'm going to say that the top of
the stack is one part bigger so that I
can access this data later and then I'm
going to add whatever item was passed
over into my array where my stack else
if I do not have enough room I'm going
to want to say that I don't have enough
room and then I'm going to display what
the stack looks like on the screen like
I did in last tutorial so you can follow
it along with what exactly is going on
in memory and then I'm also going to put
out another message here at the end and
it's just going to be input was added to
the stack so that we know exactly what's
going on and that is all that goes into
pushing information onto a stack now if
you want to get information off of a
stack and remove it that is called a pop
so if we want to pop the last item that
was added to our stack we're going to
first off say if top of stack is greater
than or equal to 0 and it's 0 because
it's an array that starts at the zero
index and here
I'm going to do display the stack again
I'm not going to get into what display
the stack does if you want to see it the
code wise anyway you can check that out
in the code provided and here we're
going to throw a note out what precisely
we popped off of our stack or removed
from the stack and again that's just
going to be there so that we know what's
going on with the stack doesn't really
have to be there now just like in memory
whenever you delete an item it's still
going to be there however it is just not
going to be available so to simulate
that I'm going to go to top of stack and
make it equal to negative one remember I
have this program set up to ignore
everything that has a value of negative
one and then I'm going to return off of
stack and decrement top of stack at the
same time and then I'm going to go and
handle the situation where the stack is
empty and I'm just going to say display
the stack I think that's where I want
that to go and then I'm going to say
sorry but the stack is empty if they're
trying to get something that doesn't
exist and then I could do a return
negative one or whatever doesn't really
matter and that is how we pop
information off of a stack now if we
want to peek which is to see what's at
the top of the stack but not remove it
pretty easy extremely easy actually
I'm gonna call display the stack again I
think I don't know and then I'm going to
say that I peaked and I'm going to say
stack ray top of stack is at the top of
the stack and then throw a new line in
there and then this guy is going to
return stack array right like that and
that is pretty much all we need to do
I'm going to show you a couple other
different things but I'm going to jump
down into main and do some tests here so
you can see exactly what a stack looks
like as we're using it so in this
situation if I want to make a new stack
I'm gonna go to the stack and I'm just
going to call it the stack is equal to
new the stack and I'm going to say that
I want it to have 10 spaces available
for me to enter information and if I
want to push information into my stack
I'm just going to do it this way and if
I execute that you can see right here
here is the stack there's 10 spaces and
I pushed a 10 on to the stack so you
push 10
added to the stack and if I want to push
another item onto my stack let's say 15
you can see 15 was added right next to
it and also we printed out another
message now if I want to pop the items
on a stack actually its first peek at
the stack see what's on there and it's
going to return just the 15 because
remember this is last in first out this
is the first in that's the second and if
I want to pop or remove an item I don't
have to tell it what item because there
is only one item it can remove and 15
was removed from the stack I'm actually
going to say because that didn't come
out I'm gonna say display the stack
afterwards and you can see 15 was
removed now if I want to do some other
things this isn't more that is basically
a stack right there what I just showed
you but if I want to just mess around
and create a couple other different
methods just we can look at a stack I
could set this up to push a whole bunch
of things at once a bunch of values and
let's say that it gets so string
multiple values is going to be its name
and I'm going to create a string array
which is going to be temp string and
then do a split to split everything
wherever there's a space into the
different parts of the array and then I
could cycle through all of these and go
in size to 0 I less than temp string and
get the length out of that and then if I
want to push them on there do that
individually temp string and whatever
lays inside of the array because we can
only work with one value at a time then
I could jump down here again and the
stack do a push many and let's say we do
a 12 13 14 15 like that and you can see
it added a whole bunch of different
numbers so first we added the 10 and the
15 and then we removed the 15 and then
we added the 12 and the 13 and the 14
and the 15 so that's how we would push a
whole bunch of things here at once and
then I could also just for the heck of
it do a pop all and we're just going to
throw a for loop in there top of stack
greater than or equal to zero and we can
decrement it walk our way through the
stack and pop as we go and I'm just
going to call pop to do that and then
bounce down inside of main and do a pop
all and it
you and you can see that stack is empty
at the bottom of our screen there's a
whole bunch of different things you can
do with stacks I also did a couple other
things that are available in the code if
you want to look into it further but
that is the basic so let's take a look
at queues okay with a queue like I said
before queues are going to allow you to
access the first item inserted instead
of the last one which you had with a
stack and a queue is going to require a
whole bunch of different things than a
stack but it's also going to have many
of the same things and we're going to
have an array in this situation we're
also going to monitor the size of our
queue and here is the thing that's going
to be different we are also going to
monitor the front remember we're going
to be point for information from the
front of the queue we're also going to
be monitoring the rear or the end of the
queue and of course we're going to be
monitoring the number of items all of
which are going to be set to zero
whenever we first start out then going
to construct our queue classes set to
size equal to it whatever the size is
that they want it to be and as this
tutorial series continues I'm going to
show you a lot of neat things you can do
with stacks and queues but I didn't want
to cover too many things in this
tutorial and probably covering well over
enough as it is I'm going to fill the
queue again with negative ones so that
they will not show on our screen
whenever we print stuff like you see on
the right hand side and then with a
queue instead of pushing we say what
makes a little bit more sense which is
inserting and there's other things
people say but insert works for me all
right so if we're going to insert
something we want to go number all items
plus one because we're going to be
adding a new one we want to make sure
that's less than or equal to whatever
the value for the queue size is and if
it is we're going to say queue array
rear which is where we're going to be
putting all of our new information and
we're going to be pulling from the front
and then I'm going to increment rear the
value for rear so we can keep increasing
the size of this array I'm also going to
of course increment the number of items
because there's more and then I'm also
going to put a little message on the
screen that something happened
obviously you don't need that but
definitely helps with learning what's
going on and I'll throw a new line at
the end then I'm going to say else well
we've obviously had a problem and I want
to say sorry but the queue is full and
I'm going to show you a priority queue
here in a minute which we're going to
what's really going to be different is
the insert part a priority queue is
going to insert all of the information
in a specific way but of course we're
going to have to provide a way for us to
remove items but before we do that we
want to check that the number of items
is greater than zero otherwise it won't
be anything to remove and we'll get
errors and if we get this far we know
we're about ready to remove something so
I'm going to say front which is where
we're going to be removing information
from and in a second you're gonna see
where the front is and where the rear is
it's going to be much more
understandable and like before I'm
simulating kind of like what it is like
in memory where an item is deleted it is
just simply not accessible it's not
literally deleted normally anyway until
it's overwritten later on of items
decrement that else well we know we got
a problem here
and that problem is going to require us
to say sorry but the queue in this
situation is empty and then while I'm at
it I might as well also cover peak and
it's just going to say the first element
is it's amazing how quickly I can type
queue and print that out on the screen
and now we can come down inside of Main
and start making some queues let's go
thaw q is equal to new queue and once
again let's say we want it to be 10
spaces in size if we want to insert them
say we want to put a 10 inside of there
and let's throw a couple other different
things in here say a 15 and a 11 say
display the queue and execute it and
you're going to see right there
insert 10 was added to 10 was added to
the queue 15 was out of the queue 11 was
added to the queue and you can see here
we're front is that means whenever we do
a remove that's going to disappear and
you can also see where the rear is so
let's take a look at what happens
whenever we do call for remove execute
you may be surprised by the fact that
10 is technically still here but we can
access it because it's not there it's no
longer in our queue and this is now the
front of our queue and this is still the
rear of our queue we could also do a
peek which is going to do exactly what
you think it's going to do which is
basically just spit out the first
element is 15 and we could continue to
remove these items over and over and
over again execute and now you see the
front is the same as the rear and that
is how a queue works now to throw a
little bit more into it let's look at
what a priority queue does I'm going to
go public void and I'm just going to
call this priority insert and what's
going to be different about this is this
is going to add items in order from high
to low as they are inputted and I'm
going to have to initialize I outside of
this then before I put anything into it
I'm going to go number of items equal to
0 if that's going to be true well then
I'm just going to let input do its job
because there's nothing really different
so there that goes so the regular input
will be used in that situation else I
need to enter everything again like I
said from high to low well to do that
I'm going to take a is equal to number
of items minus 1 greater than or equal
to 0 I'm going to start at the top of
the array or the star or the top of the
queue and decrement my way down through
and then I'm going to say if I need to
do this because these are set up as
strings if they were set up as integers
wouldn't have to do it I'm going to
convert my input that was sent to me to
an integer and then do pretty much the
same exact thing here for the value that
is inside of the queue already cue array
put I inside of there so if the new
input is greater than the input that is
in the array that I'm testing right now
I need to copy that value further up
into the array because it's going to be
moved and in that situation I'm going to
break out of this because that means I'm
going to be done shifting items in my
queue after I shift that one and then I
can go cue array I plus 1 is equal to
whatever the input is and then after
that of course I'm going to need to
increment rear
because they got more information in
there than before and then also
increment number of items because I just
inserted a new one let's go back down
into Main and see what that looks like
so let's just change these into
priorities priority insert and let's say
10 because remember it's going to sort
them from highest to lowest and we'll
mess this up on purpose just to show
that indeed it is putting them in proper
order and if we file save it and execute
you can see the difference between the
priority queue it's going to put
everything in proper order just like
that and then delete them just like a
regular queue so that is pretty much
everything you could need to know at
this point about stacks queues and
priority queues please leave any
questions or comments below the last
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
