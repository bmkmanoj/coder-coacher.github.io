tutorial on how to install the Android
development tools that we will be using
in my upcoming Android development
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
install the Android development tools
not only on a PC but also on a Mac
all-in-one tutorial so we have a lot to
do so let's get into it okay
probably most of the reasons why you
might be having trouble installing the
Android SDK is because you're trying to
use this right here for some reason it
is quite buggy so instead what we're
going to do is install the Android
developer tools plugin for Eclipse which
is in essence exactly the same thing now
to do this you're going to need Eclipse
Indigo not Juneau so just go into Google
type in Eclipse into go and go get it
and here it is and this is the specific
version you're going to want Eclipse IDE
for Java developers and I provide a link
in the upper right hand corner on how to
install Eclipse if you don't already
have Eclipse installed now on to how to
install the plug-in I'm going to bounce
over into Windows right now and briefly
I want to show you one thing that can
cause havoc for you if you go into your
computer you want to make sure that you
have Eclipse installed and I'm just
bouncing through here real quick in a
directory here is Eclipse right here you
want to make sure that eclipse is
installed and let's go down to
properties in a directory that does not
have any spaces inside of it and as you
can see users Derik documents I have it
stored in My Documents folder if in this
path you have spaces anywhere that is
going to cause havoc so make sure you
install it in a directory that doesn't
have spaces if you follow the tutorial I
previously mentioned you will not have
that problem so now into eclipse and
remember we want to use indigo and we're
going to go into help and we're going to
do exactly the same thing on a PC as
well as a Mac the only reason why I'm
focusing on a PC right now is there are
a couple more issues installing with
Windows than there is with Mac's so you
want to click on help and then go
install new software then you're going
to see available software pop up and
right here you can see work with and
here
to click on add and you're going to type
in something that makes sense for this
like Android developer tools and then
inside of here let's zoom in you're
going to put an S after that then you're
going to type in DL and I have a link
underneath the video that has all this
typed out for you so you don't have to
worry about messing it up I'm going to
go google.com so it's DL ssl.com forward
slash Android forward slash Eclipse and
after you do that hit OK then underneath
here you're gonna see developer tools
and NDK plugins let's just select both
of those bounced down here and hit next
then this guy's going to pop up on your
screen again just hit next then you're
going to have to come down here and
accept the terms of the license
agreements again this is exactly the
same on Macs and PCs and it's going to
install your software if you get any
type of warning or whatever just hit OK
and then it's going to say you need to
restart eclipse so just click restart
now again same thing on PCs and Macs and
as you can see I'm using eclipse indigo
here it's very important you know is
still very buggy for some unknown reason
and then you're gonna have to have a
workspace set up and hit OK and then
everything opens up and here's a welcome
screen let's just get rid of that and
now you know you have the Android
development kit set up because you have
these little Android icons up here so
everything's all set up and people ask
me all the time how do you get package
Explorer to open up you're just going to
go into window show view package
Explorer click on that that's how you
open up package Explorer then if we want
to come in here and create a new project
we're just going to go up the file a
couple different ways of doing this
let's go new come over here you may have
to scroll way down here to click on
other and then this little wizard pops
up here on your screen and then we'll
click on Android and Android application
project and double click on that after
you use this a couple times you won't
have to type that in every single time
or go through the other part then we're
going to give the application a name so
I'm going to keep this very simple I'm
just going to call it hello world and
then down here under package name you
should probably put in a web address
that you own so I'm going to type into
think-tank there we go and then here
what we're doing is defining the verge
of the Android SDK that we plan on
developing with and whether they are
very restrictive or not that will just
limit the number of different devices
that this will work on then after we
have that set up we just click on next
and then you're pretty much going to
click on next for everything else here
later on we'll get into more complicated
applications so just keep on clicking on
next we're going to leave this set up as
blank activity click on next this is
going to be main activity which you're
going to see here in a second and click
finish again exactly the same thing done
whether you're on a Mac or a PC I'm
going to get to the part here in a
second that is different with a Mac and
a PC okay so we have hello world opened
up here on our left side of our screen
and activity main that was the guy that
I said you're going to see here in a
second now this is one of the bugs that
occurs all the time for people we're
going to go in and we're going to select
activity main and I'm just going to put
my cursor inside here this happens all
the time
very common error now what I'm going to
do is set up an Android virtual device
and to do that I'm just going to click
on Android virtual device managers
little guy up here and you can see that
it opens up and I actually have a device
inside of there for some odd reason then
what we're going to need to do is let's
just imagine this isn't even here
actually it's make it go away so let's
just click on delete ok so there's
nothing set up well you can click over
in device definitions you're going to
see a whole bunch of different Android
devices listed some of them are very
specific and other ones are quite
generic so if we want to start working
with one of these guys can either select
that or we can just go into Android
virtual devices like we have right here
click on new and you're going to see one
of the errors that occurs with PCs but
does not occur with Mac's so I'm going
to type in my nexus 7 and I'm going to
click on this and just select Nexus 7
and target API and sometimes what you're
going to see here under CPU is that this
does not have an option which is not
going to allow you to set up your device
we're going to hit OK and everything
worked but let's act like it didn't how
we're going to fix that
remember I've set this up on numerous
different OSS this is how to fix that if
you get an error there
going to click on window and we're going
to come down into Android SDK manager
now if you click on this inside of a
Windows version of Eclipse you're going
to see a completely different version
here is the Android STK manager as you
can see here there's a ton of different
things inside of it and if you get that
error that I previously talked about the
reason why is MIPS system image is not
installed so we would just want to
select that and then here it's going to
say delete because its installed
but we're going to select it and hit
install packages and that is going to
get rid of a system image error and if
you get any other types of system image
errors remember on the previous screen
when we were trying to setup our virtual
emulated device just select all these
different system images and that error
will go away we don't have that problem
so let's look at what that looks like
over on a Mac just to show you so we'll
go into window again Android SDK manager
and you're going to see that it looks
completely different I have no idea why
there you go you can see that there's a
lot less different packages there and I
have all of them installed in this
situation so that's a difference between
Macs and PCs well now we're back into
the PC world so we're going to come back
up here Android virtual device again
same thing Mac PC I'm going to see if I
can cause an error I'm going to hit
start and I'm going to click on launch
now this thing is slow as death it's
unbelievable of how slow this is and of
course later on we're going to get into
how to actually run these applications
on our own devices and you're going to
see it brings up a nexus 7 tablet
emulator and you're going to see how
slow it is doesn't look like I caused
the air that I was trying to force
myself to cause the error that occurs
sometimes is under layout right here
well we have activity main if the error
occurs you're also going to see in the
layout folder another file and it's
going to be called activity main dot out
dot XML if you see that then what you're
going to need to do and let's just wait
for the emulator to continue executing
here for a second and I'm going
now as you can see it's terribly slow a
lot of times people get frustrated and
just give up another fun thing that
happens is sometimes whenever you run
the emulator for the first and even the
second time it crashes both times but I
have never seen it crash a third time so
unless the crash is a third time
don't worry about it everything's still
working the way it should and after you
run it two or three times it works
without crashing thereafter so that's
good and yes it does crash on both a Mac
and a PC that's not something that's
different and there you can see the
emulators finally starting to work
terribly slow literally the first time
you execute it takes minutes and it's
going to bring up this which means that
it's more than likely going to crash
just understand the half trick crashes
the first time sometimes the second time
it does work so just hang in there for a
second and it looks like it crashed the
very first time so I'm just going to
select it again
and I'm gonna hit start again and launch
and there it goes a little bit snappier
this time and there we go this time it
looks like it's gonna work so we're just
gonna open up this guy and finally after
executing that three times you're going
to see hello pearl
print it out on your screen if you
really are serious about doing Android
development you're going to want to get
yourself some sort of Android device but
yes indeed it does work because the
emulators are so slow now actually I'm
going to jump over in the Mac again same
as a PC and get into what I said before
if you do get a weird error and nothing
executes chances are what it is like I
said before is you're going to have
inside of layout which is inside of the
res folder or the resources folder a
file called activity underscore main dot
out dot XML if that happens just select
the dot out dot XML file and delete it
and then what you're going to want to do
is go into project up here and click on
clean after you do that then you want to
re-execute it by going up here either
and clicking on this little guy to open
up the different list of emulators or
you want to come over to hello world or
whatever the name of your thing is come
down here and then go run as Android
application now as per what all of these
different files do I'll get into later
on in the tutorial but activity main
that
right here just to give you a brief
overview what it's going to do is define
the UI layout in XML and the reason why
it's going to do this is it's going to
separate the application part of your
application from the user interface and
we're going to want to do this because
of course Android runs on 50 million
different devices and by defining our
layout inside of XML this is just going
to make it very easy for us to include
many different layouts that are
optimized for all those different
devices so that's what activity main is
and the other guy you're going to see
all the time here is under source click
on that and then click on whatever your
name of this guy is and
mainactivity.java and what main activity
dot Java does for you is basically just
override the oncreate method which you
can see right here and it's going to
call set content of view which is going
to layout your UI and in general all of
the different resources for all of your
application is going to be found in the
res folder right here and that is
basically how to set up Android on a Mac
and a PC please leave any questions or
comments below and I'll provide a link
to the Android development tutorial as
soon as it is done till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
