7 of my how to code PHP tutorial today
I'm going to cover how you would create
a new user registration script in this
tutorial I'll take you line by line
through how you would create a user
registration PHP script you should
definitely watch my PHP tutorial from
the beginning before you try to
understand this if you like tutorials
like this comment below and I'll make
more this is the code that will execute
when the new user types in all of their
information and clicks on submit first
we're checking if the submit button has
been pressed with the e or e GI function
we are performing a regular expression
test this test is extremely simple in
that it will accept a first name if it
is made up of any letters periods quotes
or hyphens as long as it is 2 to 15
characters in length I prefer to do this
error checking with JavaScript so that
the visitor is immediately alerted of an
error instead of after they click Submit
but this is a PHP tutorial so this is
PHP the following blocks of code perform
the same actions as the one here so I'll
skip my description of those you can
also find my regular expressions
tutorial down below here we're checking
for an email address here we're checking
for street and you can see in the here
will basically accept anything in my
regular expressions tutorial I actually
use a lot more advanced regular
expressions but I'm just keeping this
real simple here we're checking if it's
a valid city has been entered checking
for a valid zip code checking for a
valid phone number and here you can see
an example of a more complicated regular
expression I do explain exactly
character for character what this guy
does in the regular expressions tutorial
here we're checking for a password and
match against the confirmed password if
all the information was entered
correctly we move on to entering the new
user into the database you see here how
to query the database with the query I'm
asking the database to return all user
IDs that match the email that was just
entered if you don't understand these
queries refer to MySQL tutorials see I
got everything covered
if the email has not been taken which we
find out with this
if statement we execute the code between
the curly braces create the activation
code by generating a random number with
R and making sure the number is unique
with uni Q ID and convert it into a 32
digit encrypted code with md5 we are
inserting the new user into the database
along with all their personal
information here and if the query worked
properly everything's great if not then
print out an error to the string and
here we're informing the user of the
result of that query and if everything
didn't run okay we explain to the new
user why we are unable to register them
and if one of the data tests fails we
inform the user to please try again and
finally we close the database connection
and the PHP code script and here is the
rest of the basic HTML formed
information I won't go over at all
because it should be pretty much
self-explanatory if you don't understand
it then please refer to my HTML tutorial
in part eight of my how to code PHP
tutorial I'm going to show you a sample
login script until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
