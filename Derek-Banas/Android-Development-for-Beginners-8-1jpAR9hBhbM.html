8 of my Android development for a
beginners tutorial today we're gonna
take all those images we drew in part 7
and create a toolbar and also talk about
how we can switch between different
screens inside of App Inventor we'll
have a lot to do so let's get into it
ok so here we are inside of Inkscape and
here are all the images we drew last
time now one thing I like to do is to go
in here and make sure that everything
that is here can be shown as a fill
instead of having strokes now we
selected our little cloud here and if we
come down here to the very bottom you
can see that it has a fill and a stroke
I'm gonna get rid of that and see if it
makes any noticeable differences so all
we got to do is come down here hold down
the shift key and click on X and that's
gonna get rid of the strokes as you can
see if you look down here see stroke
none now we have to make a judgment call
on whether we want to redraw these
raindrops or if we do not I don't really
see any problem with it so I think it
looks fine everything is a fill that's
gonna make our life much easier so I'm
gonna select it and then click on ctrl G
and that's gonna group it if we select
our little camera here and then we go
down to the bottom and look we can see
that we do not have any problems here so
we don't have to worry about that we can
select this guy as well come down here
you can see no problems no strokes
come on up here to our microphone and
see if we have any strokes yes we do
have a stroke let's click on the X with
shift go up here and make a judgement
call did that affect anything
dramatically I don't think so
hit ctrl G and come back over here get
this guy hit ctrl G these are all
grouped anyway ctrl G just to make sure
and then we look at this guy now this I
know has a stroke and a fill here you
can see right there and also I can see
that this guy here has a stroke with no
fill and then this is just a simple fill
so what I'm gonna do with this one first
is I'm going to convert it into a fill
how I'm gonna do that is to come up here
and I'm gonna go to path I'm gonna say
stroke to path which means it's gonna
have a fill we can check that by coming
down here say stroke none or if you
can't see that stroke none say you can
view these full screen these are HD
videos then we have to make a judgment
call on what we're gonna do
with the other notches that are strokes
and fills what I'm gonna decide to do is
redraw them so I'm gonna go into
rectangle and I'm just simply going to
redraw it click on the D for dropper
which is this where is it I use
shortcuts so much I forget where these
things are there it is click on that I'm
just gonna get rid of these so get rid
of that get rid of that delete them all
and then I'm gonna go in here and put
this into position and I think it's
gonna perfectly look okay hold down ctrl
and either alt or option and of course
select your object and hit space and
then drag down here and hit space again
and then we're gonna drag another one
out of here bring it over here want to
zoom in on it
get the little rotator things hold down
control spin this into position looks
good and move it out a little bit then
I'm gonna hold down on it ctrl alt or
option space drag it out of there drag
it over here and there we go and we can
verify that all we have now our fills by
coming down here and we see stroke not
okay great control G group everything
now we'll come over here to the old
YouTube logo select that and I can see
that I have a non for stroke and just
group that ctrl G there we go all right
so now just address these up a little
bit I want to change them from black and
I also want to put a little bit of a
shadow here and I'm mainly just doing
this just to do it but so if we can just
well since this group we can just select
it and then let's say that I want to
have an 80% gray on top and then a 50%
gray on the bottom of it to give sort of
the idea that it's a shadow well I'm
gonna first convert this to 50% gray so
I have everything selected and I can
come down here is this 50% gray let's
look yep okay selected that all right
great then I'm gonna hit ctrl C to copy
that and then I'm gonna go and do an
edit paste in place or ctrl alt V like
that I'm gonna move this guy up 3 1 2 3
1 2 3 and I'm gonna convert it to an 80%
gray on the top 8 percent correct and
there you can see it sort of gives a
hint now this is gonna be really shrunk
down on your device it's just gonna give
a hand
that there is a shadow on it to make it
look a little bit nicer so let's go do
the same thing here and also something
to remember is let's say that we wanted
to switch this like this object right
here we want it to go underneath go to
object and we can raise or lower these
guys and I have them set for f5 and f6
to raise and lower them let's do a lower
and there you can see now it went behind
and I'm gonna do an f6 and bring it back
because I think that looks ok all right
great
and one thing to note you do not need to
do a different image for whenever the
button is pressed on because App
Inventor automatically does that for you
it creates or handles that event for you
so let's go and get this guy again I'm
gonna convert it into a 50% gray there
we go and I'm gonna do a ctrl C and then
I'm going to do a ctrl alt or option V
paste it on top one two three one two
three I'm down here do an 80% gray and
there we go there we go we got them all
set up now what I'm gonna use is
Photoshop to edit these you could use
GIMP or whatever you are comfortable
with and I'm just gonna hold down shift
key and zoom out of this cause I'm gonna
select all of these at the same time
there we go and if we want to export all
of these images as a ping file we just
have to select all of them just like
that and then we're gonna go over here
to file and we're you know export bitmap
and it's gonna pop up all sorts of
information the only thing that's really
important is where you're going to store
it and I am going to call this let's
change this to App Inventor 8 folder and
I am going to call this ping App
Inventor icons alright that's good and
you can see right there that it's a ping
file and I'm gonna get rid of this 5
right there and I'm gonna say export and
it's going to show a little export
progress sign down here and now it's
done now I can go into Photoshop and do
the rest of what I need to do and here
we are inside a Photoshop and here you
can see I have all the images and I'm
just gonna select all of them and shrink
them down just a little bit because
there's a tendency to cut them all
just shrink those down and make sure
that everything fits inside of here it
doesn't really matter and then there we
are then I'm gonna come up here and I'm
gonna go file and new and I'm going to
create a 100 by 100 pixel transparent
background 100 and 100 and I don't know
I'll just set that for 150 and then I'm
gonna go okay and there you can see is
that little guy
now what I'm gonna do is go into each
individual one of these so let's just
select this and I'm gonna copy it and
then jump back over into this this guy
right here consumed in if we want and
just paste it inside of there
yep one thing that I might want to do
first before I do that doing this sort
of stream of consciousness is to go into
image and do image size like this and I
know that I'm shooting for 100 by 100
pixels so I'm gonna make my height on
this 100 and then go okay and now it's
gonna go in there and be pasted in a lot
more easily
let's go like this and let's copy that
and back over into our image and paste
it in there and you can say that went in
there pretty nicely now I'm just gonna
go file save as and then inside of this
guy I'm gonna call this weather icon and
it's a ping file and I'm gonna click on
save shut off as a coffee if you have
that checked and it's safe and after we
do that for all of those different
images feel free to rewind if you want
to watch that again but I don't want to
cover it multiple times I'm gonna go
into App Inventor I'm just gonna call
this my app 1 because it's gonna do a
whole bunch of different things and it's
just a generic name so I'm gonna go into
layout to make my toolbar and I'm gonna
get table arrangement and I have six
icons that I want to put in this guy so
I'm gonna come over here to columns and
put in 6 and then for rows I'm gonna put
in 1 and then for width I'm gonna make
this fill parent and click on OK and we
could come down here and rename this
toolbar if we'd like hit OK alright so
now we're going to set up everything as
buttons so just grab a button drag it
over here drop it inside of there and
then I have to decide on what I want to
do here image I'm gonna click on that
and I'm gonna say upload file
it's gonna open up a little window here
click on choose file and then inside of
this I'm just going to look for my
weather icon click on that and it goes
in there and then I'm just gonna click
on OK and it's gonna be really really
really big and I know what size it
should be but I'm gonna act like I don't
first I'm gonna go over here to text and
delete that and then for my width I'm
just gonna let this be automatic look
out of there then just to think about
what we're gonna need to do here with
this guy I like to use a default sort of
size and then later on go in and change
it if I want to so let's go in here and
look and see what the actual width of
this is gonna be so I'm just gonna get
myself a label drag it over here and
then in this label I'm gonna put the
screen width so let's jump over into
blocks and then let's go into screen and
then let's get windscreen is initialized
let's get that guy right there and then
we'll have the label and we'll set the
text for our label right like that -
whatever the screen width is so let's
get this screen and it's way down the
bottom let's scroll down and you can see
here screen width right there drag it up
here drop it in and that's gonna give us
our screen width and it's gonna display
it on the screen it's gonna give us sort
of a hint for what we should have our
starting pixels be for our little cloud
here and I'm gonna go in and do a I
companion and I'm gonna open this up on
my phone and we're gonna take a look at
exactly how big that area is ok and if
we run the application you're gonna see
right here right underneath our cloud
that it is 320 pixels wide and we went
and looked at that on the telephone we
saw that was 320 pixels so if we want to
open up a calculator and just do 320
divided by 6 which is a number of
buttons get 53 so what I'm gonna do here
is I'm gonna set this for let's say 48
pixels
and that's just a judgement call on my
end so I'm going to delete my label that
we have right here and I'm gonna come in
and I'm gonna select my little cloud
come down here and I'm gonna go width
and I'm gonna set it for 48 pixels hit
OK and set this for 48 pixels and hit OK
and there you can see that the cloud has
shrunk down now I'm gonna do the same
thing for all the other buttons so just
drag a button over get rid of this text
that's right here
on image I'm gonna upload a file come in
get that guy let's say we want the
camera icon for this click on OK
there's the camera I'm down here suck
the pixels for 48 ok and 48 click OK
and now the camera shrunk down now I'm
gonna go and do that for all the other
buttons then after I have them all in
there there you can see all of the
different buttons now what I'm gonna do
is show you how to switch between
different screens now if we want to add
a new screen we just come up here and
click on add screen and we want to give
it a name so let's call it something
like camera screens since the camera is
probably gonna be opened it okay and now
we are in the camera screen screen and
let's just do something really really
simple here let's get a button and let's
just call it go back which is gonna go
back to the original screen so go down
here go back right like that and then
jump into the block section and then
whenever that button is pressed on or
clicked we want it to jump back to the
original and to do that we go control
and then to return to the previous
screen I'm gonna have to come down here
I'm just gonna say closed screen which
is going to be the current screen or the
camera screen it's going to jump back in
to screen 1 then we can change to screen
1 and then let's say that we want to
have whenever they click on the camera
that it's gonna open up the camera
screen go back into blocks and this is
just called button 1 click go into
control open another screen and inside
of here call this camera screen drop it
in there
over into the designer and then we can
check it on our device okay so here's
the app now one problem though is if you
are using this application using the QR
code from App Inventor and then having a
transfer over here by scanning the QR
code it's not gonna work so I thought
I'd show you what happens just so you
don't get nervous if we click on the
camera it's gonna jump over into the
other screen however if you click on go
back it isn't gonna go back so that
means you're gonna have to go in and
build the application and email it to
yourself like I've covered previously
and here it is right there and of course
if I click on it it's going to download
and it is going to install if I click on
install and app is installed and I'm
gonna hit open and there is the
application and now you can see if I use
the builded or the built form I'm gonna
be able to go back and go forward just
like that and there you can see it
worked so that is how we are going to be
able to make toolbars and jump from one
screen to another please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
