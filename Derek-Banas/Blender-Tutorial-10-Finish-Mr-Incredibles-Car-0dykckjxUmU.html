my blender video tutorial in this part
of the tutorial we're gonna continue
drawing the mr. incredible car that I
started in part 9 if you didn't see part
9 definitely watch that otherwise you
will be confused and like always all the
images I refer to in this tutorial as
well as a cheat sheet is available in
the description underneath this video
and I have a lot to do so let's get into
it
okay so here we are once again with our
mr. Incredibles car or my version of it
now I'm gonna hit one here to see the
front face and control one see the rear
and three to see the side now what I
want to do is I want to come in here and
basically cover the outer edges and then
work my way in towards detail so I'm
gonna go in here for edge select first
and I'm an edit mode and just hit tab to
switch between different modes alright
so what I want to do here is if I want
to curve this shape here and curve this
shape I'm going to have to come in and
add in some more loop cuts now I could
very easily come in and do like
subdivides so let's go and let's look at
that option
alright so here we got that and then I
could just go subdivide subdivide but
you see all the horrible geometry that's
being created so I'm not gonna do it
that way okay so I am NOT going to use
subdivide I almost never use subdivide
so I'm gonna hit a and get rid of that
so I'm gonna to be able to properly
curve this I could do a bevel also but
the bevel is gonna create all kinds of
bad geometry also so what I've decided
to do instead is just do my own loop
cuts so I'm going to have a whole bunch
of loop cuts here and I'm going to do a
bunch of and I'm just I just left
clicked and left clicked again and then
I'm gonna a to deselect and I'm gonna do
some more loop cuts there's more so I'm
just putting in my own loop cuts here so
there's four of them and I might be over
doing this
I'm you know I'm just doing this out of
my head so I created those loop cuts
with ctrl R rolled my mouse middle mouse
button up to create a bunch of them and
I left clicked to seal them into place
and then I'm going to also I want to
create like this extruded apart right
here so that means I'm going to have to
create some more loop cuts so let's
control and our and if you move towards
the right it's going to go horizontal or
if you move towards the edge is gonna go
horizontal otherwise it's gonna be
vertical I want vertical so I'm going to
drag this over here to roughly that area
and then left-click and then deselect
and then so we're gonna be able to bevel
this guy right here
and then what I need to do and I also
have a loop cut there so I want to have
one more loop cut going right here in
the front and then we should all be
happy so let's go ctrl R and move
towards the edges to be able to create
that got it and I'm gonna move it into
place and I think that that's roughly
what I'm aiming for alright so now that
we have all that created what I want to
do is like I said I could have did a
bevel but it would have created bad
geometry I could have used subdivide but
that would have created bad geometry
what I'm gonna use instead is what's
called the proportional editing which is
this guy down here which you open up by
clicking on oh so I got all of this
selected and I want to sort of round
this out so I'm gonna go and do an edge
select and let's say I do an edge select
like right here
it's an edge selects let's do mmm okay
so edge select edge select let's grab
all of that and then I'm gonna round
that so I'm gonna go o for proportional
editing and then sometimes fear it works
fear works sometimes smooth works smooth
tends to work best for me however and
then I'm gonna get that like this and
then I'm just going to sort of smooth it
now when I press the left mouse button
down you're going to see that circle
shows up that circle is saying what what
parts of the geometry do you want to
affect some so holding down the left
mouse button and with my left hand I am
rolling the idea I could do it with my
middle finger also I'm covering what
geometry I want to affect so I'm going
to move this up you can see it's sort of
rounding out and then I'm gonna go this
way and this is giving me my rounded out
edges so kind of cool so that's roughly
what I'm shooting for
and then so see it's nice and curved
they don't want to curve it down some
more so that means I'm going to need
some more loop cuts up here so let's go
ctrl R and we are
and I'm not gonna move any of them I
don't think let's just go add in one
more loop cut yeah let's escape and undo
now let's do a to deselect and then do
another loop cut so ctrl R and I'm just
there we are
I think that's more than enough loop
cuts and then I'm going to maybe move it
over just a little bit to the right side
of the screen and drop that alright so
now I want to curve this up a little bit
also
so deselecting and then we'll sort of
maybe I want to grab this edge right
here to use this to prop this up a
little bit so I got edge select already
selected and I'm going to come in and
grab this guy this guy and all of these
other edges inside of here to make a
more smooth line and then I'm going to
proportional editing zhan smoothing Zahn
and I'm gonna move this up and you can
see what I'm effecting which is
everything inside of that circle I can
make it a little bit smaller I can make
it a little bit bigger and then I'm just
dragging that up to make it more rounded
okay good a deselect and then I can come
in and increase this for the hood scoop
or whatever the centre of the of the
hood
so um again I still have edge select on
there so I'm gonna get this hold down
the shift key to get the rest of these
edges and then I'm going to raise that
up so once again let's go one and
proportional editing well let's look at
it from the top so that I can see what
I'm affecting so proportional editing I
want it to be bigger on effect more area
not less
there you go so it's sort of raising up
the all of that area that's sort of
surrounded in there and if I had more
time I could fiddle with this and make
it absolutely perfect but I think you
can say it's see it's sort of curved
here and it goes down it goes back up
again alright it's a good stuff deselect
everything now what I can do is come in
and handle these bevel like the thing
that I want to you know the I don't know
what this is called this this extruded
metal chromed out part right there okay
that's what I'm gonna be extruding out
next so I'm gonna do face select down
here I know let's see if I can get it
all right so you got this one and I'm
going to right click on that and then I
want to get both of these so let's go
get all of these different faces inside
of here and then what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna extrude those out and then
resize them so we'll get our nice little
edges that's extruded out so my goal
with this tutorial is to be able to show
how to do a whole bunch of different
cuts and manipulations and shapes and
things like that it's not necessarily to
have the world's greatest color in the
end um because I don't work for Pixar
you might not have guessed that but so
here we are I'm going to get all of
these different guys okay got them all
those are all the edges that I want to
extrude up I'm gonna go extrude with E
I'm gonna hit enter and then I'm going
to scale and then I can scale them out
like this and let's go and decrease ah
you know what I'm not gonna do
proportional editing in this situation
let's escape out of that come down here
shut off proportional anything I could
do is go and click down there or I could
just go oh and it's off and when it's
off it's gray whenever it's not it's
purple here I'll do it or blue I guess
blue it's on now it's off alright I
don't want proportional editing this
time so let's go s for scaling these out
and then let's extrude them I already
hit efore extrude and now they're sort
of popping up and there we go
and I've clipping turned on so they will
just merge any place where there's
overlap there you go there is my thing
tons of of shapes inside of here which
you want to eliminate but like I said
I'm just trying to make this quick and
I'm not being too fiddly alright so the
next part I'm getting pretty close here
and getting things done I'd like to get
this grill taken care of so let's go and
let's take care of it so I got this line
right here
I want to let's just do another loop cut
move towards the right let's want it to
be like right there that's good
and then another loop cut down here and
let's out like this and then have it be
right there
and I wish I could use these more these
loop cuts more but kind of in a position
where I can't so back to the beginning I
hit one to get in here and control or go
towards this side if you want to do
horizontal loop cuts it's another one
right there so I got that one right
there and I get this one right here so
let's drop that in there so I can make
that space and that's based in that
space and one hold down the shift key I
can move everything around here just by
dragging and dropping inside of there
and then let's go and to try to avoid
doing numerous more loop cuts I'm going
to do right here come in on this side
and bring this up then have it be
roughly the same size as the bottom one
that I put inside there okay so I got
that in there now what I want to do is
do some face selects some come down here
and this is where i'm clicking on face
like I just like vertices select just so
you know okay so if I want to be able to
have this be straight in here so that I
can extrude out the girl part of it well
this is curved so what I want to do is I
want to go and eliminate that curve I've
talked about previously how to do that
in previous parts of jewelry so I'm
gonna go alt and right click and then we
go sz0 see everything's straight now
let's go back to one hopefully I didn't
mess up anything I don't believe I did
it let's look at what else we got here
we also got this guy let's go off let's
go a first deselect alt right-click and
sz0 there everything's fine and jump
back into one now I'm going to be able
to extrude this out by doing face select
and then I'm gonna go in here and select
all of these guys I'm holding down the
shift key and ellipse shift key and
right clicking to pick out everything
that I want to be able to select and you
know what let's shut this off I don't
went down here and selected this now
it's only going to show me the faces
that
right in front of me and nothing in but
that's behind so I don't accidentally
cause problems so I'm gonna go
right-click and select all these so I'm
selecting all of the places where the
grill is going to be extruded out and
got all of that in place and for the
inside of the grill I'm probably gonna
do a rounded it's rectangle I think it
calls it alright so I selected all those
and I can come down here and look at
this I know I can go extrude and enter
and then I want to scale on the that
would be the y-axis since this is green
so I'm gonna go scale Y and then let's
go and bring it out just a little bit no
very often that's not doing it why
didn't it do it I don't know let's
escape out of that I think yes right oh
let's go let's just do an extrude point
one there we are and then do enter there
we are now I know exactly what that is
so that's a point one extrusion so we go
in and we extruded that out is there
anything else I need to do here I got
that all fixed there in the front yeah
as well just finish the front so I'm
gonna go and I'm gonna create the
headlight next so I'm gonna first DISA
and I'll also create the blinker and
then I'll also create the inside of the
grill so let's go and create a sphere so
shift and a and rounded cube that's what
I'm gonna use I thought it was called
rounded rectangle UV sphere thought it
created and then let's go and turn it
into a a headlight so just drag that guy
out of there and I'm gonna go to the
three selection hold down shift key hold
down the middle mouse button and drag
this in here I'm gonna do vertices
selections first deselect and then B for
box select and go and draw that and then
do X to delete all the vertices and it
didn't delete all the other things what
all right let's give in here let's do it
again sometimes things don't work the
way you think they should okay oh I know
why because I this off down here say
silly me okay let's leave those on there
let's go like this deselect everything
with
and be and then let's grab everything
that and X and vertices and see there
now it works so I want to size it then
so I'm gonna go B for box select select
everything and this is gonna be scaled
down a lot so scale scale scale and that
looks like that's about right let's drag
it over here see if it lines up and
looks like it's about the right size and
it does and then let's go to front view
by pressing on one and let's go and drag
it whoops whoops little flip flip flip
flip flops
um let's turn off clipping and now let's
drag it over here that's all fine
alright so we got that I love when I
make mistakes in tutorials because that
means you will not make them later on
and then this doesn't line up perfectly
cause my drawings off not because of
anything else I'm gonna do a scale on
this to enlarge it and then left click
and there you go and when I did that
scale I wasn't holding down any mouse
buttons or anything sorry oh that's
perfect
in perfect position sorta hold down the
shift key middle mouse button drag it
into position and then drag it over here
until it is inside the car and go back
out to the one position and there we go
now we got a headlight and let's go and
to create the blinker we're gonna go1
again and I'm gonna go shift and
duplicate with D so shift D if I did alt
G then any material changes that I made
to either one of these would affect the
other one so that's a difference between
alt and shift D so let's put that down
there and let's scale it and let's put
this down here actually thinking about
it I should have done way less vertices
here but that's alright I mean this is a
you know tutorial this is a learning
process and so that's perfectly fine the
way that it is and I think that's gonna
line up good and that looks pretty good
okay so deselect with a yeah definitely
do less vertices than one I had here and
you would change that down here I'll
show you when I do the the grill part of
it okay so let's come in and let's
create two these rounded tubes that we
were going to make and I'll show you
what I mean by changing the vertices so
well I'm gonna go
shift and a once again and then here is
the round cube if you do not see that as
an option I'm going to show you here in
one second how to make that an option so
let's go and actually before I do that
let's do an undo or now let's do an
undoing the whole thing let's do a shift
and then round cube again and I'm gonna
come down here and let's see how many
changes we can make here let's go and
drag this guy out
not looking to see how I could affect
this well actually there's not that many
different things I can do here to make
that less complicated but down here is
where you would lower the number of
vertices whenever you create shapes I'll
show you here in a moment with another
example so let's go and let's just turn
these into the girl parts so I will go
into three once again come in here and
do a versi select that's what I got I'm
gonna go eh and then I'm going to make
sure that I have this turned off and I'm
gonna come in and whoops I must add up
let's go shift s and cursor to Center I
just moved my 3d cursor over there again
Omega B for box select select all this I
missed one of them let's go undo box
select and let's grab all of them and
then let's do X and vertices are deleted
and this is going to be the grille part
that we're gonna be working with let's
go back to one obviously this is gonna
change pretty dramatically so let's go
and do select one of them hit L to
select the whole thing now let's move
this over here and then what I want to
do is size it on the I believe that
would be the x-axis right well let's
just size it all together first so that
looks like it's getting about the right
size down a little bit and I'm gonna
turn this into these shapes right here
so scale again down a little bit bring
it over here and let's do this one first
because that's not gonna cause any
problems for any of the other ones let's
drag it up here a little bit and then
size on the X so that would be s X and
that I'm able to shrink it down like
this and then that's what I'm looking
for so let's go to three drag it over
here into position and then one and
there it is
and then we can go and do a shift and D
for duplicate and then just hit enter
and then drag it into position that way
you know that everything is gonna line
up perfectly so shift D enter and then
drag over into position if you went and
tried to move it on its own it would get
messed up so shift D and
enter and drag it into position again
and D enter 50 enter and shifty enter
all right and there we go we have the
whole entire front of the thing the car
fixed that's looking pretty sweet in it
now all right so let's go back to three
what do we want to do here hold down the
shift key hold down the middle mouse
button drag that into position so we can
see it we're going to extrude out the
bumper we're going to extrude out this
part and we're going to extrude out
these guys so let's go and let's work on
this and then we're gonna do inset the
windows we're gonna create a new
headlight in the back here and then
we'll be done so the very first thing is
I'm gonna cover is this guy right here
so I'm just gonna do some face selects
on it face select face select all of
these and then I'm gonna have the gap be
here instead of you know in the off part
there and I can go and do they select
all these at the same time and then I
can do a extrude lets go maybe to the
front and this is being extrude on the
x-axis because it's red so I'm going to
go extrude X point one and enter it's
gonna be exactly the same as the other
extrude that I just did and there you
can see it created it now these come to
a point however so let's go and it'll do
a to deselect and we'll grab this guy
right here and we'll move it down so
that it goes into a point and then do
the same with this one and then it goes
into a point now let's make sure I grab
the right ones and I did so they look
perfectly fine
all right so that's why I was aiming to
do and then for the other one this is
gonna go to a point also so that is this
one I believe let's grab this and we
will go and grab this vertice right here
move it down to a point is that the
right one or not
I don't know ah see I grabbed the wrong
one say I want this vertice right here
so let's deselect grab that vertice
let's drag it down to the middle of our
our face grab this one and drag it up to
the middle okay so it's an extrusion the
sort of comes to a point exactly what I
was looking to do
all right so I got that one done I am
going to also want to extrude out this
streamline I don't know what that thing
is but this is going to extrude out so
how am I going to extrude it I'm gonna
extrude it exactly the same way I
extrude all the other ones it's just go
like this select all of them and then
after I get them all done I'm gonna
extrude point one so everything's
extruded out the same amount so it looks
nice and then that'll be done so let's
do that and then we can do our wheels
and things and then our incredible car
will be all modelled so once again we
are going to be extruding on the X plane
so we're gonna go extrude X point one
boom done all right a to deselect and
let's jump back to three I'm also going
to want to extrude the bumpers on this
and I'm gonna I want to extrude out to
the bumper on the back also so let's go
back to three then I can select all of
these I have face select selected so I'm
just right clicking and then holding
down shift and grabbing all the other
ones
grab them I'm just right clicking on all
of our bumper parts so grab all that and
there we go and I got it sewed up and I
think I want to do this in the back I
don't know do I want to do that or not
yeah kind of
yeah I don't want to do it back here I
want to extrude the other one but not
that
so again got that all set up extrude X
point one boom I got it but my bumpers
all set up so see there's a nice little
edge right there and that's looking good
should I go and just finish the car
while I'm at it yeah I don't know I
don't know if I want to do that let's go
control one let's look at the back so
basically what I have back here is an
extrusion that I want to do here and
then I want to put a lamp in the middle
and then I want to do a license plate
and then I want to do an inset for my
window and that's all that I need to do
so let's go and then let's go another
shift
a-and let's create another sphere go to
three drag it into position and
obviously it isn't you know perfect
because it's way too big and then we'll
jump back into the rear position way
by holding down control and one drag
this over here and then we're going to
first cut it in half because we don't
need all that shift middle mouse button
to drag around on the screen here a to
deselect vertices select and middle
mouse button scroll to see it bigger and
then B and just select all of this and X
and then vertices delete and now we got
half of it and then we'll go back to the
back again control one and I want to
select that guy and that's this one
right here alright and we go L to select
everything whoops
no that grabbed me the wrong thing
grabbed this and L okay so I got the
correct yes I do have the correct one so
I want to scale this on the why I
believe so I want it to be sort of
thinner so I'm gonna go control one and
I'll do a scale on why is that right no
right scale X there you go sometimes I
get confused all right so we got that
there and then I got to decide where
exactly I want to put it because the
drawing is different than the actual car
I think I want to put it right there cuz
that's in the middle of where I have the
other stuff so let's go do you select
that control one again is that in the
center of where I want to do the
extrusion yes it is alright so now we go
three and we'll drag this into position
well I want to do the extrusion also
control one to see the back view and
then I can do a face select so let's do
face select face look it's not gonna go
there anyway because that's where the
hood scoop is remember there's a hood
scoop let's do a to deselect select that
L didn't grab everything let's just cape
again do it by hitting a it's just doing
edge select on this there got it and
then I want to select all of the pieces
I grab I pressed on L that selects
everything once you select one thing a
to deselect and I want to do the
extrusion on the face here and the
extrusion is going to be not where it
sticks out but everywhere else so let's
go
trol one and I'm going to start it right
here
so do a face select on all of these guys
and then I'll be able to do that
extrusion alright so we're getting a lot
of stuff done here okay something like
okay so that's gonna be extruded and
then there's gonna be like a gap and
then there's gonna be another extrusion
down here that's basically what the
drawing I have is anyway
ESS extrudes also I believe alright so
then what I can do is do an extrude and
this is gonna be why because see this is
let's see there's red there's blue so
that's why so I'm gonna go like this and
I'm gonna go extrude Y point 1 see it
extruded and enter and I'm gonna go
control 1 to get it again hey did he
select I'm gonna grab this guy so I'm
gonna go B and I'm gonna go escape to
get out of that I'm gonna make sure this
is shut off so that I can select every
single thing and not just what's viewing
grab that drag this back into position
which should be right about here and
that looks good go and do view from 3
and then let's drag this in here and
it's not going to be on the hood scoop
though it's gonna be down here in the
middle of this extruded out part ok and
there we are 4-1 and it's in the center
good stuff now I can do the same thing
for our license plate that we have here
holding down the shift key middle mouse
button dragging this around let's go
grab face select got it
and then we'll just come in here whoops
you know what I'm gonna hit a to
deselect whoops
a deselect and then I'm gonna turn this
back on again so I'll see only what is
on the screen in front of me and not a
3-dimensional view of that and I got all
of those that'll be the license plates
once again we can drag this over here
and we can go extrude Y point 1 boom
done
we got that one all fixed patrol 1 and
everything is all set except for the
inset windows let's go 3 do we have
everything here yes we have everything
there except for our or our wheels 1
everything is done on the front except
for the inset windows why don't we do
the wheels ok so to create our wheels
I'm gonna have to create a cylinder so
I'm gonna go shift and a and create a
cylinder there's our cylinder and I'm
gonna move it out let's go 3 and let's
bring it out here it's way too big
obviously let's do a s and scale it down
in size and first off to see exactly how
it's doing here I'm gonna go are ym9 be
and then hit enter okay now it looks
like a wheel that's on side drag it down
here till it's roughly in the middle of
the screen sure I get down here until
it's in the middle of where I have that
wheel drawn asked to scale and then
bring it up in size so we got that all
set up alright so now we've won to see
the front obviously it needs to go to
the right so let's bring it over here
and let's scale it on the x-axis only so
I hit s and then X I don't think X
showed up don't know why
alright and there it is so I hit s and
then the X key and then it went it and
showed up now it's not gonna I don't
want it to go that far over because I
have to put like hubcaps and things on
it so I'm gonna move it over a little
bit more three that looks perfect so
let's go shift + middle mouse button to
command shift middle mouse button once
again then what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna create the hubcap part so I'm
gonna go extrude well first off deselect
everything face select and I just want
to face so like that I'm gonna go
extrude and then I'm gonna go s and I'm
gonna drag that in to get the that's
gonna be the actual tire part of it you
can see everything looks perfect there
and then I'm going to go and extrude
against omega3 first so I can use my
guide so I'm gonna go extrude you know
what let's do an extrude and then bring
it in or have it come you know to the
right so to do that I'm gonna go extrude
and then Y and let's do point zero five
something like that say it created like
a little bit of a lip there
on that wheel and then I can do you know
what let's do it on do it let's do a
little bit more than that so let's do an
extrude Y point one well that's too much
isn't it so ski let's try it again this
is what we do alright so hello - lets do
a extrude Y and we'll do a
a point oh eight something like that and
then enter and that looks a little bit
good that looks kind of cool okay three
again and that's fun right yeah it looks
good but we go in the right direction
just verifying that I got what I think I
got all right so three once again and
then we can do a extrude and scale and
then bring this in some more no it looks
funky I don't like the way that looks
let's just undo our way out of it all
right so let's just redo it it's always
better to just redo the doggone thing
again instead of guessing that she's got
it right so I got just the face selected
right yes and I'm hitting three I'm
gonna hit extrude and s/ii
s drag that drop it inside of there and
then I'm going to do another extrusion
extrude Y and point oh eight and then
enter and then three why does that look
weird I don't know why it looks weird
it's just my eyes I don't know
colorblind sometimes I double I think
that I'm seeing things that I'm not
saying um let's go back to three and
let's do another scale on this so we'll
go e extrude s and then drag that down
inside once again and then drop it and
then we can do a extrude and point or
extrude Y negative 0.05 something like
that enter so that looks like we can do
a seven to see this from the top and
then do a control seven to see it from
the bottom and yeah I guess it looks fun
I don't know why I just looks a little
bit weird whenever I did it before
that's okay and then three jump back
inside of here and then do an extrude
scale down and then have it come the
whole way in for the rest of the hubcap
okay so there we go we drew our wheel
and we have all of that all set in place
so now what I want to do is I want to
duplicate it and I'm gonna hold down the
shift key
the middle mouse button and I'm going to
select everything so I'm gonna right
click on anything and then I can do L to
select the rest of it oops let's go
turn that off l know I got everything
okay so I want to duplicate this I'm
gonna go shift D and then I'm gonna hit
enter and then I'm gonna drag this guy
down here into position and there we go
now I got our wheels a to deselect that
and do I have everything done except for
yes my window in sets so I'm gonna do is
I want to sort of inset the windows I
don't do this on this part because that
is a entire window that whole entire
thing so I'm just gonna do window in
sets on this part and the rear part
shift and hold down the middle mouse
button so I want to inset these windows
I'm gonna select face already have face
selected select that I'm gonna do I and
move in actually that's just about
perfect
left mouse button click and then I'm
going to go e x- 0.15 enter and that's
gonna make the windows inset a little
bit say and let's go back three do a
face select on these also so if a select
face select face select all these guys
once again we're going to inset the
windows so I'm gonna go I they already
went I'm gonna click on the enter button
I'm gonna go e x- 0.15 enter and there
you can see the windows inset themselves
I'm gonna go control one go to the rear
and then I'm gonna do face selects again
on all of these let's see where do I
want to actually do it though I think I
only want to do face I only want to do
the windows in a certain part so let's
go control one again and let's start
right here so face select face look face
let's get all these actually a deselect
turn that back on and let's go start
grabbing these again so face select
again got them all and then I'm gonna do
a I to inset those a little bit enter
and then I'm going to go E and this
would be why I believe let's just do it
so e y- 0.15 enter yes and there you can
see it did the inset so you go guys
there is
is our Incredibles car all modeled out
and looking pretty snazzy I think I
modeled everything didn't I
it's not absolutely perfect but it's
looking pretty doggone good and got to

crazy things inside of here and
