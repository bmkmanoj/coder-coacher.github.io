52 of my java video tutorial series and
this part I'm going to continue making
our little video game here and I'm going
to make the spaceship display on the
screen and I'm also going to set up key
listeners so that we can eventually move
this thing around so the first thing I
need to do is do an import this is
inside of spaceship dot Java like you
see right there and I also by the way it
changed just a game board dot Java
instead of lesson 50 which didn't make
any sense so back to the code and
everything you see here is available on
a link underneath of this video this is
going to be pretty much exactly the same
as our little asteroid or Rock as I
called it I'm gonna go public class
spaceship extends and yes eventually I'm
going to do much more advanced graphics
type things inside of here and our old
friend pops up here yelling at us that
we don't have a serial ID for this so
I'm just going to hit add suppress
warnings for that then we're pretty much
going to define things just like I said
like the rock so we're going to go
integer and it's going to have an upper
left-hand x position and this time I'm
going to set that to 500 which is going
to be based off of the center of our
game board and this to 400 and that's
just a rough estimate
I just want to hash out what I got here
and then I need to also determine the
direction the ship is going to be moving
so I'm just going to keep everything
consistent and just have it be X
Direction except I'm going to set it to
zero because I don't want to start
moving as soon as it comes onto the
screen and then also with y direction
that's also going to be set for zero and
that's just going to be the direction
that everything's moving I'm also going
to come in here and go and get the width
for my game board
so board with just like that and I'm
also going to get the height that we're
going to be using later we're not
actually going to use that in this part
of the tutorial but I might as well get
it because I know I'm going to need it
to bounce stuff around on a screen and
then I went and drew out what I wanted
my ship to look like just like I did
with rock like I showed you before and
I'm going to store these values in an
array and these are just the points that
make up the polygons it's just going to
be 500 527 500 508 and then 500 again to
close it off that's just my polygon
points and then I'm going to do the same
thing for the Y coordinates of the
polygon of 400 for 15 or 30 or 50
and 400 so that's going to be the
starting points for the spaceship
whenever it first gets shot onto the
screen and then we have to create a
constructor so that new spaceships can
be created on our screen and I'm going
to call the polygon class which is what
we extended here say extends polygons so
I can just call a polygon and have it do
all the work for me poly X all right
poly Y array and also the number of
points need passed over and that's going
to be 5 so there you go
that's real simple that's all I'm going
to need for my constructor doesn't get
much easier than that and then I'm also
going to create a move method and to
start this off I'm going to get the
upper left-hand corner x position that's
just going to be equal to super X points
0 just to start off this is gonna of
course be changing later on but I just
want to shoot it on the screen to see
what we got here and then play around
with everything else later on I'm just
trying to get little tiny bits of
everything working on the screen and
then I'll worry about going back in and
fixing everything afterwards then we're
basically going to do the same exact
thing in regards to if the ship hits the
wall like we did with rocks so I might
as well just come over here and copy
that which is exactly what I'm going to
do for now
might as well copy and paste as much as
humanly possible and there you go that
is all we're going to need to be able to
show our little spaceship on the screen
that simple of course it's not going to
move yet around on the screen like Rock
does because it's going to move based
off of our keyboard presses so let's go
over into game board Java and let's
create all that now the very first thing
we're gonna have to do because I'm going
to be looking for keyboard presses here
is enough to import a couple new
libraries so I'm going to import Java
dot event dot key event and I'm also
going to have to come in here and get
key listener all right now I'm going to
be able to monitor if at the user clicks
on the keyboard anywhere and then I need
to set up that key listener so I'm just
going to scroll on down and this looks
like a good place to set it all up I'm
going to be setting it up inside of the
game board constructor that we have here
and I'm going to go add key listener new
key listener I like that
then I might as well just be lazy about
this and let Java do some of the work
for me put a semicolon at the end of
that and then whenever this guy throws a
little bit of an error it's going to say
add on implement
method so I'm going to click on that and
it's going to go in there and create all
the methods that I need to be able to
monitor keystrokes
and I'm going to pretty much just ignore
key typed key pressed and focus in on
key released let's simplify this a lot
because I don't want to get too
complicated but basically we have to
monitor key codes and I decided that I'm
going to rotate the ship using a and D
and I'm going to go forward with W and
backward with s now the key code for W
is 87 and a is 65 and s is 83 and D is
going to be equal to 68 so those are the
key codes that we're going to be looking
for whenever we're using this guy and
I'm just going to keep it nice and
simple and just go E which is the event
and get key code so if the key code is
equal to 87 which as you can see that is
W I'm going to perform one event and in
this situation I'm going to keep it a
little bit simple because I want you to
completely understand what I'm doing
here and I so I'm gonna print out on the
screen
forward right like that else if I'm
going to do another check for another
key code just to keep this real simple
I'm going to go 83 in this situation
which is s and in those situations in
which s is going to be pressed we're
going to print out to the screen
backward just like that
that was how simple it was to go in
there and grab and have certain events
trigger whenever a button is pressed on
the keyboard yes it's really that simple
and I can just as easily come in here
and whenever these things are clicked on
instead of printing out something to the
screen just to make sure it works
because that's what I'm doing here I'm
trying to slowly ease into the way big
applications are actually created
they're created slowly they're not
created in big giant ball so then what
do I need to do well I have my key
listener all set up so basically what
else I'm going to need to do I'm going
to have to come in here and scroll them
away on down in here and create my
spaceship so that it can be printed out
on screen and where should I put it at I
think right around here looks just as
good of a place as any I'm just going to
go space ship and I'm going to call it
the shift is equal to new spaceship and
there you are now I got my spaceship
pulled inside of here now the only thing
that I'm going to need to do is come on
down inside of here and
move my ship around as well as draw it
on the screen so how hard is that going
to be I'm just going to go the Asha dot
move right like this and there you are
that's going to handle any movements
that we have and then to draw it on the
screen I'm just going to copy the same
exact little guy we have here on the
screen for rock and instead I'm going to
change this into Russia and if we file
save that and we have everything else
over here all set up properly which it
looks like we do and execute you're
going to see right here our spaceship is
being drawn on the screen and then if
you look over here on the right side of
the screen right like this and I hit W
for words in a pop-up and if I hit
ass-backward pops up so that is how you
draw the spaceship on the screen and
also monitor keyboard presses which in
the next tutorial we're going to make
the spaceship move around on the screen
and eventually fire at these different
rocks that are flying around and then
after that create a collision in which
if the spaceship is hit by one of the
rocks it explodes leave any questions or
comments below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
