shelf scripting tutorial in this one
tutorial I'm going to teach you the
basic syntax of how to write bash shell
scripts and I'm also going to focus in
specifically on input output variables
math creating your own functions how to
execute Python functions conditional
strings arrays looping and we're also
going to cover a lot about how to use
vim because that is going to be the
editor that I am going to be using here
and basically a shell script is just
going to contain commands that are
executed inside your terminal just as if
you type them in the terminal but like I
said previously we're also going to
cover all the other different things
like input/output conditionals strings
arrays and all that other stuff so I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so basically I have two terminals
open here one on the left and one on the
right and I'm going to start off here by
talking about of them now to install
them if you do not have it installed
you're just going to type in sudo and
apt and get and install them like that
and hit enter and it might ask you for a
password and then it will install it and
you may have to restart the terminal
after that but otherwise everything is
ready to go so now that we have them
installed let's talk about how to use
them and I think this is very important
so let's just go and create a little
file called test and there we are we are
inside of them and you can just start
typing away by hitting I that's going to
put us in insert mode and then you're
going to be able to put all sorts of
random things on multiple different
lines and I'm doing this for a reason
because I want to jump around here and
show you a couple different things and
how things work inside of them all right
so there we go we created our little
file here now how do we move around
inside of the file well let's go and hit
escape and that's just jump us out of
insert mode and if you would like to
save but not exit you're going to hit
colon and W and that's going to save
your file you can also save and quit
once again by hitting colon and WQ and
that's going to save and quit you're
also going to have the option to quit
and discard any changes that you have
again you want to hit escape and you
want to hit call
and then you're going to hit Q and an
exclamation mark jump back in here again
you could also move around in nice ways
again if you're not in insert mode of
course if you want to move to the front
of the next word just hit W lowercase W
it's going to jump you through your file
you're also going to be able to move
backwards to the front of words by
hitting B lowercase B once again you can
move to the start of the line by hitting
zero and you're going to be able to jump
to the end of the line by hitting the
dollar sign you can hit an uppercase G
that's going to jump you to the last
line and then you can hit an uppercase a
and that puts you in insert mode or a
pen mode that's going to move you to the
end of the final line and allow you to
start typing okay so and also you're
going to be able to move around with
your arrows just like you would in any
other different text editor we could
also decide that we want to display line
numbers by hitting escape once again and
colon and set number like that you could
turn syntax highlighting on once again
by hitting escape and colon and then
typing in syntax on and hitting Enter
you're also going to be able to decide
how many spaces you're going to have
with a tab by hitting colon and set tab
stop is equal to two you don't need to
memorize all these things because more
than likely you're going to go and put
them in a file and we'll show you how to
do that in a second another option that
is available to you is Auto indent which
is going to indent all of your new lines
so set Auto indent you may want to use
these you may not just don't be
completely up to you and where you're
going to save all of these changes so
they are available every single time you
open up them is inside of your home
directory so mine of course has my name
on it Derrick baños and you're just
going to save them in a file that is
called dot vim RC and we can open that
file out and if you do you can see right
here that I went and set it so that line
numbers always show up that syntax is
always on that my tab stops are going to
be equal to two spaces and I also have
auto indent and you're going to go and
save that once again in two dot vim RC
inside your home directory and then
and reload all your terminals and all
that stuff will be there every single
time you load up them you could also
come in to them and verify which them RC
file you're going to be using by just
coming in and typing in echo and then
dollar sign and my them RC and you can
see that it is using the one that is
inside of my home directory
okay so there's just the basics of how
to use vim as this tutorial continues
we're going to be doing a lot more with
it
you could also come in here and select a
whole bunch of these files just by going
Capital V like this and then pressing
down on your arrow keys to select
everything and then hit D to delete
everything now that we got that out of
the way let's go and write ourselves a
hello world script and see exactly how
that works now you're going to start off
your file with the shebang well first
off you're going to hit I to go into
insert mode and you're going to go
shebang which is just a hash symbol with
an exclamation mark and this is going to
tell the system the interpreter that you
want to use for your script in this
situation I am going to use bash and
then if I want to go and make a comment
I can do a comment just with a hash
symbol and comment and then if we want
to echo hello world out on the screen we
can do so just like this so echo hello
world and then you're going to escape
and you're going to hit : + WQ and you
are out of them over here on the right
side of the screen I can now go in here
and execute this let's just do LS to see
exactly what we have here and we can see
here is hello world which is what we're
going to be doing our little work with
there and there it is indeed and let's
just clear that now if we want to come
in here and execute our hello world
script we would just go period and
forward slash and then hello world like
that and you can see that hello world
shows up there on our screen so we're
just going to be bouncing back and forth
over here I'm going to write the script
over here I'm going to execute it now if
you did not have that executable the
hello world script it's very easy to
change it into an executable all we're
going to do is go CH mo zhee like this
and seven five five and hold
world exactly like that and now it is
going to be executable now these numbers
right here that you see after we have CH
mo D is going to define who can do what
with our file the order of these numbers
are going to represent first off the
owner of the file and then the group and
then everyone else and the permissions
that they have now whenever we put a
seven here this is going to say that the
owner of this file is going to be able
to read write and execute it when we
have five here that is saying that the
group in this situation as well as
everyone else is going to be able to
read and execute if any of these were
six that means they would have
permission to read and write four would
mean read only three would mean write
and execute two would mean write only
one would be an execute only an 0 would
mean that they cannot do absolutely
anything with a file and that is how we
can change permissions on our file if
you did not know that already
now we are going to be able to come in
here and we're going to also be able to
create variables of course and we are
going to define variables like let's say
I want to have my name like that I then
would not put a space and no space there
and I would type in direct like that so
that creates a variable called my name
with the value of Derrick inside of it
and variable names are going to start
with either a letter or an underscore
underscore meaning that guy right there
and then they're going to also be able
to contain numbers anywhere else inside
of the variable name now the shell is
going to treat all of our variables as
if they are strings but we're going to
be able to work with numbers as you'll
see in a moment and it's just important
I want to make sure you know whenever
you're declaring variables you can have
white space on either side of your equal
sign now we can also come inside of here
and we can declare a constant if we'd
like to even though that isn't very
common and how we do that is declare - R
and then we could say something like
num1 is going to be equal to 5 that is
going to make that a constant and let's
come in here and create a known one
called num - and give that the value of
4 and then you can do some basic
arithmetic
if you'd like to go and create num 3 and
you want to do arithmetic you're going
to have to go and put a dollar sign
inside of here and then 2 of those
brackets and then we can add num1 plus
num2 we could also come in here and
highlight this if we want to save a
little bit of time escape out of that
capital v we're going to hit lowercase Y
to copy that for us and then we can do
capital P and then we can do capital P
and another capital P and another
capital P and come in here get back into
insert mode change this to 4 change this
to 5 change this to 6 and then we can
also do subtraction and we can do
multiplication and we can do division
we're also going to be able to use
exponents as well as modulus I'll show
you those in a second though if we want
to then echo out all of this information
on our screen we can just go echo and we
could do something like 5 plus 4 is
equal to and if you want to put the
variable directly inside of your output
just go dollar sign and number 3 in this
situation you can highlight this again
copy it by hitting Y and then I'm going
to go and paste all these out again and
if I'm ever moving too fast feel free to
hit the pause button I like to move
these tutorials along quickly and I just
leave it up to you to hit the pause
button to make sure that they move at
the rate that you would prefer them we
can escape out of that and then go and W
and execute and you can see exactly how
all those work for us we're also going
to be able to go echo and we don't we
can use exactly the same parenthesis we
have here and let's just do exponents
again so let's go to this and we could
do echo and modulus is going to return
the remainder of a division and you can
put spaces inside of here if you'd like
and you can see that those all calculate
out you're also going to have assignment
operators that provide for shorthand
arithmetic options for you and those are
going to be plus equals 2 and basically
what this is going to mean is let's say
we have I plus equals to 2 that is going
to be equivalent to I is equal to I plus
2 so it's just the shorthand way so you
don't have to type in I multiple
different time
you're also going to have a subtraction
option and a multiplication option as
well as a division option
I think modulus also works I'm not
certain though because I never use it so
let's go and create another random
variable and give that a value of five
and let's perform some arithmetic on it
and we can go Rand plus equal to four
and then we can echo that out on our
screen as well again I'm hitting : and W
to save that and there you can see that
nine comes back you're also going to be
able to use a shorthand way of
incrementing values and it's going to
create that and let's just go echo and
we'll use Rand again so we'll have Rand
plus plus that is the shorthand that I'm
referring to and let's see exactly what
happens whenever we use this shorthand
notation go Rand plus plus and then also
we will change the position of again I'm
going to hit a V right here and why to
copy that and then I'm going to hit P
and P and P show you a couple different
ways to use incremental and decremental
so let's come in here and let's
increment this here and put that there
and then here we're going to decrement
this and decrement that as well and when
we execute that you can see exactly
what's going on here so it starts off
with the value of nine now whenever we
call for this to increment what it is
doing is it is saying print the value of
Rand and then after you print it on the
screen then increment its value here
what it's saying is first increment the
value then print it on the screen and
that is the reason why we jump from 9 to
11 likewise here we're saying print the
value of Rand and then decrement it
after you print it and that's why it
stays 11 and here we're saying first
decrement it and then print it on the
screen and that's the reason why we go
back to 9 now if you want to use
floating point values what we're going
to have to do here is this there's a
couple different ways of doing this but
I'm going to show you how to use Python
for this so let's go and create number
seven and give it a value of one point
two and number eight and give it
a value of 3.4 you're going to be able
to use a whole bunch of different Python
commands right here inside of your shell
script and we can go number 9 is equal
to and here we're going to call Python
to execute of course you have to have
Python installed on your system for this
to work and then you're going to be able
to use any type of Python commands you'd
like to use here so we can say number 7
and number 8 and make sure you put that
quote right there and then after you do
that you're going to be able to come in
and get the value of number 9 we come
over and execute it and you can see
indeed that it was able to perform that
arithmetic for us now the final thing
I'm going to show you here is how we can
come in and print out information over
multiple lines with what is called the
hair script and here I'm going to use
cat which is going to print a file or
any string that you pass to it and you
can experiment with exactly how that's
going to work basically you're just
going to put cat and you're going to put
those two little arrows inside of there
and then you're going to put how the
lines are going to end and I like to use
n some people use other things and here
we can say this text prints and then you
put end here at the end again we're
going to skip out of that jump over here
and execute it and you can see it prints
exactly as you went and to find it right
inside of there there you go that's a
rough overview of some of the basics
using math and printing information out
on the screen and using Python and a
whole bunch of their different things
now I'm going to jump over and talk
about functions and how they work inside
of your shell scripts now functions are
going to of course allow you to avoid
the need to write duplicate code and
another thing here we have all this
stuff typed out here inside of them
you're probably wondering is there an
easy way to avoid going through and hand
deleting all this of course there is
first you want to hit escape then you're
going to hit lowercase G two times and
then you're going to hit D and capital G
that is lowercase D and capital G there
you go everything's been deleted all
right back inside of insert mode and of
course in the description I have a link
to a cheat sheet that has all of the
things I talked about here so you can
use that now if you want to define a
function you're just going to go and
type it in here like this let's just say
get date for example and if we want to
go and get our current date and time one
of the little functions is available as
to us is the date function and this is
going to get the current date and time
and then we can call return and return
is going to return an exit status number
between 0 to 255 you don't really need
to worry about all that just know it's
going to jump us out of our little
function after we get it done and now
that we have that set up we can call our
function just by going get date and save
that and there you can see it went and
printed out all that data information
that brings us to the difference between
what are called global as well as local
variables and how they work in regards
to functions so let's go and create a
variable inside of here and I'll put
Derick inside of this this is a global
variable this is available to every
single thing else in your script now I'm
going to show you a local error so we'll
go demonstrate local go and create our
little function inside of here and here
we're going to define a local variable
that means it is only available inside
of this function and I'm going to give
it the same name as the name outside of
there and then we're going to return
outside of our function now you would
think I just changed the value for name
and you're going to see indeed that I
did not well let's go and call dem local
because the function needs to be called
for it executes and then we'll go echo
and we will go name and we'll see
exactly how this is going to work for us
and after you play with them for a while
you're going to get used to it and there
you can see that Derick printed out the
reason why is this version a name is
only available inside of here nobody
else knows that exists except for this
block of your script this is the global
name is available everywhere but in this
situation since we went and created a
variable the same name name inside of
here is Paul outside of here it is
always going to be Derek so hopefully
that made some sense for you what a
function is going to be pretty worthless
for us unless it is able to come in and
receive some values so how we can get
our
is is let's just go into insert mode
here and we'll create a function it's
going to receive two values and then
print a sum so we can go get some and
you may ask yourself oh we going to get
the attributes that are going to be
passed to it well we're going to be
referring to them with dollar sign one
and dollar sign two for the second one
and dollar sign three and so forth and
so on so let's go and create some local
variables and we'll call this number
three and let's get the first attribute
passed inside of there and then we will
get number four and we'll get the second
attribute we can then come in and we can
create the sum of both of these values
and we're going to add them together and
we'll go number three and add and num
four and then if we want to pass back
the value from our function back to
whoever called our function we can just
go echo and some like that jump out of
there and then we can define our phone
or our values we're going to pass inside
of here so we'll go number is equal to
five and number two is going to be equal
to six and then we'll pass our
attributes and to do so we're going to
go sum is going to have the value pass
back inside of here and we'll go get
some which is the name of our function
and then we pass in the attributes and
you just don't put you just put a space
inside of here you don't put a column on
or anything like that and that is going
to call our functions for us and then we
can go echo just to prove that this echo
up here is actually returning the value
and isn't printing it out
we will go echo the sum is sum save that
and execute and you can see right here
the sum is 11 there's a rough overview
of how we can go and create functions
pass attributes into them and have
values returned from them so now let's
go and take a look at conditionals well
I might as well also talk about how we
can read information or receive input
from the user we're just going to type
in read - P and the P option says that
we want to prompt with a string and the
string is going to be what is
your name and then the value is going
that they enter on the keyboard is going
to be stored in the variable called name
and then we can come right back and go
echo and hello name and execute what is
your name Derrick hello Derrick so you
can see how we were able to go in there
and get some input for ourselves we
could also come in here and say how old
are you and then whatever they enter is
going to be stored inside of the
variable called age and then we're going
to use an if statement to decide what we
want to do here so we're just going to
type in if and you're going to place
your conditions within these brackets
like that and the condition I want to
check is I'm going to say if age is
greater than or equal to 16 then I want
to do something so I'm going to say then
and then I'm going to type in exactly
what I want to do I could say you can
drive now if I want to check another
condition I just go L if like that and
then I type in whatever the next
condition is and I could say something
like age is equal to epsilons right
there 15 and then I can say then and
echo and say something nice like you can
drive next year and then finally we
would type in else and this is going to
be the default if neither the other two
comeback is true and it'll say something
like you can't drive and be mean about
that and then what you do to close off
your overall if statement because there
are no brackets or anything here curly
braces you're going to type in F I which
is going to be if in backwards of course
because that makes sense the hand will
come over here and will execute
how old are you and I could type in 15
whoops got a little bit of an error
jump back over here that's because I
didn't type in greater than or equal to
I'm thinking let's go in here and we'll
say greater than or equal to there that
is sorry about that
save that execute how old are you 15 you
can drive next year execute again 16 you
can drive and then we'll say 2
you can't drive thankfully all right so
there's an if statement now let's go and
let's go and check a couple other things
out here going to go capital V and then
D for delete and back into insert mode
with I and here I'm going to say enter a
number so I'm going to go back into I
I'm going to show you another different
way that we can use conditions here this
is going to be stored in num then I'm
going to say if and here if I put these
parentheses inside here I can now say
num is equal to 10 if you don't want to
use those other guys that you have
available there for you and by the way
the other options that were available to
do comparisons in other ways like we
talked about previously you could go
equals with the dash in front of it of
course not equal to less than or equal
to less than greater than or equal to or
greater than so sorry I didn't cover
that previously but like I said in the
description there is a link to all this
code and you can of course jump back and
test those out so here what we're using
is and what is called the extended
integer test so what we're going to do
is we're going to say if num is equal to
10 then we're going to define what we're
going to do and here we'll say echo your
number equals 10 this is just garbage
out put them just put in here and of
course you have to close that with fie
like that we could also then go in and
go if num is greater than 10 then and
here we'll say echo it is greater than
10 and then we come in we could still
use else and all that other stuff and L
if and all that stuff echo it is less
than 10 and you don't put any semicolons
there but we do use semicolons as the
tutorial continues I'll show you when we
use those we could also call on these if
we wanted to do any type of math inside
of here so let's say we want to check if
num is even or not just like this and
we'll go numb modulus 2 and we can check
if that is equal to 0 and that situation
we want to print out on our screen echo
it is even and closed off the if
statement again and save that and our
number we can say ten your number equals
ten it is less than ten it is even okay
so you can see exactly how that works
and then the reason why that came back
as less than ten is because I said
greater than ten if I would have put
greater than or equal to go into insert
mode with I again greater than or equal
to escape save that here ten and you can
see it comes out the same and we can
change this we could say greater than or
equal to ten but either way whatever
just writing this code out of my head
and that is what we're getting we're
also going to be able to use logical
operators inside of our shell scripts so
we can say something like if and then
want to compound these so let's say we
want to check if num is greater than 0
and we could also use or or we could
also come in here and use not just like
that just like other computer
programming languages but here we're
going to say that both of these
conditions need to be true not one or
the other
yes a num is less than 11 and then throw
then on there like that here we'll say
echo num is between 1 and 10 and our
number and what is the set numbers
between 1 and 10 let's put 5 inside of
there it is less than 10 pops back and 5
is between 1 and 10 so that's how we can
use logical operators also you're going
to be able to use logical operators to
execute different things so let's say we
wanted to go and create a file and then
if that worked and the file was created
we could then open it up inside of them
so this is kind of silly because you
would normally just create the file by
opening it in vim but I don't know so
basically what we're saying here is if
we were able to create this file then
what we want to do is go and have this
file opened up inside of them and we can
do that of course we could also come in
here and use or in much the same way so
we could say if sample directory doesn't
exist then
you want to make it and to check if it
exists or not a command we could use
here is - D sample directory and then we
could go or that's that guy if it
doesn't exist we're going to go make
directory sample dir and jump over here
execute and our number doesn't really
matter and there you can see the sample
file was created and here we are going
to escape out of this guy and you're
going to be able to go LS and you're
going to be able to see that the sample
directory was created as well as the
sample file was created and of course
I'm sure that you probably know this but
if you want to delete a file you just go
RM or remove sample file and if you want
to delete a directory you just go RM
directory and sample directory and that
is how those files are deleted for us we
can also come in here and test some
strings so what we're going to do is go
escape G G and D G and there that's gone
let's go in here and create a couple
strings we'll go string one and let's
just have it be nothing and string two
and let's give it a value of sad string
three and we'll give it a value of happy
if we want to test if a string has the
value of null and go and put in the
string that we want to check and then
we'll go then and if this comes back as
true then we know that string one is not
null and we can close that off we can
also check if a string has a value or
not by going if and then we would type
in - Z and the string that we want to
check inside of here so we'll go string
one then echo string one has no value we
can also check for equality between our
strings if once again and then what we
want to check so it's going to be string
one and we're going to check
if it is equal to string two or string
through I mean then let's jump up here
and change this string too and we'll say
equals and throw in the value of
whatever string three is do LF fair just
to show you that we can do not equals to
as well even though we could just go
else and leave it the way that it was
and then we come in and close that if
statement off we're also going to be
able to check if they are greater than
or less than based off of checking you
know alphabetical order of our different
strings once again we're going to be
doing the same sort of thing here string
two greater than string three then and
then once again we could check if they
were not equal to each other as well of
course or bless them in a situation in
exactly the same way that we did
previously and then close off that and
then jump over here and execute these
guys and you can see string one has no
value but it wasn't null and sad is not
equal to happy and sad is greater than
happy which just means that S comes
after H you're also going to be able to
do a whole bunch of checks in regards to
files so let's command and and we'll do
an if statement like let's say you
wanted to check if file exists you put -
e well let's come in here first off and
refer to these files so we'll say if
file one is going to be equal to and
we'll have it be called test file of
course you have to create these files
inside of your directory and it's just a
junky and empty file that's all these
are and we'll do the same thing for file
two now we can come in and say if and we
want to check if the file exists and we
could just refer to the file and then we
can go and perform some checks with it
so we can say then echo and we could say
file one exists and we can execute this
and it says test file one exists okay
now there are a ton of other different
things that we could then check for so
let's come in here and I'll just show
you them and you can
look at them on your own and here you
can see all the other different things
you can check in regards to file so we
checked if it exists we can then check
to see if it is a normal file just by
putting the dash F inside of there with
- or we can check if it's readable we
can check if it's writable with W X is
going to be is it executable D is going
to be is it a directory capital L is it
a symbolic link P is it a pipe s is it a
network socket G like that is is it
owned by the group capital o is it owned
by the user and so forth and so on
so those are all the different things
you can check in regards to files inside
of shell scripting and now I'm going to
show you how you can use regular
expressions as well so if you want to
check regular expressions you're going
to have to use what is called the
extended test so let's come in and let's
read some information from the user so
let's say we wanted to do something
create a script that's going to allow us
to validate epsilon that I do here
validate a date store whatever they type
in inside of date and then we can create
a pattern I'm not going to get that much
into regular expressions I already did a
tutorial on that you can look on my
YouTube channel if you'd like check that
out so let's say we wanted to make sure
that they enter in a group of numbers
between 0 and 9 and that they provide at
least 8 of them and we're going to say
that that verifies it is a date and we
put the question mark here for saying
that's the end of the pattern we're
looking for and the carrot says this is
beginning of the pattern we're looking
for we can then come in and go F and put
these brackets inside of here and then
check date equal to tilde and compare it
to our pattern and then if it is true we
can say that it is valid not a great
check for this but whatever and then we
could say else and say that it is not
valid and execute it and as long as we
go and we put in eight digits it's going
to say that it is valid and
we go and put in anything less than that
it's going to say that it's not valid
okay so you can play around with other
different regular expressions and see
exactly how those work we could also
read multiple values inside of our shell
scripts I'm not sure if I did that yet
or if I covered that yet again capital V
and D for delete and here what we're
going to say instead is enter two
numbers that we want to sum and if we
want to allow them to enter in multiple
different numbers we can just go nom one
and num2 without putting any commas
inside of there and then we can of
course come in and sum these values num1
plus num2 and then we could echo out on
the screen this information and there we
go enter two numbers sum and we could
say 23 wooped and put anything in there
so it just came back as 23 and of course
Wilco 23 space 45 and there you can see
it's able to go and accept multiple
different pieces of output just like
that another thing we're able to do here
and I'm just reviewing some of the
different ways that we can output
information or or read information I
mean let's say that we wanted them to be
able to enter information however we
don't want it to be displayed on the
screen whenever they enter it we would
just go read and espy the P is for
prompt once again and we'll set in the
assets for secret and we'll say enter
the secret code and we're going to store
that inside a variable secret and then
we could say if secret is equal to
password then we go echo enter else
wrong password and to enter two numbers
the sum whatever we just do this and
that whatever enter the secret code and
you can see here that if I type in the
secret code that it doesn't show but I
did indeed enter password and you can
see there that enter printed on the
screen other things kind of neat is
let's say that it seems weird to you
that the user would go in there and put
a space in between the values that
they're entering let's say that you
instead thought they should put a comma
or something else it doesn't really
matter
what it is going here V select all those
different things delete get rid of that
what we can do is we can store what we
want to define as the separation for the
attributes that are passed inside of
ourselves our shell script but what we
want to do here and what how we do that
is we go and change what it's called the
ifs now what we're going to do here is
we want to input or first save the
original version of ifs because that
could be useful as our script continues
so we'll go ifs and that's how we get
the original value and then we can set
what's is going to separate the input
values we'll just go ifs and let's say
that we want a comma to separate those
that would work perfectly fun and then
we could go read - P and then we can say
something like enter two numbers to add
separated by a comma and then we'll go
Nam one and num2 we could then use
parameter expansion to substitute any
white space that was entered when they
put these attributes inside here so it's
going to accept commas but it's also
going to accept any white space that
would come around these different values
and how you do that is you go normal 1
is equal to get more into parameter
expansion here in a second like
literally right after I cover this so
you can see exactly what I'm doing here
so I'm going to say num1 and let's say
that I want to replace all the blanks or
the whitespace inside of there I can do
that and I'm going to replace them with
nothing so I'm going to put nothing at
the end of that and that's going to work
perfectly fine for me copy that and then
capital P to paste that in there and
we'll go and change this to 2 and change
this to 2 and now we can come in and sum
those values just like we did previously
so sum number one number two and then
echo out on our screen and then of
course we want to change the ifs back to
the way that it was so it doesn't mess
up anything else in our script how you
do is
like this old ifs you put anything
inside of there of course and then we
can execute enter any two numbers and we
can say 23 and , and we can put a whole
bunch of spaces and then 45 and you can
see that it's able to perform that
information there you didn't have this
guy right here replacing the spaces
there would be a whole bunch of spaces
between or before the plus sign right
here so that's the reason why we did
that so what exactly do we mean by
parameter expansion and what exactly
does it do let's go and I'll show you a
whole bunch of examples so you can see
exactly what it does so let's say I
wanted to do something like create a
variable oops let's get rid of that so
let's say we wanted to come in here and
I wanted to print a value but I wanted
to immediately thereafter put some
characters after it so I wanted to do
something like Derek's toy so here I'll
show you
so Derek think I'd be able to type my
name by this point so I'm going to
create a variable called Derek and I
want to output Derek's toy with a s at
the end of it so I'm going to go like
this and I'm going to put this is what's
called a parameter expansion
I'm going to go name like that and then
I want to put in and ass at the end of
this so that we can do it like that see
if I put name and then I put the S after
that without the parameter expansion
this is the parameter expansion this guy
this guy and this guy if I put it in
there it would cause an error and it
wouldn't know what I was looking for it
definitely wouldn't put the name
variable inside of there so that's what
that does also we can come in and we'll
go sample string to explain what I did
whenever I replaced all of the blank
spaces with nothing here I'll do a
sample string if I then wanted to output
different information let's say I wanted
to change that string to cat I would use
a parameter expansion again and I would
go sample string and I would say I want
to replace dog with cat inside of the
string and that's going to allow me to
do that
and there you go enter two numbers
whatever
dah dah and there you can say Derrick's
toy shows up and you can also see that
our replaced dog with cat another couple
things you can do with parameter
expansion is let's say that you want to
print out a value for a variable but if
a value doesn't exist you want to print
out a default value well you can do that
a little bit of a weird type of thing
but trying to cover as many things as I
can here so let's say I want print the
name however if it doesn't exist I want
to print Derek instead and also what
this is doing right here well if I put
just a line like that it's just going to
print out Derek if a value for name
doesn't already exist if however a value
for name does exist it's going to change
the value to it with the equals sign so
you can play around with that see how
that works out for you and now I'm going
to jump in show you exactly how we use
case inside of shell scripts ok so the
very first I'm going to do here is I'm
going to ask the user how old are they
and then I'm going to use case to
perform different execute different code
depending upon the value of age so I'm
going to go case age in and then I'm
going to check some different things so
I'm going to say if the value of age is
between 0 and 4 this is really cool
which case work like this for other
languages then I want to echo too young
for school and then I'm going to put two
semicolons to end searching through all
the other conditions
I could also match only five and in the
situation which age is equal to five I
could say go to kindergarten and again
go like that and it's not going to check
in to the other different values I could
go and check for 6 through 18 just by
going with this 6 through 9 and then
close that off and then put a pipe
inside of there and then put one and
then put 0 through 8 so this is going to
check the ages 6 through 9 this is going
to check the ages 10 through 18 that's
what's going on there
and then I can come in here of course
and perform some arithmetic like let's
say I want to figure out what the gray
it is could do that
I going age minus five and then here
I'll go echo go to grade and whatever
the value of grade is and then come in
here so I'm a colon so close that off
like that and then finally we could do a
default action and that's just going to
be a star inside of there like that
let's go to the next line star and here
we'll say something like echo you were
too old for school and close that off
and then you're going to type in e si si
to end the case and before we execute
that might as well show you the last
conditional which is the ternary
operator and the ternary operator is
going to perform different actions based
on conditions so let's say we have
something like canned vote give it a
value of zero like false and then we'll
have 18 like this what we're going to do
here is we're going to say if age is
greater than or equal to 18 and then
we're going to put a question mark
inside of there then we're going to say
you can perform any type of arithmetic
or anything you want inside here but
here I'm just going to do an assignment
here we're going to say the can vote is
now going to have a value of 1 : and
that's going to be if this condition was
true otherwise it's going to be false
and in that situation we're going to say
I can vote and that is going to get the
value of 0 and it will close off all
those brackets and then here at the end
we can say echo can vote and then shift
they can vote or not run it how old are
you say 10 go to grade 13 and can't vote
comes back as one all right
sorry good guys there's a whole bunch of
different ways we can work with
conditionals now I'm going to take
another look at parameter expansions and
strings ok now I'm going to show you
what we can do with parameter expansions
in regards to strings so let's say we
have random string and it's just going
to be a random string and let's say we
wanted to get the string length could it
which could be useful for numerous
different reasons so strengthen link and
you would
go dollar sign and curly braket and hash
and then put in whatever your string
name is and then close it off with a
curly braket you could also get a
strength slice and remember we're using
zero index is here and we're going to be
going in and asking for a specific index
whenever we do this and here we just go
curly bracket again and random string
and let's say that we want to get
whatever is at the second index that's
how that's done
we could also commit and define a
starting index as well as an ending
index and get a slice that way so random
string and let's say we want to go to
two seven and then we could also come in
here and get everything that follows
after for in this situation I'm going to
say the letter A and then a space and to
do that we just go dollar sign again and
random string and then we're going to
put a hash symbol and then I'm going to
put a star and an A and a space in curly
bracket and we come in here and we save
that and jump over here and run it you
can get the string length is 15 you can
see here random string pops back because
we've got everything that follows from
the second index on here we go from the
second index to the seventh and here
once again we get everything that
follows after a and a space so there's
just a couple little neat things we can
do with parameter expansions and strings
now let's take a look at looping now
we'll start off with a while loop and
any time you use a while loop you're
going to have to define what you're
going to be iterating or incrementing or
decrementing whatever what's going to be
changing that is eventually going to
throw us out of our loop and we just
type in while and then we type in num
and here I'm going to say less than or
equal to ten is how long we're going to
loop through this put do here and I'm
going to find inside of here what
exactly is going to happen in this
situation I'm just going to print out
the numb and then of course you're going
to have to have a value that is going to
increment and that's going to be num
we're going to have to increment num and
there we are and then - and the while
loop we just put done at the end and
let's go and do another while loop here
again this time I'm going to demonstrate
how continuing break works so we can
just leave the let's just use the number
one again
so let's come in here and go num is
going to be equal to one and we'll throw
in another while loop and once again
we're going to be incrementing num and
we're going to be incrementing as long
as it is less than or equal to 20 and
then put do inside of here and let's say
that we don't want to print even numbers
how would we do that
well if you remember what we did
previously with the if statement we went
and took the modulus of our value and
then we compared it to zero and close
that off and then we're going to say
then in this situation we are going to
increment the value of number and then
we are going to continue and what that's
going to do is this line is going to
take care of the incrementing and it
continue is going to jump back up here
and it's not going to cover anything
else that was done anywhere after this
if statement now let's say that that
condition doesn't come back is true
let's say that we want to jump
completely out of our looping structure
all together and let's say that we want
to jump out if num is greater than or
equal to fifteen at any point in time
then and to do that we would type in
break and then we can close off our if
statement and then we can come down here
otherwise and just print out the value
of num and then of course we're going to
have to also come in here and increment
once again the value of num because it's
not going to be incremented otherwise
and then finally close off our while
loop whoops hit ctrl s there instead of
coming and hitting escape and W and we
come over here and execute those and you
can see how those all worked out there
up here we went in for an edge zero
through ten and right here we only
printed the odd numbers and whenever we
got to fifteen we didn't print it out we
instead jumped out of the loop so
there's
a couple different ways we can use a
while loops now let's come in here and
take a look at until which is basically
the opposite while loop basically with a
while loop we're saying we're going to
continue doing something as long as the
condition is true and with a until we're
going to continue doing something until
a condition is true so it's just
slightly different and to use until
let's just use num again and we're going
to say greater than 10 so we're going to
loop until the value of num is greater
than 10 and here we can then come in and
once again echo out the changing value
we are once again going to have to
increment our value here right like this
and then you close a until loop in
exactly the same way and you can go and
execute that on your own I think you get
exactly how that's going to work you can
also come in here and output file
information and let's go in here and
whoops let's escape out of that and
let's go and do LS to show everything we
go out here let's say we wanted to read
and loop through an output information
that is in a file well the file that I'm
going to use in this situation is going
to be my Barry Bonds stats and he's a
baseball player if you didn't know and
it's going to have his batting average
his RBIs and his total number of home
runs inside here so what I want to do is
I want to go and I want to loop through
all that Barry Bonds data so we're going
to come in once again we're going to
jump into this just using hello world
again and I'm going to say that I want
to use a while loop here and I want to
read information and information is
going to be average RBIs homeruns and
I'm going to say do now in this
situation I'm going to show you another
way that we can output information I'm
going to use printf in this situation
and I can say average let's just make
that older case and I can go and get my
average by going average like that and
then I can throw a newline in there the
printf allows me to use new lines inside
of here
I can then go RBIs and grab the RBI's
out of that once again we're going to
new line in there and we can also go in
and do homeruns and you could do
multiple different lines of data also to
grab out of there if you'd like
and for homeruns of course we're going
to type in hrs and close that off and
then throw in another new line and you
close off the printf statement and now
at the end here what I just need to do
is pipe data into the while loop and the
data being the text file that I showed
you just a second ago
so Barry Bonds and texts right like that
and we could save that and execute it
and you can see that it went and sucked
all that information directly out of
that file and then put all this other
information there so there's a way that
we can go in here and actually work with
the files and grab information if we'd
like to leave that out of there and of
course there's also going to be a for
loop and for loops come in a couple
different ways inside of shell scripting
so this is the C style way of working
with for loop so here what we're going
to do is we're going to continue cycling
through this as long as I is less than
or equal to 10 and we are going to also
come in here and increment the value of
I each time it jumps through our loop
close that off again we're going to type
in do and I'll just keep this nice and
simple once again and output the
information there and you close the for
loop like that and we can also come in
and cycle through ranges with for loops
and we are going to see another way
whenever I cover a raise here in a
second exactly how we can cycle through
an array and we can throw that right
there and do and echo and dollar sign I
and that's going to be closed off in
exactly the same way and we can jump in
and execute it and you can see right
here that I went and cycled through all
that information and you can also see
that went and printed out the values of
0 through 10 so pretty cool stuff and
let's get rid of that and now I just
mentioned Reyes so why don't we just
talk about arrays the one thing with
bash arrays is that you're only ever
going to be able to have one
shanell array as inside of bashes and of
course the indexes are going to start at
zero unless you defined you want them to
start something else sucka come in here
and create an array just call it
favorite numbers very easy and we can go
3.14 again you do not put commas inside
of here two seven eight and five seven
seven two one and what other number do
we have here
bonus points if you know why these
numbers are my favorites and we can come
in here and echo out I thought that is
how to create an array of course if I
didn't say that we can come in and echo
out a value inside of here quite easily
dollar sign and just go favorite nums
and then let's say we want the zero
index of course that's what pi is whoops
just gave away part of the little
question I had there and we could also
add a value to or an array in a similar
type of way so let's go the fourth index
and let's say that we wanted to add
another value inside of there and we
could echo out the value in much the
same way so let's just say gee our
favorite noms in here will echo out our
fourth index close that curly bracket we
can also add a group of values to our
rice favorite numbers and you just go
plus equal two and one and seven inside
of there and then of course we can
output all of our array values using for
loops which I told you I promised you I
was going to cover and here I am
covering it so favorite numbers and to
do that you just put bracket like that
and star and a closing bracket like that
curl the bracket like this and to do and
an echo and just grab this value and
then done and we can come in and save
that and if we run it you can see
exactly how all that information was
able to print out here I grab the index
here I grab another index in here I
printed out all of the information
stored in the array using the for loop
let's continue doing some more stuff
here you're also going to be able to
output indexes using much the same style
as this for loop so why don't I just
come in here and grab this guy
once again capital V why jump down here
capital P and all I need to do in this
situation is come down here insert and
throw an @ sign in there that's going to
print out all of my indexes I'm also
going to be able to get the length of
the array or the number of items that
are stored inside of the where I do the
array and there we go and then just
throw the @ sign inside of there and
that's going to work for us we can also
get the length of an array element like
an individual element so we'll say index
3 linked and to do that once again curly
bracket favorite nomes
and let's say we want to get the length
of the individual element there and we
can do that we're also going to be able
to come in here and sort our rice I will
say sorted nums and how we would do that
is go dollar sign and then we go for I
in and then the other side favorite nums
and then in @ sign inside of there a
curly bracket closing like this and then
whoops don't forget to put the semicolon
inside of there and then we'll go do and
we can go echo and all the sinai and you
can I don't know if I mentioned this
before you can put semicolons in here
but not necessarily do you need to do
that and then finally what you're going
to do here at the end is just go dawn
and put that right there
and then you're going to put in sort at
the end and then we're going to close
off those brackets and that is how easy
it is to sort an array and what the heck
let's go and print the array once again
so escape out of this V and why
and let's jump down here do a cat pee
inside of there and we want to get our
sorted gnomes
so sorted gnomes and here what we're
going to do is change this to a star and
this will be due and that'll be echo and
this will be done and all that works and
finally if you want to delete an array
element you go unset and let's say I
wanted to delete sorted gnomes and I
want to delete the second index that's
how that would work or they you know
whatever is in index one and of course
if you want to delete the whole Ray you
just go on set and you want to do sorted
gnomes and that's exactly how that works
and we come over here okay and run it
and there you can see we were able to
come in and get our array length whoop
and you can see here I made a little bit
of bug now let's come in here if you
want to get the length of our right you
have to come in here and put a dollar
sign in there right like that so a or a
hash symbol inside of there like this
and then you can come out here and put
another hash symbol that's how you get
the two lengths sorry about that little
error on tutorials sometimes make me
make errors and there you can go ray
length and this tells you how many items
in the array this tells you how many the
length of the individual item here we
went and printed out all of the
different items in a sorted manner so
there you are that is a whole bunch of
different ways to loop now let's take a
look at positional parameters and how
we're able to accept the values from the
command line
okay so positional parameters are
variables that can store that on the
command line in variable names zero
through nine however the variable 0 is
always going to contain the path to the
executed script so for the most part you
are going to be working with 1 through 9
now you're also going to be able to
access names past 9 but you're going to
have to use a parameter expansion like
this guy I'm right like this if you want
to go and get 10 all that stuff probably
didn't make any sense so what I'm going
to do here is actually just do it
and once I show you an example it'll all
make 100% sense
so let's go echo and we will go first
argument and let's go and get the first
argument right like this and then what
we're going to do is we're also going to
come in here and sum all the values that
are entered in off of the command line
so what I'm going to do here is go while
and we dollar son and hash and that's
going to tell you the number of
arguments the dollar sign and the hash
and greater than zero so it's going to
cycle through whoops make sure you don't
put a space there greater than zero and
do and now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to get the first argument that is
passed in from the command line just
show you whenever I run it it will make
on represent sense I'm going to go some
and I'm going to increment some by
whatever the first number is that they
passed inside of there and then I'm
going to call shift and shift is going
to move the value that is in the second
argument that they pass through the
command line into the one position and
then continue adding all those together
and now I'm going to come in here and
I'm going to execute this and it's all
going to make complete sense
so we'll go hello world and we'll say
something like one two three four and
five and there you can see first
argument is equal to one and why not end
the tutorial with a mistake because it
would also make a lot of sense if I want
to come in here and also show you the
sum of those values and how I would do
that is just come in here like this and
go sum and escape and W and let's come
in and run it again and there you can
see first it got the first argument
which is this guy right here and then it
summed all the other different arguments
in the that were passed from the command
line so there you go guys that is a
rundown of the basic syntax used in
writing shell scripts using bash hope
you guys found that useful and just like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
