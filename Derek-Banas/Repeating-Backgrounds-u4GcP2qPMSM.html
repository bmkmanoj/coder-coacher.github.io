tutorial on how to create seamless web
site backgrounds the reason I'm doing
this today is I was actually asked to do
this over the weekend three times by
three different people so I thought what
the heck I'm gonna do it well if you're
trying to create a seamless web site
background what I mean by that is what
we're going to do is we're going to
create one single image it's going to be
roughly 60 by 60 1 50 by 50 maybe 300 by
300 at the absolute most and we're going
to tile it in the background and it's
going to look seamless it's gonna not
show seems and it's a really great way
to create really beautiful backgrounds
without worrying about file size so what
we're going to do I'm going to show you
what is a good background image this
right here is just about perfect this
guy will be very easy to turn into a
seamless background and the reason why
are there are no repeating patterns it
is very irregular and it is also very
complicated people often think the best
images to use as backgrounds or
uncomplicated patterns if it's a flat
color obviously that's true but if what
you're for the most part looking for is
complication so this will be very easy
to turn into a seamless background this
is going to be one of the harder things
to turn into a seamless background and
the reason why is because of the lights
up here in the darks down here that
doesn't gel very well but i'm going to
show you how to get pretty good results
with that and this right here even
though there are patterns it is still
pretty complicated and pretty ill
regular and should be pretty easy to
turn into a background so what we're
going to do is start off with the
easiest first what we're simply going to
do this is 300 by 300 image and I'm just
going to select all and I'm going to go
to filter and I'm in Photoshop by the
way and I'm going to go to other and
then I'm going to go to offset now the
reason why you want this to be equal
links and also even numbers is because
you're going to have to put a half
inside of your half of what this is so
I'm going to put in 150 in horizontal
and 150 and vertical and then check on
wrap around and when I hit OK and there
you can see nothing really dramatically
changed which is really cool and the
reason why is it is extremely
complicated and even if I tried to
create this as a seamless background
right now I could pretty much pull it
off let's show okay i zoom down and what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna select on I'm
going to copy it and I'm going to go
image and the next one's going to be
much more complicated so there never
this easy all that
number select canvas size and i'm going
to change this to 900 this is just for
demonstration purposes and you can see
if i paste it in here everything lines
up seamlessly here for the most part now
if i would have went in and did a little
bit of editing this would it be
absolutely beautiful but I didn't
because I wanted you to see how
important it is to pick the right type
of image for your backgrounds so now
that was the first part now I'm going to
show you how to do a more complicated
guy alright so we got this one right
here so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to select all again and this time
I'm going to take it to total perfect
seamlessness I'm gonna go filter and I'm
gonna go other I'm gonna go offset again
and we'll leave this 150 x 150 because
these are 300 by 300 okay so that's
super now what we're gonna do is we're
going to go over here in the toolbar to
this band-aid this is called the healing
brush we're going to select that and
then I normally try to keep this pretty
small like in the 529 area hardness at
100 and spacing a 25-percent alright so
now what we're going to do is zoom in on
this a little bit and I'm just going to
get rid of all of the problems I'm gonna
get rid of this line basically I'm just
going to hold down alt option and come
in here and delete this imperfection
that is in here and then I'm just going
to continue to do that over and over
again what photoshop is going to do is
it's going to clean up everything real
nice for me i'm just getting rid of that
line that's there where are these images
join together so I'm doing about rocket
science and unlike with the rubber stamp
which I also could use and before the
healing brush was created that is
exactly what i did use this gives you a
lot better results because it sort of
blends everything in with whatever is in
the background switch this 25 for the
most part of making everything blue
because that seems to work better than
anything else here this is all based off
of your own belief though you're in
control here basically the whole point
of this is just to eliminate those lines
that's it and then you want to be real
careful when you get to the edge don't
touch that because if you do start
messing around with the edges it's going
to mess up what we did with offset
alright so it got rid of the line for
the most part everything's pretty well
cleaned up inside of this guy so let's
go and check and see how good of a job I
did I'm going to select it copy I'm
going to go image canvas size nine
hundred just like before and then paste
and as you can see everything is
seamless it's all going in here real
nice and it does not look like anything
is in tiles and there you go so that's
how to create a little bit harder
seamless background now I'm going to
create probably the hardest and that is
metal because the reasons I told you
before again this is a 300 by 300 piece
we're going to go in here select all
filter and I'm going to go into other
and I'm going to hit offset just like
before now you can see the problem look
see all the different colors that's bad
well there is a way around it and I
still have select all a copy and i'm
going to paste a new layer and then this
new layer I'm going to come over here in
the layers panel and I'm going to hit on
normal I'm gonna go down to what it's
called luminosity and select that then
select all hit filter I'm going to go
other I'm going to go to what is called
high pass and you can see this is kind
of me but it does get rid of that
problem or issue that we have there with
the colors now I'm going to go a little
bit the long way and there's a lot more
that I would do I'm going to actually
select this guy right here this
individual square I'm going to go to
image adjustments brightness contrast
and I'm going to hit ctrl or command age
depending upon what less you're on I'm
going to try to make this bought top
square the same as the bottom square
color wise as closely as possible and
it's always better to select from the
upper right-hand corner it's a little
bit easier to judge where you're
selecting and then again image
adjustments brightness contrast get rid
of that with the controller command H
take the brightness up and then select
the bottom one real careful to not
select the same part twice that you
already changed brightness for image
adjustments brightness contrast control
command H the reason I'm doing control
or command HC there's little dancing
things i think they're called dancing
ants that's what i'm getting rid of all
right that's almost perfect it ok I'm
going to go into filter and we go other
and
let's try high pass well first I want
select all filter other high pass now
you can see that it's a little bit
better here still get those lawns
showing up there there's definitely no
image issues this is just to buy I sort
of thing you just do it as much as you
want and we hit OK on that and then
guess what we do go in with the healing
brush again what you want to do is try
to avoid these things like these blobs
right here because they're gonna show up
over and over again actually what I
normally do is just get rid of them all
together there I don't have to worry
about it now you also want to try to
avoid lines because that's also gonna
make things not look realistic so I'm
gonna come in here and I'm sort of
zigzagging as I go and I'm just
co-learning over those lines like I just
showed you for in the previous tutorial
i get rid of this blob here you're rid
of this one remember don't touch the
outside edge I'm sort of zigzagging here
hey I saw it on purpose make this zig
zaggy rid of that I'm getting rid of
that this one doesn't even really seem
to be showing up drew over that line
then you can come in and go image
adjustments brightness contrast and then
turn the brightness back up a little bit
if you'd like turn the contrast up a
little bit turn it down a little bit
whatever you can to try smooth it out I
know now we're going to take this and
we're going to make it into a seamless
background image canvas size nine
hundred and you can see if a paste this
in here remember metals just about the
hardest thing to do this with but you
can see that it is well is pretty much
perfect so that is how you make seamless
backgrounds for websites you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below otherwise until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
