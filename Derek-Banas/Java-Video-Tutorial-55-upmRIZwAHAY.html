55 of my java video tutorial series well
so far in this tutorial we have created
our asteroids that bounce off of each
other and we have created a ship that
rotates now I'm going to really throw a
monkey wrench into this whole entire
tutorial because in the past I've mainly
focused on the math behind programming
again in this part of the tutorial I'm
going to focus on the object oriented
design principles behind designing a
game right and on top of that how
exactly to solve problems now this ship
you may be surprised is now moving
around on the screen and also it is
floating in a completely different way
and you can see that not only is it
accelerating in certain directions but
I'm also able to rotate it and then
switch it around and have it fly in
completely different directions now how
exactly would you go from what we've
created so far using object-oriented
design principles to make this much more
advanced spaceship in this tutorial I'm
going to walk you step-by-step through
how to solve that very important issue
when we're going to design a ship you
have to go through a series of different
steps now all programmers do this in a
completely different way but what I like
to start out with is to list the
features of spaceship we're going to
throw our previous spaceship design
right out the window because we're going
to use object oriented design principles
and do this the right way
now what are we going to do here based
off of what you previously saw we're
going to move the ship around the screen
and this is just a listing of all our
features this is extremely important if
you want to be able to solve most any
problem we're going to rotate the ship
clockwise when D is pressed and we
solved that previously we're also going
to rotate the ship counterclockwise when
a is pressed on top of that your
customer would say I want the ship to
rotate in any direction 360 degrees that
throws a monkey wrench in how we're
using polygons and how would rotate and
currently because that just doesn't work
and you're going to see as this goes on
we're going to solve more and more
problems want to be able to increase
velocity slowly as you saw the velocity
picked up when W is pressed that's
something else we didn't calculate and
that also is a floating-point sort of
situation we're going to have to solve
if the ship goes off the board have it
appear on the other side welp that also
needs change because we had it set up so
that it would bounce off the side of the
screen if the ship it's something
explode okay something else brand-new
also the customer would say I want the
ship to continue on its current path but
still be able to rotate something else
completely different as you saw the ship
would continue based off of where I was
thrusting it but also allow for it to
change directions so that's something
else we got to do and then on top of
that use encapsulation so the
application is more flexible ok so those
are our features those are all things
that we're going to need to implement
whenever we create our new spaceship
class now what a lot of people do is
they use a case diagram after they
create this list of features and it's
normally at drawing I personally don't
like to use them because I get the same
thing out of just typing out everything
so you could draw you know a stick
figure or something that would represent
the player and then what I just simply
would do is type in that the player
starts the game so there's your first
step of your use case they move the ship
this is to just make everything as
simple as humanly possible how are they
going to move the ship well they're
going to rotate the ship and also
they're going to increase the velocity
of the ship and then finally if the ship
crashes start over okay so there's my
basic use case sort of diagram without
pictures you know like I said you can
draw a picture of the player if you
really wanted to do that but and then
what do we need to do well then we need
to either define our risks or our
problem code this is what is going to be
the basis of all the fields that we're
going to need or variables as well as
all the methods or
functions whatever you want to call it
well there are our problems I've already
talked about them 360 degree rotation
means we have to use doubles we can no
longer rely on integers because that's
not going to work if we went 360 degree
rotation what's something else well my
polygons are built using int arrays
that's an issue because I just said in
part one here of a risks or potential
problem code that we're going to need to
use doubles so how are we going to get
around that one there's something else
and then floating point calculations
lose precision okay there's something
else we need to worry about and how are
we going to solve it how do we slowly
increase velocity there's another issue
again forcing us to use floating-point
numbers how can we rotate the ship while
maintaining the current course something
else we didn't think about how do we
move the ship when it goes off the board
another issue that we have not thought
about okay so those are really the main
things I have already solved collision
issues in previous tutorials so I'm not
gonna really worry about that right now
whenever you get through your features
and your use case diagrams and all these
different things you want to focus on
the things you don't know how to solve
so let's think about what exactly we can
do here to solve these guys well one
thing which we've actually used in the
past which is affine transform that
solves a lot of our problems because
it's going to allow us to do a whole
bunch things use doubles for rotation
and then just have it worry about that
and all the precision issues that we've
had previously and we can also let the
polygons be an int array meaning that
it's points are going to be defined by
two integer arrays they contain both the
X and the y points but have the center
the a double so there you are now we're
going to solve a lot of the other issues
we're going to have the center be a
double but have the polygon and remain
as just an integer array so we're going
to be able to still use those wonderful
polygons and when the
ship goes off the board just change the
center points all right there with just
that little change to our code we're
going to solve a whole bunch of our
problems 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 6 okay so all of those
risks right there are all fixed just
simply by using affine transform as well
as going in and defining our center
point as being a double that's going to
solve a ton of problems for us so let's
go through here and solve all our other
problems I'm just gonna get rid of this
here for a second solve some more
problems
okay well we'll create some velocity
methods that increase and decrease
velocity and that guy right there is
going to solve problem 4 how do we
slowly increase velocity and I just
threw in the decrease velocity because I
think I might want to do that as well
and then finally that just leaves us
with how can we rotate your ship while
maintaining the current course we can
simply solve that problem by having a
rotation angle for current movement and
then also have a separate one have a
rotation angle for the ship's rotation
so we're going to have a movement
rotation and we're going to have a ship
rotation totally separate so this is
going to handle where it's currently
moving and the angle in which it's
moving and this guy is going to handle
the actual ship rotation what's going on
on the screen okay so there we are we
solved all of our risks and all those
different things right there so now what
we move on to is a scenario and here
basically we're just going to walk
through the player playing our game
let's just give ourselves some screen
space here okay in this scenario we're
going to draw a polygon center of the
screen with points surrounding center
points what this is going to do by
working our way through this this is
going to tell us exactly what fields and
methods we're going to use so what are
we going to need here a to do this we're
going to need game board width and
height so those are some fields that
we're going to need Center points for
polygons x and y polygons x and y
integer array obviously and we might
need upper left-hand corner x and y so
we're
think it through this process so we're
gonna put everything in here we might
have as well as things we know we
definitely need I'm just going to put a
question mark there just so that I'm
able to see that and say yeah might not
need that okay so then we're going to
move on with our scenario the player is
going to increase the ship velocity okay
so what are we going to need to be able
to handle that situation well we're
going to need x and y velocity methods
as well as fields and we're also going
to need the ability to increase the
velocity as well as decrease based off
of what we had before
and the scenario continues player
rotates ship hey what are we going to
need to handle here move that up there
we're going to need a rotation angle
definitely going to have to store that
and also methods that are going to allow
us to change it we're going to need a
movement angle and we're also going to
on the fly because we're going to
continue using the rotation angle and
change it based off of keyboard presses
but the movement angle is actually going
to have to be calculated on the fly so
we're going to have to calculate
movement angle so some things to think
about there and then finally player it's
a rock and blows up so there is our
scenario that we have right there so now
based off of all this stuff we're going
to create all of our fields and methods
and we're going to use a UML class
diagram to do that so I'm just going to
go spaceship and start defining these
guys so I'm gonna need my game board
width as I saw on the left side of the
screen so just create that guy I'm also
going to need my game board height
that's also going to be an integer
cuz I'm gonna need to know where the
center is and that's the only way I'm
gonna be able to figure that out then
I'm gonna need my center point for my
ship like said for that's gonna be a
double my center point Y also gonna be a
double these are all the fields or
variables whatever you want to call them
then we're gonna need our polygon x-ray
and that's going to be an integer array
poly yra
also going to be an integer array ship
with that's going to be an integer ship
height also an integer then we have our
upper left hand x position again I'm not
sure if I'm going to use that but let's
just throw it in here and see what
happens and upper left hand Y position
also going to be a double and then we're
going to have to be
able to change our velocity so X
velocity double y velocity also going to
be a double rotation angle double I'm
going to say moving angle also going to
be a double and that's it
so these which are all defined over here
I mean you can see X Y velocity all
these things line up with what we have
on the right side of our screen and that
is as far as I can tell right now after
I work through this scenario the only
fields that I'm going to need to create
a spaceship now I get to think about
what methods am I going to need well I'm
going to need a spaceship method which
is going to receive an integer array
another integer array and those are to
define the x and y coordinates for my
polygons and the number of coordinates
so there's one method I'm also going to
have to get the X center point form a
ship or my polygon and that's going to
be a double remember we have to have
that be a double because we want a lot
of precision with this guy and then
we're also going to need the Y point for
that and that also is going to return a
double value whenever it's called guess
what else we're going to need to do
we're going to need to set these
positions right here so just change this
to set instead of get we're also going
to want to be able to change our x
position so I'm going to call that
increase X position and we're going to
pass it a double so that it knows how
much to increase by and it's not going
to return anything whenever it's done if
we're going to increase X we're also
going to increase the Y position if I
want to get my upper left-hand x
position gonna do it that way and it's
going to return a double and then it's
going to do exactly the same thing for
the Y position and then guess what since
we have our little get functions here
we're probably also going to want set
functions so just do that we're also
going to want to get our ship with and
that's an integer in this situation it
might actually make more sense to copy
this guy over to here which is what I'm
going to do much better now you can see
what exactly I need to get whatever and
this is going to be height what else do
we have over here well we have velocity
there's X velocity so let's get that as
well and velocity is a double so that's
going to be a double and then we're
going to do the same thing for the Y
velocity and then of course we have get
means we need a set so set and set then
let's just keep all moving on here we
said that we want to be able to increase
our velocity as well as decrease our
velocity let's just get this guy right
here pace that in there
this is going to be increase and it's
going to receive a double and it's not
going to return anything so just set
that to void and then anytime we
increase chances are we're going to want
to decrease not definitely but
definitely a possibility
and then these beginning stages that's
exactly what you're going to do you just
want to cover all your bases so you can
start writing some code afterwards then
we get down into these guys rotation
angles and moving angles well you're
going to want to set your moving angle
and you're just going to put a double
inside of there and if you set you want
to get also going to want to probably
increase your moving angle and then with
and then remember we were talking about
previously moving angle is going to be
calculated on the fly and the angle is
going to be based off of X&amp;amp;Y positions
so we're going to go ship X move angle
that might be a little bit complicated
to understand right now but whenever we
get into the code you'll get it because
I'm using some trigonometry here and
then we're going to do the same thing
for the rotation angle so get rotation
angle and then set rotation angle and
then we're also going to have increase
rotation angle and decrease it and the
only other thing is get bounds which is
going to handle collisions for us and
it's not going to return anything and
finally the Big Daddy move which is
going to make this whole thing run so I
hope I helped explain exactly how you go
from a problem an issue right to how to
actually create all of the code and
fields and methods in the next part of
the tutorial we're going to take this
UML diagram that we created here and
actually make the program that you saw
at the very beginning of this tutorial
