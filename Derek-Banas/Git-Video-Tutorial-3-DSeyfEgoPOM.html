3 of my get video tutorial today I'm
going to cover branching commits head
checkout merge conflicts merge tool
rebasing reset clean and a whole bunch
of other different things part of this
tutorials going to be in presentation
format so I can show you a bunch of
diagrams so all of this makes a lot of
sense but the majority of it is going to
take place in the terminal so you can
see exactly how things work so I have a
lot to do so let's get into it okay so
basically branching is going to allow us
to take a project in our own direction
without affecting the main code that is
the whole purpose of it and the main
reason you're going to want to do this
is so that you can go and work with code
without introducing potentially unstable
code to what is called the master branch
now what you see here on the screen is
basically what happens each time you
commit a project each of these files is
going to be given a unique hash code as
you can see on the right side of the
screen and then a tree object is going
to contain those files and the
associated hash codes on top of that a
commit object is going to store a
reference to the tree and other data
such as the author or the commit
comments or well actually most
importantly a reference to the previous
commits and all of that data now the
default branch is called the master and
as you make additional commits the
current newest version is going to be
referred to as the master commit and
this is where branches come in if you
create a branch you can go in a
completely different direction like I
said with a project without affecting
the master of course until it merges
into the master each of those branches
is basically just a pointer to a
committed version of files and each time
you create a branch that doesn't create
a whole new set of files you can
actually create numerous different
branches all on one big giant block of
code but however if you're doing this be
very careful because it would be
possible if let's say you change the
exact same file on one branch as you do
on another branch for you to have merge
conflicts later on and I'm going to
demonstrate exactly what that looks like
when that happens
what you do to solve it so you may ask
yourself well how do I know how to point
at the branch that I want to work at or
the commit I want to work with well
basically you're going to use a pointer
that is referred to as head as you can
see right here this is saying I want to
work with this very specific branch and
you're specifically going to point at
the branch or the commit you want to
work with by using a command called
check out course whenever you're
finished with your branch you can merge
it back into the master commit and then
move on and of course you're going to be
able to make all of these changes either
locally or remotely all right so let's
go and take a look at exactly how we're
gonna do all this stuff in the terminal
ok so here we are in the terminal and
I'm gonna show you how to create a
branch and then how to switch to it now
there's actually two ways to do this we
can create our branch by going get
branch fix 20 and then follow that up
with gets check out fix 20 which is
gonna switch to it but it is much easier
to just go get checkout - be fixed 20
this is going to create the new branch
and then switch to it and there you can
see we switched over to it now let's say
I want to go into vim and make some
changes to a file so let's go XML and we
are in the branch right now
ok so we're not going to be affecting
any other code I'm gonna change to
insert mode and then I'm gonna come down
here to random comments and let's just
change this to to exit out of there : WQ
okay so we made that change now I'm
gonna go in here and go get commit - a -
M and I'm going to say added branch fix
20 Bob Loblaw blah blah this is gonna
commit the change but it's not going to
affect the master in any way okay so
there you can see I made that change now
I can go over and to the master check
out master like that now what I'm gonna
be able to do is push the branch over to
github and that's pretty easy we're just
gonna go get push origin fix 20 there
you can see and then we can jump over to
github and see that it's there let's
reload the page you can see right here
it says one branch reload it and now you
can see it has two branches so there we
go got that set I'll jump back over into
the terminal one
that's important to know however is if
you go get fetch this is somebody else
origin like that what's gonna happen is
they're going to receive a reference to
the branch on the server but they're not
gonna get all the files so just so you
know that however if you would want to
actually get the whole entire branch
what you're gonna do is go get checkout
- be fix 20 origin fix 20 but we don't
want to do that but if you did want to
actually get the branch that is exactly
the command you would use to get it now
if you want to see all of your branches
well just clear the scroll back here all
you need to do is go get branch like
that and it's gonna show the master as
well as fix 20 which we just created if
you want to see all the merged branches
well the only thing that's gonna show up
as the master all you do is type in - -
merged you can see master shows up and
of course if you want to see the
unmerged - - no merged you can see there
is fix 20 you can also show all the
branches as well as the last commit by
just going get branch - be there you can
see and you can also see right here
where we have the star that is a
reference to the current branch that we
were working with clear to scroll back
then if we want to just make sure they
eat member we're on the master branch
fest dot XML you can see right there
that the comment has 9 so you know that
that's not merged out of that if we do
want to merge our change now to the
master we just go get merge fix 20 right
like that and now we can go into vim
again just to prove that it has been
merged and there you can see random
Coleman is - so there we go
quit out of that now if we go get branch
you can see the fix 20 is still there
but since we merged it probably we're
not gonna want to keep it so let's
delete it to delete it you just go get
branch
- d4 delete fix 20 there it's deleted
and then just to prove it we can go get
branch again and see that the master is
there but fix 20 is gone in some
situations you're gonna want to also be
able to delete unmerged branches if
there was a mistake or something made
all you need to do there is just go get
branch again it's going to be a d but
it's going to be a capital d so
act like you're really mad and type that
in but fixed when he's already been
deleted so you would use the Big D if
you want to delete unmerged branches you
would want to use the little D if you
want to delete merge branches okay you
can also go in and delete the branch on
github by going get push origin and then
I'm gonna type : and fix 20 because it's
still on get up and we can see that that
happens by going into github there we
are
now it says two branches and then we're
gonna refresh and now it's gonna say one
branch so that's how you do that okay
back in the terminal now I'm going to
show you a more complicated thing now
I'm going to cover multiple branches and
more specifically what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create merge conflicts
just so we can see how to resolve them
but before I leave I just want to show
you how to change the name on a branch
git branch - M and then you would just
type in whenever you want the new branch
name today all right so let's jump over
here and start creating some merge
conflicts all right so I'm gonna go get
check out - B and let's just call this
fix 21 this is gonna create a branch and
switch to it just like before now let's
go in and let's edit our
androidmanifest.xml there we go insert
mode by pressing I and let's just change
this to 3 there we go
and we saved it now I'm gonna go get
commit - a - M and I'm going to say
changed comment to 3 there we go
all that's been committed I have however
not merged it and this is very calm and
you're not always going to merge of
course because that would defeat the
purpose of using branches so we're going
to now go back to the master there we go
switch to the master branch we can come
in here and jump into the manifest again
just to verify that it has not been
changed to 3 and you can see right there
it hasn't been we're just going to quit
out of that now let's say we want to
create a new branch and very often
whenever you need to go in and make a
very quick fix to something that you
know you're going to merge you use the
preference hotfix so we're going to
create a new branch called hotfix and we
are going to switch over to it there we
go
and go and open up androidmanifest.xml
there we are
and let's change this to four and on top
of that let's type in hotfix
just so we know we got something there
and we're gonna save that and now we're
going to commit it so git commit Jim and
added hotfix
okay so we have two different versions
of that file saved and this is going to
cost ourselves some problems so that we
went fixed it now we're gonna go get
checkout switch back over into our
master and then we're gonna go get merge
hotfix
and this is not going to have any
problems because we've only changed one
file so there you go fast-forward and
the file has been changed clear scroll
back and we can go and check Android
manifest XML and there you can see it
says hotfix exactly like we expected so
let's quit out of that and now let's
cause some problems we're gonna delete
our hotfix
little D remember because it has been
merged there it is deleted now let's go
over check out fix 21 like that's what I
called it yep there it is I'm going to
however wants a guarantee that I am over
in our master there we go now we're
going to try to merge fix 21 so merge
fix 21 and we're gonna get some errors
because there's a different version of
the Android manifest on what we have
here multiple different brands just
causes problems it's going to try to
automate but you're gonna see right
there it says conflict merge conflict in
androidmanifest.xml automatic merge
failed it didn't work so let's try to
make it work well one thing we could do
is we could say well we don't really
need that anymore so we're just going to
delete it because we made a change
somewhere else and since we you know
basically made exactly to save change we
change the comment we could delete it
however since it's not merged what we
need to do is type in Big D fix 21 that
is one way to resolve it another way to
resolve it is to use what is called a
merge tool now you're going to maybe
have to install this for yourself and
I'll leave that to you because it's
quite easy to do but what I'm gonna do
here is I'm just gonna use the default
merge tool there you go and it's gonna
say hit return to start figuring out
how we're gonna solve this issue there
we go and it's gonna automatically open
up for me now what you're gonna see here
on the left side of the screen is one
version of the code what you see on the
right side of the screen is another
version of the code so basically what
we're going to need to do here is figure
out which version we want so I could
also go in and actually rent you know go
into the code inside of them and change
it but it's very often this works and
it's nice and easy so what I'm gonna
decide is the hotfix was right and the
other version that I have over anyhow
fixed 21 was wrong so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna come down to actions in
this situation and I'm gonna say choose
left there we go
you can you know basically just have to
decide on what exactly you want to do
then I'm gonna go over here to file and
I'm gonna say that I want to save merge
there we go then we can close this and
here we are back over in our terminal
clear our scroll back now if you type in
LS we can go in and actually see what's
going on with this androidmanifest
with the original little extension at
the end versus this one so let's go into
vim let's take a look at the original
first and there you can see exactly this
is where we could have came in and
decided right here inside of them and
saved it and got rid of all of our
issues and that's definitely something
we could do
I'm gonna quit out of this and now let's
take a look at what the actual XML now
looks like and you can see right here
that we have the hotfix version that's
right there okay we can quit out of this
then we could decide that we want to
remove that original say we prefer the
way the other one looks remove boom
there we go LS now we got that rid of
that extra file another thing that could
show up here is androidmanifest.xml this
happens if you don't exit your merge
tool in the proper way you could also
see extensions on that like instead of
original you could also see backup and
that's going to contain the file before
we called for the merge you could also
see base which is going to be the common
ancestor of the files that were we were
trying to merge you could see local
which is going to be the version that we
were pointing at with head whenever we
whatever specifically we had checked out
or we could also see remote and this is
going to be the branch being merged into
the head okay so just clear
so you know exactly what all of that
means now however if we go get branch we
have everything resolved we still have
fixed 21 there so what we want to do in
this situation is see if it's in its
merged form or its non merged one get
branch - - no - merged and you can see
it shows up right there so what that
tells us is if we want to delete it we
have to go get branch with a big D and
fix 21 and now it's deleted and if we
can go get branch you're gonna see that
only master is there so that's how we
can go in and resolve these different
issues that we have so you may be asking
yourself what happens if you are ever
left behind and by Left Behind I mean
that numerous other commits have been
committed and meanwhile you're back on a
previous commit with your branch well
basically that is going to be solved by
what is called rebasing and what
rebasing basically does is it just moves
a branch to a new master or base commit
and very often you might hear somebody
refer to this as a fast-forward merge
there's different names people throw
around when using it but what you must
understand is you never want to rebase
commits that have been pushed to a
public repository if you remember that
one rule you should never have really
any problems with rebasing so let's jump
back over into our terminal and let's go
get checkout e and fix 20 - there we go
created a new branch now let's go in and
let's edit our android manifest again
there we go I'm down here and let's say
that we're still holding a vendetta
against the whole hotfix issue so we
want to get rid of that and let's just
type in 5 and let's save it go in here
to get commit a - M and we'll say
something like changed the comment to 5
and there we are now we're gonna go in
and create another hotfix
check out - b hotfix now in this
situation we're going to edit a file
other remember we're in the hotfix
branch we're just going to try to avoid
conflicts by going in and changing
another one of these files just to keep
it simple won't we just change the
reading
and there we are and let's just come in
here and let's just do something silly
like hotfix
happy cow and let's save that jumped out
of there get commit okay this is going
to commit the hotfix
read me whatever file has been changed
then we'll go get check out jump back
over into the master clear that out git
merge hotfix we can delete our hotfix
now gone yet check out fix 22 and now
just understand that the readme has been
changed inside of the commit there is a
brand new commit inside of it
however the fix 22 is still tied to the
previous commit and we can see that
that's true by going vim readme MD
see there's no hotfix here so if we want
to go and get the readme from the
current commit and then save it inside
of here what we're gonna need to do is
rebase so let's quit out of that and to
do that we just go get rebase master and
whenever we do that we can now go into
vim readme MD you can see the hot fixes
there so we were able to go and move our
branch which is the fix 22 over to the
current commit quite easily it's simple
quit out of that and that is basically
how rebasing works now let's talk about
the difference between reverting versus
resetting now sometimes you're gonna
want to eliminate a previous commit but
more than likely you're still going to
want to keep the commit just for
integrity reasons okay it's very very
important now what revert does is it
undoes whatever changes were made in
that commit by making a new commit so if
this is the commit that we're going to
want to undo it creates a new commit
which is basically going to eliminate
what was done in this one and then it's
going to move that ahead so basically
it's almost like an undo and there's
going to be proof of the fact that there
was an undo resetting on the other hand
actually deletes the commit and that can
indeed cause a lot of problems here
we're undoing it we
and we have proof that there was an undo
here it just disappears okay so now
we're gonna jump over into this guy and
we're gonna do something just basically
so we can reset it so let's just go vim
androidmanifest.xml there we are we're
inside of here and we're gonna say
something that we plan on deleting like
this comment here and we're gonna say my
boss is a jerk okay so we might want to
change that at some point in time so
we're going to save this and now we're
going to commit that I'm gonna say
something like I told the truth
today and there you can see it has been
inserted however let's say that after I
type that in I decided that I want to
keep my job and I want to revert this is
actually still gonna keep proof that
this change actually occurred but we're
gonna go get revert head right like that
and this is going to be a revert and we
could come in here and say something
like I had a typo
save that and if we go into the Android
manifest you're going to see that that
is gone so that happens and the commit
has actually been registered however we
are not going to have it in the current
version of our master files close out of
that if however you want to completely
obliterate that commit from ever
actually if current you just go get
reset and then type in some file name
whatever file you want to get rid of if
you would just type in get reset what
that's gonna do is reset the staging
area to match the most recent version of
the commit however this is going to
leave the working directory completely
unchanged get reset and actually typing
in a commit is going to move back to the
previous commit it's also going to reset
the staging area but again it isn't
going to do anything to the working
directory get reset - - hard however is
going to both reset the staging area as
well as the working directory to match
the most recent commit and get reset
hard and then an actual commit right
here is going to move back to the commit
listed as well as change the staging and
the working directory so I don't really
use reset very much because it's bad
practice and I will
tell you that you probably shouldn't use
it but I wanted to cover it nonetheless
and the final thing we have here is
something else that I barely ever used
and this is called clean now basically
what clean does is it's going to remove
untracked files from the directory and
it is undoable which is a very bad thing
reset is also undoable that's why we
don't want to use it but I just wanted
to cover the commands here to end off
just so you know what they are so if we
go get cleaned this one doesn't hurt
anything what this is gonna do is show
the files that would be removed if you
actually ran clean then if you went in
and went get clean - f this is going to
remove untracked files get clean - DF is
going to remove untracked files and
untracked directories in the current
directory and then once again if you
wanted to do a lot of damage you would
go get clean DF which is gonna remove
all untracked files and then you could
also go into reset - - hard which is
going to undo all of the changes on all
of your tracked files so there is a lot
of stuff about git in the next part of
the tutorial I'm going to go over basic
workflow inside of git and pretty much
end the entire tutorial please leave
your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
