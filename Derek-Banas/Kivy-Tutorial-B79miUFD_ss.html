kevie video tutorial on this one
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
install keavy on both windows as well as
on Apple Mac OS and we will also write a
beginning basic program to make sure
everything is installed now keavy is a
graphical user interface python library
that's going to allow us to develop on
multi platforms and by multi-platforms I
mean Windows Mac OS Android iOS Linux as
well as Raspberry Pi in my opinion it is
the best GUI option available for Python
and in this tutorial we are going to see
how everything is set up and on top of
that keavy is also going to for the most
part outperform
html5 cross-platform alternatives so I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so first I'm going to show you how
to install it on Mac then I'm going to
show you on Windows then I'm going to
show you how to write a program so on a
Macintosh you're going to go to TV
dot-org and then download and then of
course you're going to have to have
Python installed and I have a link in
the description underneath the video if
you click on that it's going to show you
how to install Python as well as how to
install PyCharm
I'm going to make everything work with
PyCharm as well so I didn't want to go
through that whole process again and
chances are if you are following my
learned the program series you already
know how to install Python and PyCharm
but if not in the description you can
find a link to that so if you're on Mac
you're going to click on this we're
going to be using Python 3 so you just
click on that guy and install that or
it's going to download for you then
after you do that you're going to open
up your terminal it's in your
Applications folder on Mac and you're
just going to type in this is going to
be wherever the directory is that you
downloaded keavy into so more than
likely if you're installing this now
you're going to get kV 1.9 point one and
you're going to change to that directory
then you're going to type in sudo move
key v3 dot app and move it into your
Applications folder again in the
description I have a link and you can
copy and paste this stuff so you don't
you know accidentally miss a space or
miss a period some
whatever and you're going to type in
this line or copy and paste this line
into your terminal and then you're going
to type in key V just to make sure it
works and it's going to come in here
it's going to work with Python 3.5 if
you have that all set up and it's going
to open up your Python interpreter and
to see if everything worked you just
type in import key V hit enter and if
you don't see any error messages you see
basically what you have here you know
that it works then to get out of the
Python interpreter you're going to type
in quit with the two parentheses get out
of that and then you're going to be able
to run your key V applications by just
typing in key V and whatever the name of
your Python application is now I'm going
to jump over show you how to install on
Windows and then we are going to write
applications so that you can test to
make sure that everything works
perfectly alright so to install on
windows what you're going to do is
you're not going to go to the kiva.org
site you are just going to open up your
command prompt and you're going to type
in Python it doesn't have to be in the
downloads folder can be anywhere you're
going to type in Python - M pip install
and upgrade pip wheel setup tools and
it's going to download a whole bunch
thanks pretty quick then after you do
that you are then going to type in
Python - M pip install and doc utils
pigments and all of these other
different things and you're going to hit
enter and it's going to download all of
that stuff like I said just click on the
link in the description copy and paste
the stuff pasted into your command
prompt and everything is going to work
and this is on windows just want to
reiterate that then to install key V in
the command prompt you're going to type
in Python - M pip install TV and all of
that is going to download and as long as
you don't see any errors you are ready
to go alright so now that we have all
that installed what I'm going to do is
I'm going to create a file and it's
going to be called key V Tut dot py it's
a Python file and I'm going to create
this first inside a Macintosh then I'm
going to create it windows and you're
going to see them both run so if you
want to use key v first you're going to
have to import the key v module and
don't worry about any errors that you
might see right now all that's going to
get fixed and you can type in key V and
require
and in this part of the tutorial we are
using one point nine point one I believe
but I'm just going to put 0 inside of
there just so we use the right one
you're going to have to import some more
TV modules inside of here app import app
and this is going to give you the
ability to use all the different fields
as well as methods provided by TV and in
the next part of the tutorial we'll
really get into some cool stuff right
now I just want to make sure that
everything is set up and we will import
label and then what we want to do like I
said we want to inherit key B's app
class and that's actually going to
represent the window that is on the
screen that you're going to put all of
your widgets inside of and to that we're
going to say class and I'm going to call
this hello TV and pass app inside of
there and then basically we can call a
function called build and this is going
to return the content we want in the
window so it's self inside of there and
then what we want to do is we're going
to open up a window and we are going to
return a label widget with hello key V
inside of it so you're going to go
return and label and the text you want
for this label is just going to be a low
key V and then you just have to go and
create the object for it so I'm going to
call this a low-key V is equal to and
low-key V to create that low key V
object and then to run everything you
just go hello TV and you call for run
all right and that is it and that's
called key B touch py then inside of
your terminal you're going to have to
it's going to work different on Macs
than it does on Windows so basically on
Macintosh you're going to want to make
sure that you are in the folder so here
is key v py so you're going to want to
change directory to the directory where
you save this python file and then to
run it you're just going to type in TV
TV Tut dot py hit enter
and there it is there is your
application and you know that everything
has been properly installed and you will
be ready to do more advanced things
after that so now just to prove that all
this works exactly the same on Windows
and this is Python were running this one
I'm going to copy this and Here I am in
the world of Windows so I'm going to
paste all of that directly inside of
there and the one difference between
running this on a Macintosh with PyCharm
versus running it on Windows with by
charm is you're going to be able to run
it directly inside of PyCharm you're not
going to have to do the thing with the
terminal and we're going to save this as
GV Tut py there it is TV Tut py and same
thing and we'll say ok just to give it
the same name and then to run it you're
just going to right click and then
you're going to see run unit tests in
key v Tut hit enter and boom there's
your application so on Windows you don't
have to do the whole terminal thing you
can just right click in here and
automatically run it and everything's
going to work perfectly so now I'm going
to jump back over into the world of Mac
and show you something else we can do
with TV so what we're going to do is
we're just gonna copy and paste this
because TV gives us the option to
separate the presentation layer from the
logic layer and we're going to use a
special TV file to the in this situation
transport the label inside of here with
the text you're going to see exactly how
this works so basically we're going to
keep everything here pretty much the
same except I am going to here I just
created a new file called key V Tut 2 py
and here I'm going to put app inside of
here the app part is important and
you're going to see why here in a moment
then down inside of the build section
what I'm going to do is once again
return a label widget with hello key V
inside of it but I'm going to be
referencing a key V file here so we're
going to do instead of having the text
part be inside of here going to delete
that part and then I'm going to
reference another file that's going to
have all the the text inside of it so
that's all I changed
went and just got rid of that and I put
a pup here instead of that now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create a new
file called hello.c V dot K V and
whenever you are naming this the name of
the K V file has to be hello ki v and
the reason why is we call this hello ki
V app so basically the K V file is going
to be whatever precedes the app part
right there so just simply a Loki V that
way they're going to be able to match
each other up and provide that
information so now inside of here and
like I said we're going to do this so we
can separate the logic from the
presentation layer so to create our
label over inside of here we're just
going to say label and colon tab in and
then we'll put our text inside of here
whenever we do more complicated examples
that you'll see exactly why something
like this could be a good idea so we're
going to save it and we're going to
bounce over here and we're going to save
that and then over inside of the
terminal once again we are going to
change this to TV tight too so come over
here change it to that and run it whoop
and I got a little bit of an error
because I was being silly make sure you
put app inside of there and save it and
run it again and there you can see the
low key V shows up and if you just want
to make sure that this indeed is a
completely different thing you can put
the two inside of there save that and
rerun it again and here it says hello
tv2 alright so now to prove that
everything works the same on Windows as
well as McIntosh I am just going to copy
this bounce over inside of Windows I am
in Windows right now paste that inside
of there jump back over is out of here
copy this file right here and this is
going to be hello key vkv and I'm going
to go file and then I'm going to say new
file and this one's going to be hello
key B dot K V okay and it's going to pop
this up it's not going to know what that
is just leave it as text right now click
on OK paste in these exact same
information you had before
and save it jump back over inside of
here everything else should be exactly
the same
we will click and if it doesn't give you
the option to run you come up here and
click on run unit tests in key B Tut and
whenever you do you're going to see
Hello key v2 shows up right there so
there you go guys this is the beginning
of what will be a really fun tutorial
just one to keep everything short and
sweet to make sure that everybody can
get everything installed perfectly and
like always please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
