tutorial on how to set up visual studio
code for C++ as well as Arduino on Mac
OS you guys have asked me for this
tutorial and so I shall make it as soon
as I work out the bugs on how to set
everything up for Windows I will do that
but first I'm gonna cover Mac OS and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so I'm gonna be moving pretty
quickly here so prepare yourself to hit
the pause button very first thing you're
gonna want to do is go command and space
and then you're gonna type in terminal
and we're gonna set up G plus plus what
you need to do in the terminal is just
type in G plus plus if you get the error
message that you see right here that
means it's already installed in that
situation you can go G + + - - version
like this and you should see someone and
something either four point eight point
four or something higher than that if
you don't see that what you're going to
do is you want to go to the App Store
and you're going to download Xcode
update here but you're gonna have
install so click on install and install
Xcode after you do that you're going to
open up your terminal again and you're
gonna type in Xcode - select and then
two more dashes and install and what
we're gonna do is we're gonna go and
install Visual Studio code so you're
gonna go to code Digital Studio dot-com
and just click on download for Mac
whenever you do that you're gonna see
this little guy down here pop-up and of
course you're gonna click on that and
then click on open and then you're going
to download Visual Studio code and
you're gonna drag it into your
Applications folder then we're gonna
open up visual studio code and you're
gonna come over here on the left side of
the screen where it says extensions and
click on that then over here you're
going to see C and C++ this guy right
here and you're gonna click on install
after you have that all set up you're
gonna come over here and click on reload
and everything is going to be installed
in regards to C and C++ we're then going
to come in here and verify all this and
how you're gonna do this is you're gonna
come in here and set up your settings
and you're gonna come over here and
click on this little widget and then
click on settings and then inside of
here you're gonna be able to do things
like change your font size or define new
fonts or whatever you want to use and
what I do is I just copy you know
premier pasted him over here and then
make the changes that I would like and I
prefer to have a bigger text so I
changed that and I don't like the Menlo
typeface so I went and got rid of it and
just put Monaco in there instead and
what you're gonna do is come up here and
go file and save workspace as I typed in
C++ taught one dot code whatever you can
name it whatever you want it to you
don't be named and then click on save
and you're gonna come over here and
click on your file explorer and you're
gonna click on add folder and then
you're gonna be able to define wherever
you want your folder to be defined and
he gonna click on add after that just to
verify that c++ is working you're gonna
create a new file and then you can just
type in exactly what I have here on the
screen and make sure it's exactly the
same then what we're gonna do is come up
here and go view and command palette
click on that then you're gonna type in
tasks and you're gonna come down here
and click on configure task after that
it's gonna give you the option of create
task JSON file from template and you're
gonna click on that then you're gonna
come down here where it says others and
click on that then this guy is gonna pop
up inside of here everything is
perfectly fine you don't need to make
any changes just want to verify that
everything looks basically like this and
you see g plus plus that just means that
it was able to find g plus plus that you
installed earlier in this tutorial then
you're going to open up extensions again
by clicking this guy right here and
you're gonna type in code with a space
followed boy Runner and then you know
click on install this guy's gonna open
up you're gonna click on reload now what
you're gonna be able to do inside of
your hello world dot CPP file is just
right click on your screen and run codes
gonna open up here and your click on
that and then you're gonna see down here
that hello world prints out so you know
that C++ is properly set up inside a
visual studio code now we're gonna set
up Arduino so you're going once again
click on extensions and you're gonna
type in platform I owe - IDE and this
guy's gonna pop up you're gonna click on
install then it's gonna open up on the
right side of your screen you're gonna
click on reload then down here in the
bottom of your screen you're gonna see
installing platform IO IDE you're gonna
have to sit here and wait it might take
you a minute or whatever but you're
gonna have to sit and wait until it all
installs and then whenever you see it's
a platform IO IDE has been successfully
installed everything
fine so you're gonna click on reload now
and then you're gonna see this guy pop
up and this is where we're gonna run art
or Arduino projects so you're just gonna
click on new project and then you're
gonna search until you find Arduino Uno
or at least that's what I'm using and
then you're gonna select the framework
is also gonna be Arduino and then click
on finish and this guy's gonna open up
you're gonna have a project down here
and you're gonna click on open and then
you can type in exactly what I have
right here and this is just going to be
a blink test so type in everything I
have there you can click on the pause
button and your Arduino whenever you
plug it into the back of your computer
it's already gonna be blinking so you
can just change the delay maybe to 500
to 100 just so you can see that the code
actually changed the Arduino and this is
going to be in your main CPP file where
you're gonna put this and that is going
to be located over here in the source
directory and then to upload to your
Arduino you're gonna come down here and
you're going to compile everything by
clicking on this little check mark
that's right here and then after
everything is built you're gonna click
on this to upload it to the Arduino and
of course you have to have the Arduino
plugged into the back of your computer
and then you're gonna notice that the
blink rate has changed so there you go
that is how we are able to set up C and
C++ as well as Arduino on visual studio
code hope you guys found that useful and
like always please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise until next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
