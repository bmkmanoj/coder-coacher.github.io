another cooking tutorial today I'm going
to show you how to make cream of
mushroom soup and a local delicacy to
where I live called Pittsburgh
Pennsylvania I'm going to show you how
to make hash brown casserole and along
the way you're going to discover how
easy it is to get very very fat so I'm
just going to cut mushrooms up this is
one pound or 16 ounces of mushrooms
that's all these mushrooms this is
probably about the healthiest thing
that's going into this this I'm going to
add about 2 tablespoons bunion and then
I'm going to throw them in here to be
blended as well and to that I'm going to
add exactly 1 tablespoon of lemon juice
now I'm going to blend it now that it's
blended it's going to be able to about
this consistency and then I need to
start mixing this with all the bad
things now i'm going to make what is
called a roo roo in essence is just
butter and flour each one of these this
is one tablespoon of butter equals out
to 102 calories or 11.5 grams of fat I'm
not going to put in 1 i'm going to put
in 3 instead and in essence a roux is
one tablespoon of butter for each
tablespoon of flour and people use this
to thicken sauces up that's why ribs are
used but as you can see it's quite
simple just not particularly healthy
then 1 tablespoon of flour 2 tablespoons
are 3 tablespoons of flour and that's
roughly equal to 110 calories right
there plus the butter and you have
over 400 calories right here in this
little mish-mosh it once all the lumps
around senescence telling now I'm going
to throw in the mushroom and mix that up
through this we're going to add a whole
container of cream which equals out the
828 calorie or 44.4 or grams of fat and
then on top of that we're going to add
another cup of regular milk which equals
out to 160 calories and an additional 8
grams of fat then I'm gonna let this
cook I'm going to whisk it and cook it
for 12 minutes on high and also add salt
and pepper to taste and here we are
after 12 minutes of cooking and whisking
and so forth and the cream mushroom soup
is done that's how hard it is to make
cream of mushroom soup or how easy it is
so we're gonna put that aside because
now i'm going to make hash brown
casserole and to make hash brown
casserole we got to do here is we have
two and a half cups of Velveeta cheese
this works out to being about 1,900
calories to that we're gonna add some of
the cream of mushroom soup there's half
of a cup another half and another half
and one more so to total cups of cream
of mushroom broth or soup going to mix
this together and then to this mix from
at exactly 30 ounces of hash browns and
stir that up a little bit
and then to this if you thought well
that must be enough fat nope I'm now
going to add not a announces with 16
ounces of sour cream which equals out to
about 1,400 calories if you're wondering
or one hundred fifteen hundred and
twenty grams of total fat and I'm going
to mix that together so what you're
looking at right here is five thousand
ninety four calories and 365 grams of
total fat and if you think it doesn't
look appetizing I guarantee later on
today when i go to my family's they will
eat almost all of it if not all of it
then you take a pan after you've
preheated your oven to 350 degrees you
dump this in that pan and you cook it
for exactly 45 minutes and here's an
opinion dip it in there and then 45
minutes later in after 45 minutes in the
oven here it is nice and crunchy on top
very gooey gooey gooey in the middle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
