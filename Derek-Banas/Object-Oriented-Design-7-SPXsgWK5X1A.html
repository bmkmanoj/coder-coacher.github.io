7 of my object oriented design tutorial
today I'm going to show you how to take
the sequence diagram we designed in part
5 and 6 and transfer it into a class
diagram so let's get into it ok so on
the left side of our screen we have the
sequence diagram and I zoomed in here
real real real close so you'll be able
to see it and over here on the right
side I'm just using a text editor this
time to make sure everything's real big
so you can see it I'm going to transfer
everything on the Left into class
diagrams on the right so let's just
start off here here's test ATM which is
going to be my default name for my
application during my testing phase and
I see a count is here so let's go right
in and let's create account so there's
the class and then I got to think about
okay now what fields am I going to need
well then I'm just going to take these
fields here like Bank ID and customer
name and account type and I'm going to
transfer them over here so we have bank
ID and what is it it's an integer so
then and the negative sign here is for
private then I'm going to go customer
name and what's that it's a string real
simple and then I'm going to go account
type and what is it it's a string and
then just so I don't forget it here I
also have these guys up here count type
and dot it out of these little notes I
want to make sure that I pay attention
to these little notes and one thing I
have here is account number and I have
that pointed towards account so that
means I'm also going to have to include
account number and just to make sure
that it's important I'm going to stick
it up here closer to the top and that is
also going to be an integer and we also
see here account number incrementer I'm
going to need this guy as well keep
track of all my different accounts and
strip number I'm also going to need that
and then I also need to get all these
other different guys inside of here so
after account type I'm also going to go
and track account balance and this is
going to be a double and then I'm also
going to track pin because pana is right
here see I'm just copying everything
from the left side of screen over to the
right and strip number is also an int
and all I almost forgot account number
that's going to keep track of all my
different accounts as I create them and
that is also going to be intent and
another thing as you can see it is going
to start off at a hundred thousand so
I'm going to also go in here and give it
a fault value of 100,000 and this is
going to be a static I can't underline
in this silly text editor so just
remember that's a static and whenever
you're creating class diagrams that all
your static should be underlined so just
remember that well then I got to think
about okay well what methods am I going
to need in this account well one of them
is going to be this constructor right
here so I just need to go and copy this
a constructor over to this side so just
type in a count and I need to type in
all my attributes and classes and so
forth
so Bank ID int customer name string
count type which is going to be a string
and account balance which is going to be
a double and then finally hen which is
going to be an integer and it has no
return value so we're just going to
throw void inside of there and there you
go there's the constructor
now just to separate this out now I got
to think about okay well what other
types of methods am I going to need here
now I don't often think that much here I
just throw everything in that I think I
might need so I'm going to go get Bank
ID and that's going to provide me access
to my bank ID if I need it
get account number and I'm just taking
everything from the top here all of the
different fields that I've defined and
typing them in that's it now this is
it's going to save you an immense amount
of time and this is why I said before
the sequence diagrams are extremely
important get account type and
everything that I do here is going to be
available in a link underneath the video
and of course it's free just like always
move that up a little bit and somebody
actually said to me something about the
importance of sequence diagrams one
thing I never thought of to tell you
guys is that whenever I am making these
tutorials and I say I have a little
thing of notes in front of me that I'm
working off of because a lot of you guys
think I do this 100 percent out of my
head which I don't but what I do have is
a sequence diagram that I scribbled out
on paper just handwritten sequence
diagram that's what I make almost
every single tutorial off of so yes
indeed I think sequence diagrams are
very important and as you can see I'm
just cranking out this stuff right here
and a class diagram is pretty much one
step away from finished code so there's
a strip number and that is going to
return an int well then I'm going to
think about some other different things
that I'm going to need here like for
example how is the strip number going to
be created for our ATM card well I think
it makes a lot of sense say here's the
strip number which I'm going to be
creating I think it makes a lot of sense
to generate that strip number inside of
the account whenever the account is
created so I'm going to go in here and
go generate strip number and you can
actually see that that is coming from
here so I have generate strip number da
da-da-da say it's already in my sequence
diagram generate strip number get strip
number by adding bank ID to account
number incrementer say it's right there
so I'm just following exactly what I got
in front of me making this stuff up
there's that and then generate account
number that's something else that I
should do
and here's account numbers going to be
strip number with one or two from
account type at the end makes a lot of
sense to do all of this whenever we are
creating the account and one thing that
I left out of the sequence diagram is
normally when I create them I also
include all of the attributes because
they're just so easy for me when I'm
creating the sequence diagram to just
write them down and save the programmer
that comes after me sometime
so based off of the sequence diagram
that's all I need to do for a count so
now we come down to what is the next
class well I just have to look here and
here we create an account right there
what did we create next card so the next
thing we're going to create in our class
diagram is a card now what is the card
gonna need don't really have a whole lot
of information here I got a pen and a
strip number but for the most part
that's all I'm gonna need because that's
what the sequence diagram tells me is
all I need see as a programmer looking
at a sequence diagram I don't want to
really think my job isn't to think my
job is to do exactly what the sequence
diagram tells me to do and then I have
to also think about okay well what are
going to be the different methods that
are going to be needed well of course
I'm going to need a constructor however
I don't just want to jump in here I want
to also make sure that there's not any
other information
that I want to take advantage of so here
you can see that it's being passed a pen
as well as a strip number this is a
constructor for the card so I want to
create that guy so I'm going to come in
here and I'm going to type in pin just
recreating what's on the left side of
the screen and I also want to type in
strip number because that's what it's
telling me to do and that's also going
to be an int and does it return anything
no because the sequence diagram says it
doesn't and that is it however if I look
through this you shouldn't just
willy-nilly just fly through this
however later on as you're going through
and like I said before this was a design
that I created just so I could tear it
apart and say how I should improve it
but either way as we're coming down here
you see is strip readable well as I'm
looking at the sequence diagram then I
see that the pin is entered well up here
that means that the card when it is
created doesn't have a pen so what am I
going to need to do I'm going to need to
create another constructor that only has
a strip number inside of it so I'm going
to do and just do exactly that and
because it is a smaller constructor I am
also going to paste it inside of there
that's just something that I do you
don't have to do it that way what other
things might I need well I might need to
get my pin because I'm just returning
the attributes that I know I'm going to
use another thing that I'm going to need
to do probably is get my strip number so
want to return that and what are some
other things well I might have to set my
pin at some point in time if the user
wants to change that pin definitely
something I could see occurring and this
is pretty much the only thinking that
the programmers ever get really going to
do is these add and on attributes so
it's very easy just to add all of them
so we're going to say strip number is
going to be passed over it's an integer
and avoid it returns nothing so there we
go now we created card so what's the
next thing we got to create well let's
look at our sequence diagram find out we
can see there is account there's card
and then customer is going to be created
so what type of attributes is customer
going to need well you can see right
here
customers ATM card is passed over
whenever the customer is created kind of
like the ATM card being mailed to the
cost
so what sort of things am I going to
need here well let's just scroll this
guy up and this is going to be called
customer and what fields are we going to
need in classes and so forth well we're
going to need customer ATM card because
that's what was passed over to it and
what else am I going to need now I'm
going to need some methods here one of
them is going to be customer which is
going to be the constructor and I'm
going to go new ATM card which is going
to be of type card right like that and
it's going to return nothing and all I'm
doing here is just copying this
constructor right here and then does it
tell me to do anything else no not
really
so what are one of the things I might
want to add on here just being a
programmer and thinking hey I feel like
we should be able to access this card
well there you go
all the sequence diagram tells me to do
is basically to create this guy right
here and to create this guy right here
as the programmer I shouldn't think I
should just follow directions so that
was easy let's see what else we might
need here so we created a customer now
we need to create a bank computer so
let's create it by looking at the
constructor it's getting past a bank
name so you're like this bank computer
and what are some of the things we're
going to need here Bank computer data
Bank computer everything is continued as
designed in the first design so let's
just come down here well we could just
go and create this method since we're
already looking at it Bank computer and
it is going to be new bank name so we're
just giving our bank's a name whenever
we create them and they're going to be
returning nothing and that's just the
constructor we're going to be using here
so that's easy so what are the other
things we're going to need here so let's
scroll through all so we could look here
and see if we see Bank computer anywhere
else on the sequence diagram which right
now I don't see anything there dah dah
dah dah dah and here is Bank computer
now remember this is going to be the
bank computer that holds all of the
accounts inside of an ArrayList check if
the bank computer bank ID equals
transaction so what does that tell you
that means that Bank ID is going to be
needed for Bank computer C this is one
of the reasons why I always include all
the attributes inside of my sequence
diagram even though you're not supposed
to and I also know that this is
to store it off at 9 because of another
note that I have here on the screen so
I'm just going to throw that in and then
what else am I going to need well bank
name of course because bank names down
here so bank name and that's going to be
a string
anything else I'm going to need well I
just mentioned before that the bank
computer holds all of the accounts
inside of it and you're not supposed to
type out things like a raid list but I
do it especially when I know that the
person I'm working with is going to be
working in Java otherwise I wouldn't do
that I would just have a count listed
here and then let's look them see what
else we're gonna do here verify the pen
da-da-da-da-da back computer transaction
the only other thing I could think of is
since this is an ArrayList in that
situation we're probably going to want
to monitor the number of banks that we
have and that is just something that is
done whenever we have an ArrayList so
that we know how many items that are in
that ArrayList and we got them outside
here and we can check it real easy and
this guy is going to be a static as well
which means if it's class diagram it's
going to be underlined okay so that gets
us down here into the methods and that's
all our sequence diagram says we need so
what are we going to need to do well
we're going to have to have a way to add
bank accounts to this guy and this is in
the method that always is going to be
included anytime that you are creating
ArrayList
and there we go so we have the ability
to add accounts what else are we going
to need well we're going to have to be
able to get bank ID because that's
another rule anytime you have any
attributes up here you want to provide a
way to get to them and that's going to
be an integer what else are we going to
need well let's look here and see
exactly what's going on with this guy
and if we do find Bank associated with
card remember I change this in the last
part of the tutorial and you can also
see here is add account to bank and
there's Bank computer say that's where
that guy comes from I had that in
sequence diagram good on me I made a
good decision there and I can see a
whole bunch of mentions here is ATM
cards Bank in network and I can also see
mentions over here is Strip readable so
that tells me that a good method to have
inside of here is to verify the strip
number and how we going to do that
the card is going to be passed in right
like that and then I'm going to return a
boolean that's going to say whether it
is readable or not see boolean so there
that is what else are we going to need
now let's look down here in the bottom
verify the pin which is going to get
passed a transaction so we're going to
also want to use that and as you're
watching me do this you're probably
thinking wow that's too easy and
da-da-da-da-da let me tell you there's
very few people that seem to be able to
do this even though it is so easy it's
just a matter of going through the
process and saying what needs to be done
requests withdraw amount which is going
to be a transaction request with raw
amount and it's going to be passed a
transaction which is a transaction and
here that is and in that situation we're
not going to return anything and there
you go so there's Bank computer that's
all done so now what's next in our
classes well if we look here we can
actually see like I have notes here
check if the bank computer bank ID
transaction blah blah blah blah blah and
I'm saying here basically that
everything that is being done to Bank
computer also needs to be done to Bank
Network and Bank network is going to be
the very next thing created after Bank
computer here's Bank computer and we're
Bank network there's Bank network so we
got that right there but let's also come
in here and let's look at the
constructor Wow it doesn't do anything
so let's just come in here and start
creating this so it'll go Bank network
there that's created and what's going to
be needed to be stored inside of this
well basically the only thing that we
know of is going to be the ArrayList of
Bank computers remember Bank computers
hold a bunch of accounts and then Bank
network holds a bunch of Bank computers
like let's say we have 10 banks that are
accessible from every ATM and every ATMs
tied into a bank network that means we
need access to all of those bank
accounts so let's go and define that
thanks in the database is something I'm
going to throw inside of here and this
is just going to be an array list like I
said I'm putting this in here because I
want them to know I want an ArrayList
created and I know they're going to be
programming this in Java and if you're
using another language just use your
different ways of defining those
different things or just simply put that
in there as bank computer whatever you
want to do it's up to you now what else
are we going to need to do well we know
that verify pin and requesters they're
all amount are going to be needed
because we use them previously inside of
Bank computer and we know that those
guys if they are used inside of bank
computer they're also going to be used
inside of Bank Network so let's define
them what else do we know well we know
that we're going to have to be able to
access or add all of our banks to our
network because we have an ArrayList
here so let's just do that
we'll go add bank to network and how are
we going to do that we're going to go to
new bank which is going to be of type
Bank computer and there we go now we
have that and we're going to type in
void here at the end so there we got
that so that's simple anything else we
need well let's just scroll through here
is strip readable is ATM cards Bank in
network well there's that guy and that's
going to be pointing down here into my
ATM and it also points down into network
so want to use that guy as well
everything else continues as designed in
the previous so that's good
and you can also see here add bank to
network had that my sequence diagram
even though I was smart enough in this
situation to know that it should be
there so that's good except this is the
bank and I put the new bank whatever
maybe I don't want to jot a note that
says that but either way so now we also
know that we need to put this method in
here because it's on the sequence
diagram so we're going to do it we're
just going to go is ATM cards Bank in
work and what are we going to do we're
going to pass a card to it and I'm going
to say the card and then the return type
for this guy is going to be boolean
anything else that I'd like to do with
this guy I know there's a note here
somewhere
let's look scrolling around I know I
have a note written here somewhere where
it says I should get the first two
digits of the strip number two identify
the bank ID and here it is see right
here way of Bank Network
well I'm verifying if the bank ID is
correct and here I'm verifying you know
whether it's correct or it's not correct
okay so what does that mean well the
beginning of the strip number is going
to be the bank ID which means I'm gonna
have to get the first two digits
of the strip number so the final method
that is defined here anyway that I'm
going to need to get is going to be
those first two digits so let's also go
get first two digits and we're just
going to pass it strip number which is
going to be an integer and it's going to
return an INT obviously it's going to
get the first two digits off of that and
I think that might be something that's
going to be handy in the future so I'm
going to mark that as static which means
as a class diagram it will be underlined
so that's going to be a static method
for me so I'll be able to access it from
other classes so now what do I need to
do let's just come up here we created
Bank computer we created Bank Network so
up here comes ATM so what are we going
to have to do for ATM well one of the
things we're going to have to do you can
see here we're creating a transaction
from ATM so we're gonna have to have
that capability and also ATM is going to
be created by passing it the Bank
Network so let's go in here to this guy
right here and let's create this class
called ATM and remember I said that is
going to be holding transactions so I'm
going to go the transaction and it's
going to be of type transaction because
that's defined in that sequence diagram
make sure that's uppercase what else are
we gonna need here well let's just look
I see here ATM which is going to be the
bank network that's being passed in here
so I'm just going to create that guy
right now since it's right in front of
my face so I'm gonna go network of banks
on ATM and go network and this is going
to be a bank network so there is the
constructor for creating my ATM and what
am I going to need well I got this
inside of here so I'm definitely going
to need this guy because it's also going
to be in my constructor so I'm just
going to save that attribute right there
and I also know the users going to be
inputting stuff inside of the ATM this
is another thing that would normally be
in my notes down below so I'm going to
provide for user input because you know
it's an ATM there's no use for its
existence if the user can't enter
information and I'm also going to mark
that as static so that's going to be
underlined as well and it doesn't say
that I need to do anything else here so
I'm not
do anything else so let's look at atm
what exactly is it doing here you can
see all of these guys line up with ATM
so is strip readable there's something
that I need to do is strip readable and
how are we going to find it's well
there's going to be a card that's going
to be passed inside of here pretty
simple stuff and what are we going to do
well it's a question so we're going to
return a boolean anything else is ATMs
cards Bank in our network so there's
something else is ATM cards Bank in
network something else we got to do and
it's going to get fast a card just like
it says there and it's a question and
it's going to return a boolean as well
there's the boolean part anything else
that we need to do here well insert pen
say I'm just copying this it's just
pretty much copy and paste so insert pen
and what's it going to get it's going to
get a card right like that and it's also
going to get a pen because why because
that's what it says to do so I'm just
listening to it and it's question and
the result is going to be a boolean as
well so there's that guy pick account to
access okay I'll do that
pick account to access like that and
void amount to withdraw amount to
withdraw and pull it and then get
transaction info and that's going to
print out all of the transaction
information after everything's been
processed so now what do we need to do
well let's just use our sequence diagram
to find out there's Bank computer
there's ATM and here is transaction and
this is one would be one of the final
pieces so let's just scroll up here and
create our transaction right like that
and then I wrote a ton of notes about
what exactly we're going to do with
transactions so let's just scroll over
here and you can see it is right here
receipt comes from transaction info list
the name date balance withdraw amount
account used for withdraw blah blah blah
blah blah this is going to be the very
last one and basically here all I'm
going to do is think about all right
what are all the different things that
I'm going to need to return with a
transaction well Bank ID and in this
situation I'm going to have it do
everything I'm just going to type in
every single thing that's on the left
side here in this look
no out here on the right side another
thing customer name count balance and
this is why notes come in handy I got
everything that I need for my
transaction right here on the screen so
that's cool
withdrawal amount which is an integer
count number used and then pin which I'm
going to store inside of here because
inside of these guys I'm passing
transaction over to this see transaction
requests from stall amount say
transactions being passed so I'm going
to put my pin in there verify pin see
what's being passed transaction again
that comes from these notes that I have
here so that's the reason why I have my
pin inside of there strip number because
I'm verifying that the strip number is
good as I go into the bank network
account to withdraw from which is going
to be either checking or savings and
what else do we got here verify the pin
well the final thing is going to be did
the card verify and you know am I going
to be able to actually do the
transaction so card verify and that's
going to hold a boolean value so then
what do I need to do well let's just
scroll up here and let's look and see
where is transaction created
there's transaction and it's going to be
created by passing over a strip number
which is going to be an integer and it
is going to return nothing and then what
am I going to do after that
I'm basically just going to put a thing
in here that is going to allow me to get
the bank I deeds get current dates get
customer name and all that for all of
the things that I have up here above
that's it get bank ID get customer name
set customer name with a void at the end
get current date time turn that as a
string because I need to print it out
get pin I'm gonna put set pin inside of
this just because I always normally if I
have a get I put an int but I can't
imagine why I'd want to do that at this
point in time
that's probably something's gonna be cut
out and if I was doing this class
diagram I would draw a little note that
said hey you know this thing here
probably not going to be here in the
final piece get strip number cuz all I'm
doing is copying what is up above down
below get strip number int set
the card verify because I had that
little note up there that said I wanted
to check that every time in bank
computer before I sent everything off or
I wanted to check that every time I ran
it through Bank Network before I would
send it over to the bank computer sort
of like a security sort of thing also
going to check here if my card verified
spit that out and I'm also going to
throw in a whole bunch of things
withdrawal from what account and I'm
going to do the same thing for get
account withdraw from and set withdrawal
amount get withdrawal amount which is
going to be another integer get account
number used and then I would also want
to have the option to change the account
balance after I do my withdrawal and
then finally get account balance so
there you go there is a finished class
diagram like I said I have the whole
entire thing underneath the video you
can take a look at it and look at it but
basically all we're going to do here is
transfer the sequence diagram over into
the class diagram it's what we're doing
in annex part of the tutorial I'm now
going to use the sequence diagram in the
class diagram to write all the code in a
