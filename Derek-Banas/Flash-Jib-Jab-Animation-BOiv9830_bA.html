tutorial on how to make JibJab
type animations inside of flash and
Photoshop or you could also do this in
GIMP which is Photoshop free basically
what I did was I went and I took all
these different body parts of Sarah
Palin the most animated person I know in
politics and I divided all of these
different body parts into all of their
individual pieces probably the most
complicated thing I did was I cut out
the jaw and then just left this black
area inside of here which is very common
for what you see with JibJab
animations and then I saved all of these
individual pieces onto their own layers
so that's what I did with Photoshop and
and I saved it then you want to come
over into flash I'm gonna get file
import and I want to import to library
and I'm gonna find my Photoshop file and
it automatically selects everything and
I want to put them all over here and you
can see just that easily they're all in
their separate little pieces now what I
need to do is come in and create a
symbol for each part so I'm gonna have
my head which is actually going to boo
it be a movie clip cause I'm gonna put
the head a on the jaw on the same symbol
and then I got left arm and this is
going to be a graphic symbol right arm
animation and the rest of all of the
symbols that I create are all going to
be graphic symbols okay so I have all my
symbols created let's just start with
the head first since it is the movie
clip and what I want to do is I want to
come over here and drag my head onto
this stage symbol and I'm going to be
animating the head but where I have this
placed right now this marker which
defines how I can transform see how it
rotates around that symbol I'm just
gonna leave it the way that it is right
now I'm gonna drag my jaw all over and
I'm gonna put my jaw on a different
layer of course JibJab does this and
much more complicated ways but I can't
really get into sound inside flash at
the same point in time here so what I'm
gonna do is just make this real simple
you create a keyframe here give me a
free frame here create additional
keyframes and then I'm just gonna make
our jaw just open and close so there
it's open
and there I'm just gonna let the way it
is and an inside of here I'm gonna
create a classic tween there you go got
Sarah Palin's mouth opening and closing
in JibJab style then I'm gonna come over
here to the body symbol that I created
before and the graphics name suit that's
all that I need to do with that the
crotch I caught it waist and drag it
over here
left arm animation drag left arm onto
the screen left leg drag left leg on
right arm animation just drag my right
arm onto the screen right leg okay so I
have all my individual symbols created
here I'm just call this background and
all I did here was I took a picture of
the White House and then I traced it so
that everything's vector art and then I
can start defining all my layers so left
leg right leg crotch body left arm right
arm and head and then I'm gonna drag my
left leg here onto the screen so just
find the left leg drag it here on the
screen and drag the right leg over into
the right leg layer do the same thing
with crotch do the same thing with the
body and I'm gonna position these in a
minute and they got a little bit
pixelated on the edges you can fix that
up inside a flash it always happens when
you import from Photoshop grab my left
arm grab my right arm and then grab my
head which is a movie clip remember and
there's Sarah Palin's big-headed I'm
actually gonna transform these all to
65% okay now I want to position
everything so let's just take the body
let's put it right there
left leg let's put in what's gonna
represent the crotch area it's gonna
represent the feet it's going to
represent the arms
and I'm just defining all these pivot
points again and if I grab her head and
let's say I want to size this make it
look a little bit nicer I don't want to
size the background so I'm going to lock
the background zoom out here and
position her onstage fitting window and
there you got her now if I want to start
animating everything I'm gonna do is I'm
just gonna right click create motion
tween it's automatically gonna do it 24
frames per second so it's gonna create
24 new frames and I'm gonna create a
motion tween for each one of these guys
except for the background and I actually
know I'm gonna go to 48 so I'm just
gonna go to 48 for this and create a new
keyframe by hitting the shortcut f6 now
I can come in here and start playing
around with everything so I'm gonna
create a whole bunch of keyframes and
say I want to play around with this arm
animation right here so halfway through
I'm gonna want the arm to be rotated
right like this and then I'm gonna want
I'm gonna move the pivot point again I'm
gonna want this left arm to be in this
position right like that
great motion tween for the head put a
keyframe in here and I can pivot this
head around as well and let's say I want
to move the feet and then move the feet
this way okay so if I want to extend
this animation I'm gonna come out here
to frame 48 hit f6 f6 f6 f6 f6 f6 create
all kinds of new frames here I'm
actually gonna grab this frame drag it
out so there I got the white house still
here in the background and if this new
frame I want to take her head move it
over here take this arm move it in like
that take the other arm move it out take
your body and move it a little bit maybe
do the same thing crotch
and right leg and a left leg and you can
see if I come in here and actually hit
return it animates her just like a jib
jab type animation and then if I want to
test the movie just come up here hit
control test movie and test it and there
you see Sarah Palin dancing around just
like a jib jab cartoon we can zoom in
here so basically all that I would need
to do is to come in here and get these
individual graphics and cut out all
these little white trailing garbage
mess-ups here on screen and everything
would be just like it is in JibJab
except of course I have to put sound and
music and all these other different
things to it so that's basically how you
create a JibJab type animation inside of
flash if you have any questions or
