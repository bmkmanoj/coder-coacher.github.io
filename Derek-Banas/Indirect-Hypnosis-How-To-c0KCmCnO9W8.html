and asked for more information on
indirect hypnosis well in this video
along with all the other videos that are
attached I'm gonna teach you exactly how
to direct people without them knowing so
what is indirect hypnosis it's simply
the issuing of commands subliminally to
people without them knowing people go
into trances all the time I'm sure at
one point in your life you've left a
place and returned home in your car and
cannot remember the trip at all that is
because during that period of driving
you are in a trance Marketing uses in
directive notices all of the time mainly
through the uses of the yes set and
through manipulation of the
decision-making principles which I
document in the video that is provided
here so what are the steps to cause
indirect hypnosis first you have to
build rapport through mirroring and
matching discover the subjects chosen
representational system which I go over
in detail in the video advanced sales
techniques part two but I'm gonna get
into light here then you have to
discover how a person makes decisions if
you're trying to make them make the
decision you want them to that is also
covered in advanced sales part two if
you want to instead of seeing a list of
things you actually want to see how to
implement these techniques then you
place the subject into trance through
either a direct action by establishing a
yes set or through confusing language
then you issue commands through the use
of conjunction stories and metaphors so
where does this stuff come from oil
directive gnosis was created by a man
named Milton Erickson mainly because he
knew the power of hypnosis but after a
certain period of time he was restricted
from using hypnosis so he had to develop
covert way as to hypnotize people
NLP is a branch of psychology first
created by Richard Bandler and John
grinder and what they did is they study
what Erickson and other noted
psychologist did to change lives and
then for the first time ever they
catalog those techniques step by step if
you understand NLP you'll understand how
we communicate on a multitude of levels
and how to get people to follow your
commands so what is rapport rapport is
simply the development of a close and
harmonious relationship in which two or
more people understand each other and
can communicate well you build strong
rapport through mirroring matching and
copying representational systems so
what's mirroring when you're with
someone you trust you may not notice but
your natural
mirroring him or her mirroring is
defined as when you copy someone else's
behavior movement body position hand
gestures tone of language etc a clear
example of marrying is seen when a
couple naturally completes each other
sentences they are so in tune they're
actually seemed to be reading each
other's thoughts what most people do not
realize is that mirroring is a two-way
street
you can actually mirror a person
slightly and get them to feel closer to
you naturally when mirroring people it
is very important that it stays outside
of their perception be very subtle by
copying breathing the speed in which
they are talking and a few of the
phrases they are using but don't make it
obvious that you are mirroring them what
other things should you match their
breathing pattern to figure out when a
person is exhaling you can tell that
they are exhaling because their
shoulders are going to lower slightly
and when they're inhaling their
shoulders are gonna rise slightly also a
person exhales whenever they are
speaking you also want to match their
voice tone their posture any gesturing
that they're performing and you can find
more information on gesturing in my
gestures and body language video you
also want to match their blink rate and
the representational systems so what
does all this talk about chosen
representational system so what you have
to understand is whenever you ask
somebody a question an event actually
triggers in their mind in which they
remember something they've seen or heard
or an actual action replays in their
mind people that talk very slowly
normally replay that action in their
mind this is called kinetic but I'm not
gonna get into that I get into it in
another video but whenever they are
remembering something visually you can
tell that because their speech is
actually going to change and they're
gonna start using a lot of words that
are visually representative such as
brightness and so forth and so on
however if they remember something that
they heard in the past they're gonna
start talking in audio they're gonna
talk about things being loud or they're
gonna start using phrases like can you
hear what I'm saying
versus a visual thinker would say
something like can you see what I mean
by speaking in their chosen system what
you say will sound more believable to
them and they'll grasp onto it and want
to continue to follow along with you the
commands you provide will also seem very
reasonable to follow and if you are
trying to convince somebody of something
you can discover the number of times you
must convince
in their chosen representational system
by simply asking how many times do you
need to see here or do something before
you feel you understand it again if
that's not 100 said clear there's
another video that goes completely
through the representational systems to
really be able to persuade people you
must understand exactly how their brain
processes and makes decisions now I went
over the principles of decision-making
in a previous video and the name of that
is how to influence people if you want
to look into that but you also can find
additional information if you want to go
really deep by understanding what is
called meta programming see our brains
create what are called Maps whenever we
are looking back into a past event to
decide to make a decision like I talked
about previously
well the meta programming actually
deciphers those maps those things we
remember seeing those things we remember
hearing and those things we remember
doing and through the use of meta
programming this is how person reasons
gathers information two signs on
preferences and makes decisions hope
that you're grasping this if not again
there'll be a video here a hundred
percent on that of programming you have
to understand I'm trying to explain
something that's really complicated
through a series of videos so if you
have any questions leave them in the
comment section below
then what you want to do is place them
into trends and you can do this through
either a direct action through the use
of the yes set which is probably the
easiest way I go a hundred percent
through the yes head in the pan sales
techniques part for video but I'm gonna
go more into the yes set here real soon
or you can confuse them with tricky
language metaphors or stories you can
also issue commands using conjunctions
metaphors and also stories now the yes
set it is just the process of asking
questions that are guaranteed to get the
other person to respond with a yes
that's all the yes set is psychology
researchers have found that if you get a
person to answer affirmatively to topics
that relate to what decision you want
them to make seven to eight times you
are almost guaranteed that they are
going to say yes I will do what you tell
me to do through the yes set you can
gain access to the quick thinking part
of the brain this is the unconscious
mind versus the no part of the brain
which is the conscious mind people use
our uncool
just mine to make instant decisions when
a deer runs in front of your car your
unconscious keeps you from crashing how
does it do that you're unconscious makes
decisions based on rules and past
experiences nearly instantaneously one
of the rules that strongly governs the
unconscious mind is the consistency
principle this principle states that a
person will strive to remain consistent
with their past decisions and statements
and the yes set gets people to agree
with you by accessing the unconscious
mind by placing them in a trance by
asking simple questions then making them
believe they are answering consistent to
their past responses going on to asking
them questions that will definitely
return a yes response and gradually
asking questions that are less probable
or questions that you want them to say
yes to so that they agree with you and
agree to do what you want them to do
here's some examples how are you doing
today pretty good this is gonna get you
a yes response can you please sit down
there of course is the temperature in a
room comfortable or I see you're looking
at and point it whatever they
specifically are looking at Milton
Erickson the world's greatest
hypnotherapist embedded suggestions in
many ways he first would build rapport
establish the yes set and then embed
suggestions through the use of stating a
truism followed by a conjunction and
then a suggestion or through assumptions
what are called double binds analogies
metaphors or stories now double binds
are simply saying like if you're in a
sales situation what Tuesday are ones
they work better for you see either way
the person answers you win that's what a
double bind is here are a list of
conjunctions you could use to embed a
suggestion with a truism or a current
event you could say something like as
you sit in the chair you may feel
yourself becoming very relaxed or every
time you blink your eyes you feel a need
to swallow or because you have relaxed
in the past this means you can relax now
all over again
you could also convince people by
assuming that they will do or think
about that which you want them to in
here are some examples of powerful
phrases to get people to do what you
want by assuming this day well you may
be wondering what this beautiful TV
would look like in your living room or
you may notice a little itch somewhere
on your body now or how about you may
find yourself wondering what else you'll
learn by watching these videos
embedding suggestions can also be
accomplished through the use of
analogies you could say something like
like you chose to spend a little more
for a car that excited you behind the
wiill for a lot less this new TV will
excite you every moment you're in your
home another our great analogy would be
like you chose a neighborhood that is
safe with reliable neighbors and
provided convenience this car will keep
your family safe it will remain reliable
for years and it's great fuel economy
will keep you from losing money at the
pump a true story interlaced with many
metaphors and analogies assumptions and
conjunctions will really get you what
you want however Alex everything you
want is already provided to you right
here if you want to get your way a date
a sale or anything else just follow the
techniques laid out in the advance sales
technique videos that video series
applies rather than just lists the
techniques I've covered just about
everything but metaprogramming which I
am going to put out today and is linked
right here and pretty much everything
else is it you think tank home if you
want anything else specifically leave it
