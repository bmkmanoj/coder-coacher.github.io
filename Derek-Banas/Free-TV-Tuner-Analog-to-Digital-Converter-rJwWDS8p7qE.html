tutorial on how to set up free digital
televisions you can broke it from live
broadcast right out there in the sky
right around your house I tried out many
different antennas and many different
digital TV converter boxes and for the
antennas the best one that I was able to
find is this RC a multi-directional
digital flat a amplified antenna that
you see right here this is the Box sorry
the presentation isn't it a little bit
neater but couldn't quite figure out how
to do this any better so that is the
best antenna able to find and I'm not
being paid by RCA by the way and right
here you're able to see the digital TV
converter box that I found to be the
best which is made by Zen well and just
so you know if you have a digital
television already you do not need this
this is only for whenever you have an
analog television does the only time you
need that but first off I'm going to
show you exactly how you hook the
antenna to a digital TV this is one of
the parts you get with a digital antenna
and as you can see here this part goes
into your antenna which is right here
and this part goes out to your
television which you can see over there
then on top of that there is a plug
attached that needs to go into an outlet
and that is basically all it takes to
hook up an antenna to your digital TV so
you can receive live broadcasts and this
is how good the digital TV looks that is
100% free
asides from having to buy the antenna
it is also extremely easy to set up all
you need to do is plug the antenna into
the side of the digital TV turn it on
and it automatically sets itself in
here's a diagram from the user's manual
for the RCA digital antenna as you can
see here there's the one connecting
piece that lies between the television
and the antenna itself and all you need
to do is plug in the power adapter and
plug one end into the antenna and the
other end into the television as I
showed and here is this in Weld digital
converter box here's the back end of it
because the video is a little bit blurry
as you can see in the part labeled one
this is where you would connect your
antenna to the back of the digital
converter box the part labeled part two
is where you would take coaxial cable
from this converter box which it does
come with and connect it to your
television also there's an option of
connecting to the television using both
the audio ports and the video out and
then at the end here we have our AC
adapter and also from the owner's manual
you can see here exactly how you would
plug everything into the television take
you maybe a minute to two minutes if you
have a regular analog television you
would need the digital converter box
which you see here this is the back of
it right here is where you would plug in
for the antenna so instead of having the
antenna go into the television the
antenna is going to go directly into the
back of this box this is the cable that
will go into your television and again
here's a power adapter which needs to go
into an outlet and here is the box
itself can change the channels this way
but it also comes with a remote control
this is what the remote control looks
like that comes with a Zen well unit
this is the major negative with the Zen
well unit people don't like it that I
find it's perfectly fine for my personal
uses ok as soon as you have your
television and
and digital-to-analog converter box all
connected to set up everything from that
point you would then select your
language then I'm going to check the
eastern time zone because that's what I
will currently list then I click on OK
now it's going to check all the channels
that are currently available to me based
off of my area I'm currently in
Pittsburgh Pennsylvania so some things
here may be different for you and you
can see down here below all the channels
that it's currently finding currently up
to 6 and roll most done right here and
there you are saving data and there it
is digital cable on an analog television
and that's pretty much all it takes to
get free TV NEC here are just a sampling
of some of the channels they'll look
equally as good as regular cable now
remember this is an analog television
though if I shift through you can see
here showing me signal quality signal
intensity giving me a lot of information
this is regular ABC looks just as good
as cable this is a channel that plays
hold movies in my area this is a signal
that's currently not working this is NBC
again looks pretty good
another channel that's actually an
analog channel you could say everything
looks really really nice though QED is
local broadcasting and of course you got
Home Shopping Network I think it's
really neat how it has a single quality
there and all that information many
people don't know there's s many
channels that are for free and you can
say dynamite we look fabulous so that's
the end of my how to get free TV with a
digital converter box and antenna for
anybody who's been doubting that it is a
good thing to try the looks that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
