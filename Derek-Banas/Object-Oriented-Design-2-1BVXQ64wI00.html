two of my object oriented design
tutorial today I'm going to show you how
to turn the UML design that we created
in part one and if you haven't watched
that definitely watch it it's up above
and I'm going to turn that UML design or
specification directly into working Java
code so let's get into it okay on your
screen you're going to see the java code
from the last part of the tutorial and
here is the use case diagram that we had
previously and our goal here is a player
is going to be created at random that's
offers the prediction of a coin flip
either heads or tails and then the other
player gets the other option the coin is
flipped and the correct guessed wins
that is our goal and that was the use
case then we created the object model
that you see right here and all of this
diagrams and all this stuff is available
in a link under the video you should put
it in front of you to completely
understand this stuff and we created
this object model which is going to tell
me how many instances of all the
different classes I'm going to need as
well as attributes and a whole bunch of
other things and then from that we
created our class diagram so now I know
exactly what attributes or fields and
methods I'm going to need for all of my
different classes and then the sequence
diagram which is right here which is
what I'm going to be working with a lot
is going to show me all the logic and
how all of these guys are going to work
together so let's get into the code and
start working with this stuff so I'm
gonna have the class diagram down here
in the lower left-hand corner like I
said you can get this whole thing put it
in front of you look at it and then
you'll completely understand this stuff
but because of the lack of screen real
estate I'm going to have to move this
over here so I'm going to be looking
down here and transferring what's down
here over to this now the very first
thing I'm going to do is create player
dot Java I haven't really thought at all
about any of this stuff so I'm going to
be creating all of this right out of my
head actually I think coin dot job I'm
going to create first so I'm basically
just going to take this class diagram
that you see down here for coin and
transfer that over to this so I'm just
going to go public class coin not much
thinking and that is the whole goal here
get all your thinking done in the
diagramming part of the tutorial so I'm
going to go private string coin
option because it says to do that down
here and so I'm just following my
specification then I also know from
creating the sequence diagram that I'm
going to also have to monitor the coin
value or I'm going to have to have an
array I'm just going to do this as an
array like I said I haven't thought this
out a lot because I wanted to make this
feel like what happens whenever
somebody's just handed a specification
and they just start writing some code so
this probably could be done better with
an enumeration or something like that
but either way for now this is what I'm
going to do and I also know from my
sequence diagram that I actually create
coin right here so you create so I have
to provide a constructor that's going to
allow me to create that coin and for now
I'm just going to leave it right like
that I'm not going to do anything else
and then also from looking down here at
the coin class diagram get coin option
and it's going to return a string so I'm
just going to go and create that guy so
public string get coin option and what's
it going to do it's going to return coin
option which is going to be a string
there you are
all I'm doing is taking what I got on
the left side of the screen and moving
it over to the right side of the screen
well now I'm going to go into player
Java and all this codes available under
the video as well and I'm going to go
public class player and then what do I
know
by knowing what I know about the player
well I'm going to have to have a name
which is going to be a string I'm going
to have to have coin option which is
going to be heads or tails for each of
the players now I'm going to have to
have get coin option maybe haven't quite
decided if I'm going to need that or not
set coin option which is going to pass
whatever the opponent flips over to this
player and then it's going to
automatically switch so if it gets past
a heads it's going to switch to tails
and it's not going to return anything
because it's going to set coin option up
here so that's what this is telling me
that's what this diagram is telling me
get random coin option this is going to
be used in the situation in which this
player is going to be able to pick heads
or tails and this is going to return
string which is going to be heads or
tails
and then did player when it's going to
be passed the winning flip the winning
flips going to be compared to coin
option
and then we're going to be able to
decide if the player won or lost so
let's just go in here and again transfer
what's on the left side of the screen
over to the right side of the screen and
I'm just going to give this a default of
nothing and drive it string coin option
which is going to hold whatever the
option is for each of the players it's
going to be created again just copy them
from the left to the right and then I'm
also going to store this guy in here
like I said this isn't optimized because
I'm doing this out of my head so you
know bear with me I'm betting there's a
better way to do this than that like I
said an enumeration or something like
that so and we're going to go player
string let's say oh that a name is going
to be passed over to this guy because we
have to store the name somehow and then
we're just going to go name is equal to
new name which is passed to it so
there's the constructor out of the way
and then we're going to have public this
guy is going to return a string get coin
option again my sequence diagram
actually told me that I don't need get
coin option and I'm kind of guessing
that I might not but just out of habit
I'm going to provide that option just in
case I do need it because it's always
nice to have it there unless I do need
it then just going to go public again
void set coin auction and this is going
to be passed a string which is going to
be whatever the opponent flipped and I'm
also sort of looking at the sequence
diagram as I'm putting this together
just for now but as I go and progress
through this I'm going to look more at
the sequence diagram after I have
everything all set up so I got Set coin
option which is again just taken from
the class diagram then I'm going to go
public string get random coin option and
throw that inside of there as well
because that's in the sequence diagram
so I'm not really fleshing out these
methods at this point in time I want to
make sure that I have them all in here
and actually if I used a really
professional tool for UML diagrams this
stuff it actually gets spit out for me
so that would be really cool but either
way I want to work with what I got and
then the final thing I need to create
here is public void did player win and
the ultimate goal here is to provide a
software engineering type degree online
for free that's what I'm trying to do
it's never been done as far as
I know but I like doing things like that
okay so now I transferred the class
diagram over to this guy and this has a
little arrow underneath of it or a
little red line because it will never
return value which we'll worry about
that later on so now that we have that
all set up let's look at coin game which
is this guy down here is a coin game and
I'm going to create this class and it's
going to have a player's array a coin
that's going to be stored inside of it
using composition and start game which
is going to be a method so let's just go
into coin game Java and credit so we're
just going to go public class coin game
and then just copy what I got on the
left side of the screen so it's a
specification then this is a sort of
stuff that programmers do all the time
the architect goes and creates what we
created in port 1 and then the grunt
programmer who or whatever you want to
call them is going to create the actual
code so pretty simple stuff and we're
just going to call coin constructor for
this guy and coin game is going to be
the constructor for this and it's going
to be passed layer 1 name because we
want to assign names to these guys and
player 2 name because we know we need to
assign those values and for now let's
just leave it that way ok and then the
final part of this is going to be public
void start game and let's just leave it
that way so there we go we just
transferred all of these class diagrams
over here on the left side of the screen
over to our code that's all we did so
now we can move the sequence diagram
over here because the sequence diagram
is going to help us write our code it's
going to tell us exactly what we need
so now let's jump over into coin Java
and start writing all of this code so
what is coin going to have to do as a
constructor well let's look and see what
exactly coin does as a sequence diagram
so coin is going to be created and then
what happens
coin game that's what this guy is here
that's what this line is right here coin
game is going to call coin with a method
get' coin option and it's going to be
returned with a string which is going to
be the winning flip that's it that's all
coin does so let's go and get this
simple thing out of the way real quick
here and I'm going to decide to just do
this
inside of here inside of the constructor
just to keep everything as simple as
possible so what I'm going to do here is
I'm going to generate a random number
either a 0 or a 1 and the value of coin
option is going to be set based off of
that random index which is going to come
from this array right here like I said I
know there's some better way of doing
this I like to jump in make the code
work and then worry about optimizing it
later on so I know I need a random
number so I'm going to call math dot
random and I'm just going to do this
really simply I'm going to say if the
random number comes out less than 1/2
I'm going to give it a value of 0 and if
it comes out greater than 1/2 I'm going
to give it a value of 1 so that's going
to help me be able to figure out exactly
whether I want heads or tails chosen
here and then what I want to do well
pretty simple I'm just going to go coin
option is going to be equal to coin
value and then I'm going to stick the
random number inside of it so that's
going to be the index value see either 0
or 1 and this is the 0 index and this is
the 1 index so there we are pretty
simply I'm able to create that and guess
what I think that's all I need to do so
because why because the sequence diagram
told me that it basically says all I
need to do is whenever get coin option
is called I need to return a string
which is going to be winning flip and
then the coin pretty much just dies
which is exactly what it did I created a
new coin and it's going to return coin
option when get coin option is called so
I'm basically just copying exactly
what's there alright so coins done we
got that finished now we have to go into
player Java and make that code wanting
or sequence diagram again so what do we
need to do here well let's take a look
at our sequence diagram and figure it
out well get random coin options going
to be called for our player see this
method actually is for this guy right
here and it's going to shoot back
players pick that's all it's going to do
so let's go in here and make sure that
we have this all set up properly we
already have the name assigned to our
player so that's cool it looks like my
sequence diagram was smarter than me I'm
not going to use get coin option I'm
gonna leave it in there though just for
the heck of it
but let's just go along with the
sequence diagram I know Set coin options
here but I'm going to come
here first and let's write all this code
so what am I going to do just to keep
this simple I'm just going to use this
guy right here so I'm just going to come
in here I'm going to copy that which is
going to give me my random 0 or 1 and
paste that in there because I need to
return either heads or tails in this
situation so I'm going to do it in much
the same way so then I'm going to go
join option is going to be equal to coin
value and then pass my random number
inside of there just to keep this really
simple because I know this is going to
work so I'm just going to reuse this
code so now that I have coin option set
for this object see I'm setting it
inside of here which I'm going to use
later on I'm now going to return my
value so I'm going to just go return and
this is going to be exactly the same
thing so let's copy that paste that in
here and there we are the red line went
away and everybody's all happy so now
what do we need to do well Set coin
options going to be the next guy that we
need to do and I can see that so in the
situation in which the player doesn't
win what I want to do is I want to
actually pass over so let's say the
player one wins the random number
generated pic thing and they say ok
player 1 what do you want
it says heads well then set coin option
is going to pass over heads to player 2
and player 2 is going to choose the
opposite of heads which is going to be
tails so I basically just have to
program that in there so how am I going
to do it let's see if I can just do it
in one line of code so I got coin option
which is opponent flip that's being sent
over to me and I'm just going to come in
here and go opponent flip if it's equal
to heads in that situation I'm going to
change this value to tails and if it's
equal to tails or anything else I'm just
going to set the coin option to heads
pretty simple one line of code all done
so that's it that's just the sequence
diagram told me to do that then what
there's a sequence diagram told me to do
did player win well I know this method
doesn't have anything in it and it needs
to have something in it let's go over
here and figure out exactly what it's
going to need to do roll down did player
win well the coin is going to flip and
give me a winning flip I got that from
the coin object and then I'm going to
say okay well I need to pass the winning
flip over to player one and then player
one is going to need to output whether
it won
or not so how are we going to do that
just out of my head I'm going to do a
few coins option and spell it right so
point option coin option is whatever the
player has as its value if it's equal to
winning flip which is the flip that the
coin did now I'm going to print out a
message because remember previously I
said that I just want these guys to
print out a message right here on the
screen rather than pass stuff back so
I'm going to say name which is my
players name one with a flip of and then
come over here and coin option which
coin option is going to be this player's
value so it one else if it didn't have
the winning flip I'm just going to
change this to lost with a flip of a
coin option and there you go sequence
diagram told me everything that I need
and I know it's perfect in the class
diagram told me what attributes our
fields I'm going to need as well as what
methods I'm going to need so now I need
to go and figure out exactly what coin
game needs to do now coin game is going
to be a little bit more complicated see
coin game Java and let's just look and
see what's going on so remember I said
previously that I wanted flip again the
option to play the game again to
actually be in the main part of the
program so I'm just going to ignore that
for now so what I need to do is figure
out a random player who's going to get
to either choose heads or tails then I
know all this stuff get random coin
option needs to be called on this guy
it's going to return back whether it
chose heads or tails if it shows heads
for example I'm going to set the other
player to the opposite of whatever heads
is which is going to be tails and that's
what the sequence diagram tells me there
and then in situation which player two
wins the random pick it's going to do
the absolute opposite so let's go into
coin game and let's start figuring out
exactly what we're going to do well the
very first thing we're going to need to
do is I have my players array and what
it's going to do is store names so I'm
going to go new player player one name
is going to be passed over and I'm going
to create a new player object by passing
it the name and let's take a look at
that for a second so here we are in
player dot java and you can see here new
name is passed over and we're going to
assign that to this field up here so
that's all we're going to do there
so pretty cool all right so what else do
we need to do with the coin well we're
going to jump right into the whole
entire process of starting the game so
what do we need to do we need to pick a
player at random well I use this code
over here before so I'm just going to
use it again this is just going to pick
me a random zero or one to decide which
player gets to pick first then I'm going
to create a string which is going to be
players pick and as you can see over
here all this stuff's coming from the
sequence diagram look the name of this
the return value is player spec so I'm
just using the sequence diagram of
following the rules that are laid out to
me by the architect of this plan and
then I'm going to go random index and
then I'm going to say get random coin
option because the sequence diagram told
me to call that method and it said that
it's going to return back to me either
heads or tails and actually I'm going to
change this to index because that works
better and then make this Capitol there
you go so there we are we picked a
random player pretty simple and we also
returned back a value of heads or tails
from that player well then I need to set
the opponent's coin option to the
opposite value so this is if player 1 1
we are going to set player 2's value to
the absolute opposite value so how am I
going to do that I'm going to go random
index is equal to 0 again this is an
optimized code feel free to optimize it
I'm just doing this like I said you go I
keep repeating that but I just know that
I'm not optimizing this and it's making
me nervous
so opponents index and then in this
situation I'm going to call set coin
option why am i doing it players peck
because the sequence diagram told me to
see Set coin option it's going to be
passed over a string and that string is
gonna be the opposite of whatever the
other guys picked was look at this how
everything just comes together I'm
barely even thinking and I know code is
working when I'm not thinking too much
and then what do I need to do well I
need to flip my coin I already created
my coin so I'm going to go winning flip
is going to be equal to the coin and if
I forget what exactly I need to do there
I can just look at my sequence diagram
get coin option is what I'm going to be
calling on coin so I just go to the coin
get coin option and there we are so now
I know what the winning flip is and now
I need to actually print out the results
so I'm going to go players call my first
player did player win and I'm going to
pass over the winning flip to it
and it's going to tell me if player 1 1
and then I'm going to do the exactly the
same thing for player 2 and as far as
the sequence diagram says I am finished
so I'm going to save game now I'm going
to actually create the main working
program which I'm going to call coin
flipping game Java so I need to get
input from my user so I'm going to go
and need the scanner library and I'm
going to go public class coin flipping
game kind of a funny name so what do I
need to do here not much because
basically all this guy is going to do
because my sequence diagram tells me
this is all it needs to do is give the
player the option to play one time and
then play again so what does that tell
you whenever you're thinking about
something you're definitely going to do
at least one time and maybe more times
than once well that pretty much screams
to you that you're going to use a
do-while loop but either way so I'm
going to go coin game because I need
coin game because coin game runs
absolutely everything and we go new coin
game and then what do I need to do with
coin game well let's look at coin game
win game Java well I need to pass over a
name for player 1 and player 2 all right
piece of cake so I'm just gonna make up
some names here mark and tone and there
we go so that's all set up and now what
do I need to do I basically need to
start the game well I need to say inside
of main don't want to jump out of there
yet and I'm going to say string users
answer is actually going to be whether
the user chooses to do something again
or not remember I said I want to do
something at least one time so do wow
that's what that means and then inside
of it I'm going to say the coin game
start gaem and there we go and then
after the game is run I'm going to go
out print line and I know again for my
sequence diagram that my sequence
diagram says you know what your only job
is to ask the player if they want to
play again and if they want to play
again you give them the option to do it
so I'm going to go scanner play game
again
is equal to new scanner system in
because that's going to read input from
my keyboard and I'm going to go users
answer is equal to play game again next
line is used whenever you're reading
text from the user and then that's
basically it I just need to come down
here and finish my while loop to decide
if I'm going to do it again so I'm going
to go while I'm gonna check a couple
different things here this is the first
thing that comes to mind for me to do
let me say starts if their answer starts
with a lowercase Y or users answer
starts with an uppercase Y if that
happens I'm gonna do it again and if not
I'm not
okay so let's save it and let's see if
this actually worked it should because
the sequence diagrams there I didn't see
any error messages pop up but either way
let's run coin-flipping game and you can
see it worked mark lost with a flip of
heads tom one with flip tails so let's
try it again
let's just go why mark lost with a flip
of heads Tom one with a flip of tails
let's try it again over guess why Mark
loss with flip ahead
Tom one with flip tails and it goes on
and on and on and on and on so there you
go there is a prime perfect example of
how to create all of those UML diagrams
just from a really simple specification
and then convert the whole entire thing
into code leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
