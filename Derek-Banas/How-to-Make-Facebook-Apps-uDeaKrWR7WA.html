long-awaited how to make Facebook apps
tutorial this is going to be a long
series with many many many videos I'm
going to show you how to do really cool
things and program pretty much anything
you could ever want in Facebook in this
tutorial well I actually saw a Facebook
app that charges you a monthly rate to
display your YouTube videos and I didn't
think that was right so in this tutorial
or in this first two parts of this
tutorial to show you how to make this
guy right here it allows you to play
your YouTube videos and also cycle
through a whole bunch of YouTube videos
right here on the screen just by
clicking on the thumbnails and it also
grabs all the thumbnails from YouTube it
allows people to bookmark this app
whenever you make it it also allows
people to like it and also comment on it
and comment on their Facebook wall and
all kinds of other cool things so the
first thing I'm going to do is before
you can set all of this up you're gonna
need to go to facebook.com forward slash
developers and you're gonna see
something like this on your screen
you're going to want to click allow what
this is going to do is it's going to
provide you access to all the Facebook
tools needed to be able to develop apps
and special pages and all kinds of other
cool stuff after you hit allow you're
gonna see a screen it looks like this
right here and there's all kinds of
documentation on how to use Facebook but
we're gonna go through all that and
video tutorials so you don't need to
worry about that unless you want to look
at it by all means look at it and then
to start making apps you want to click
on create new app and you're gonna have
to type in your app name and it's going
to have to be a name that's not already
taken and you want to agree to the
Facebook terms and hit continue then
you're going to have to go through this
little security will good will be right
here and then hit submit and then you
could start making your own app I'm
going to go through all the things are
important here and all the things that
are not important first you're going to
want to give your app a name mine is
just messing around and then you want to
create what's called a name space which
is basically going to be the directory
where this guy is going to be on
facebook.com and I just called mine
messing around FB you want to type in
your email address and you can choose a
category I just chose other because this
is kind of another type of app and this
is the important thing on what you have
to understand is this page changes all
the time inside of Facebook but these
main things that I'm pointing out here
almost never change and one thing that
hasn't changed in a long time is tan vez
URL now what this is you have to have
your own website and you're going to
have to create a special directory on
your own website and you're going to
store all of your facebook files inside
of there and then all of the code that
lies in those files is going to be
uploaded into Facebook for you to be
able to use and secure canvas this would
work if you have a SSL certificate you
don't need to worry about that right now
and if you did have an SSL certificate
you just use this exact link that's on
the screen if you can't see this you can
watch this video in full-screen HD
because it's an HD video the only
difference between canvas URL and secure
canvas URL is it's going to be HTTPS
down here and everything else it's going
to be exactly the same and that's pretty
much all you need to worry about I
normally leave everything else as a
default so after you enter all that
information and you want to hit Save
Changes and then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to show you how to make a page
tab and I'm going to call this one top
video and again in the same folder like
you have up here messing with FB on your
website inside of this folder you're
going to want to create an HTML file if
you can't see this make it a little bit
bigger and then here is where all the
code is going to lie that's going to be
uploaded inside a Facebook to create our
nice little page that I showed you first
here on the screen and that's basically
it in regards to setting up everything
on Facebook now you have to write all
the code that is going to then be
displayed inside a Facebook and you're
going to do it in my situation in top
video HTML I just have to write all the
code inside of there and make everything
work and Here I am in a basic text
editor and I just have a couple little
things to find here style this is where
I'm going to do my CSS styling but you
don't really even need to worry about
all this code if you just want to copy
this code and you'll basically only have
to change one line of that code to make
it work for you that's great and that
code is available underneath this video
and you can use it however you want and
the other things I have here predefined
is this is a jQuery library that I'm
going to be using throughout my code and
here I'm just defining some scripts and
then here's the head section being
closed off and here's the main body
section this is where I'm going to be
writing all my code if you're unaware of
how to program like I said just copy the
code below and you can use it however
you'd like first thing I'm going to do
here is I need to get myself the
Facebook JavaScript SD
okay for this app to be able to work and
how you do that basically is just coffee
and exactly what I have here on my
screen inside of the body section we're
going to create a div and you have to do
this so you're going to create a div and
it's going to have an ID equal to FB -
root and close that div off okay so you
have to do that every single time then
what we're going to do is we're going to
actually grab ourselves the JavaScript
code that is needed for Facebook so you
just type in script source is equal to
HTTP colon forward slash connect dot
Facebook dotnet / / e and underscore us
if you're speaking English if not sorry
I'm not sure what Talia character set is
equal to UT f - 8 and then you want to
close that off and this is going to grab
the code you need to be able to program
inside of Facebook and we're going to do
some more scripting so put a script tag
and so out of there and then you're
going to call FB dot and knit again this
initializes all of the code that you're
going to need to be able to use Facebook
or develop Facebook apps and then app I
D now where this is coming from is over
here whenever you create an app it's
going to give you an app ID and there's
also an app secret but I have that
blocked out so you're just going to copy
that
right there and you're going to type in
your specific app ID so this is going to
be whatever yours is six five - this is
going to be one of the only things
you're going to need to change to make
this app work for you then under status
we're going to put in true and this just
checks if the person who's currently on
this tab is logged in this should never
change after cookie we're going to type
in true and this just enables cookie so
the server can access the session that's
created if you don't know what that
means don't worry about it because this
is almost always going to be true
and then type in true and this is the
markup language that's specific to
Facebook and we're just basically saying
here yeah we want to speak in Facebook's
language you know since that's what that
says trying to keep this as dumbed down
as possible so that just about anybody
will be able to use this tutorial if you
have a little basis in regards to how to
use HTML then if you want to allow
somebody to create a bookmark for your
specific tab that we're making
just type in FB : book mark and then /fb
: book mark and that's all you need to
do and because we did this up here you
can now do this and boom boo-boom
boo-boom people are going to be able to
bookmark your app which is kind of cool
give myself some space and I'm going to
create an h2 tag
it's called top videos this is what's
going to be displayed on the screen I'm
going to close out h2 tag off then I'm
going to create a div with an ID equal
to I'm going to call it top video and
this is going to allow me to later on go
in here and change anything that lies
inside of this div and anytime you
create something like that and all a div
is is if you don't know it's just in
essence a box inside of HTML that's all
it is and then I'm going to create an
iframe it's going to contain my YouTube
video and like I showed you before it's
going to change if any of the thumbnails
are clicked tab in here type in iframe
ID is equal to and I'm going to give it
an identification so that I can later
change it and I'm going to type in width
is equal to 500 height is equal to 311
and if you're wondering where this comes
from jump over into happy YouTube okay
so here is my fantasy-football strategy
video where all this is coming from if
you click on share inside of YouTube and
any embed there is your code this is in
essence what I got here except I'm going
to click on that there you are so this
is all of the code that I'm in essence
copying if I want to make this smaller
or whatever sure you guys know to use
YouTube see I typed in 500 and that's
where the 311 came from so nothing too
fancy and then source is equal to this
is going to be the default video that
shows up when somebody goes on their
tube comb forward slash embed forward
slash and then you're going to have to
put your special YouTube code inside of
here so I'm just going to come in here
jump up to the top of the screen I'm
going to copy the little code that comes
after V equals right there so I'm just
going to copy that and paste that inside
of there and then you're going to put a
question mark you have to type in W mode
is equal to transparent and the reason
why we're doing that is if you don't
have this inside of here if a pop-up
comes on the screen your video is going
to be at the top Z index which means
it's it's going to float above every
single thing else on the page even if a
pop-up comes on the page so we're
putting that in there
that the video will stay downwards and
allow for other things to show up around
it and if that didn't quite make sense
leave a comment below or whatever
frameborder is equal to zero and I'm
going to say allow full screen and then
I want to close off my iframe and type
iframe and then my div closes itself and
then if I want to allow users to be able
to post to my wall like I have right
here and all this little neat stuff all
this stuff is very easy to put inside of
your app you're just going to create a
div and give it an ID equal two comments
and then FB : comments number of posts
I'm just going to leave this as four and
title is equal to my blog comments you
can put anything you want here it's
totally up to you and then this doesn't
matter
and then simple its equal to one you're
almost always going to do that close
that off close off the div and in the
next part of the tutorial I'm going to
show you all the rest of the code that
needs to be put in here to make this guy
a hundred percent functional if you want
to skip ahead there's a link in the
underbar to the complete code and like I
said you can do anything you want with
it
leave any questions or comments below
and otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
