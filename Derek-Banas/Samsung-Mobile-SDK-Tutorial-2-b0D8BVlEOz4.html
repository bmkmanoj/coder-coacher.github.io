2 of my Samsung Mobile SDK tutorial in
this part of the tutorial I'm gonna
continue and finish the code that we
wrote in part 1 of this series in which
we were introducing the s-pen parts of
the Samsung Mobile SDK and you
absolutely positively must watch part 1
before you watch this because I started
creating the app in part 1 and here I'm
gonna finish it and I provide a link to
part 1 in the upper right hand corner of
this screen but before I jump back into
the code and finish that app I'd like to
answer a couple questions that I've
received since I created part 1 which
basically center around the whole idea
of how do you learn a new software
development kit so let's take a look at
what I do anyway ok so the very first
thing you're gonna want to do is of
course download the software development
kit because you're gonna get all kinds
of documentation as well as great
samples at least you do in this
situation with this software development
kit then you're gonna be able to go
through all of these different samples
that are provided to you and there are a
ton of them and then what I do anyway in
this situation is I would go to
developer.samsung.com forward slash
samsung mobile sdk just like you see
right there comb through all of this
documentation which is gonna give you a
brief overview of all the different
tools like right here you're gonna see
right here in this little table exactly
the capabilities of all of the different
parts of the sdk all in one place and
you can scroll through here and just get
a really nice overview of the sdk then
what I do once I have all the samples
put together I would go to image -
developer.samsung.com online Docs I go
to the online documentation or the API
and then as I come across different
parts of the code maybe some of it I
don't understand I could just bounce
through here and let's say that I am
using the pen click on that and then I
can just scroll my way down and look at
all of the different objects that are
available to me and then read up on them
and then slowly as you go through all of
this code this is how
to Android by the way over two years ago
I just combed through the API so that's
basically what I do and I just wanted to
make sure you are aware of those links
which I'll also put in the description
for this video now what I'm gonna do is
I'll continue covering everything you
need to know to finish the s-pen example
app that we started in the previous
tutorial and I'm just gonna jump
directly into that code right now now if
we got this four we basically know that
the device that we're going to be using
isn't a Samsung device so what we want
to do in this situation is define
exactly what's going to happen if the
Mobile SDK doesn't support the device
that we're using so this is going to
bring us to process unsupported
exception which was the function that we
had way up here at the very very very
beginning there it is process
unsupported exception copy that name
spin back down here again and here we
are and it is going to be receiving the
unsupported exception well I don't need
to go up there to get that just copy
this and it's gonna receive s SDK
unsupported exception and let that be e
and then we could print a stack trace so
be able to track how we got here and we
can get our air type by just going
II get me or type then we're basically
going to be able to ask it a whole bunch
of different questions by it I'm
referring to the air type so we could
ask it something like is this a Samsung
device and we do that by going air type
equal to call this guy up here and then
we're gonna call vendor not support it
which means it is not a Samsung device
or error type equal to again call to the
unsupported exception device not
supported and then in that situation
we're going to print out another toast
base that in their device does not
support s-pen let's just leave it as
that
everything else is perfectly fine so
let's just kill the application by
calling finish and then we're gonna say
else if and check a couple other
different potential error types so error
type equal to paste in our unsupported
exception in this situation we're gonna
ask if the sdk library was installed and
we do that
calling library not installed there we
go that's the air and this is the
situation in which we opened up the
application and we clicked on it and it
said hey wait a minute you need to
download the new S Pen SDK remember we
went and got that application so we're
basically going to have to generate an
alert dialog that's going to tell them
to do the same thing and in this
situation we're gonna call show alert
dialog and we're gonna create this
method here in a few seconds and in it
we're gonna say something like you need
to install additional s-pen software +
and then say to use this application +
you will be taken to the installation
screen and then restart this application
after the software has been installed
and then true so it's kind of
long-winded there we got ourselves
another else--if that we need to handle
and in this situation we're gonna check
if the error type is equal to and we're
gonna use this guy right here and we're
gonna check in this situation to make
sure that the library might be installed
but it might need to be updated and in
this situation we're gonna use the
required for an update and I forgot to
mention it but this true that we have
here that is going to be passed over if
the application needs to be closed so
that's what that means ok so if this
needs to be updated
grab this paste that in there you need
to update your s-pen software to use
this application perfectly fine you will
be taken to the installation screen and
actually restart this application after
the software has been used and true
again because we do want it to be
restarted are also going to be passed
along and that brings us to our last
else if and that else--if is going to be
in reference to the fact that they do
not need to update but it is something
that is recommended that they do and
that situation check if the error type
is this exception I mean we could throw
it out altogether but this is basically
and we're gonna say is recommended which
means not required of course and in that
situation let's just copy this again
paste that in there and we're gonna say
we recommend that you update your s-pen
software and then we'll say before using
this application and then we're gonna
say you'll be taken to the installation
screen restart the application after the
software has been updated however in
this situation we're not gonna force
close it we're gonna say false and then
if we get down here we're going to
return false which if we scroll way up
here you can see that we checked if true
or false was passed inside of there and
then in all the other situations in
which we know the activity was closed
we're going to return true all right
that leaves us with one thing show alert
dialog which is going to receive a great
big giant string to print out in a
dialogue box and then it's gonna decide
if the activity either survives or gets
deleted or shut down anyway not deleted
so to create it our final function go
private void it's not gonna return
anything in this situation alert dialog
it's going to receive a string of course
to print in our dialog it's also going
to receive our boolean which is gonna
say do we want to close our activity or
not and then inside of it it's gonna
create our dialog box so to create our
dialog box we're gonna call alert dialog
builder and this is called LG and new
call our dialog builder and it needs
passed in our context and then we can
set the icon to display in our title to
do that we're just going to use the
default little icon that's provided by
Android and to get that default we're
gonna call get resources get drawable
these are like the little graphics that
we get by using Android and then we'll
specifically call our drawable and the
one we want is dialogue alert and that
is down here
I see dialogue alert there it is so it's
stored in there so we don't have to use
our own and then now the the icons been
set we can also set the title and in
this situation we're going to call this
upgrade notification also to this set
message to the message that was passed
inside of here and then we have to
decide what's going to happen if they
click on a positive button or if they
click on and cancel so ok or cancel and
this is positive button and in this
situation we're going to use default
Android again string yes it's okay to to
proceed and then we're going to create
the onclicklistener which is going to
handle what happens
so dialogue interface on click listener
come down here put a semicolon it's
gonna say hey you need to add some
unimplemented methods so let's do that
there we go so what exactly we're gonna
do whenever they click on the yes button
well we're gonna need to send them over
to Google Play and specifically send
them to the s-pen application that
they're going to need to download and to
do that we're gonna have to create a
uniform resource identifier to store
that location and have to call parse and
then inside of it to reference the
Google Play Store we're gonna call
market and details and then pass an ID
and then to that guy we're gonna call
the s-pen native package name which is
stored right there
now it's gonna know which application to
try to download and since we're going to
be performing this operation we're gonna
need an intent just like always anytime
we have an intention to do something we
need an intent and we're gonna call the
intent with specifically action view and
specifically the intent here is to use
that Universal resource identifier to
trigger the Google Playstore to open so
that we can get our application and and
be able to use the s-pen but first what
we're gonna need to do is set some flags
and these flags are basically going to
define how our intent is gonna be used
so first off we're gonna have to say yes
a new task is being started so we just
go intent set flags and then inside of
it intent flag and say yes a new task is
being started and then we want to clear
our task as well
and then after we have that's all setup
all we need to do is open the Google
Play Store and we do that by calling
start activity and pass our intent now
that we have that set up we just close
our dialog box and then close our
application altogether get rid of that
semicolon that's right there because
we're also going to have to handle if
they hit either a negative button or
they hit the cancel button have no there
have to create our new click listener
come in here and add unimplemented
methods again there we go
and then basically we're just going to
define if we are going to force close
the application or not and we do that by
just going close activity checking if
it's true and if it is we're gonna call
finish to close it and then in this
situation of course we want to close our
dialog as well either way and then
finally we're gonna say what are we
gonna do if they hit the cancel button
define our cancel listener add
unimplemented methods which in this
situation are going to be on cancel we
get it there it is and then again we're
gonna say if we should delete our
activity or not any other way we're
gonna close our dialog box and then
after we get all of those different
things defined we're going to say show
and then finally set and all for our
dialog box and then the absolute final
thing we have to do is to find what's
gonna happen when the application is
shut down and in this situation we just
come in here go source override
implement methods come up here activity
on destroy put a checkmark in there go
okay there's on destroy and then we're
basically just gonna close up the s-pen
surface view as well as the note dock so
we're going to say if spen surface view
is not equal to null then we want to
close it and then set the value to null
and then we're basically gonna do
exactly the same thing in this situation
for the s-pen note dock it's not equal
to null inside of a try block we're
gonna say spen no dock close and then
catch all the exceptions that might be
triggered from that prints dock trace
and then set the note dock to know and
there you go you just took a whirlwind
trip through developing an S Pen app and
learned a lot I mean really I covered a
lot there's one little air
here I just want to make sure that I
correct that yeah it's right here
get drawable in this situation I just
want to go get resources close that off
put a dot right there get drawable come
down here to the end and get rid of this
additional bracket any error went away
okay so hopefully you enjoyed that
tutorial I know it was long I just loved
to put as much information as humanly
possible in each tutorial please leave
