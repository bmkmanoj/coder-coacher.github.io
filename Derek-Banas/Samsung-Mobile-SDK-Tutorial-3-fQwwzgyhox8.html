3 of my samsung mobile sdk tutorial
today we're going to talk about samsung
s look list activities simple adapters
list views intense and a whole bunch
more and this of course is brought to
you because of the samsung smart app
challenge and i have more information
about that in the description for this
video as well as information on my
giveaway which is going to be a samsung
galaxy note 3 am one of three samsung
galaxy gear watches so let's get into
what we're covering in this tutorial
basically s look is going to provide a
bunch of specialized widgets and you can
see them here as well as what our app is
going to look like in the very beginning
writing buddy in this situation is going
to allow the user to write information
which is then recognized and then
convert it into regular text or it's
also going to allow the user to draw
images air button is going to allow you
to display interactive menus which can
contain text or images and it's really
cool but it's kind of hard to describe
so I'm just going to let that too later
in the tutorial where you'll actually be
able to see it in action and then we're
going to cover Smart Clip which is going
to allow you to capture text you ro
screenshots and so forth just by drawing
with an S Pen now like I talked about
before this tutorial isn't going to be
solely about just just just samsung apps
that's definitely going to be part of it
but if you're just interested in
learning a lot of things about android
in general you should definitely watch
it because probably about fifty percent
of the tutorial is going to apply to
just general android development and why
I'm focusing in on samsung is because
basically there aren't that many
tutorials out there on developing
samsung specific apps and since samsung
controls about one-third of all the
smartphones in the world i thought it
would be interesting to cover this topic
so let's take a look here deeper before
we start writing some code and exactly
what we're going to be creating this
tutorial is really going to focus in on
list views so i'm going to have a whole
lot to do with anything specific to
samsung but the next tutorial and those
tutorials that follow will definitely
cover samsung s look in this situation
so basically whenever our application
opens up its going to have a list view
which is going to have a whole bunch of
items inside of it whenever you click on
one of these guys like let's say i click
on
writing buddy it's going to open up
another list view and then if I click on
that it's going to open up some other
class inside of this package in this
situation with writing buddy what we're
going to be able to do is you can see
this little pen right here whenever you
click on that the user is going to be
able to actually go in here with the s
pen and draw out words or numbers or
pictures but in this situation since we
don't have imagery enabled it's just
going to allow you to do things like
right hello and it's going to convert it
into hello just like that if you decide
to enable image listener you're going to
see this dialogue pop-up it's basically
they say hey you're changing the mode so
what we're going to do is delete all the
previous text and allow you to draw
pictures now then you'll be able to draw
a nice smiley face or potato with a
smile on it whatever you want to call it
on your screen and save it that way but
in this tutorial what we're really going
to be focusing in on our the list view
and how to create it now to create a
list view we're going to use what's
called a simple adapter and what we're
going to do in this specific situation
is bind static data static data meaning
the titles for each of these list items
as well as where we're going to go or
what class is going to be called or what
intent is going to be fired when we
click on them and I like to think of
these kind of like hyperlinks inside of
HTML you click on it it sends you to
another class or it fires another intent
that's what's going on here now for a
simple adapter to work you're going to
have to send it the context which we're
just going to say this and we're going
to be done with it we also need to send
it a list of maps now those maps are
going to contain the text for the list
item information writing by the air
button all of those things as well as
the intent to fire when these are
clicked on so that's all that's going on
there then we're going to have a default
row layout which is just going to say
how is our row going to be laid out
you're going to see that in a second
it's just a canned Android provided
layout and then we're going to have our
column names and the text views to
display because basically we're going to
create a list view object and then bind
it to a text view as you're going to see
here in a second so to look at more
closely what we're going to create in
this tutorial basically the simple
adapter is going to say hey get data
which is another function we're going to
be writing I need you to
I'd me with the names for each of the
list items as well as the intense or
where we will go whenever they are
clicked on that's what the simple
adapter asks get data to get get data in
exchange says okay I'm going to define
encode the classes that are going to be
called when any of these are clicked on
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
call another function this is a custom
function this is a custom function this
is not a custom function and that
functions name is going to be activity
intent so we're going to pass class name
to activity intent and activity intent
in turn is going to return an intent
that is going to reference this class
that we want to fire then get data is
going to passed a basic list as well as
the title which we're also going to
define in code inside a get data and the
intent that we just received from
activity intent add item is going to
receive the list and then it's going to
add the title and the intent to the list
that is full of maps and then it is
going to save that data there then that
data is going to be returned to get data
and get that is going to return simple
adapter the list that needs to create
this list view and that basically leaves
simple adapter with everything it needs
context list of maps a generic row
layout to use the columns names and
generic text views to display on top of
each other for each list item so that is
a overview now I'm going to actually
jump in and write the code okay so here
we are inside of activity main.xml and
of course all of the code is going to
need to be available in a link in the
description basically we just have a
generic relative layout here what we
want to do remember I said before we're
going to create a list view object and
bind it to a text view so that means we
need a textview so we're just going to
commit over here grab a text you throw
it anywhere and there it is it's
wonderful jump back over here we can
actually look at the XML and I'm pretty
much going to leave everything the same
I don't need an ID for this so I'm going
to delete that I don't want to define
text to go inside of it because that
wouldn't make sense and I also don't
need to define margins one thing i do
how
need to define inside of this is tools
context is equal to dot main activity
and that is going to be used to pick the
right theme to show for our layout all
right activity mains done now let's go
into s look activity Java and here we
are and I'm just going to start writing
some code so here we are inside of on
create and remember this is our list
activity and like I mentioned before
it's just an activity that's going to
display a list of items the data in the
list and the data in the list is going
to come from an adapter which we talked
about before and that of course is going
to define what happens when an item is
clicked so let's go inside of here
inside of on create and set up our
simple adapter and like i said this
simple adapter is just going to bind the
static data that's provided by get data
which we're going to create here in a
second that data is going to be used by
the list view object which is also going
to be bound to the text view that we
just created inside of activity main and
we have to pass all those things to the
adapter that i mentioned before so we
need to pass in well first we need to go
create simple adapter then we ask the
pass in the context which is just this
and then we're going to call get data
which we're going to create here in a
second then we're going to use a
standard Android row layout which if
you've seen other tutorials of mine
you've seen I use this is it just
basically a temporary holding cell and
simple list item one there it is click
on that and there we go then we need to
define a list of column names that we're
going to be adding to our map so we'll
just go string and it's going to be
title and then finally we're going to
have our text views which are going to
be used to display our data and again
we're just going to use a generic text
view and then close that off and put a
semicolon inside of there and don't
forget to put the curly brace right
there there we go something else we can
do inside of here is to enable what is
called filtering which is basically not
only to allow the user to use their
keyboard to cycle through list view
items if possible how we do that is just
get ListView set text filter enabled and
set that to true and that is basically
all we have to do with on create that
brings us to
data which is going to put together our
map for us and it's going to be private
it's going to return a list that is full
of maps and it's going to have a string
which is the name or title for the list
item as well as the intent which is
going to be set as a basic object and we
have get data which actually doesn't
receive any attributes it's going to
however create a list of maps and string
and object and i'm going to call this my
data equal to new and in this situation
it is going to be an array list let's
just go and copy this one to type all
that out ray list paste that in there
put our braces in there and there we go
now we have our ArrayList set up now we
basically have to add our information
I'm going to use an outside function
called add item which I mentioned before
and basically add item is going to
receive our list which is where it's
going to be adding the data to it's also
going to be receiving whatever the title
is for the list item you remember before
it was information was the very first
one and then we're going to call
activity intent remember that guy
activity intent is going to be past the
location for the class that is going to
be called whenever the list item is
clicked on so in this situation is going
to be samsung android example let's look
demos information activity come way over
here and put a semicolon there we go
that's given us all kinds of errors
because activity intent doesn't exist
and it says my date by the way it's
supposed to be my data sorry about that
so let's go and create activity intent
basically going to create it right here
we're going to go private it's going to
return an intent of course activity oh i
just copied that didn't I yes I did it's
going to be a string component name it's
just going to be the location of the
class just like you see right here and
we're going to have to create our intent
new intent hopefully you guys if you
watch my android tutorials you really
know what an intent is now and you know
that we need to put a capital I inside
of there and then we just need to go
result set class name and then this
and then component name and now we have
the intent and now we return it and
there it is now another thing we have
here is add item which also doesn't
exist so let's create add item as well
come down here private void add item add
item is going to be getting a list item
sent to it full of maps paste that
inside of there and we'll call it data
it's also going to receive a string
which is going to be the name that is
going to be displayed on the screen for
the list item and it's also going to
receive an intent which I'm just going
to call an object in this situation
there we go then it actually has to
create this map so there that is and
this is going to be an individual list
item so I'm just going to call it item
is equal to new and this is actually
going to be a hashmap put in those
braces and there we go now we have our
hash map then to our hash map we're just
going to call put and put in the data
which is going to be the key for this is
going to be title and the value is going
to be whatever the name it was sent over
then we're going to put our intent also
inside of our map and it's going to be
called intent and this is going to be
intense as well there we go and then
finally we're going to call data which
was passed right here and inside of data
we're going to add our map because it's
going to hold all of our maps and there
that is now what we do need to do is
just come up here and create five of
these guys so just select all of them
one two three four five and here are the
five different list items we need to put
inside of there so we have information
writing by the air button Smart Clip and
pointer icon okay so we have information
done so let's come in here and let's
change this to writing buddy and this
guy the actual class name is going to be
writing buddy activity and let's divide
these up a little bit so it's a little
bit easier to see them so let's views
are not as complicated as they seem and
I hope that they make more sense now
then for number three we're going to
have error button just like we had on
there and this is going to be air button
activity
number four is going to be smart clip
and this is going to be smart clip
activity and then number five is going
to be pointer icon and I don't need this
one by the way just get rid of it there
is gone and this is going to be pointer
icon activity save that and then of
course we're going to have to return the
list to the adapter so after we have all
this set up we're going to go return my
data alright so everything is set up the
adapter works everything's beautiful
only problem is what are we going to do
when those items are clicked on well
since this is a list activity we're
going to be able to actually catch that
event whenever it occurs and to do some
go way down the bottom here and I'm just
going to go right click come in to
source right there come on down inside
of here and go over I'd implement
methods and then we're looking for on
list item click what are we trying to do
we're trying to figure out how we're
gonna do or how we're going to handle
when an item is clicked so it got that
hit okay and there it is I'm just going
to come in here and delete this now what
we just need to do is whenever the list
item is click point it to the
corresponding class activity which is
then going to be executed so inside of
here we're going to need a map I'm just
going to copy that save myself some time
map is equal to and map and then in this
situation if we want to get the actual
item that was clicked on we're going to
use the ListView in this situation as
well as position which is going to be
the position in the list view so we're
going to say L which is the ListView get
item at position and throw in the
physician then create an intent by
getting the intent in the map to do that
we go map get in turn right like that
and now that we have it we can call
start activity with the intent let's
clicked on this catches it and this
intent is fired and then the final thing
we have a little bit of a warning here
what I'm going to do is just suppress
that warning because it's not going to
matter this is right here unchecked ask
from object to map I know it's going to
be fun so I'm just going to say suppress
warning and there we go and we have that
setup now pretty much the only thing we
have left to do is to set up what
happens whenever writing buddy is
clicked on well you see edit text and
view group
up up there well here's the writing
buddy activity Java right here I'm not
going to waste your time because I think
you get it so what I'm gonna do is I'm
just going to run through this because
the writing buddy activity which is just
a big giant list activity just like the
previous that I just showed you it's
going to work in pretty much exactly the
same way so I'm going to do is instead
of typing all this out I'm just going to
run through it one last time just to
make sure that it makes hundred percent
sense okay whenever this activity is
called on creates going to be called of
course we're going to use a simple
adapter to bind the static data which
we're going to provide below whatever we
call get data and we're going to need to
pass the following we're going to pass a
context which is this in this situation
list containing all of our data we're
going to have our simple sort of generic
Android list item or list layout that
we're going to use we're going to have
our column names and the junk sort of
text view that's going to be used to
display our data this guy again is going
to be used to allow the user to use
their keyboard to cycle through all of
the list items if possible get data of
course is going to create a list filled
up with maps it's going to take this
reference to a class that we want to
fire call activity intent let's go down
here activity intent you're just going
to take that class and create it and
turn it into an intent pass it back up
inside of here add items also going to
be passed the list that is full of maps
which is my data my data as well as
whatever the title for each of the list
item should be call add item down here
there we go including a title that's
going to be the name or the text that
shows up on the list item intense which
is going to be a reference to the class
we're going to fire whenever that list
items clicked on we're going to then add
this map to the data list it's going to
come back up inside of here again return
my data from get data and then come up
here and go inside of the adapter and
that is how you create a static list
using a simple adapter and then of
course finally on list item click again
is going to be used to far the right
intent based off of the list item being
clicked there's a whole bunch of
information in the next part of the
tutorial
I'm going to focus more in on writing
body what you already saw a preview of
it please leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
