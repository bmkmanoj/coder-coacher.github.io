tutorial on how to get Twitter followers
in this tutorial I'm gonna show you
exactly how I added 1,000 plus Twitter
followers in under one week and this is
one of those tutorials where I throw out
all these results and then at the end
ask you to buy something in this
presentation I will show you exactly how
to do the first a warning do not try to
follow more than 200 people per day I'm
gonna make it so extremely easy to
follow people you're going to be tempted
to follow all 1000 people don't do that
also don't spam your new followers to
death make sure you read your direct
messages or you will lose all of these
followers that you put on do not go in
and unfollow people once they followed
you as well and make sure you understand
if you don't follow these rules you may
get banned on Twitter
Twitter was made to make it easy for
people to inform others not blitz them
with advertising and also finally some
of the people I have you follow swear if
you have a problem with that
don't do this where did I come up with
the idea to even do this presentation
it's simple people on my website
requested that I find out how to get
more followers on Twitter here's the
goal get 1000 followers in a week with a
brand new Twitter account that has no
followers currently I was unable to
promote my Twitter account on my website
which gets a good amount of traffic and
also I was not allowed to promote my
Twitter account on YouTube the reason
that I follow this rule is there are a
lot of people out there that want to get
a lot of Twitter followers who don't
have a high-traffic website or a youtube
account so I wanted to make sure
everybody could do this and on top of
those two things I wanted to find an
easy way for others to do exactly what I
did as you can see here I did get a
thousand viewers in under a week I
opened this account one week ago on a
Saturday I can't say their I have one
thousand five followers and check here
see if it's going up since there got an
I just added on another one on top of
that I'm listed in thirty four different
lists this is extremely valuable because
there's ways for people to subscribe to
every every person that resides in a
list in the list that I'm
in our the lists that are pointing out
the fact that I'm such a good follower
that I follow everybody who follows me
and you can see here how many people I
had to follow to get my magic 1000
number to go back to the point where I
was talking about don't spam if you look
at the messages that I create on my
Twitter account it's not spam
I don't advertise all over this I don't
advertise at all actually I just point
out articles I write once or twice a day
that I hope for helpful and you can see
here the lists of 100 but this is not
where you're going to get your list so
you may ask yourself how do you know who
to follow well I have a tool that allows
me to search through Twitter and find
those people that have the largest
number of followers and you can see that
list right here it's also on my website
freely available and Barack Obama is the
number one guy in regards to following
people hence my hypothesis was that if
if you get a list of people who follow
tens of thousands of people the chances
are the reason they follow those people
is because those people follow them
follow the big followers and you'll get
a lot of additional followers that's the
whole idea
I know it's not rocket science but
either way it works so there's the list
of a thousand like I said on the website
now what I wanted to be able to do
however was to create a very easy way
for other people to be able to subscribe
to these large lists of people and
cutting and pasting or clicking on
follow or whatever just wasn't working
for me so and you can see here on the
website this is the 1,000 list right
there
either way so I found this really great
tool called tweet m/l what it allows you
to do you can get someone tweet a mental
Don or how I'd used it to create lists
was I got my 1000 names I copied them
one hundred at a time just to keep it
simple I'll just copy a couple here
pasted them in here clicked on this gave
it a name gave it a title put some
people in it and if you click on
generate tweet ml which you can see
right here what pops up on your screen
is a link back to the list that you just
created up here and I sorted these out
in lists of 100 people that you
would want to follow and then I took
that list and if you click on the link
that points to the list that was
generated by Tweep ml what it does is it
automatically subscribes you to every
single person in that list so if you go
to my website again I made this
extremely easy for you if you go down
here and you click on one hundred more
Twitter followers this is part four
this is what will happen screen will pop
up you'll see hundred more followers
part four you can click on select all
scroll down to the bottom of the screen
sign in on Twitter allow it access to
your Twitter and what it'll do is it
will automatically subscribe you to
every single person on any list as you
can see it's doing right here following
already following so forth and so on
as you can see I was able to get to the
1000 mark without subscribing to all
1000 people all at the same time
remember you do not want to do that and
if you can't remember why just go back
to the beginning of the video and watch
that again mainly you'll get banned if
you try to subscribe to thousands of
people in one day first off twitter
won't let you and secondly they'll
consider you a spammer and they will ban
you so if you have any other questions
leave them in the comment section below
but asides from that I think this is the
way that the Twitter experts who are out
there selling programs teach people how
to get more followers I don't know that
for a fact
but I do know this works 100% and if you
want to do the same thing all you got to
do is go to new think-tank on til next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
