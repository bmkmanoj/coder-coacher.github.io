my sales and closing strategies tutorial
system here I'm going to cover how to
utilize subliminal selling techniques as
you sit there now comfortably and read
these words you may notice you are
salivating in your mouth somewhere in
the back you may also notice that you
have a growing need to swallow all did
you swallow yet how did I do that you
may ask all I did was suggest that you
do something you can easily do also
somewhere on your body you also have a
need to scratch go ahead scratch it
it'll make it feel much better as I've
explained in many of my diet articles it
is impossible for our minds to process a
negative thought right now I want you to
absolutely not think about pizza don't
think about eating it either don't
imagine what it tastes like or anything
see your mind has to think about
anything that you tell it not to think
about that's why people that tell
themselves tonight think about food
spend all day thinking about food you
can use this principle to get people to
imagine owning your products however and
that's great now think about how sales
people misuse suggestions they normally
tell customers to not worry about this
problem or that what is the customer now
thinking about that problem never tell
your customers to not worry about
anything in fact never bring up anything
negative ever milton erickson the
world's greatest hypnotherapist embedded
suggestions in many ways he first would
build rapport establish a guest set and
then embedded suggestions through the
use of stating a truism followed by a
conjunction and then a suggestion if
that's confusing don't worry i'll give
an example soon making assumptions using
double bonds analogies metaphors or
stories here are a list of conjunctions
you could use to embed a suggestion with
a truism or current event all you would
say is as you embed a truism followed by
whatever you want to suggest to the
person or you could say every time you
stayed a truism or current event
followed by a suggestion and I have a
whole entire list of tons of these at
new think tank on you could also
convince people by assuming they will do
or think about that which you want them
to do and here are some power phrases
you can use if you don't hesitate in
your assumptions you could say something
such as you may be wondering what this
product will do
for you in your life or you may notice
that this product is a great time saver
or whatever the suggestion is and here
are a couple other ways to embed
suggestions using assumptions these are
very powerful and here are some examples
using indirect hypnosis you could say
something such as as you sit here I'm
sure you'll find the television perfect
for you here what am i doing I'm stating
a truism followed by a suggestion just
like I talked about in the previous
examples or you really shouldn't buy a
new television until I answer a few
questions about what you want what am i
planning on doing answering a couple
questions then they'll buy the clip the
television when you find the television
it looks good to you I'll be available
to answer your questions or imagine how
much more fun you'll have watching
football games when you have this beauty
in your living room you could ask them
what's it feel like when you buy
yourself something special or suppose
you did reward yourself by getting this
television what would that feel like or
when you're watching TV do you imagine
how beautiful a set like this would look
instead or unfortunately we can only
provide financing up to $1,500 when you
find the TV you want to buy a double
bind is an either/or clause in which you
win either way here are a couple
examples that work amazingly does 10
a.m. or 6pm work better for you or are
you a morning or afternoon type person
or would you prefer to look at our
blu-ray players before or after you look
at our TVs or finally as you look around
the store I wonder which one of you will
find the perfect gift first if you are
approaching a couple in a selling
situation you can use metaphors and
analogies to slip in a multitude of
suggestions and here are a couple of
examples of how you could do that you
could simply walk up and say most people
just walk in and buy the first
television they say I can see that you
are here to look them over however weigh
the benefits of each and make sure that
you find the right television before you
make a purchase right when used
correctly you will tap directly into the
customers imagination and subconscious
through the use of analogies and
metaphors this will make the whole sales
experience unthreatening and instead
enjoyable for you and your customers
think about how you can use analogies to
make your presentations more interesting
and unthreatening here's another example
that should help like you chose to spend
a little more for a car that excited you
behind the wheel
for a lot less this new TV will excite
you every moment you're in your home or
like you chose a neighborhood that is
safe with reliable neighbors and
provided convenience this car will keep
your family safe it will remain reliable
for years and it's great fuel economy
will keep you from losing money at the
pump or as a home buyer you already know
how important it is to weigh your
options as you make an important
decision I'm here to make sure this
important decision is handled with care
then you'll know you made the right
purchase because an expert took the time
to help and of course you can embed
suggestions within stories this is
really higher-end selling that deserves
an entire video or two but remember you
also have to make these stories one
hundred percent true exciting full of
benefits fast and interesting no
trickery is needed I then often go on to
give specific client success stories and
if by all means you don't sell the best
product available quit and then sell the
best for the best company true stories
of course will sell better than anything
else and if you're able to embed
suggestions within these stories that
will make it so much more effective a
true story interlaced with many
metaphors analogies and assumptions and
conjunctions will really sell them in
part 6 of the sales and closing
strategies tutorial I will handle
closing techniques and handling
objections if you have any questions
