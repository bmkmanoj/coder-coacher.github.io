my Java video tutorial series today I'm
gonna continue making the video game
while demonstrating how to use UML class
diagrams like we have over here to
create Java classes today we're gonna be
working on our torpedo or our gun or
whatever you want to refer to it I'm
just gonna be takin what I created here
on the right side of the screen and
transferring it over here if you haven't
watched all the previous parts of this
tutorial you definitely should otherwise
you will be confused and if you want the
completed program and you want to start
shooting torpedoes right now underneath
this video there is a link to all of the
completed code from both this tutorial
as well as the next tutorial right here
I'm gonna focus on just creating the
photon torpedo class so the very first
thing I'm gonna do is create an integer
and this is going to hold my board width
and to get my board width I'm just gonna
go game board board width and there you
go got that and I'm also going to want
to get my height and these two guys are
going to be used to make the torpedoes
disappear whenever they go off of the
screen so that's why I need to get those
things and as I progress through here
I'm gonna explain exactly why I thought
I needed what's on the right side of the
screen and then I'm gonna go private
double Center X and this guy is gonna
start out at zero zero and this is going
to be the center of my polygon or my
torpedo and it's going to start out when
it first appears on the screen right
where the nose of the ship is because it
makes sense for the torpedo to come out
of the nose of the ship and then I'm
going to create all of the vectors that
are going to be needed to draw my
polygon because it says up here photon
torpedo extends polygon so it's gonna be
important for me to have all of those
and I'm just doing this so that I can
use floating point values to be able to
draw vectors pretty much anywhere on the
screen and I'm not tied down to all the
problems that come about whenever we try
to use integers and again talked about
that previous parts of the tutorial and
then I also need to hold my Y vector
points and then these just you need to
change a little bit and this is just
going to be a basic square so that's
where all this stuff is coming from
and there you go got that all set up
then I'm gonna list out here the width
and height of my torpedo of course this
could be changed but I saw no reason for
it to change for this part of the
tutorial and of course I'm sure you know
how to change it if you would want to
have different sized bullets for some
reason then also if my torpedo goes off
of the screen I'm gonna want to know
that so that I don't waste computer time
trying to draw something that is not
even on the screen for anybody to see
and each torpedo I'm gonna start off
with a value of false so that's by
default not going to show on the screen
and then I'm also gonna need to store my
angle that my torpedo is going to be
moving around on a screen and this is
going to be whatever angle the nose of
the ship is whenever everything is going
to be created all I'm doing is I'm just
taking stuff from the right side of the
screen and moving it over to the left
side of the screen that's why you and
all class diagrams are so useful to
think then I'm gonna have a velocity and
this is basically what it's gonna do is
whenever I hit the enter key it's going
to say okay where is the nose of the
ship what is the angle of the ship and
then how quickly are we going to move
our torpedo down that angle or that
imaginary line and this guy this has
just really dummy values because they're
gonna change immediately whenever the
torpedoes first created but I'm just
throwing five in there just for the heck
of it and then the very next thing I
need to do is create my constructor and
if anything doesn't make sense leave a
comment below and I will be glad to try
to help you through this but you're
gonna find if you get a hold of the code
that you're probably gonna be able to
understand almost everything here
because the codes really heavily
commented photon torpedoes going to be
created and it's going to be passed the
X&amp;amp;Y value of whatever the nose of the
spaceship are as well as whatever the
angle of the spaceship is so that's
gonna work out real nice and then I'm
gonna create my polygon you may wonder
why if I'm drawing this as a rectangle I
don't just have it as a rectangle
instead of a polygon the reason why is I
want to have the functionality or the
ease to change this to anything I want
it to be later on in the tutorial so if
I decide I don't want it to be a
rectangle
well since it's set up to be a polygon
that
not gonna be a problem and another thing
that keeps coming up as people keep
asking me what book this comes from
there is no book I'm doing this out of
my head for better or for worse
of course I've learned some math in the
past so I guess it came out of those
math books that I've used and then I'm
just going to say okay well I want the
center of my torpedo to be equal to the
center X&amp;amp;Y points for the spaceship that
are gonna be passed over the spaceship
nose and then I'm also gonna go moving
angle is also going to be equal to
whatever the moving angle for the
spaceship is whenever it is fired New
York now since this has been fired I'm
gonna say on screen I now want you to
have a value of true because the torpedo
is now on the screen and then I need to
set how quickly the torpedo moves along
the path that is going to be defined by
two methods I'm gonna create a second
called set X velocity and set Y velocity
and this is just gonna define how
quickly they move down the X&amp;amp;Y path
torpedo X move and we're gonna be doing
this pretty much exactly the same way
that we moved our spaceship around and
you can see there there's moving angle
that's the space ships moving angle and
I'm going to multiply that times 10 so
that it moves quickly along that path
and we're gonna create all this stuff
here in a second I'll paste that in
there and we're gonna do the same thing
for y remember this X&amp;amp;Y point is for the
center of the torpedo or the little
rectangle on the screen so that is what
we're gonna be changing and then all
this stuff up here is just automatically
gonna draw our rectangle or our polygon
on our torpedo whatever you want to
refer to it as and all of that is gonna
remain the same as well so that's all we
need to do and just so you can see what
set X velocity is I'm gonna go and
create it right now even though I don't
have it created right now set X velocity
meaning that it's not on the right side
of the screen in this order set X
velocity and it's going to receive just
a double and then it's going to say this
X velocity is equal to whatever the X
velocity that was passed over that's it
so it's not that complicated let's set
that to upper case B and then guess what
this set Y velocity is going to do
pretty much exactly the same thing why
and why
and why so that's that so right here
said X velocity and right here said X
velocity that's what those guys do they
just receive a double and they set it to
whatever is set for our torpedo so then
your next question is well what does
torpedo X move angle do so I'm going to
show you that what it's gonna do is
calculate the torpedo angle of movement
now this is trigonometry again so I'm
gonna show you a little diagram here to
explain like I did previously sound
torpedo X move angle I'm just gonna copy
that paste that inside of there and it's
going to receive a double and we know
that and that double is gonna be the
move X move angle so what exactly does
it do well I'm gonna type out the
calculation and explain it it's gonna go
return and it's gonna return we're gonna
cast this to a double and then we gotta
use some trigonometry it's a math dot
and cosine if you get the X move angle
for that vector multiply it times math
dot pi divided by 180 and we do that so
that this is two radians because cosine
accepts radians not degrees and then I'm
just gonna go in here and do the torpedo
Y movement as well and then explain
showing a little triangle exactly what's
going on here so we're gonna get a
torpedo why move angle and there's Y's
again and there's y again except this is
gonna change just a little tiny bit this
is gonna be sine and this is how easy it
is to define on the fly using some trig
methods to define what is the Y vector
based off of a starting X point versus
whatever the angle is we want to move it
and I showed you this guy here in the
past basically what we have here for
torpedo X move angle see we have to get
these X&amp;amp;Y points and that's what you can
see right here so if this is the angle
that we are working with here for the
spaceship or the torpedo and I want to
get my x value which would be
represented by this adjacent right here
if I want to get whatever the X is or my
bullet which is gonna be moving so let's
just say that bullet is shot right here
and there is no Y and we're just gonna
increase X well we just need to figure
out what are all these different vector
points here right
with that guy and if you want to find
all those vector points to follow along
this line that we have right here you
just need to get the cosine of whatever
this angle is in radians and likewise if
you want to be able to find the Y points
or whatever is going on with this line
right here
you just need to take the sine of
whatever the angle is and that's going
to give you those will x and y vectors
so this is what we're working with right
here except this is gonna be a cross
okay hopefully that makes sense just
just basic trigonometry so let's get
back up into here and start fixing some
of our other things so right after here
so that we can follow along with our UML
class diagram I have over here so I
don't get confused we're gonna go public
and we're gonna go to double and we're
gonna have to have a way to get ahold of
the center X Point and this guy's real
simple all its gonna do is return Center
X right like that and then we're also
gonna have to get the Y position and
that's how we do that and that's how we
do that real simple stuff
we're just encapsulating all this code
and like I've said before any time
you're gonna be getting values chances
are you're gonna need to set them maybe
not but what the heck you might as well
put them in there so that they're in
there if you ever decide you want to use
them in the future and this is just
going to return nothing so we're gonna
put void inside of there and void inside
of there
however it is going to receive a double
and this is going to be accent as well
copy this paste that in there and this
is gonna be Y sent so X&amp;amp;Y point for the
center of our torpedo this reference to
the torpedo of course is equal to X sent
and is equal to Y sent okay so I'm doing
here is I'm setting these values that
I've created above it's all I'm doing
nothing that fancy can you scroll this
up as you can see all I'm doing is
copying from the right side of the
screen to the left well another thing
I'm going to need to do is I'm going to
need to change my X position just save
myself some time basic sort of format of
this that this is gonna receive nothing
then we're gonna say change X position
and it's going to receive a double and
Inc
or decrement amount this is gonna be
good night amount and this is change
because it can either go up or down and
then this guy the reason why I copied
this is I'm gonna go plus and then I'm
gonna go plus with this and then all I
need to do is to increment amount
I'm not just gonna change the center
point for the torpedo on a whim and like
I said before anytime you're gonna set
values chances are you're gonna be
getting values so let's come in here and
do that and this is gonna be double get
X velocity and real simply it's just
gonna return whatever the current X
velocity is like I said if you don't
need it that's no problem
it's but if you do need it it's nice to
know that it's already there or anybody
that's gonna use your code for treating
their own sort of video game there you
are man also going to come in here and
create a way to be able to get the width
of our torpedo so public int yet with
returned torpedo width there that is and
then we're also going to get the height
and if we want to be able to change the
torpedo movement angle for some reason
again this is something that I'm not
going to use here currently but it's
nice to have it if I want it and it's
just gonna get a double move angle and
then say this moving angle is equal to
moving angle copy that guy piece that in
there and then we're also going to get
moving angle double don't need anything
here and return moving angle and then of
course Seth had to move angle which is
what is passed over here another thing
we're gonna need to do is we're gonna
get to collision detection here in a
second I know you know already know how
to do that but because we've done it so
many times before I don't cover it again
get bounced so I want you to be able to
make this stuff not just copy it for me
okay return new rectangle again
everything's gonna be represented as a
rectangle and to create this guy we're
gonna go get width and we're gonna go
minus sixth which is the width of my
torpedo or my rectangle on this career
because basically what I want to get
here is the upper x position so if I get
to the total width of the rectangle or
the torpedo and then subtract that width
from it if it's at some vector point
other than zero on the screen it's going
to give me that very specific position
and then get height we're gonna do the
same thing so we just want the X&amp;amp;Y upper
left-hand corner X&amp;amp;Y position and then
we need to define what the width is so
just go get width and then get height
pull beans and there you are that's all
you need to do now this is gonna pretty
much handle collision detection for us
which is awesome
and then the last thing we need to do is
move our torpedo around on a screen and
this is gonna be a public method and
it's gonna be public void move we're
gonna say first off before we do all
kinds of calculations that would waste
our time or the computer's time we're
gonna say hey wait a minute is this
torpedo even on the screen before I do
anything and if it is we're gonna say
this torpedo we want to change its x
position and go this get X velocity get
its current velocity which is a method
real simple and then we're also want to
check if the torpedo goes off the screen
so we're gonna say if this get X Center
so if the center of our torpedo is less
than zero in that situation we're gonna
say this torpedo is now not on the
screen and it will stop doing
calculations and all kinds of other
things else if this torpedo get X Center
is greater than game board width we want
to pretty much do the same exact thing
and I know I could've did an older
statement there but I'm just trying to
really explain what's going on here so
I'm saying if my torpedo goes off the
screen to the left member I'm checking X
position then take it off don't show it
on the screen don't do calculations
don't do anything with it if it's
greater than the game board width again
do the same thing don't show it and then
what we need to do is also change our Y
position and we'll just go this get Y
velocity I think that and for some
reason I went up here and left that is
Center so let's scroll up there and just
change that to Y position there you go
that got rid of that error then I'm
basically just gonna copy this right
here paste that in there and then just
change this to Y that's pretty much
everything else is gonna be the same
again we're gonna say if the Y position
is less than 0 or the Y vector
well don't show it on the screen and if
it
greater than the gameboard height in
this situation don't show it on the
screen and that is it that is how we
create our torpedo in the next part of
the tutorial I'm gonna take this nice
torpedo and start launching it out of
the spaceship leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
