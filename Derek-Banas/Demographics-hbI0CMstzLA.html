asked me to show them how to find
demographic data online so I'm gonna do
that today this is information that's
sold for thousands of dollars by people
that you can get for free so where do I
get it well these are five of the best
ways I've found to gather very accurate
demographic information city - datacom
finder dot census gov zillow.com for
real estate information Google Maps to
hunt down and look at where competitors
are as well as to analyze traffic and
great schools org to find information on
school districts well I look for I look
for housing value fluctuations cost of
living people per square mile meaning
events the population is daytime
population age income and income changes
over the years overall education
employment information look for a lot of
information in regards to competition
traffic pattern school rankings family
cohesiveness poverty disability rates
and many other things I also want to
figure out in regards to my competition
what does an average customers spend per
purchase what is the net profit on an
average purchase how long will the
customer use that business how many
purchases will they make during that
period of use how many referrals new
customers tend to make and what's crazy
is a lot of this information can be had
just by asking employees and the
competitors businesses but some of it
can't so you just want to gather as much
as you can possibly get other data to
get is average ticket average floor
count which you can get just simply by
going into the competition's business
marketing materials which you can also
get just by going in there and asking
for what are they most busy what are
customers complaining about you also
want to really analyze the layout both
interior and exterior of the store but
in regards to getting statistics one of
the best places to find information I
have found is zillow.com so just type in
the location you're looking for here I'm
looking for a city in Wisconsin which
I'm not even gonna try to pronounce and
you can see to go up here there's
demographic information here but I
really focus on home value information
because I find that most valuable in
regards to what Zillow can provide me
and you can see right here it's gonna
give me month over month fluctuations in
real estate values it's gonna give me
quarter a quarter you're over a year
it's gonna give me the average value of
a home in this
location as of July 2010 and this
information is considered very very
accurate and then I also look at what
was the price of a home in 2007 so I
want to really figure out is the real
estate market here all beat up so that's
what I would get from looking at Zillow
calm then we can go over to City
- data calm type in our location here
and they provide a wealth of information
in regards to demographics I'm always
amazed when people don't know anything
about City data so let's take a look at
what they got well you can see here not
only they give me really accurate
population information as of July 2009
but they're telling me that the
population has increased over this
period by sixteen point two percent so I
know it's growing
give me a median age which is great give
me household incomes and also how
household incomes have changed since
2000 median household value give me a
ranking on cost of living based off of
the average across the United States
being 100 so I know the cost of living
there is lower than average give me a
lot of information on ancestry if that's
important to you and this is very
important to me it gives me overall
population density per square mile which
is very valuable we're also able to find
a lot of information in regards to
education level the people that live
there how many people are married within
the area can also find daytime
population changes based off of
commuting in and out of the city this
definitely you want this to be a
positive number meaning during the
daytime you're gonna have a lot of
people moving into town also a lot of
information on how many people live in
this area in poverty this is actually
extremely low and an immense wealth of
other information what a lot of people
don't look at is if you scroll way way
way way way down to the bottom they
actually will do top 100 top 101 list
and if your city are looking at an
obviously you'd be looking at a lot of
cities and comparing them to each other
but there might be something really
really great like for example this has
ranks in the top 100 counties with the
smallest number of people without health
insurance coverage and sometimes things
will pop up in here like for example
ranked in the top 100 for daily influx
of people meaning there's a lot of
people who come into town every single
day so this is a very very important
place to look
a lot of people don't look at in regards
to city datacom another place if you
want to find information in regards to
unemployment just go to bls.gov and then
click on tables and maps on the left
side and if you scroll down you can get
all of the information on unemployment
in every single County so just go down
to County data and then look for map
click on the gift and here you can get
unemployment information on every single
county in the United States
so that's something else useful then if
you go to send stats Census gov and
click on county data you're able to pull
up information so let's just go here and
click on Wisconsin and specific county
that I was looking in was Lakeisha and
if I hit go it's going to give me a lot
of information that's updated as of 2008
this is a wealth of information which
Jeff understands the census doesn't
update on a monthly basis it only
updates on a major level every 10 years
and on a semi major level every two
years so this is some of the most
accurate information you're gonna get in
regards to data can also go to
fact-finder Census gov and you can look
up your community here as well what's
crazy about this is sometimes they'll
provide that up to 2008 and only and
other circumstances go up to the year
2000 but you can definitely want to
check it out because this information is
dense meaning it will literally answer
almost any question you could ever want
answered then after you gather all that
information you might want to check out
great schools org if we typed in the
community again see we dump that in
there and it's gonna give me high school
and elementary school and all kinds of
different rankings so that's also very
useful then once we have all this
information we go to Google Maps type in
the location that we are searching for
and I've always found that one of the
best places to locate a new business
would be near a grocery store among
other things obviously if you just
simply type in grocery it's going to
show you a whole bunch of grocery stores
but you can see here this is a Piggly
Wiggly and there's a couple other
different locations here so if we were
looking to locate an area such as this
we would want to zoom in near those
grocery stores we would want to
if we have any competition so let's say
we were looking for to locate a craft
store let's type in craft and you can
see here car craft sturdy craft and
Franklin crafts okay so the hosts are
basically this is the only competition
in the area so that's a basic rundown of
all the different demographic
information you can look at and where to
locate it if you have any questions or
comments leave them in the comment
