40 of my java video tutorial series
today I'm going to show you how to
create je applets which are just like
swing components that you can load right
directly into a browser and also I'm
going to convert kind of my personality
test so that we'll be able to come in
here answer a couple questions hit get
results and a personality report pops
right on the screen so it's kind of Veen
and all the code for this is available
underneath of the video so let's get
into the code so I'm going to come in
here and I'm going to start importing
myself some libraries so Java X swing
because we're going to be using a bunch
of Swing components inside of this if
you're used to my swing component
tutorials you're not going to have any
problem with this because for the most
part everything you do with applets is
identical with what you did with swing
components it's all the same sort of
stuff only difference is you're going to
see here in a minute you don't use a
main function
I'm going to go public class and I'm
going to go Java lesson already extends
J applet like that and then I'm going to
have to start creating some components
I'm going to create a J panel and it's
going to contain all my other panels and
I'm going to create just like you're
used to doing with swing then I'm going
to go question one panel and what this
is going to do is it's going to contain
all the radio buttons for the first
question then the second question and
the fourth question and I just have to
come in here and change this to two
three and four
if you can't see what's on the screen
just view it full screen everything will
look wonderful then we need to create a
button years old don't worry I'm going
to be covering a whole bunch of new
things here in a second and I need to
create a jet you've radio buttons so
they're going to represent all the
different questions in the personality
test and don't worry about it if you
don't know what an extravert is or any
of that stuff I'll provide a link above
you will not see the personality test
since your radio ok so those are going
to be the names for all the different
radio buttons we're going to be using
here in this little tool then I'm going
to dynamically create and then display
in HTML document so to do that I'm going
to use a J editor pane I'm going to call
it your report a thing that popped up
there on the screen that was a J editor
pane with an HTML file in it and here's
the big difference we do not use main
function instead with applets that open
up in browsers we're going to use an
init function then we're going to set
the size or the frame was going to go
inside of that browser to 675 pixels to
870 pixels pretty simple
then we're going to go the panel which
is going to contain all the other
different panels and they go new J panel
and inside of it I'm going to get a new
flow layout and then I'm going to go
flow layout what this is gonna allow me
to do is left justify everything that is
inside of the panel it's going to give
me an error message saying it can't find
flow layout so I'm just going to click
on import bring that in there and there
you are and you can cast this into a
layout manager but you don't need to as
you can see there and I'm just going to
go question one panel is equal to nu J
panel because all of the radio buttons
are going to be contained in their own
special little panel and I need four of
these of course and then we just need to
change this to two and that's the three
and that's the four now you got separate
panels for all your radio buttons then
you need to create borders around all of
those panels so we're going to go border
and border one that's where you saw the
little questions and whenever I ran this
guy for you and you go board or factory
dot create titled border and of course I
have a whole tire tutorial on this and
I'm going to type in my question to you
prefer to work like that and there you
go there's the border just so you know
what I mean this is what I'm doing right
here these are the borders and also
these are the panels and those are of
course radio buttons so what are we
going to need to do well this is
underlined what's that mean we're going
to go import border and there you go now
we got that border library inside of
there and we're going to create four of
these because there's four panels so I'm
just going to call this border to border
three and border four and then we're
just going to change our questions and
this was going to be which is most
important and this one's going to be to
you act on and then which do you prefer
like that alright so all those questions
going to be available in there then we
need to come in here and solidify these
question panels by setting the borders
around these panels though sounds really
hard it's not question panel we're going
to get a set border and set this to
border one because that makes sense now
we'll get that assigned one we got to do
well we got to create four of those
that's exactly what we did and then we
just need to change these two two three
four change this to three change that to
four you know we are just putting
everything together like bunch of puzzle
pieces then what we need to do is make
sure that only one radio button can be
silly
did per question and you do that by
using button groups and we're just going
to go group one is equal to new button
group that and then guess what we're
going to do this for all of the other
ones like that so be two three four now
we're going to have a button group for
each of the radio buttons and we want to
go in here and get this stuff right here
and I'm just going to copy it so that I
make sure everything's spelled the same
paste that inside of there then I'm
going to go actually copy this I caught
it extrovert radio is equal to nu J
radio button and I'm going to say in
groups which is going to be the answer
to said question I need eight of these
guys so I'm going to cut this out of
here I down here paste that in on your
own cut this out of here paste it right
there actually why don't I do it for all
of them paste all right so I got those
all change and I need to assign the
right questions to each one of the radio
buttons and to adapt there you go well
now I need to set the radio buttons to
true by default some of these are going
to be true and I'm just gonna have
extrovert radio be true and since or be
true and feeler be true and judging be
true so that's just going to be each
radio button is going to have a default
is true and then set selected like that
if you want to set it to true that's how
you do it
pretty simple then if we want to do it
for all the other ones just paste this
in there there you go throwing
everything together here real cool now
we need to add our radio buttons to
their individual panels so we have to go
quest one panel dot add and then inside
of this we're going to put extrovert
radio like that and I'm actually going
to copy this paste at eight times again
you normally of course wouldn't do all
this all in one method using the
initialization method but just to go
through here and not get things too
confusing that's why I'm doing it soon
enough I'll cover design patterns and
algorithms and get into all the computer
science computer science stuff and then
I'm going to copy this I didn't notice
and I semicolons in the wrong place why
did that got that fixed okay so I got
all those radio buttons attached to the
right panels now I need to assign all
these guys to the right groups in this
situation remember
that's so that you can only select one
at a time and this one's going to be
group 1 and it's going to stay the same
and copy this paste like that I'm going
to come in here and change these two two
three four and there we are now we got
all those radio buttons assigned to
groups so you can only select one at a
time now we need to come in here and add
our radio button panels to the main
panel which is called the panel question
one
annal like that and I guess what we're
gonna do we're going to copy and paste
again and then we're going to go two and
four and there we go got that all set up
so it's just a matter of what do you
want to do next and we have to create
ourselves button that is going to fire
off a nice method that's going to do all
kinds of cool things whenever we click
on it J button and I'm gonna say get
result there we are I create a J button
and then I'm gonna go get results list
Center I'm going to call it but listener
is able to new yet result listener and
we're going to create this class right
here called get results listener that's
why it's not showing anything right now
so if they need to make sure it has the
same there no problem then we're going
to go get result but which is the name
from a button and I need to add an
action listener which is a real simple
way of saying whenever this guy is
clicked on I want you to fire a method
and we're going to go by listener like
that then I need to go the panel need to
add my little button to my main panel
then we go this which is a reference to
the applet window or frame whatever you
want to think of it out and then add my
panel to that applet and then I need to
say show my applet and we do that by
giving it the value of true there you
are now what I need to do is actually
create this class and I'm just going to
call it class get results listener and
implements action listener and I like
this because I can put my mouse over
this instance a add unimplemented
methods of course that saves me a little
bit of time and thinking so there we are
I know what I need to work with now
because Eclipse helped me along with
that outside of this guy I'm going to
create a string and I'm going to call it
page to open is equal to
going to give it a value of nothing and
then I'm going to create another string
directory LOC which is directory
location and I'm going to give it file
colon three slashes very important and
then this is on my local drive that I'm
playing around with this stuff so this
of course is going to be different for
you like that and then just so I don't
confuse things I'm going to go string
text to display and here's what I'm
going to be creating the dynamic HTML
that's going to be opened up inside of
here now you don't need a head and all
those different things and I'm going to
create a div around this which I
technically don't even have to do but I
don't know I was just typing and that's
what came out well then I would since I
want to put a double quote I need to
escape it with a backslash and then I'm
gonna go directory location close that
off now that I get all that fixed I mean
need to make sure that the event that
was triggered was triggered when the
button was pressed and that's the reason
why they're here I'm gonna go get result
right and if my button was the reason
why the event was triggered I'm going to
say if extrovert radio is selected and
what I'm doing here is just checking if
the radio button named extrovert radio
was selected and if it was I don't need
to use curly braces
I'm going to go page to open and I'm
going to put on the end of that the
letter e see all of my files are going
to be of the type three letters so for
example e SF j dot Peng so what I'm
doing is I'm slowly adding in those
potential things those pinging files I'm
going to jump up here and grab these
just so I make sure I don't have any
typos typos will kill you base that in
there
we already got extrovert so that's good
so I just need to do eight more of these
guys I like that and then I'm going to
go in here and go introvert paste that
in there censor it's that man two ative
Euler linker judging and perceiving
there you are got all those all Soto I
can delete that and then this is just
going to be changed into an eye this is
going to be changed into an S an N and F
T please just match up with the codes
for the personality types J and P so now
I know what ping file I want to open and
that ping file is the personality report
then I'm going to
the panel I'm going to remove all of
these unneeded panels from the screen
because I don't need them anymore I want
to make room for my personality report
and it just changes to two and this two
three and four
so that's how you remove panels you can
do it at any time then I'm going to go
text to display plus is equal to and I'm
going to add these strings to it and
remember I said it's a ping file so I'm
going to get a dot PNG plus I have two
backslash my second double quote this
and then this is going to close off my
image and this is going to close off my
HTML tag at the very end and of course
get this out of here now we go your
report which is the name for my J edit
or plain I'm going to go new a editor
pane and I tell it I want text where I'm
going to give it HTML file here and the
string that I want it to display has
HTML inside of it is called text to
display which is this whole entire thing
which is the whole HTML file and of
course don't forget to put the equals
sign then I'm going to go your report
set editable no I don't want my jetty
editor pane to be editable your report
I'm going to set my size my J editor
pane to 650 pixels by 825 pixels I want
this whole entire report to be
scrollable I'm going to go J scroll pane
I'm going to call it scroller is equal
to nu J scroll pane your report is named
my J editor pane that's why I'm going to
add to it and then I'm going to define
how I want scroll borders to appear J
scroll pane and I say vertical scroll
bar always and then actually I copy this
piece that in there and I just need to
change this to horizontal close that off
close that off now if I want to come in
here and also say I told you you can be
covering a lot of things here I'm gonna
get a scroller set preferred size i'm
just get defining how big i want this to
be I'm going to go new dimension use
dimension to define this and 8:25
exactly the same as what I have before
and I didn't import my dimension library
but that what eclipse do some work for
me then I just need to go the panel and
add my scroller it contains my J outer
pane and then get result but which is
the button which I have not deleted yet
and I'm going to set its visible to fall
another way to make a component
disappear on the screen and then I just
need to redraw everything so I can ou
dog panel and to do that you go
revalidate and then the panel and you go
repaint and that redraws everything in
the applet so there you go
I just touch a whole bunch of different
things you've any questions or comments
below all the codes under the video go
get it and look at it it's heavily
commented and you will learn this stuff
instead of just watching me do it til
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
