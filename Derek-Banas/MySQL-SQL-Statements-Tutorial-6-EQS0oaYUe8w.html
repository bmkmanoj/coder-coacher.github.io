6 the final tutorial on SQL statements
and MySQL today I'm going to cover
working with multiple tables talk about
one-to-one one-to-many many-to-many
joins and unions you just saw in the
previous tutorial how you link tables
using foreign keys now we'll look at
different ways tables can interact first
one-to-one when we are talking about one
to many relationships think about the
table diagram here if you had a list of
customers chances are some of them would
live in the same state hence in the
state column in the parent table it
would be common to see a duplication of
states in this example each customer can
only live in one state so there would
only be one ID used for each customer
just remember that a one-to-many
relationship is one in which a record in
the parent table can have many matching
records in the child table a record in
the child can only match one record
however in the parent a customer can
choose to live in any state but they can
only live in one at a time many people
can own many different products in this
example you can see an example of a
many-to-many relationship this is a sign
of a non normalized database how could
you ever access this information well if
a customer buys more than one product
you will have multiple product IDs
associated with each customer as well
you would have multiple customer IDs
associated with each product you could
create a table that just holds the
foreign keys for both the products and
the customers this is called a junction
table then the junction table loses
normalization but the other tables don't
if you want to quarry two tables you
must first merge their data with a joint
statement there are multiple different
types of joins in this presentation I'm
going to cover the full join a straight
join the left and right join and the
inner join you create a full join when
multiple tables are listed by joining
two tables this way each row from both
tables is combined here's an example of
how
could create a full joint like we have
many times you use the select statement
followed by in this circumstance the
table name customers and we're saying
here that we want all of the columns in
that customer table as well we want all
the columns in the products table and
then from them we are going to extract
both the customers and the product when
you perform a full join you may be
overwhelmed with data so be careful if
you combine this join with a where
clause you could decrease however the
number of results returned an equal join
is one in which the where Clause limits
the results in just cases in which two
columns are equal the non-equivalent
performs the opposite with a not equal
sign which you can see here inside of a
where clause a straight joint is used
when you wanted to find the order in
which the tables are joined you tell the
database server what order to use by
listing them in the required order after
the from statement as you can see here
in this example if a left join is used
when you want to show rows on the left
table that don't match in the right
table you would follow this example as
you see here this would return a table
with all the columns in the customers
table listed and all the columns in the
products table being listed that have a
matching column name with customers you
can also perform the opposite actions
with arranging an inner join is similar
to a full joint except that you are able
to add conditions that will limit and
refine the results you receive this is
how you make an inner join as you see
here we're using the Select statement
and we're extracting the first name from
the table named US presidents as well as
the first name of the president's wives
we're taking all of this from the table
US presidents and that we are joining
with the president wise table and here
at the end you can see the condition
that we're using we're checking that we
would receive results if the
identification numbers from both tables
are equal this would return a list of
all presidents and first wives that have
a matching identification number this is
referred to as an equal children as I
mentioned before because it checks for
equality of values as well there are
other inner joins that schefren a qua
and the other performs tests on tables
that have columns with the same name to
make a non equally just replaced the
equal sign in the comparison above with
the not equal sign a natural join
matches columns with the same column
name they look like this see here using
the Select keyword followed by the
references to the first name of both the
US presidents as well as the president
Wives table then we're saying we're
taking information from the US
presidents table and we're going to
perform a natural join with the
president's wives a union statement you
can also combine two or more tables the
Union statement combines all of the
values in the tables specified cuts out
the duplicates and serves up the results
you can see here how we're using a union
statement we are using the Select
keyword followed by first name from the
table US presidents and we would use the
Union keyword and we're going to select
first name from president's watch then
we're gonna order that based off of the
first names and make them all show up in
alphabetic order this return a list of
all the US presidents and first wives in
order if you want all the values to be
displayed including any duplicates you
can use the Union all statement well now
you're basically an SQL expert I've gone
over all of the different techniques and
all the different capabilities available
to you with SQL hope you enjoyed this
presentation next up I'm going to show
you how you can use all these SQL
Curie's in PHP til next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
