present to you the absolute final video
today we're going to talk about locked
CSS layouts all of the layouts I've been
showing you or known as liquid layout a
liquid layout is a loud but in which the
web page will change and resize as a
person resizes their browser a locked
layout on the other hand will stay in
place no matter how the browser is
resized each type of layout has their
own positives and negatives some choose
whichever fits your specific situation
now here is how you set up a locked
layout again extremely simple all you
need to do is create what would be
considered a master div and some
surround all of your other divs with
this master div and of course you would
want to make a fixed width for this div
you probably would want to add padding
to the top of the div and padding on the
bottom you definitely would want to
choose a background color and more than
likely the background color of this
master all surrounding div is going to
be exactly the same color as your body
tag then you would want to set up margin
left to autumn and margin-right:auto if
you do this your webpage will be
centered automatically that's all there
is to create an a lock CSS layout just
make sure you understand the opening div
for the master div would appear right
after the body opening and the closing
div for this master div would appear
right before the closing body tag now
I'm going to show you how to place dibs
exactly where you want you can tell the
browser exactly where to place your divs
right down to the pixel if you do this
this is called absolute positioning I
have to warn you though that it is very
easy to break the structure of a web
page if you don't precisely calculate
the exact placement of your dibs over
the years when I've been calling in to a
company to fix CSS errors it's almost
always had something to do with absolute
positioning the major difference between
normal and absolute positioning
is that the order of the HTML code
doesn't matter think of your dibs as
playing cards you could stack them up on
top of each other with absolute
positioning in fact there is a new
property for absolute positioning tips
and it is known as the z-index here is
some CSS code that I will use to
demonstrate absolute position divs here
is an absolute position to side bar this
is a class that's defined and then
here's background color padding
position:absolute tells the browser that
you are going to position this
absolutely down in the pixel you do that
by typing in top 100 pixels means that
you want this sidebar to appear a
hundred pixels from the top of the
webpage and right zero pixels means you
want it to be stuck to the right side of
the master div want it to be a width of
200 and then you define the z-index the
higher the z-index the higher on the
page this div will appear so z and x 0
if placed in the same position as this z
and z index class is defined right here
in this div would appear underneath of
this sidebar death so that's absolute
position a div element that is
relatively positioned is positioned
relative to another death welcome to
another technique to completely break
your page design if not used properly
here is the code needed to relatively
position anything what I'm doing here is
defining a class named sidebar and I'm
defining that I wanted to be efficient
relative to the div it lies inside of so
it's just a div with an image inside of
it and I wanted to lie a hundred pixels
from the left side of that divot lines
inside and a hundred pixels down from
the div that it lies inside and that's
relative positioning have you ever gone
on a web page and seen a pop-up window
that was embedded in the web page itself
and followed you around as you scroll
well and this whole CSS style HTML
tutorial I'll show you how to make one
this is what I'm referring to by the way
here's an example this div is actually
going to stay in
same position no matter what I do that's
how you would create an irritating
pop-up well if you want to create an ear
taking off up here's how to do it define
class named whatever then what you want
to do is define a border maybe I'm using
dotted here bordered color background
color its width of 200 pixels you
definitely want to define a width text
align it to center you can do whatever
you want with that this is the part
that's really important now here we're
defining position fixed and this is what
keeps your little div in the same
position no matter how anybody scrolls
and here we're defining we want it to be
set a hundred pixels from the top of the
browser window and 300 pixels from the
left well now you know pretty much every
single thing there is to know about
cascading style sheets I left out a
couple properties that only work in one
browser and don't work in other ones but
aside from those broken properties you
know pretty much everything if you have
any comments leave them below if you
have any questions and if you'd like to
see presentations done on JavaScript PHP
MySQL maybe on WordPress themes you can
also comment below hope you enjoyed this
I enjoyed making it till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
