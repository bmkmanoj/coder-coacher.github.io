5 of my ex get video tutorial today
we're going to talk about some really
interesting tools we're going to talk
about cloning and clone tiling which is
really cool if you missed any of the
previous parts of tutorial you don't
have to watch them if you're just
interested in this subject but if you'd
like to take a look there you are
available in the upper right hand corner
of this video and also in the
description for this video so I have a
lot to do so let's get into it so now
I'm gonna demonstrate cloning first
because it's pretty simple and I just
hit star and I'm going to draw a star
shape here on our screen and now that I
have that selected I'm going to go over
into edit and come down here where it
says clone and if you can't see this
view it fullscreen it's an HD video and
I'm going to click on create clone now
the clone is going to be on top and if I
would say switch over into the node tool
and actually what I'm going to do with
this guy is I'm going to convert this to
path so go path object to path and there
we go and grab this node and there you
can see it automatically changed the
clone something else that's kind of neat
about this is let's say I select this
clone and create a clone of a clone
what's going to happen so just go clone
create clone there we go and we have a
new clone now if we come in here and
change this clone that's going to change
but the original will not and also if I
would say come in here to this clone and
change it both of those is going to
change because this is a clone of this
and this is a clone of that and of
course I can come in here and detach
them so that they no longer affect each
other by clicking on edit coming down
here clone unlink clone and now we'll be
able to come in here and change this
clone without affecting the other ones
so that's the basics what you do with
clone so now let's take a look at
something a little bit more cool clone
tiling all right so to demonstrate clone
tiling and basically what it does is it
just repeats an object in numerous
different ways across the screen so
let's say I create a rectangle so I'm
going to draw rectangle inside of here
or a square or whatever I want there we
go and let's move it over here
then we're going to go into edit and
clone and create tiled clones now this
starts off really simple but it gets
really crazy very quickly so I have that
selected let's just do something really
really simple so I have one row and
three columns and hit create and there
you can see not that exciting however
there are numerous other different
things you can do and to remove that
styling just click on remove now we can
come in here to this guy and let's say
well let's close this we want to draw
some ellipses in here so we can track
exactly what's going on so we got that
and let's give that a white space and
also let's come in here and just make
copies of this dot so I put one there
and then put another one down there it
looks like a die ok and then we'll come
in and give this a fill color of yellow
and to give this a fill color of cyan
and then give this a fill color of I
don't know neon well however I got neon
green let's try red instead all right so
now I have those selected I'm going to
hit ctrl G to group something I've
covered before and then again edit down
to clone and then create tiled clones
there we go simple translation we
already saw so let's try something
different
and let's look at all of them all at the
same time here so basically simple
translation is just going to make as
many duplicates across how many rows and
how many columns you define p2 through
cm are going to rotate the tiles as they
are being generated 180 degrees and then
also flip them both horizontally and
vertically p4 as well as p4m and p4g
are going to rotate 90 degrees which is
going to give you sort of the impression
that you are creating tiles in square
shapes p3 through p3m1 are going to
create 120 degree rotations as well as
reflections if you would like that which
are going to create sort of triangular
patterns and then P 6 and p6 em are
going to rotate 60 degrees which is
going to create hexagonal type patterns
all right so we have those set up let's
just change it to 180 degree rotation it
now let's come in here also make this
three rows and three columns and create
and there you can see the white went
down here 180 degrees and then back
where it was and you can see that it is
also using the same tile
the first row for each one of these and
then since everything is rotating on our
day degrees it's also going to keep
everything else aligned we can come in
here again and let's try reflection hit
create now you can see the yellow the
yellow the red the red the white the
white the blue the blue all line up but
you can also see that we are also using
the same tile in each beginning row
glide reflection is going to change that
a little bit what it's going to do is
flip the white down there and you can
see how this is all changing
and this is really something that you
would play with on your own now to also
look at this in a completely different
way we're going to close this and we're
going to delete this and I'm going to
draw a sort of any irregular type of
shape because I found drawing your
regular type of shapes with this tool
makes it a little bit easy to
demonstrate exactly how it's working so
there we go I drew sort of like a bean
typed shape inside of there let's shrink
that down a little bit so that we'll be
able to see it a little bit better then
if I want to change the stroke I
actually don't think I've ever shown you
this before just come down here at the
very bottom where it says stroke and
right click now we can come up here and
say we want to change the stroke to six
say now the mean shapes a little bit
easier to say and again we're going to
go into edit and clone and create table
clones now you can see of course
symmetry is or simple translation is
going to keep everything nice and even
same exact thing over and over again
iron 80 degrees there you can see how
they're flipped so it's a little bit
easier to see exactly what's going on
with these patterns whenever you use
irregular shapes collide and let's go
down into the 90 degree rotation and hit
create see how we're sort of well
actually I need to change these to four
to make sure that you can see how they
are sort of square shaped patterns
create say square shaped patterns are
being formed whenever you have a 90
degrees it's kind of hard to see
whenever we switch to 120 degrees that
these sort of have a triangular type of
pattern but sort of get that gist just
from looking at it now let's change it
to 60 degree rotation hit create and you
can see those patterns that are
generated there so they're all kind of
interesting but whenever we get into
shift and scale and all these other
things you can see some really really
really cool things happen let's just
demonstrate one of those right now let's
say that I want to draw a diamond
shape so come in with a star come over
here click on polygon let that be for
and let's just hold down the control key
so everything lines up here and then
shift over to the Select tool and let's
make this with 90 pixels and I'm just
changing this up here and let's make our
height for our diamond shape 150 pixels
so there we got that right there and if
we want to come in and also change edit
clone create table clones there we go
course we can do very very simple things
like the simple translation or the p1 as
its referred to all the time hit create
and there you can see how those patterns
are generated we can also come in and do
some more interesting things and one
thing to remember with this there's
almost every single time you're going to
get frustrated using the tiled clones
tool it's going to be based off the fact
that you set something inside of here in
one of these tabs and you don't remember
which one that's why it's always a good
idea to go reset at any time you're
really struggling you can't figure out
why things aren't rotating or aren't
doing what you expect them to do just
come in here and reset all these and
then try again chances are there's
something that's been set and you just
don't remember it and reset now all of
them are reset so that's good again
unclamp what that's going to do is if
you have a whole bunch of random
patterns what it's going to try to do
sort of make the distance between these
objects in these patterns that you're
creating look a little better like so
that they're not all clumped together
hence the name on clump and remove of
course like I said it's going to remove
the tiled clone changes that you made
somebody's kind of neat let's jump
inside of here and let's change this to
120 degree rotation there you go and hit
create there you can see patterns are
starting the formal on the screen so
that's kind of neat and another thing
you might want to do is to come in here
and change this to a one and hit create
and then actually we can come in here
and change this to a three and hit
create and what I'm referring to are the
rows and the columns and there you can
see that I was able to generate this
cube shape on the screen really really
easy actually so there's numerous
different things you can do and I'm
going to explore more as we go on here
next thing I want to explore is the
shift tab inside of this and how it's
going to change the look and feel of
everything that we
going to be using here and I'm going to
close this and instead what I'm going to
do is draw an hexagon shape so like this
there that is change the corners on this
to six there we go
hold down control and there we have our
type of hexagon shape actually shift
this and I'm going to rotate it there we
go that looks a little bit better and
let's look at shift again so we're just
going to go edit clone create table
clones and here we are again let's take
a look at shift now remember we want to
change this back to simple translation
or hit reset anytime we're trying to
create a new design and basically what
shifts going to do is each time a new
tile is created either on a row or on a
column you're going to be able to shift
or move those different new tiles in
different ways normally whenever you're
playing around with the shifts rows are
going to be affected by shift Y in this
area that's where you're going to be
making changes and columns are going to
be affected inside of the shift X sort
of setting so for example let's say I
come in here like I said shift X is
going to be columns most of the time I
mean play around with it find what you
like and shift Y is going to be rows so
change that just like that and then we
come in here and hit create and there
you can see that it just created a
little bit of space between each of
these tiles as they were being drawn on
the screen then we can look at these
different settings basically what
alternate is going to do is alternate
the sign for the shifts for each new
tile that's going to be drawn and this
is going to deal with each row and this
is going to deal with each column
cumulates is going to sort of grow the
shifts so if you are jumping 10% well
then the next time it's going to get 20
and it's going to go up and up and up
and again you can divine that for the
rows as well as the columns to create
many different sort of different shapes
and changes and then exclude tile is
basically just going to ignore the tile
height the original tile height whenever
it is shifting all these and in this
situation it's a little bit confusing
this is going to exclude the tile height
and this is going to exclude the tile
width and then of course we can also
randomize with this over here and so
forth and so on
what we're going to do
is we're going to remove that and we're
going to create something a little bit
more interesting now like I said before
shift X is normally going to relate to
columns and rows but not always in this
situation what I'm going to do is I'm
going to leave the columns be 0 and I'm
going to show you a real quick way to
create a whole bunch of really neat
patterns using hexagons so we'll go into
shift X and what it's going to do is
shift 50% and then the shift Y is going
to shift negative 25% as each new tile
is being drawn on our screen we also
want to make sure that the symmetry is
set for simple translation which it is
then when I hit create and you're going
to see that the hexagons all grew
outwards to make 3 of them however if we
come in here to the columns part let's
up this a little bit let's change this
to 6 in this to 6 and hit create you can
see now that we made like a honeycomb
sort of pattern on the screen and we're
able to move those all into a very
interesting type of pattern on our
screen now I'm going to demonstrate
scaling so we're going to go and create
ourselves another rectangle or square
shape inside of here go into edit and as
you're probably guessing scaling is just
going to scale the shapes as we create
new tiles create table clones and there
we are again let this be set to simple
translation click on scale and in this
situation what we're going to do with
our square we have here is as we draw
new squares on the screen we're going to
decrease their size so change that to
negative 15 change that to negative 15
course we could randomize these we could
also alternate the signs on these from
tile tile and also accumulate them and
then we're messing around with columns
in this situation so let's come in here
and set this to 1 set this to 4 hit
create and there you can see as they're
drawing new tiles
we are decreasing by 15% each new tile
that goes on the screen and as you're
probably guessing there's numerous
different ways to play around with
scaling and I'm going to show more
interesting things we can do here in a
second after I cover all the basics of
using these tools come in here and reset
this close that delete all these things
and this time we're going to draw
ourselves a triangle up inside here
changes 3 and there is our triangle now
to demonstrate rotation it should work
pretty well edit clone create table
clones go into rotation and as you're
guessing as new tiles
they're also going to be rotated so
let's just let this guy here meaning
Rose be set to one and let's change the
columns to seven because I want them to
be drawn as columns from left to right
and I don't want them to be going from
the top to the bottom that's how we are
looking at rows and columns we can come
in here now since we are using the
columns and we want to rotate them let's
say we want to rotate them 20 degrees
hit create and you can see that's
exactly what they're doing so as a
rotating across the screen they are
starting off flat like this and rotating
bit by bit by bit until they go back to
their original position so there you go
another thing we can do is let's draw a
star in this situation this is something
maybe a little bit more interesting what
we've done I'm in here select star do
this inside of there increase this to 5
go get the Select tool get this guy
right here and there we go now we have
our star shape on there we could also
come in here and if we zoom in you're
going to see the center point for our
star right here let's say we move it
outside of the actual shape itself then
what's come in here and actually play
around with the clone and the tiles and
the rotation tab specifically we could
then come in to shift and say hey don't
pay any attention to the height and the
width of this star and then jump back
over into rotation change the per column
degree rotation to 60 and let per row be
0
hit create and there you can say you
basically stacked all these guys and
revolved all these stars around the
changed center point for the star
something else that's a little bit more
interesting again I'm going to come in
here and I'm going to reset all these
different guys so that I don't have any
problems or get confused by anything I
did the past close that let's say that
you would want to come in here and
create for yourself like a flower
pattern let's draw ourselves an ellipse
here on our screen there it is nice and
simple again open up our clone tiling
there it is if you want to rotate this
guy around to create like a flower
pattern like we said before
well we're mainly going to be messing
around with our columns so let's say we
want to have 12 petals and what
not going to do anything with anything
else so let's just leave that be set is
one go into rotate and remember we have
a bunch of columns here and we have one
row so we're going to be focusing in on
our column so we're going to set this to
say 15 degrees and then in our shift
with each new one that is going to be
drawn if we want everything to be
shifted around all on the same dot what
we can do is for shift X per column
we'll set that to negative 100% and then
shift Y we'll also set that to negative
100 percent and hit create and there you
can see there's your flower type pattern
could also just do something quite
interesting with just a simple line
delete that come in here bezzie a tool
bunk and bunk and we'll see how this
lines up here what it looks like okay
got that set again jump into our clone
tiling in this situation what I'm going
to do is make pretty much a same type of
flower thing but it's going to look a
little bit more interesting let's set
our rows to 8 and our columns to 10 jump
in to shift again negative 100 per
column negative 100 per row again we
want all of these rotations to be done
in the center and then jump over into
rotation and let's change this to 2
degrees for Row and 18 degrees for
column make sure it's not 1518 I'll
cause catastrophe okay cut that set and
it great and there you can see is
another interesting type of pattern so
I'm basically just jump it through all
these different things let's change it a
little bit well change this to well
let's change this one let's change the
row here to 10 hit create you can see
how it's moving together or you could
change this to say 4 and hit create and
you can see how the spacing is changing
as that is rotations are occurring on
our screen
that brings us to blur and opacity and
for this guy I'm just going to use a
simple rectangle just like before again
clone create clones ah here it is blur
and opacity blur as you're probably
guessing is going to blur this the
different objects as they're being drawn
across the screen so let's just come in
here and change this to 1 we want this
to go across the x-axis let's just
change this to 6 I don't know
and then let's change the blur
percentage let's just put one inside of
there
create there you go there's a one
percentage blur each time a new tile is
being drawn but you can't see that
because it's too slight so let's change
it instead to 10% create and there you
can see it just blurs as each new tile
comes on the screen change that back to
zero not going to be using that and we
get into fade out let's try changing
this to 10 it create and there you can
see as the rectangles are being drawn on
the screen they're slowly fading away
and in actuality if you want them to
pretty much fade almost completely away
change that to 16 hit create and you can
see it's a little bit more dramatic
there on our screen so as you would
probably guess the way you think blur
and opacity changes would you know
actually show up on the screen that's
exactly what happens so let's set that
to reset that brings us to color the
color tab it does some pretty
interesting things one thing you're
going to have to do however if you want
to mess around with this is you're going
to need to have to mess around with
initial color let's get rid of that and
you're going to have to also change the
fills so if I want to change the color
or hue the lightness and so forth as new
tiles are being drawn across the screen
I'm just going to select this however
what I'm going to have to do is go in
for the stroke and the fill and set this
to what is called unset paint so unset
paint unset paint for both of those guys
then jump back into it again
clone tiled clones jump over into color
specifically then what you have to do is
define an initial color and in this
situation it's red so let's just say
that's what I want or I can change it to
whatever I want let's change it to green
just to be different and then say okay
now your initial color is green and if I
want to change my hue as it goes across
negative 16 normally works pretty good
so I'm going to go like this negative 16
and also change this to negative 16 of
course you could randomize I almost
never randomize though saturation
doesn't really matter let's just change
that to negative 16 as well negative 16
and then our lightness let's say that we
want this to be less changes to the
negative 5 and since we're only messing
around with columns let's just let this
be 0
let's just play around see what happens
okay so you'd create and there you can
see starts off at green goes to pround
go
- magenta purple blue and navy blue so
it's basically just generating for us a
rainbow type pattern you could of course
come in here and change this six create
and you're going to be able to create
even more interesting types of
transitions from one color to another
and really you should go in here and
play around with this because it's just
kind of interesting to see exactly
what's generated could also come in here
change this to zero okay just to zero
change this to zero and then change this
to negative sixteen and this one too and
your sixteen and hit create and you can
see that it is going from whatever our
initial color is and slowly getting rid
of the saturation in their color as it
goes across so really interesting sort
of effects that you can get with this
color tab and really interesting effects
you can get in general come in here and
delete all that let's do something a
little bit more interesting let's say
that you would want to have a star
pattern or pretty much anything and you
wanted it to sort of spiral from being
very very small to being quite large
this might crash my computer but I'm
going to give it a go anyway come over
here to the Spiro tool and let's create
it I want to get rid of the fill so
there that one way give it a stroke just
to see exactly what it looks like and I
want to keep this guy quite simple then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to get
a star there's the star I'm going to
draw a star in here pretty small change
the selection tool and there that is now
basically what I'm going to want to do
here is I want to take this star that is
way inside of there if you can't see it
and have it spiral outwards and at the
same time scale and then at the same
time also change color sounds really
really complicated but it isn't with
this tool but you have to follow a
couple rules the spiral that you have
inside of here is going to have no fill
of course so come in here make sure
that's set for no fill and it's also
going to have no paint stroke so go into
stroke paint and X that out so the
stroke is there but you can't see it
then what we're going to do is we're
going to select the star and we have to
make sure that it also has our fill set
to unset so this guy right here because
we want this to be the thing that
changes colors as additional stars are
being drawn on the screen so if that's
going to be a thing that is going to be
changing we're going to have that be
there and you can see it's black it's
not really black but that's what
looks like on a screen and will leave
pretty much everything else exactly the
same we want to of course come in here
because we want these to be working
together select them all control G they
are both grouped and we're going to go
edit and clone and create table clones
there we go we're going to have this be
set to p1 very simple translation and in
this situation we're going to have two
rows and 20 columns I've done this ahead
of time of course because I want the
rotation to go around the same center
point I'm going to go into shift for a
column and set this to negative 100
shift Y negative 100 I want to scale
these as the Stars are being drawn on
the screen as well as being spiraled so
for column I'm going to change this to
30 and then I'm also going to do the
same thing for Y go into rotation going
to change the rotation for the rows to
30 and 1 change the rotation for the
columns to 60 and of course you can
rotate anything you don't have to just
use stars and then if I also want to
change my color let's just let this be
green don't really care no actually
let's come in here and let's make it a
little bit different color move that
down there let's move this up here and
now it's sort of a red type of color
looks a little bit nicer now let's also
coming here and change that okay so now
it's a red so it looks a little bit more
interesting and then I'm going to be
changing the hue I'm not going to be
paying attention anything else so let's
just come in here hit reset and then
change the hue for this guy 10% and 10%
and zoom out see what happens and there
you can see the star pattern starts off
small and as it is being spiraled around
it gets bigger and bigger and bigger
then the final thing we have here and
I'm going to do this really quickly is
trace because trace is really really
strange so basically what trace does is
it sets the tiles color the size the
opacity etc based off of the image that
is under it so let's come in here and
delete all those and I actually have a
rainbow gradient that I created earlier
okay so here's the rainbow gradient I'm
going to do this really quickly come in
here this is the guy we're going to be
changing this is the rectangle that's
going to be drawn across this image and
it's going to be affected by the changes
in colors and so forth of the image that
is underneath so clone Craig
taub clones there we go come into trace
I'll go over this here real quick of
course you're going to have to go trace
the drawing under the tiles then what
you're going to do in this first part
here let me zoom in a little bit in pic
from drawing what you're going to do
here is you're going to specify the
property of the image that is underneath
of the object you have selected that
will affect the tiles so it's either
going to be the color red green blue hue
saturation lightness or the opacity down
here you're going to be able to edit the
gamma and you're going to use that to
try to correct color distortions that
might occur and then of course you can
randomize just like always and then
finally what you're going to do down
here is define how the input will affect
the tiles that are going to be drawn and
presence if you've never heard of that
before it's an Inkscape specific sort of
thing presence is the probability that a
tile will not display at all so let's
just do something really simple let's
just have color set and there there you
go and let's set this to 20 as well and
let's hit create and there you can see
all the tiles that were generated we're
all based off of the color and you can
change this to opacity hit create and
you're going to get all sorts of
different results I personally don't
really use the trace tool but hey it's
gives you a new thing that you can
explore artistically so you might find
it very very useful so that is an
overview of clones inside of Inkscape as
well as clone tiling go in experiment
with it and have a lot of fun please
leave any questions or comments below
