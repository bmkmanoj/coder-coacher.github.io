see video tutorial today we're going to
talk about relational operators logical
operators if else else if conditional
operators bits bytes looping and a whole
bunch of other things if you missed part
1 of the C video tutorial I provide a
link to it in the upper right hand
corner and all of the code used here
along with a ton of comments that would
be easy to translate is available in the
description so I have a lot to do so
let's get into it
ok I'm using the same setup I used in
the first part I just have a basic text
editor text Wrangler if you're on a Mac
or a notepad plus plus if you're on a PC
or whatever other text editor and then
over here on the right side of the
screen I have a terminal or command line
if you are using Windows so I'm just
going to start here and we are going to
need the standard i/o library just like
before so we can use printf and a whole
bunch of other different things and then
I'm going to define main of course
because that's where all the action
occurs now I'm holding a whole bunch of
different things back here and I'm going
to explain them as time goes on like for
example I in the last part of the
tutorial talked about the size of
different data types this time I'm going
to actually show exactly how to find the
size of data types that was actually
brought up in the comments another thing
I want to bring up is if you want to
compile one of your programs and the
program name dot C is set up like that
and you want to actually define what the
executables name would be instead of
using a out you would just put a dash
and then o and then program name exactly
like that then what you'd be able to do
from that point on is execute using dot
forward slash program name instead of
dot forward slash a dot out just
something to think about and in this
tutorial we're going to be using this
right here and I actually have the 2011
version of the C compiler in this and
I'm actually going to do a couple other
different things compile wise so that we
will be able to take advantage of the
changes that have occurred in C instead
of using the old version now the very
first thing I want to talk about is how
we can
compare different variables so let's
just say we have variable 1 and variable
2 well we can use things called
relational operators to compare these
guys and of course we have greater than
we have less than we have equals 2 and
then we have greater than or equal to
and we also have less than or equal to
and then finally we have not equal to
and throughout this tutorial I'm going
to show you a bunch of different ways to
work with these and with these
relational operators anytime you perform
this type of operation you're either
going to get 1 if the evaluation is true
or 0 if it is false and those are
actually saved as int for now later on
I'll get into Bo Lian's there actually
is a boolean data type but we have to
bring in a library for that and the very
first thing we're going to do is put a
little bit of a space inside of here and
we're going to start defining some
variables that we'll be able to use so
I'm numb 2 is equal to 2 and then we are
going to explore a relational operator
right here so if we just go print F and
say is 1 greater than 2 in here and do
this
throw in some new lines and then we can
go num1 and do the rational operator or
the condition right here then remember
we're going to want to compile this in
our new way so i'm going to go see
tutorial to dot c right like that
c torial to dot c dash and then an oh
not a 0 no lower case o and then let's
say I want to call it C tutorial toe and
I'm just going to cut this out of here
bounce over to the terminal paste it in
there there we go and then to execute
this guy now I'm just going to go see
tutorial 2 and there that is and there
you can see they did evaluates to 0 just
like I said before of course we're going
to get into more complicated things than
that and the very first thing I'm going
to do is talk about the if statement now
if is going to be used anytime you want
to compare values or perform different
actions depending home on different
comparisons that you want to make so
let's say I want to check here if number
1 is greater than number 2 and if it is
I want to put that out on the screen
exactly like that
however what would we do if it isn't
because of course number one could be
less than number two but it also could
be equal to it well you're going to be
able to check multiple different
conditions using else if in this
situation so we're going to say else if
number one is less than number two and
then we're going to be able to perform
or print out a different answer to our
screen like that however there's only
one other opportunity or thing that it's
going to be available to us and that is
going to be that they are equal to each
other and just to keep this simple and
all here on the same page when actually
is to scroll up and then finally we're
going to have equals to or equal to once
over here and execute and you can see
that one is less than two is what
actually was printed out on the screen
now it's very important to remember if
there was a situation in which two of
these conditions were actually true only
the very first condition that is true
and the code that says follows it would
actually be used so for example if
number one is equal to number two like
this well in this situation let's say
that we came here and we said number one
is greater than or equal to well then we
are never going to get down to this
point once a condition is true the code
that is between the curly brackets is
going to be executed and then every
other if statement that follows is going
to be ignored so that's very important
to remember and we'll just get rid of
that and that brings us to logical
operators now a logical operator is used
anytime you want to combine multiple
relational operators and there's a
couple of them and we're actually just
going to get rid of this you're going to
have and/or which is going to be those
two pipes that are on the far right
corner of your keyboard and then finally
you're going to have not and then or are
quite simple not pretty much what it's
going to do remember we're going to in
any situation where we're performing a
relational operator or we're checking a
condition we're either going to get a 0
or a 1 well if you put naught and then Z
rrrow that is going to return a 1 and if
you have a situation in which you have
not and then one that is going to give
you a value of zero so not pretty much
just takes whatever the result is and
turns it into the opposite so let's say
we have customer age is equal to 38 and
let's say that we have a swanky club and
we want to check that everybody that
goes to our club is either over the age
of 21 and we want to check that the
customer age is less than 35 and if that
age is indeed true we're going to say
that those people are going to be
welcome in our club and yes indeed you
can ignore the curly brackets if you're
going to just put one line or just have
one line of code that would be printed
in that situation you can also go else
and again on one line without curly
brackets put in that condition and the
only way this is going to be evaluated
to true is if customer age is greater
than 21 and customer age is less than 35
as you see right here they are not
welcome prints out on the screen and to
give you an example of how not works
let's go not turns a true into false or
vice versa and you're going to see if
you put not and one and execute it of
course zero shows up so just an example
of how not works let's look at a whole
bunch of other examples let's say for
example we want to check if an employee
named Bob deserves a raise now the
conditions we're going to set here let's
actually just show those conditions so
we can look at how the if works inside
of C Bob is going to qualify for a raise
if he missed less than 10 days work and
has over 30,000 in sales or signed up
more than 30 new customers and let's
just put this on an excellent so there
we go
this condition has to be met because it
is an and and one or the other of these
conditions need to mean in that
to be true so how are we going to
evaluate that well first we need to get
some information about Bob Bob mist this
is going to be equal to eight
Bob total sales is going to be equal to
24,000 remember don't put a comma in
there and Bob new customers is going to
be equal to 32 well you can see
immediately that Bob's going to get a
raise but we need to check this and how
we're going to check it is we're gonna
say if Bob missed days is less than 10
and see just exactly how we would say it
and Bob total sales is greater than
30,000 for Bob new customers is greater
than 30 that is going to be the
situation in which bob is going to get
himself a raise and there we got we got
it all on the screen here at once then
what we're gonna say if that's true for
now Bob it's a raise else Bob doesn't
bounce over here execute Bob gets a
raise so there you go another example
another thing it's kind of cool we come
in here get rid of all this because I
want to talk about a shortcut way of
performing a comparison in which you
know that you're either going to get one
result or another result so I'm going to
say customer age is equal to 38 then
what we're going to do and ignore this
store for now I'm going to get into this
as the tutorial continues what we're
going to do here is create legal age and
we're going to say customer age we're
going to put a conditional this is
called the conditional operator and why
it works as you say this is going to be
my condition and if that condition is
true in this situation I'm going to
return true and store it in this
character array called legal age if this
condition here customer age is actually
less than 21 instead of greater than
we're going to return false and this is
the conditional operator it's very very
useful and what we can do go like that
and remember this is a character array
so this is going to be considered a
string once again don't worry about it I
can't cover everything in one tutorial
and we file save that and execute
there you can say is the customer of
legal age true see pops back so that's a
an example of the conditional operator
it's quite useful actually another thing
we can do with it let's say we define
number of products and let's say we make
that equal to ten I can come in here and
do a printf and a really neat way using
a judicial operator and say something
like I bought throw in a string products
like that and then put a conditional
operator that says num of products if
it's greater than one what we're gonna
return as a string is going to be many
otherwise we're going to return one and
as you can see I bought many products
gets thrown in there so that's kind of
useful and we're gonna get more into
different things that we're going to be
able to do here it's whole never-ending
supply different things are gonna be
able to do is see now I'd like to talk
about some things that I actually play
in the last tutorial but one of you guys
actually commented on it and that is
specifically how much space do tatah
types actually take up how big can an
integer really be or a character really
be well there's actually a way to find
that out in the past what I was
referring to was the past the minimum
size for an integer and not the maximum
or necessarily your size or your maximum
size for an integer depending upon your
computer there's actually a way to
figure that out so we're going to do and
do this we're going to say a character
takes up fights and I'm going to get in
here to it in a couple seconds exactly
what about is and what a bit is to find
out you can actually throw a variable
name inside of here but you can also
just throw character inside of here and
that's what we're going to do just to
keep everything nice and simple and
we're going to find out just how big all
of these different guys can actually be
so we're going to say a character takes
up an INT takes up and then we're going
to throw an ins inside of here a long
int takes up and then we're going to
type in long int then we're going to
type in float and then we're going to
type in double and float and double I'll
say if bounce over here and there you
can see a character is going to take up
one byte an integer is going to take up
four bytes alongs going to take up eight
bytes a float is going to take up four
it's a double is going to take up eight
bytes but what exactly is a bit and what
exactly is a byte well a bit is actually
short for binary digit and a bit can
either be a one or a zero that's it a
byte is generally considered to be eight
bits and I have a little handy
presentation and I'm going to show you
exactly what I'm talking about so let's
say we have one byte or eight one two
three four five six seven eight bits
well if that byte only has zeros in it
that is going to be equal to the number
zero however if it has a 1 in this
placeholder that's going to be equal to
1 a 1 here and a 0 here is going to
equal a 2 two 1s is going to equal a 3
and then a 1 0 0 is going to be equal to
4 as a decimal versus a binary number so
what exactly does that mean
well let's just look at it as a smaller
number of bits being 3 well everything
is structured as a binary number in that
this can either produce a 0 or a 1 and
then the possible numbers that it's
going to produce from that point forward
are actually going to double as we
increase the number of bits
I'll stick with me here this is going to
totally make sense so for example if we
have a binary number which is 1 0 0 we
have to take this situation in which we
have a 1 count over knowing that this
represents a maximum value of 1 2 &amp;amp; 4
and that tells us that the binary number
of 1 0 0 is actually using our normal
way of counting representative of the
number 4 let's look at another example
in this situation as you can see
everything doubles 1 to 2 2 to 4 4 to 8
8 to 16 16 to 32 so how exactly are we
going to calculate this number
very easy we're just going to take 32 16
8 4 2 &amp;amp; 1 add them all together and get
63 that is how we translate binary
numbers into our regular old way
accountant so in reference to exactly
how characters
work why exactly is a character eight
bits or one byte inside of memory in our
computer well here we have all zeros and
we have a byte or eight bits like I said
before these numbers are going to
continue to double for these eight bits
and what that's going to allow us to do
if we add up all of these is represent
up to 256 possible characters if we
include zero this actually adds up to
255 but that's not counting zero of
course as a possible number so what
exactly does that mean to us for
integers well I didn't list them all out
here there's actually going to be twice
as many different bits available for all
of the possible integers that can be
stored but then if you add up all 32
boxes that can hold a large integer that
would mean that we would have the
capability of holding four billion 294
million nine hundred sixty seven
thousand 295 but that doesn't take into
effect the fact that we're going to be
able to store both positive and negative
integers and if we take a look at that
that shows us that actually on this
computer and more than likely on your
computer you're going to have a maximum
value that you can store inside of an
integer of 2 billion 147 million bla bla
bla bla bla and a minimum of negative 2
billion bla bla bla bla bla so let's
take a look at that in the code so here
we are back again and this time what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say int big
int just going to call it that and I'm
going to go to 1 4 7 4 8 3 6 4 8 now we
can do something like printf I'm bigger
then you may have heard like that and
there you can see I'm bigger than you
may have heard however look at this
negative 2 billion why is that well you
may not remember because why would you
remember actually the maximum value you
have for an integer ends with 7 and not
8 and that just gives you an example
what happens if you try to input
a number that's bigger than the integer
can hold starts going backwards into
negative numbers however if we change
this to seven I'll save and execute now
you can see the maximum number that our
integer can actually hold that's kind of
cool I thought I'd get into that a
little bit and yes sometimes in these
tutorials I actually put information in
that isn't necessarily always true just
so that I can make things interesting
later on and there we go now let's say
we wanted to actually automate this
whole process of calculating the maximum
value based off of the number of bits
that we have number how big is equal to
zero then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say printf how many bits then
I'm going to do is scanf and ask that
person exactly how big is the number of
bits and then we're going to think here
for a second about exactly how we are
going to write this code well we know
that if they have zero bits well then
the answer is going to be print what is
given same thing is going to be true if
they have one that's also going to be
print what is given however what happens
if they type in two they have two bits
and you want to return the biggest
number that they can possibly create
well that's going to be created by going
1 plus 2 and that is going to give you 3
or in the binary world that's going to
be equal to 1 1 then if we go 3 3 bits
how big of a number can we make well
that's actually going to be 3 and that 3
comes from here the result of that then
to that what are we going to be adding
well remember this starts off at 1 then
it doubles the 2 then it becomes 4 and
that is going to give us a maximum value
of 7 or in the binary world 1 1 1 and
then if they would type in 4 that is
going to what are we going to do we take
this 7 from right down there
in there da-da-da-da-dah four becomes an
eight and that gives us a maximum value
of fifteen or in the binary world one
one one one and I think we have enough
information we can start putting
together our little algorithm here to
solve this so what are we going to do
well we basically have three guys at
play here we're going to have our final
results we're going to have this guy
which is going to be whatever this
previously was so one goes the 1 3 goes
to 3 7 goes to 7 and we're also going to
want a multiplier that starts off at 1
becomes 2 and then goes to 4 and then
goes to 8 so just to keep this nice and
simple let's say we need three different
variables to be able to perform this
calculation and I'm going to send us a
my incrementer and the incrementer is
going to start off with a value of 1
then I'm going to have my multiplier
which is going to be this guy right here
this is going to multiply and that also
is going to start off at a value of 1
and then I'm going to have final value
which is going to represent this these
numbers right here so that I'll be able
to spit that out on the screen whenever
I get to the point where it is finalized
and all of those are going to start off
with a value of 1 to start them off so
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to say while my incrementer is less than
my largest number that they can possibly
enter in here well I want to perform
some calculations my multiplier
immediately is going to start off and it
is going to multiply whatever times
itself which is going to have a value of
1 the first time and then go to 2 which
is right here and actually to keep this
simple after this what I'm going to do
cause of course if this is equal to 1
and this starts off as 1 nothing inside
the while loop is ever going to execute
and I'm kind of playing a little playing
around here a little bit just so that I
can show you more examples of if
statements and while loops and a whole
bunch of other different things so I'm
going to say if number how big is equal
to 0 or number how big is equal to 1
like that I'm going to say printf top
value
based off the number of bits is going to
be whatever they entered so number how
big else what I'm going to do is go in
here like that
and top value is going to be equal to in
this situation whatever the final value
was calculated up here inside of this
while loop which we haven't gotten to
yet so another example of that and if I
didn't mention it which I don't think I
did the while loop what it's going to do
for us here is it is going to continue
to loop and execute this code over and
over and over again while this condition
is true whenever that condition ceases
to be true it is then going to stop
executing so what we're going to do that
is very important with your while loop
is you are going to have an increment
and you're going to want that created
outside of the while loop very very
important and aside from that it's
pretty much logical so all right so
let's continue making this little guy
here we're then going to say final value
is going to be equal to final value plus
whatever my multiplier is which is going
to start off as 2 as we see there that's
basically what I'm doing the final value
3 is going to be equal to whatever the
previous final value was which was 1
plus the multiplier which is to say
that's what I am creating right here and
then what I need to do is just go my
incrementer and increment it and that is
going to be the way the wiles are
normally created it's going to have the
incrementer defined outside and then of
course the incrementer is going to have
to change in some way so that at some
point in time this condition no longer
is true and the while loop then ends and
I'll show you another example the while
loop here in a moment and you can see
here how many bits and if we say 3 for
example top value is going to be equal
to 7 and how many bits did we say an
integer can actually hold well 32
however remember we had that problem
where some are positive and some are
negative so what we're actually going to
have to do in that situation is go 31
and
approximation of the biggest number that
an integer could possibly have otherwise
if we come in here and run this and type
in 32 what are we going to get negative
1 why because it jumped back the
beginning of the negative numbers and
integers so don't worry about that just
more information just playing around is
that's what I like to do when I'm
writing code I like to play around as
much as possible to keep things
interesting
now let's do another thing with our
while loop so I can give you an example
of how to use a break statement so let's
say we want the user to come in here and
we want them to keep guessing what our
secret number is between 0 and 10 until
they get it how would we do that
well we're gonna have a number guessed
is equal to 0 and then what we're going
to do is create an infinite loop like
that this isn't the only time you would
use a break statement this is just one
time in which you would use a break
statement which is basically whenever
you want to avoid a potential for an
infinite loop or you want to
automatically always store yourself out
of a while loop if a certain thing ever
happens you're almost always going to
use a break statement with an if
statement so as you're going to see here
so I'm going to say guess my secret
number like this number guest then what
we're going to say is if number yes is
equal to the secret number this guy up
here well in that situation what we're
going to want to do is print F you got
it but then we don't want to ask them to
enter another one because they guessed
it so what's something we can do if we
want to break out of the while loop and
jump down here to this point down here
after the while loop is over we type in
break and break we'll end the loop and
you can see if we run it here we are if
I type in 4 it asked me again 6 ask me
again 2 it asked me again and then the
magical 10 and it ends and it types out
you got it right like that that's kind
of cool and that's another example of
while loop another thing that is very
useful in programming no matter what
anybody says to you is a do-while loop
now you're going to use a do-while loop
when ever you need something done at the
very minimum one time but you know
know how many times you're going to need
to loop thereafter and that is also the
difference between they'll do while on
the wild loop and the for loop what
you're going to see here in a second so
you might ask yourself well when would I
ever need to do something once every
single time let's say we want to ask for
the size of a shirt that somebody wants
to buy this is a good example of that
well the while loop is going to come
down here after the do and this is when
the condition is checked the very first
time we're going to say size of shirt
not equal to letter s and we're going to
do this a couple other different times
this is going to be the condition that
has to be met size of shirt M which for
medium and size for shirt is L then
after that to finish off the while loop
we're going to put a parenthesis and a
semicolon make sure you don't forget
that well what this allows us to do then
is we know we're going to have to ask
for the size of the shirt once
so we'll say what size of shirt and then
after that we're going to say that our
option is s small medium large those are
the only options available and if they
don't enter that oh the while loops
going to ask them again until they get
it right and let's make sure that we put
size of shirt and not size of of course
I'll say if so they ask what size of
shirt let's say you type in K doesn't
work let's say you type in M doesn't
work lowercase M anyway and you type in
uppercase M and then it works so there's
an example of how do while loop can be
very very useful and that brings us to
the for loop now you're going to want to
use a for loop when you know up front
exactly how many times you need to loop
through something and the basic format
of a for loop is you're going to type in
four and you are going to define an
incrementer and I'm actually going to
use the c99 version of the for loop in
this tutorial and then you're going to
define a condition and another semicolon
and then you are going to increment your
incrementer and then put a whole bunch
of things between curly brackets and
that's how four is defined so let's say
you wanted to define something that is
going to count to 20 are you going to do
that with for-loop well I'm going to go
int I'm going to say counter now you're
not going to be able to do this in
anything other than C 99 or above as you
can see and we're going to have to
change our little way of compiling over
here to take advantage of that otherwise
you'd have to actually initialize this
outside of the for loop but I prefer to
do it this way just to understand those
differences okay so we got our counter
and we're going to say as long as our
counter is less than or equal to 20 what
we want to do is we want to continue
incrementing our counter like that there
we go tab and then we're going to print
out our counter like that now remember I
said we have to compile this and a
different way what we're going to do
this time is go GCC then we're going to
type in STD not the bad type c99 c2
toriel - dot C - lowercase o and then
we're going to put our C tutorial 2
inside of there as well just like we did
previously cut that paste it over here
and you see whoops
what's it's a warning return type
defaults to int what they're referring
to is main inside of the 99 version of C
main must have a return type unless you
type in void void means that there is no
return type so you don't need to worry
about that but by default in c99 you
need to return an integer unless you say
hey I don't have anything to return
don't push me around there you go you
can type in void and that's what that
does for you so now if we save it again
come in here bounce it in like that
execute it you can see that it counts
out 0 the whole way to 20 that's an
example of our for loop and that's going
to give me the opportunity to show you
how continue works let's say you decide
you only want to print odd numbers well
how can you do that well there's this
nice little thing called continue and
I'm actually going to chuck this up to
40 what continue is going to allow you
to do is skip the current iteration of
the loop and instead continue with the
lube cycle which is going to increment
counter in this situation and how we're
going to be able to use it again if is
very often used with an if statement
we're going to say if our counter
modulus two which means whenever it's
divided by 2 it's going to return to me
a zero for the remainder well that means
that it's even if we type that in there
and what we want to do is continue and
what continue means again is to skip
this and jump up here and increment the
counter again if we save that bones over
here and execute it you're going to say
that it only prints out odd numbers so
there is a whole bunch of different
things you can do with the C programming
language please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
