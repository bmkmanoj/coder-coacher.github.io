7 of my C video tutorial today I'm going
to do a lot of messing around with
strings characters boolean functions and
pointers and answering a lot of the
questions I received as well as covering
a lot of information I've never covered
before that I wish I would have covered
but I left out for good reason if you
haven't seen any of the other tutorials
you definitely should watch them there's
a link in the upper right hand corner to
them and of course like always all the
code is available in the description and
it's heavily commented to aid in
translation I'm actually transcribing
what I'm saying in this video so if you
have any trouble with English you should
definitely check those out I have a lot
to do so let's get into it okay so I'm
going old-school again basic text editor
and terminal just like previously and
this time I'm going to explore a couple
different libraries so I'm gonna play
around a little bit with boolean so I'm
gonna bring in this boolean library like
I said I'm gonna be doing some things
with strings so I'm gonna bring in the
string library as well and I'm also
going to be playing around with
characters so I'm going to bring in this
character library as well for that now
let's just jump right into main now I
previously haven't talked about boolean
variables inside of C but you can most
definitely use them and if you have this
library up here you can definitely use
one of these guys but this is going to
come standard down and it's going to
allow me to do things like check if a
number was entered in by the user
there's gonna be a lot of user input
playing around with as well in this
tutorial so basically this is a boolean
variable and it's going to represent
true with one and it's going to
represent false with a is 0 and that is
how it operates however if you bring in
this library up here you could also
change this to that if you should
weren't so inclined but I'm actually
just going to leave this the way it is
there and you could definitely go in
there and play with this if you'd like
basically what I'm going to do is I'm
going to allow the user to enter in a
bunch of numbers and I'm going to sum
them and it's going to be up to them how
many they want to enter so we got some
of numbers and what I'm gonna do
is ask them to start entering a number
so enter a number like that and like
that
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to check if they followed my advice and
entered a number or not and let's show a
couple different ways of doing this
actually i mean--you scanf here and the
reason I'm using scanf is what this is
going to do what scanf returns is a 1 if
they entered a 0 through a 9 and it's
also going to allow them to put a minus
symbol if it's a negative number so I
can throw that into a while loop but I'm
actually gonna do it outside of the
while loop just to focus in on this so
I'm going to say right there whenever
they enter a number is it an actual
number and if it is well then I'm going
to continue to cycle through and ask for
additional numbers as long as is a
number is indeed true let's just move it
up here bit then what I can do is go sum
of numbers is equal to sum of numbers
plus the new number they just entered in
this guy right there make sure all these
match up and they seem to and then if
they enter a number in the way I asked
them to I'm just gonna do this whole
song and dance again and then once they
enter something in that is not a number
I'm going to jump out of my wild loop
and I'm gonna go printf and say the sum
is and print out the sum on the screen
sum of numbers that's one way to a new
way to take input from the user you can
see and our number and go 1 2 3 4 5 6
and then F and it gives me my son so
that's one way to work within put inside
of C and let's get rid of that and next
up I'm gonna demonstrate get character
and put character alright something that
I disregarded was a whole bunch of
different ways to accept input from
users so I'm going to remedy that right
now and I'm also going to talk about
buffering so let's say that I wanted the
user to enter in a whole bunch of
characters well one way to do that is to
use get character and I'm going to allow
them to keep entering them as long as
they don't enter in a tilde
so they're just going to keep asking the
user for additional information until
total is reached then what I'm going to
do is I'm going to individually put each
of the characters on the screen using
put character and there's no lunar line
at the end of that now basically what's
going on here might not be working a way
that you think it is and actually what
I'm going to do is execute it just to
show you okay
so didn't ask for anything I'm just
going to start typing in some stuff so
let's just go turtle and hit enter and
turtle showed up on the screen now you
may have thought to yourself well since
get character is going to accept one
character and continue asking and
printing them on the screen until tilde
is entered you may have actually thought
that as I touched each one of these
letters that you would in essence see
that well it is possible to find a C
compiler that works that way but that's
not the way this guy works basically
what's going on here is you're getting
an example of what is called line
buffering and what line buffering does
is it stores data in a buffer until a
new line is entered some compilers don't
work that way some compilers actually
just spit all the information out on the
screen as it's being entered or they
would in this situation but since we're
using a buffer get characters actually
going to wait until the enter button is
pressed and then going to push all the
individual characters on the screen
using put character that's how it works
and basically with a buffer the data is
going to be stored as it is entered and
in essence a buffer is a temporary
storage area in memory or that's that's
not in essence that's what it is
basically the size of the buffer is
going to depend upon your specific
compiler your specific system and I'm
not going to get into that in essence
what it is it's just a pointer to a
place inside of memory without a
specified size and like I said before
this is just another example of a line
buffering so that's one way to accept
data until this condition is met right
here and do whatever you want to do with
that data and also an example of how to
use get character and put character now
I'm going to demonstrate gets puts F
gets and F puts so to do that what I'm
going to do is create a character array
or a string and I'm going to say to the
user or what is your name for example
and I'm going to use the gets function
this time to actually get name and what
the gets function is going to do for us
is receive a string from the keyboard
until a new line is entered just like
before but what's really cool about it
is it is then going to replace the new
line with the null character now
whenever you're using gets and actually
you're going to see it in the compiler
here in a second whenever you're using
gets just make sure that you do not go
over actually I'm going to chuck this up
250 don't go over the 50 character limit
because gets does not check if you've
reached the end of your available
storage inside of the string we defined
right here so that's very important then
we can use puts if we should be so
inclined I technically I don't know when
the last time I use puts but what the
heck here it is what puts does is it's
going to receive a string and then it's
going to print it out followed by the
newline because remember I said gets
takes the newline off puts every single
time it's called it's going to issue a
newline and on top of that it's only
going to print out one string so we
could do something like this if we
wanted to with gets and puts there we go
say you can see actually warning this
program users gets all very unsafe I'm
just going to type in my name and it's
going to go hi Derek and there you can
see the newline
it shot it down to the screen so that's
how it gets and puts works gets this
kind of useful puts in my opinion not so
much so let's get rid of those guys and
that brings us to the guy we saw before
F gets now with F gets as we've seen
previously it's going to accept the
string you want to print too it's also
going to ask for the maximum size and
it's also going to say hey where's this
coming from standard in which is the
keyboard and it's basically just going
to keep reading information into the
array till a new line or until
has been full and on top of that it does
put a new line at the end of said array
F puts which was designed to work with F
gets unlike puts is going to allow us to
enter multiple different strings inside
of here and what we're going to do to
get set data is say hi and then we're
going to go standard out meaning that
we're going to be printing that out to
screen and we go like this we go like
that and then if we want to put our name
inside of there we can do it that way
compile and yes I can put in multiple
different spaces if I want and you can
see hi Derrick baños remember F puts
unlike puts does not attach a newline so
that's the reason why we can put this
information out here and this isn't on
different lines and that brings me to
some can may be confusing ways to print
screens that are kind of confusing
people out there so I'm going to do is
I'm going to create myself a string here
random string is equal to just some
random stuff and if you don't remember
from before whenever we create a string
like this in essence what random string
is doing is creating a string array or a
pointer to the first element in our
array to be more specific now what we
can do is we can say while and put a
star inside here and go random string
this is something that people have been
sending me questions about what does
this mean because they see it in code
and it's a little bit weird it's one of
those see things you see what this is
going to do the while with random string
inside of it is we are going to
increment through all the different
characters inside of a random string and
we're going to actually spit them out on
the screen at some point we obviously
are going to get to a null character and
whenever random string gets a value of
null that's going to translate to zero
and that's going to end our while loop
that's what's going on there and we can
print out our characters inside of this
array just by going start a random
string and then increment after the
character has been printed out this guy
right here has caused a lot of confusion
out there so that's basically what's
going on and if we bounce over
I'll execute you can say just random
stuff print it out here on the screen
you also see that there's no new line
and that's because put character doesn't
have a new line and just to show you you
can do pretty much exactly the same
thing the long way which might be
something that makes more sense is well
I don't need to define that again what
I'm going to do is let's say I wanted to
cycle through this in a more natural but
not optimized way we would cycle through
it still using while we could go random
string I not equal to null and then we
could use put character but slightly
different
put character get this out of here and
then put a bracket in there and treat it
more like an array if you should be so
inclined and if we get rid of this guy
right here
delete compile execute you can see just
some random stuff pops in there there
you go two different ways a shorthand
way of printing information out on the
screen and the long way of doing it now
I'm going to come in here and actually
solve a whole bunch of random different
problems so let's say you create a
character and this is going to get into
the issue that comes up whenever we are
trying to quit out of a program whenever
some word is typed you would think that
would be very easy but it can be a
little bit confusing with safe so what
we're going to do is we're going to say
enter quit to quit now what we're going
to do is we're going to use F gets for
this and we're going to say do you want
to quit and we go to ten and we're going
to go standard in right like that and
remember like I said before F gets is
going to add a new line at the end so
we're going to need to get rid of that
and one way we can do that and we're
going to create an outside function to
get rid of that newline and I'm going to
call it no more new line and it's going
to send in do you want to quit it's
going to fix it and we can just create
this function right up here I'm going to
go void no more new line and to accept
that string we need a character star the
string right like that then inside of
this character star is a new line then
what we're going to do is we're going to
use this function and what it's going to
do for us is return the last occurrence
of whatever we're look
for what we're looking for is the new
line but first one we need to do here is
go is a new line and then make it equal
to STR CHR and if you wanted to find the
first occurrence you would use a
different method STR CHR so one less R
this would find the first occurrence
this would find the last occurrence we
want the last occurrence and inside of
that we're going to pass our string that
we have up here and we're going to
specifically look for a new line of
course you could look for other things
as well and change them and it's pretty
much exactly the same way I'm going to
show you how to change them here then
I'm going to say if is a new line
because this function is going to return
either a true or false well I'm going to
say if I want to change the character
that is currently in there I can go is a
new line and change it to the null value
and that is going to remove new lines
for me we could test it out figure that
out here first
no more new line and to test that the
new line has been deleted and here and
then we could just throw do you want to
quit inside of there and I doesn't
matter what I type in here I'm gonna
type in quit and you can see that quit
print it out there without a new line so
we know that our function no more new
line works that's pretty cool well now
let's get back into what we wanted to
actually do here which is basically
continuous to accept input of some type
until quit is entered
well what's something else that could
cause a problem well what if they type
in qit yeah okay that's going to cause
some problems so one thing we might want
to do is to take the input and actually
convert it to lowercase how exactly can
we do that well I'm going to create
another function I'm just going to call
it make lower case and we're going to
pass do you want to quit again and then
we can come up here again another
function make lower case I'm going to
make it void doesn't do anything and
here again we're going to be accepting
this string so I'm going to go care
to star the string and here I'm going to
go in I is equal to zero show you a
bunch of different ways to manipulate
that inside of these arrays and here I'm
going to say while the string I and you
know it's going to continue to cycle
until it hits that null character and
then it's going to stop so there's
another way of testing that then if I
want to change the individual characters
and I'm doing this in a different way
just to show you a different way we want
to change it to lowercase I can go to
lower and then type in the string I like
that and convert that character to its
lowercase variation and then we can
increment I outside of that and if we
come down here get rid of the sky right
here put that in there file and execute
enter quit the quit now I'm going to put
it in all upper cases and there you can
see it printed out in lower cases so
there it worked again another thing in
another way of doing things and of
course if you want to convert something
to all upper cases all you need to do is
come in here and type upp ER to upper
it's a way to convert to uppercase or to
lower cases if you're using characters
and now let's go in here and actually
allow the user to enter information
until they enter quit so to do that let
me use a while loop and here I'm going
to do a string comparison and I want to
use do you want to quit inside of it and
then I'm going to compare that to quit
now this wouldn't work without the no
more new line or the make lower case you
need both of those for this guy to work
down here throw that in there and then
I'm going to go and copy all of this
information right here right like that
and get rid of this one going and then
let's indent this and after we've done
all that can do something like print out
thank you for typing quit I don't know
first thing it came to mind and the
string if you just wanted to actually
let's go and do this
thank you for typing that
and then go do you one to quit yeah
clear that away compile execute enter
quit to quit
they go no enter quit the quit
I don't want to enter quit - quit well
then you would just come in here and go
quit
thank you for typing quit and there it
goes and then the final thing I'm going
to show you here is how to do a whole
bunch of different things with
characters I'm gonna make this nice and
simple I'm just going to do all this
inside of a function get character
information and just copy this guy
bounce right here Boyd get character
information it's not going to do
anything and then we're just going to
create a character the character I've
already shown you how to cycle through a
whole bunch of different characters and
then go the character is equal to get
character and it's going to do
everything inside of this while loop
until new line is entered which
basically means going to accept one
character and a new line and this stuff
is all coming courtesy of this library
up here so you definitely need that
library then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go printf and check if a letter
or a number was entered and here I'm
just going to print out ones or zeros
for true or false and how you check if
the number was entered as you go is all
numb and pass it the character itself
close that off I'm going to show you a
whole bunch of them and show you pretty
much every one of them we could also
check if an alphabetic character was
entered and that is just going to be is
alpha we could also check if a standard
blank which would be tabs or spaces or
whatever and that is just is blank
if a control you know like C or one of
those things where you hold down the
control key if that was occurring is
control we could check if it's a number
with is digit basically anything but
space is going to be is graph and we
could also check lower case with is
lower guess what
upper case is going to be is upper we
can check if it's anything that is not a
letter number or space or basically is
it punctuation I'm just going to put it
in there
version and check that we're going to go
is punk and then the final thing we'll
check is if it's any type of space at
all so any space and to do that we just
go is space compile execute and if we
enter in a capital letter H you can say
letter our number and all that
information comes out so there is a
tutorial explaining a lot of things I
sort of skipped over just so I can have
this be a more complete tutorial as well
as how to handle input from users and
play around with strings and other
random things please leave your
questions or comments below otherwise
