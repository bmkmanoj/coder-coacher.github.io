of my java video tutorial series today
we're going to talk about interfaces
abstract classes abstract methods and a
whole bunch of other different things
I'm going to really focus on syntax in
this tutorial not going to get into a
roll a Briggs ample because I don't want
to really confuse people out there but
basically Java does not allow you to
inherit from multiple different classes
so that's where interfaces in abstract
classes come in because what do you do
whenever you want to add additional
functionality to a class that already is
inheriting from another class well in
this situation you'd probably use an
interface and to define and interface
just type in public interface and
normally interfaces aren't adjectives
why because most objects are nouns and
if you want to modify a noun you would
use an adjective so this is normally
common practice for people to do
basically an interface is just an empty
class that provides to someone or tell
someone what methods they must implement
if they want to use this interface size
from that is just like any other type of
class now you can put fields inside of
an interface but you have to understand
that they are final which means they're
basically constants that are never going
to change so if there's like for some
reason you wanted to put PI inside here
you could do that however you could
never change the value up then what you
have to do is come in here and define
all the different methods that you want
someone to be fine if they want to use
your interface and this is how you do
that
now you technically could come in here
and type in public abstract and int but
that is what it is by default so there's
no reason to come in here and do any of
that stuff and you basically want to
just define all the other different
things you want in here such as void
maybe set the number of wheels that
someone needs to define inside of a
method and then let's say in this
situation that an integer is expected to
be passed and whenever this interface is
implemented it has to follow all of the
rules that are defined right here and
you just throw get speed inside of here
and then maybe another one that says set
speed you can see here in a second
through an example how you're going to
be able to implement this interface and
that's it that's an interface is nice
and tight and compact not much to it now
we're going to jump over into vehicle
and implement it
now you implement an interface just like
this go to class and then let's say we
want to call this vehicle and
you type in implements driveable which
is the name of the interface that you
created and then what you need to do is
jump back over into your interface and
grab all these methods because you have
to create them in anything that
implements the driveable interface so
just keep everything simple just going
to pop this inside of here
now inside of this class this doesn't
mean you're not going to be able to
define any fields you might want you're
allowed to do that
the only rule that you must obey as you
must define every single thing that is
inside of your interface so you could
put in a double inside of here speed and
set it a zero maybe you wanted to put in
here like a car strength if you were
doing some sort of game or something
doesn't matter then you have to come in
here and actually define these and
another rule is that any method that is
based off an interface must be at least
as visible as the interface itself so
everything that was defined over here in
regards to methods is a public method
that means it's available to anybody so
with this vehicle you must come in here
and also make sure that all of these
guys are also public so there you are
they can't be more restrictive put that
inside of there then we're going to
start defining what these methods are
going to do and I'm going to keep it
really simple here I'm just going to say
return this num of wheels it's going to
return that and then in a situation when
I have a similar thing down here with
get speed except it's going to return
the speed and then we're going to come
in here and where we're going to be
setting the values we're going to say
this dot num of wheels is going to be
equal to whatever naam wheels is equal
to and let's say we want to basically do
the same thing down here for set speed
speed is equal to whatever the value of
speed was whenever it was passed over to
here and just set the stop or case save
that guy and then we're going to create
a constructor for this whole entire
thing here so that we'll be able to
create new vehicles created just like
everything else and type in public
vehicle and let's say we want wheels to
be sent and we want speed to be sent
whenever we create a new vehicle and
then we're just going to go this of
wheels
equal to whatever value is passed in
wheels this are the speed is equal to
whatever speed was whenever it was
passed over all right there we won't be
defined a whole bunch of different
things we create an interface and then
we implemented it inside of the vehicle
class now we're actually going to create
ourselves some vehicles you know I went
ahead and put in Lesson fifteen and
created a main function because I know
you understand that now now let's create
a new vehicle let's call it car and you
just implement everything in exactly the
same way you did before say we want to
give it four wheels maximum speed of 100
and now that we did that
system.out.print line let me say
something like cars max speed and then
we just say car get speed and just keep
this simple we're basically going to do
the same thing down here except we'll
say num of wheels and then here we'll
just say get wheels which is the name of
that and then we'll execute it and I'm
sure you can pretty much to figure out
what it's going to do there you are it
prints out max speed 100 which is what
we defined right here it's out the
number of wheels which is four so
there's a whole bunch of stuff about an
interface now what we're going to do is
we're going to create what's called an
abstract class it's going to be called
crash' below and you would use an
abstract class whenever you want to
create a class in which every method
doesn't necessarily have to be
implemented to use the abstract class
and create an abstract class just come
in here and go public type in abstract
class and we'll call this crash' ball
and then you can define and all cuyps of
variables inside airier this is not
being forced to be a constant so you can
say car drivable is equal to maybe true
by default and that's perfectly fine
that's not a constant that's a value
that can change you could also come in
here and go public void you crash for
example create a method inside of here
that's not abstract and basically this
car drivable is equal to false however
of course you could create abstract
classes inside here and since this isn't
an interface you do need to type in
public abstract void and you could say
something like set car strength and
let's say it gets an integer or strength
and you define it exactly the same way
being this
abstract class abstract and let's say
it's inte get or strength I like that
file save it and there's a way to create
an abstract class now let's go use it
back over into our vehicle and if you
want to implement an abstract class
inside of this guy well you're going to
have to type in extends and it needs to
go before implements otherwise you're
going to get an error code so type in
extends and you're going to say crash of
all right like that and then basically
you're going to need to jump back over
into crash' bulow and we need to
implement these two guys jump back over
into vehicles and I'm just going to put
this after the constructor because it
doesn't matter where it is you want to
make sure you get rid of the abstract
part here that has to go otherwise this
isn't going to work the way you want it
I'm going to be executable anyway and
then this situation leave it will go
like this and then we'll type in this
call our strength is equal to our
strength
let's pass to it and remember we define
color strength up here is zero in this
situation and then down here need to
return this car strength like that I'll
save it then jump back over into lesson
15 play around some more here with that
abstract class we don't really have to
do anything more we can just go to car
go set car strength say we want to give
it a value of 10 that works and then we
could come in here and go
system.out.print line and type it in the
strength car dot get our strength and
call that method and we execute it see
it prints out the max speed number of
wheels and the strength so that is how
you implement interfaces and abstract
classes and abstract methods a whole
bunch of other different things as this
tutorial continues I'm going to show you
or some really solid examples on how to
create some real ones leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
