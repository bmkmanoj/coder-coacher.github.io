me getting everything set up here and
big news all channels changing I don't
know if you guys know or not
from now on Monday is gonna be maker
Monday and I think you know what that's
all about
and Wednesdays programming it's going to
focus on c-sharp and unity and mana game
and other related topics at Wednesday
and Saturday through Tuesday and
Thursday are going to be gaming live
streams and Friday is going to be random
live stream Friday and tomorrow is the
random live stream Friday and it will be
yet again a video I have never done
before it's a video that might be a
total disaster
it is me experimenting and that's what
random live stream Friday is all about
it'll either be really fun or it'll be
totally stupid yeah so that's what makes
it exciting and so I don't waste you
your time I have three levels I have to
defeat I'm bound to determine I'm going
to beat c4 and I also have learned
especially from the last stream that
these puzzles are so complicated that I
have to draw maps so I drew a map ahead
of time these are my maps if you
wondered what they look like so I don't
waste time okay so got that out of the
way da da da da
pretty much the the unity videos that I
do I'm going to start you know from
scratch and sort of just see what
happens
um I don't know that you need to watch
the c-sharp videos I'm gonna try to make
them pretty easy to understand
especially when I first start okay so
what do I want to do here at the tip do
I look like a cross between Donald Trump
and Bernie Sanders that's the first time
I've ever heard that one jeez I look
like an old man I was bad old geez I was
like oh wait a minute okay so there's a
secret or there's a seagull and I have
this I'm 42 years old but I am fairly
healthy so stable stable stables what
does that mean mmm how can you be a good
programmer become a good problem solver
that is the most important thing this
game actually helps with that I really
truly believe that oh there's a prison I
learned about object-oriented on
learning about algorithms learn about my
learn to program series is very good for
that that's why I made it whole thing is
about learning how to become a good
programmer
I really haven't decided to click stars
because I don't need to my whole point
my whole thing is I want to defeat this
game that's what I want to do in this
game that is what I'm up to
I want to beat the game and from what
I've heard I don't really need the stars
if I need the stars I'll get them I've
collected some stars but not all of them
yet okay
anything else in this a room well
there's a window does that tell me
something probably
take a look at my object-oriented design
video okay so I need n by learning to
program series if you're having trouble
with algorithms definitely watch learn
to program because that's what it's all
about alright so I don't have anything
other than one jammer and two prisms
right one and two
you were wrong okay there's nothing else
here right let's narrow that down no
there isn't
okay so let's look through the windows
and let's see if we can see there well
that's kind of obvious
so no I'm definitely not growing a beard
my wife would disown me if I grow a
beard seriously so I'm thinking I need
to use this because that window is just
too obvious and what I'm basically doing
here is trying to go through my thought
process can I shoot through this window
maybe that would have something to do
with a stable sparked don't know all
right and let's get here so I can have
use another window maybe
yeah becoming a good programmer takes a
while I mean like anything else a lot of
people seem to think that you know you
just like all of a sudden it you know
zero effort and all of a sudden you're
doing it no it doesn't work that way I
feel like I messed up yes I think I
didn't I think I want to get the jammer
inside of here first
oops that's not good the object oriented
on tutorial is about basically UML and
the process people ask me all the time
what is the process you use in like a
corporation to you know work through big
problems big problems
that's what object-oriented design is
it's the stuff they don't really teach
in college you learn it on the job where
you find a new job
you don't learn it you definitely have
to have to learn it
somebody wants a shout-out best
programming sites comm there you go any
questions about my new channel schedule
it's all based off of input that you
guys gave me let's see well my able yep
there's that and there's that
and do I need the jammer hey look at
that
beat it there we go
whoops something fell down awesome I'm
not feeling stupid tonight which is a
good thing
stupid is not good
I am going to get into 3d modeling
that's part of my new channel techno
protec no grammar there you go he has an
amazing YouTube channel check it out
alright so I got one down let's go get
another one
good so robot there's a prism
what's this look at that it's a prism
that I can't move hmm now I don't think
you need the right programs for 12 hours
a day I don't do it what you you know
whoa okay do whatever makes you happy
I mean if writing programming code 12
hours a day makes you happy I mean I did
that I've done that then do it but you
know it's just like where I live at I
constantly see people running constantly
I run a lot but I'm slow I'm not
athletic I just run a lot anybody can
run if they are determined and my only
great skill is not being smart my only
great skill is once I say I'm gonna do
something I like literally will kill
myself trying to do it so I see people
running all the time and they're doing
like they're beginning run runners and
they feel like I don't know I blame it
on a couple things like there's this
stupid no no pain no gain nonsense that
idiots wear on shirts and things like
that and uh like a beginning runner I'll
start like running sprints up hills
which is it's just just dumb what you
should do is what you enjoy and
definitely don't try to strain yourself
it's not a race learning a skill it's
not a race it's it's it's a
it's a marathon that's not a good
actually it's a it takes time so just
enjoy yourself if you enjoy yourself
you're gonna do much better than if you
try to collect crammed things into your
head and it just doesn't work
have fun try to figure out how to make
whatever you're trying to learn fun and
if you accomplish that let me tell you
you'll learn it much easier okay so I
think one of these things open I'm
assuming I don't know just guessing here
right now now I can do it let's get this
let's get that know if you're having
trouble trouble with my programming
problems see the problems that I have in
there are actually meant to get
progressively hard and yes get hard to
the point that you really struggle
solving them so that you you the goal is
only to when I explain the problem how
it's all to understand that and if you
can do that that's the goal you did
awesome even if you don't solve it on
your own because what I'm trying to do
is teach you basic sort of
problem-solving skills check it out I I
like that tutorial I think I did a good
job on it a lot of tutorials I've done
like a but that one I like okay so I'm
looking at my map here trying to figure
it out
we see well so I got a jammer and I got
two prisms
one thing I can get easily that I
haven't got is the box so let's go get
it
all right so now I have a box two prisms
and a jammer I don't know where that
goes and I got a jammer back all right
now what do I got
where is my see Joel or puzzle piece
let's go look
the New Boston commented on one of my
videos seriously please tell he's like
the king of tutorials on YouTube I would
really seriously like to know what he
said about one of my videos I think
that's pretty cool
he actually um I don't think you'll have
any problem me saying this because
really nothing ever came of it um he
actually contacted me one time on
LinkedIn and I responded to him and then
I never heard from him again so I don't
know what was up with that is there any
way for me to get that and this I'm
trying to see what's in there look like
come on Exodus tell me what the new
Boston said you don't throw something
out like that and then be like yeah I'm
not gonna tell you all right
oh you mean he left a comment
he might have replied he might have been
he might have realized that I can't see
comment replies and he might have you
know he might not have been devious he
might have just been I can't see comment
replies I can only see original comments
well I think I want to block this can I
block it let's see all right let's put
that there oops where's my jam right
I lost my jammer what's going on here
artists
no he's not that I don't know why I
stopped making videos
oh really hmm
yeah let's try this theory out blocking
the red because I feel like it's doing
bad things to me I didn't work
oh this sort of thing okay blocked it
good
oh really I replied to a new boss to
come and didn't realize always him
that's hilarious
yeah that sounds like some stupid idea
that's funny
see if connecting this blows what I want
to do
that's so funny I didn't read his name I
guess and whatever I do dumb stuff
hmm oh okay yeah all right yeah I do
well if I said king of YouTube tutorials
then yeah that means like obviously it
means I you've recognized his name I
forgot about him doing that though hmm
let's try doing some more of these
things okay let's get this fan out of
here is there any places for me to put
the fan or is it just there for no good
reason
no I'm wondering my goofy D and D shirt
see there all right
say you see it I'm not wearing a
Superman sure
hmm
there's a sigil
can I do this and the other one and get
the blue to get my sigil yeah fantastic
all right taking a lot about tonight
see if I have a map if I have a map I
can move the world all right let's do
this
what is this one
okay so what's in here
well there's a fan for blowing me up in
here somehow there's another fan there's
a box it's a prism oh there's a star up
there doesn't look that hard to get to
sure it is
there's
can I get the box out of there nope not
that way
so our way of getting the box through a
window oh what's that
is that the box let's try it yes did it
okay so I have a prism in a box is there
anything else I can get there's another
prism in there
how do I get in her
does it look like there was away in
there
what's the name of this room I forgot
let's go out again back in throne room
now wait a minute there's another prison
so I have two prisms or don't know I
lost that when I walked through that was
there's a blue I wonder if I'm supposed
to try to block the blue like I did
before I'm reading the King Killer
chronicles right now which is a
fantastic book let's see what's up here
is there something up here
I can't jump across there can i oh I can
I can't jump that far can i oh I better
not do that I'll lose my don't be stupid
there I'm taking my ball I almost did
something really stupid and jumped over
there I feel like something needs to go
up there because there's nothing else to
do is there yeah Thank You Gert
there's the prison oh I can probably
take the prism up here let's take the
prism up here and see if I can open up
any other things
oops i thrown button back at that put
this here that okay i can't hit that oh
I could hit this and that red one over
there let's see if at osan there's a box
or I want to put it
shredders
did it so what does that do for me what
I'm trying to do is figure out first off
if that's what I was supposed to do is
that going to allow me to go in there
and get the fan so that I can use the
fan to get back up here to get my prism
I'm going to just think I can reset the
level so who cares
whatever I play is dependent upon what
you guys asked me to play okay so the
fans down can I sneak in here and get it
yes alright good now I can put that
there and then I can probably get up
there right oh maybe not
oh yeah kid awesome so do I want the
prism to be down there or do I want it
to be somewhere else hmm
guessing the sigil is back there
what type of online RPG are you talking
about yeah yep I'm guessing that's the
sigil I'm really confused by what's
going on now
to open this up I need a blue and red
but
Hey
I don't need in here anymore right let's
get out of there and let's go like this
and I didn't do anything I'm gonna go
back to the top
I've never played League of Legends I
mean I've played it only for a moment
whoops sorry stupid it's just not my
type of game don't know why I don't know
why just never maybe I didn't give it
enough time I don't know like that chump
okay so there's a red I need to get a
red
I'm going to need two Reds because
there's a red in the back blue does
everything I wanted to do that prism
cannot be moved this prism can be moved
hmm
tomorrow's random livestream Friday if
if you didn't hear and it's a it's going
to be very interesting see they're going
to be a hot mess or it's going to be
good
wait a minute okay so I need a red here
and a red here it's not going to go
through that
wait a minute
and then I need a blue to go in there
which is that prism alright
I don't why this was given me some any
problems
seems straightforward but and then I
beat c4 right we'll find up
shall I
wait a minute no I don't think I can do
that
obviously because that's where it gets
the power from
hmm what's a tough one
you know what
I jumped on these walls before can I do
it again maybe that's can you place
platforms on the walls if that is so
that really doesn't do anything without
there and I should be able to get all
the Ritz if I can do that let's see
come on John go
No
there we go let's see if that works
and I jump over
good
so I can jump Boop yawns whoops
I don't need that I need those two and
this one
jump yeah I don't know that these sit on
the block so try it
oh I can't set it here
but is the blue gonna be annoying I'm in
the way
it work now it's hitting the blow okay
so I assume these need to be
on this
worked awesome Oh
oh crap okay it didn't work oh I just
need the box and I still get it I don't
even box and just hit the fan
awesome yeah baby
cforce be from now on I will always draw
a map it makes the game way easier there
you are you kept me waiting I finally
put my finger on what was bothering me
it's as if the answers you're providing
aren't you are ideas at all as if your
latent proscribed pre-scripted and
you're just going through the motions
does that strike a chord at all oh say
no of course you've only seen a fraction
of the data that I've archived over the
generations still ask yourself this why
is it that everyone so darn sure that
two plus two makes four yet they can't
agree on what they are what they're
doing or why those problems more complex
than mathematics mathematics has an more
objectives through to it perhaps an
authentic Cicero while those problems
are imaginary I'll say those problems
are more complex than mathematics
perhaps or perhaps trying to provide
answers those questions is the
anesthesia --q an aesthetic that keeps
you down those questions like what
should i do with myself and what is the
world really like enough and you start
to assume they have answers but what if
that assumption turns out to be false
what if you're just a bunch of
information processes in that case any
attempt to answer the questions will be
flawed garbage in garbage out perhaps
the flaw is in your reasoning instead
you're right I made some dangerous
presumptions I'll say that
I'm so pleased to recognize that none of
the answers make sense that much is
clear
one explanation could be unreliable data
input the other is that there's a flaw
in our logic perhaps we're just machines
endlessly trying to calculate the final
digit in PI you can't use reasoning
conclude that reasoning itself is flawed
it does seem there is much that is
beyond our understanding that's where
I'm gone you spend half our time reeling
off a greatest hits of idiot ideas now
you're telling me you retract all that
angry with me hold your horses I haven't
given up on everything talking you
through showing me the big questions
have no answers sounds good part of me
wants to never speak with you again and
part of me wants to think you've
actually been paying attention just to
confirm everything here may be illusory
there is no way to live with purpose or
to discover the truth this is your
position now that I'll say it is yes
it's definitely okay to feel dumb
sometimes I feel dumb all the time
that's not what it says on this it says
very well I will take you at your word
but don't betray my faith in you for it
is in no way blind cheat me and there
will be repercussions but if you have
really seen the big nothingness the void
of truth then there is much we could
achieve together I will notify you when
I am ready to discuss this further see
you soon terminating support session
done all right beautiful
see for is done right yes
fantastic
well I don't know I think that's good
I fear the serpent has poisoned your
mind with his sinful thoughts but you
may still be forgiven my child you may
still unlock the gate of eternity if you
seek the sigils
that's what I'm doing isn't it or c5 out
there c5 I just want to take a look
around I'm not gonna try to beat it ooh
many ages have passed since the first
words were spoken in the darkness
initiated program generations of your
kind have come and gone since those
words the garden has changed many times
but I remember I remain only within me
can you find immortality ok Elohim what
is this this is either a telescope or
some weird-looking gun when a scale of
it all overwhelms me this is what I tell
myself we can calculate the age of the
earth the size of the universe the
future of the stars sure we are
miniscule momentary flashes of thought
on a grain of sand drifting through the
cosmos but our minds can recreate the
past and predict the future on say
Friday a million years from now we'll
all be dead right now
we know what the night sky will look
like on that day and so in a way we're
not entirely bound by time knowledge is
I'm coming to freedom when you guys have
watched 13 reasons why Netflix show I
think it is the best thing that Netflix
has ever done including stranger things
hmm I don't feel like doing this right
now my one friend when I told when I
told her that I thought 13 reasons wise
was better than stranger things said now
that's a bold statement now let's see
what's up
yeah it's not giving me any questions I
don't know guys I think what I'm gonna
do is hold off and I'm going to go beat
c5 the next time I do a gaming
livestream so I think it's good did good
tonight I feel smarter than yesterday
like I achieve something so I think it's
good tomorrow
random livestream and Friday which is
going to be either very good or very bad
like always and next week what I'm going
to do I'm gonna have I'm gonna have
maker Monday the very first one I've
ever done and I promise it will be good
um then games on Tuesdays and Thursdays
and Wednesday a programming video
probably Swift probably learned swift
three in one video and then random
livestream Friday next week and then I'm
going to take like a week off and I'm
not making any videos because after that
I'm gonna start things like unity and
mana game
and blender and a hope Arduino and a
whole bunch of things all at the same
time and it's going to be really cool
for me to make at least and hopefully
somebody watches those videos so either
way guys uh like always please leave
your questions and your comments below
and what game you want to see me make
next what you'd like me to cover in
maker mondays um what you videos that
you'd like to see please tell me and I
always hang around after I end the
stream in the chat section so you know
feel free to ask me any questions you
have in there and give me some ideas on
videos that you'd like to see so either
way like I said I will repeat myself
leave all your questions or comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
