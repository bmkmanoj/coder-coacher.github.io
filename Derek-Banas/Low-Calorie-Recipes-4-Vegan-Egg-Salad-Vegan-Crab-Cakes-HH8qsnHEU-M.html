four of my low calories recipes tutorial
today I'm going to show you how to make
vegan egg salad vegan crab salad
vegan crab cakes and vegan tuna salad so
I have a lot to do so let's get into it
first I'm gonna make the vegan egg salad
I'm gonna take 12 to 14 ounces of extra
firm tofu put it between two towels and
put some heavy stuff on it then the next
day I'm gonna break it up into whatever
size pieces you want to help it resemble
eggs then in a small blender I'm gonna
mix up my vague or eggs substitute
mixture which is really going to give
this the true taste of eggs and there
you can see all the nutritional
information and ingredients on the vague
to make it you're gonna get 1/4 a cup of
water and then to that you're gonna add
one teaspoon of the egg substitute I'm
actually going to introduce the main
ingredient in the vague later on in this
tutorial it's basically a salt that
tastes exactly like eggs now in a
separate Bowl I'm going to go and get
some vegan mayonnaise which I showed how
to make in previous tutorial and I get
specifically 1/4 of a cup and put that
into the bowl and then to the vegan
mayonnaise I'm going add one tablespoon
of the Vague mixture that you just made
mix all that together until it's very
well combined then add one teaspoon of
Dijon mustard you don't have to use Grey
Poupon anything will work perfectly fine
then add 1/2 of a teaspoon of just
regular old dry mustard and then this is
actually the star of the show Callan
amic I think I'm pronouncing that
correctly either way it is a salt to
taste exactly like eggs so if this
doesn't taste like eggs enough for you
just add more than 1/8 of a teaspoon and
then you'll add 1/4 of a teaspoon to
taste of just any type of black pepper
and then you're going to of course stir
all of this to combine and then after
all the liquid is all stirred together
you're gonna stir that in over your
dried tofu and by the end you're going
to have perfect egg salad and of course
if it doesn't taste edgy enough just add
a little bit more of Callan ammok which
can be found on Amazon and numerous
other websites and now we're going to
make ourselves some hearts of palm
vegan crab salad and this stuff is truly
amazing you just go and get your hearts
of palm and throw it in a blender and
then you're gonna blend it you're gonna
touch the blender 3 times 1 2 3 that's
it and then whenever you're done you're
gonna get something that looks amazingly
like crab and then to your crab
mixture or your hearts of palm you're
gonna get some Old Bay seasoning which
can be found pretty much anywhere and
you're gonna get one teaspoon of old
paste seasoning and sprinkle over it and
then you'll get yourself 1/2 of a
teaspoon of just regular old dried dill
and sprinkle that also over the hearts
of palm then I got some sea salt and
threw it into a mortar and pestle and
you're basically just gonna add a couple
pinches to taste of just regular old sea
salt I just used one and then I'm gonna
chop up a green onion real nice and
minced and then throw that in as well
and then I have 1/4 of a cup of just
regular old cut corn that's gonna add a
little bit of sweetness then I'm gonna
get my selves right around 1/4 of a cup
of just regular old red roasted bell
peppers and I'm gonna throw that in as
well and then stir it all together and
then add about right around 1/4 to 1/8
of a cup of vegan mayonnaise and then
I'm gonna mix it up and this is what it
looks like when it's all done and it's
really amazing I use a tomorrow 60
calorie tortilla I go and slap some of
it on there and it is quite a great
dinner now to convert that crab salad
into crab cakes we're going to instead
add 1/4 of a cup of panko bread crumbs
and leave out the vegan mayo even though
I try to avoid it I normally add another
fourth of a cup of panko bread crumbs
till the consistency is good and then I
stir it up like crazy and then I'm gonna
get myself some whole grain corn flour
and put it in a separate bowl and then
I'm gonna pull out whatever size you
want your crab cake to be and I'm gonna
dunk it into the corn flour to eliminate
the fat I put a little bit of olive oil
on a napkin and then wipe down the
bottom of the pan I'm gonna preheat my
oven at 350 degrees and I'm gonna cook
it for approximately 20 minutes per side
and we're until golden brown
alternatively you could cook it in a
cast-iron skillet like I have right here
you could either fry it or bake it in
that and this is what it looks like when
it's done super now I'm gonna make some
vegan tuna salad you're gonna get
yourself two stalks of celery and you
either chop them up or you can mince
them in a food processor whatever works
for it and get 15 ounces of chickpeas
you want to drain them and then you want
to process them until they have the
consistency of tuna mix those two
together and then we're going to be
getting ourselves 1/2 teaspoon
onion powder and then adding that in and
mixing it liberally until everything is
well combined and then the next two
ingredients are really gonna give it
it's tuna salty taste we're gonna add
two teaspoons or more of nutritional
yeast until the taste is perfect for you
and then we're gonna get some Liquid
aminos or soy sauce and you're gonna add
one tablespoon of that an additional
ingredient we're going to add is kelp
which is also gonna add the tuna type
taste and I'm gonna add one half of a
teaspoon of kelp and then finally to
finish off everything I'm gonna get two
tablespoons all vegan mayonnaise I'll
put a link to that recipe in the
description throw that in there or add
more whatever it's low-calorie mix it
all up of course and then we could also
easily turn this into a tuna melt
I found this smart beet cheddar which is
only 25 calories and zero calories of
fat I hope you guys enjoyed this video
