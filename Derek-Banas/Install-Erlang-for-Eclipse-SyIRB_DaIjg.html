tutorial which I'll show you how to
install Erlang for Eclipse Eclipse Neon
to be specific and I'm gonna show you
how to set everything up for both
windows as well as Mac OS and all the
links that are used in this video are
available in the description underneath
this video and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it
okay so the very first thing I'm going
to do is show you how to install on Mac
if you want to skip to the Windows part
in the description there will be a link
to do so so what I want to do is have
homebrew installed and where you'd get
this is you just go to brew dot sh and
how you install it on your Mac is you go
and copy this link right here and you
paste it into your terminal now if you
have no idea what the terminal is which
I'm guessing you probably do but I'm
gonna cover it anyway you're just gonna
look in your Applications folder and
scroll way down to the bottom where you
will find a utilities folder and then
inside of that utilities folder you will
find terminal open that guy up copy and
paste that in there and you're done then
after you have homebrew setup you're
gonna want to open up the Mac App Store
see I said there's a little bit involved
in this you're either going to want to
install or you're going to want to just
simply update Xcode after you do that
you're going to want to accept the Xcode
license so once again in your terminal
you're gonna type in this command sudo
Xcode build - license accept and hit
enter and then type your password in and
you're done and then you're going to
install Airline using Brousseau homebrew
that is so you're gonna type in brew
install Erlang and a whole bunch of
stuffs gonna spit out all over your
screen and then at the very end you're
going to see this command and everything
is going to be perfect now you're going
to go and double check that our lines
been installed in the terminal once
again type in er L with a space and then
- V and you should see exactly what I
have here this is the most updated
version of Erlang as of this moment and
you may see a different version but that
won't really matter because everything's
gonna be the same now we're gonna go get
eclipse if you do not have eclipse if
you don't have eclipse you're gonna go
to eclipse.org for it slash downloads
then after you do that you're gonna
click on the big download button that is
going to install the Eclipse installer
in your downloads
directory so you're gonna want to double
click on that whatever you do you're
gonna see this command come up here this
window come up you're going to click on
Eclipse IDE for Java developers and then
this guy's gonna pop up and you're gonna
click on install
after everything installs and you hit
next and all that a whole bunch of
different times you're going to see this
pop up here and you can either change
your workspace that it's giving you as a
default or do whatever you want to do
and then click on OK and then you have
eclipse and it's ready to go but we're
going to have to install the Erlang
plug-in to get everything to work here
properly so what you're gonna do is
you're gonna go over to help and then
you're gonna come down to install new
software and click on that then inside
of this director this text box up here
you're gonna put download dot e RL IDE
dot org with a forward slash update and
then you're gonna click on add whenever
you do you're going to then type in once
again capital e RL IDE this guy will
already be in there and they're gonna
want to click on OK then you're gonna
want to check off in both of these two
boxes you have right down here and then
you're gonna come down and click on next
this windows gonna pop up
doesn't matter click on next and you're
gonna have to come down here and accept
the terms of the license agreement and
then click on finish and there you go
you got everything all set up then
you're gonna want to come up here into
the upper left hand corner click on this
guy right here and then come over to
project whenever you do that you're
going to be able to open this folder
here and see that you can create an
erlang project inside of here click on
next I'm going to give this the project
name of Erlang Tut and then I'm going to
click on finish alright so everything's
opened up inside of here I'm going to
open up this little folder inside of
here come over to source and right-click
on it and then go new and then I'm gonna
come down here and click on module
whatever this pops up I'm gonna type in
Erlang taught like that and then click
on finish and then this is all gonna pop
up your console might be down here it
might be down here it doesn't matter you
can drag and drop these guys around
anywhere you would like to so just move
it around wherever you'd like and in my
big Erlang tutorial I'm gonna cover
exactly how to use our Lang and how the
language works itself but for now what
we're gonna do
just come in here and do a simple hello
world type of application so you're
going to type in exactly what we have
here module Erlang and brackets around
it with a dot at the end and a space an
export hello world with a forward slash
o and then you're gonna type in hello
world you can pause your screen here
type all this stuff out
io f right da-da-da-da-da it's just a
simple Erlang hello world type of
application and then you're gonna click
on save now we can come up here and
click on this guy right here and you're
gonna see our Lang Tut comes up as an
option I clicked on that little downward
facing arrow right there then in the
console you should see this stuff pop up
over here we're gonna change into the
directory where I have this file at
that's obviously gonna be different for
everybody remember you had your
workspace that you created originally so
it's gonna be in that workspace whenever
you first create it or whenever you
first started eclipse I'm then going to
come in here and change to the directory
where I have my stuff you can see it's
right there yours is gonna be quite
similar because Eclipse you know
basically creates the same workspace for
everybody or a similar one anyway hit
enter and you're gonna see that it goes
and opens that up and then down here
inside of the console you're going on
once again put in two more commands
right here and I'm not gonna get into
the specifics of what they are what
we're doing here is just verifying that
everything's been installed properly so
type exactly what you see right there
and then you're gonna want to hit enter
whenever you do you can see if
HelloWorld pops up right there and you
know that you have everything installed
properly alright so that's how you
install Erlang on a Mac OS computer and
now I'm gonna show you how to install it
on a Windows computer ok for Windows in
a browser you're gonna want to go to
Erlang dot-org /downloads I know you
don't want to specifically come to this
part right here where it says windows
64-bit binary file and click on that
whenever you do it's gonna give you the
option to run it and you're gonna click
on run and this guy's gonna pop up and
you're gonna say that's ok and click on
next and this should be a good location
there's no reason to change it so click
on next
and this guy's gonna pop up and we're
gonna click on install and it's gonna
take a little bit of time to install
after it does we're gonna click on close
then what you're going to want to do is
you're going to look for
environment variables you can come down
here and type in environment variables
do a search for it for whatever but what
we're going to do here is just make sure
that the Erlang is available in your
path so you're gonna specifically click
on path and then edit and you're gonna
come over here and you're going to type
click on new and then type in program
files for which slash exactly where you
have Erlang installed on your
windows-based computer and then you're
gonna click on OK after you have that
all set up you're gonna open up the
command prompt once again if you don't
know how to do that come down here to
ask me anything click on there and then
type in CMD that's gonna open up the
command prompt but if you know how to
eat if you're working with our Lang
james's order you know what the command
prompt is so here comes the command
prompt and you're going to just verify
that our Lang exists by typing e RL
space - V and this should pop up and
then you'll know you have Erlang
installed now we're gonna go and install
eclipse so you're gonna go to
eclipse.org /downloads don't worry about
the rest of this it'll all pop up and
you're gonna come in here and click on
download I tried to do everything here
so I went and deleted Java on purpose
just so I could cover how we can go in
and install Java what you're gonna want
to do is come down here to Oracle JDK
1.8 point 0 click on that
this guy's gonna pop up what you're
gonna want to do is click that you
accept the license agreements and then
you're going to come down here and click
on more than likely Windows x64 so this
guy right here click on that it's gonna
ask you if you want to save if you're
gonna say yes and then the installation
wizard for Java is gonna open up we're
gonna click on next
everything's fine click on next and it
will install everything Java wise for
you and then that all works go great
click on next again and click on close
and then you are done then what you're
gonna want to do is go and find Eclipse
and that's going to be in your downloads
directory so you're specifically going
to look for Eclipse and win 64 and you
can come in here into a search what I
did here was just do a search for
everything that was downloaded today so
you're gonna double click on that guy
whenever you do the Eclipse installers
going to open for you so we're gonna
come in here and we're gonna click on
Eclipse IDE for Java developers
this is gonna come up and we're gonna
click on install you're gonna have to
accept the terms click on accept now and
then it will proceed to install on your
computer system whenever it's done we're
going to click on launch to open up
eclipse you can decide where you want to
put this stuff I always basically just
use the default however so it's gonna be
users Derek dance works based remember
this cuz you're gonna use it a little
bit click on OK
I know whenever you open up Eclipse
you're gonna get a welcome screen and
just click on this X to get rid of that
then what we're gonna do is install the
Erlang plugin for eclipse go up to help
come down to install new software click
on that whatever you do you're going to
get this box right here you're gonna
type in download dot e RL IDE dot org

come over here and click on add whatever
you do you're gonna see this guy you're
gonna type in e RL IDE this will already
be here click on OK put a checkmark in
here and in here and then come down here
and click on next whenever you do that
you're going to see all this stuff pop
up on the screen don't worry about it
just click on next come down here check
that you accept the license agreement
and click on finish after you do that
you're gonna want to create a new erlang

and it's going to open up everything
here for you I'm just going to put a
very very simple hello world application
in here so that we can just verify
everything works so we're gonna get rid
of that type all this in here and
everything will look perfectly fine then
you're probably gonna well you're gonna
want to save it they're gonna want to
come up here and you're going to want to
click in this guy right here and run

drag the console around all that you
would like you're then gonna want to
come down here in the console area and
you're going to want to change to the
directory where you have your file hit
