show you my recipe for eggplant with
green curry using ingredients that are
available to me year-round I look
forward to your feedback and I have a
lot to do so let's get into it
the very first thing I'm gonna do is
show you how I boil jasmine rice because
it seems to be a little bit of an issue
for some people I start off by just
taking two and a half cups of jasmine
rice and then I mix in four cups of
water then what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna bring it to a boil I'm gonna stir
it then I'm gonna cover it and reduce
the heat to 40% and it's gonna cook up
beautifully in six to eight minutes for
this recipe you're gonna need two
eggplants here I'm demonstrating the
normal wrong way to cut up the eggplants
and I'm gonna follow that up with how to
properly cut eggplant and you're also
gonna have a lot less chance of cutting
your finger off I'm also going to need
one red pepper for this recipe and as
you can see here I am going to de-seed
it mainly for texture reasons not really
because of heat because in a minute here
I'm gonna be adding a jalapeno pepper
and my main goal here is to get the
pieces of pepper to be roughly the same
size as the eggplant then I'm going to
be adding one jalapeno pepper and the
heat of this dish is really going to be
determined by this jalapeno pepper some
of them are very hot and some of them
are not and as you can see I'm cutting
it much like I cut the eggplant
previously now that I have that I'll cut
up I'm going to dice these really really
small because I personally don't prefer
to have gigantic chunks of jalapenos in
my meal now I'm going to take the
jalapenos and I'm gonna put them in a
separate Bowl and then I'm also going to
do the same thing with the red pepper
that is also here then to a wok I'm
going to add one to two tablespoons of
oil you don't need a wok but you're
going to need a pretty big pan to be
able to real easily fry all this stuff
then I'm gonna make sure that all the
oil is evenly distributed across the pan
which is all I'm doing here and if
you're using a regular pan of course
just evenly distribute all the oil just
in exactly the same way and I have this
pan set on high and I'm gonna take a
little piece of an eggplant throw it in
there and whenever it starts to fry or
bubble up I'm gonna get a little rest of
my eggplant
and throw it in the pan and then I'm
just gonna stir stir stir stir stir the
eggplant in the pan and I'm just trying
to make it kind of gummy sort of like
you can see right there and whenever it
tastes right for you
that is the time in which you can take
it out of the wok and then we're gonna
start frying up our peppers after you
fry that eggplant for about 3 to 5
minutes I'm gonna add another tablespoon
of oil and then I'm gonna take my
peppers and I'm gonna throw them in
there and then I am again going to stir
stir stir stir stir them up in the pan
until they are the right consistency
right about three minutes and then I'm
gonna add another tablespoon of oil into
the pan and now I'm gonna add my curry
here I'm adding 3 tablespoons of green
curry paste to a pan and also the oils
in there I'm going to mix that up
normally mix it for right around 20 or
30 seconds then I'm gonna add half a can
of light coconut milk to the pan and I'm
gonna stir that up until everything is
all mixed together real real nice then
I'm gonna add one tablespoon of liquid
aminos or soy sauce to a pan and then
I'm gonna go and get myself one
tablespoon of brown sugar and add that
to the pan and then I'm gonna start
stirring stirring stirring again and
then I'm gonna put in in this situation
1 tablespoon of pesto because that was
the only basil that is always available
to me then I'm gonna put in 3/4 of a cup
of bamboo shoots and then we're gonna
stir that up and I'm gonna add the rest
of my light coconut milk it really
wouldn't matter if you put all the
coconut milk and it's totally up to you
then it's time for one tablespoon of
lime juice see the recipe is pretty easy
to remember and then of course we're
going to stir all of that up until it
gets into a really nice consistency
after everything is all stirred up I'm
gonna get my eggplants and all of my
peppers and I'm gonna dump those into
the wok and then after get them all
inside of there you guessed right I'm
going to stir all the vegetables until
the sauce thoroughly covers all of them
I then get a big spoonful jasmine rice
which once again took 6 to 8 minutes to
boil and it tastes really really really
good and then I'm gonna go and get the
eggplant with the curry and the peppers
and throw it on top of there and it's
all done I'm very interested in your
take
on my take on eggplant with green curry
so please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
