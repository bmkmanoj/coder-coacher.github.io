html5 tutorial today I'm going to go
over some of the standard webpage tags
and I'm gonna jump right into canvas cuz
everybody seems to be really really
interested in that now first off what
we're gonna do is I'm going to tell the
browser that opens this up to render
this page in standards mode so that's
what that means right there and just so
you know this does not work on anything
previous to Internet Explorer 9 I was
kind of holding off hoping that
eventually Internet Explorer would get
its act together and get work in but too
bad not really that I'm gonna find that
I'm using English on this page this is
all just me talking to the browser and
I'm gonna tell the browser what
character encoding method I'm gonna be
using I just go meta character set it's
equal to utf-8 and then what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna use a tool called
moderniser and you can get that at
moderniser comm here's the web page over
here on the right side of the screen and
it's just a JavaScript library that
allows html5 to work on all browsers but
I'm gonna use it in this tutorial only
to check if canvas is installed on the
current browser that we're gonna be
working with so that's where you get
that guy and I have a link in the under
board underneath this video and I'm just
gonna copy it and save it into the
directory and then I'm gonna go script
and I'm gonna point out it so moderniser
dot custom 6 4 9 j s so that's just a
JavaScript library maybe pulling in and
name for yours it might be different
than mine but either way whatever it's
named you just point at its that's all
we're gonna do with that
and then title tag say messin with html5
close the title tag close my head tag
open up the body section myself a little
bit of space here and then I'm gonna
create the canvas that we can draw on
and I'm gonna give it an ID canvas
number 1 and I'm gonna give it a width
equal to 500 pixels height is gonna be
equal to 400 pixels and of course you
can make this whatever you want and
inside of here the browser does not
support this your browser doesn't
support html5 and it sucks and then
close off the body tag and close off the
HTML that's just basic HTML right there
and i'ma show you a bunch of different
ways to work with this guy here right
here
after we pull the modernizr librarian I
create a style area twice is equal to
text CSS and I'm keeping this all in the
same file just to make it a little bit
easier to understand close off the style
area and you can style this just like
any other element so I'm gonna say
canvas number one which is the ID that I
gave to this guy and let's say that I
want to change the background color on
it to green just to do something now
file save it reload and there you can
see there's the canvas it's drawn on the
screen and here I change the background
color of it to green now we're gonna do
some fancier things here script type is
equal to text JavaScript and then what
we want to do is perform some certain
actions whenever the page is loaded and
how do you do that type in window onload
I'm gonna say that I want to run certain
type of function side of this bad boy
and to keep everything all nice and neat
here I'm actually gonna call another
function my canvas app is what it's
called what I'm calling it this is just
a name I made up so then I want to
create that function it's out of here
let me just copy this paste that inside
of there and I'm gonna run a couple
little things inside of here
first I'm gonna say if is an vez
supported on the current browser that is
this is the name of a function that I'm
gonna call and if it's not I want to
jump out of here so I'm just gonna
trigger return so what do I got to do I
need to create this function we're gonna
be jumping back into here so type in
function paste simply what this guy's
gonna do is it's gonna use the
moderniser library to check if I can use
canvas or not so it's just gonna return
that element whenever it's called up
inside of here this is just basic
JavaScript I'm using here and we can
check if canvas is working by going
document right you notice is working
reload it you could see canvas is
working popped up here on the screen
and it also deleted what we previously
had there which was the canvases so and
the reason why is anytime the screen
reloads with any type of information the
canvas is deleted so if I wanted it to
show up again I'd need to actually
recreate it so that's just the way that
html5 works and canvases in specific so
now what I'm going to do is I'm actually
grab a reference to the canvas that I
created here so I'm just going to create
a variable in JavaScript I'm gonna say
document do I get
by ID and what am I gonna put inside of
here well if I want to grab this guy
down here and it has an ID of canvass
number I don't I'm gonna put that inside
of there right like that and this is
gonna give me a reference to that guy
and I'll be able to make some changes to
it so I'm gonna copy this paste it
inside of here and here I'm making
specific changes to the canvass and
let's say I want to change the
background color on this guy to black on
the canvas again and let's say that I
want to also change the height to 600
pixels and the width to 600 pixels
reload it as you can see originally it
was green because that's what we did up
here with a stylesheet and then we over
rid that with this code right here so
now it's 600 pixels by 600 pixels and
it's black so now if I want to get
access to the different properties and
methods and functions that are available
inside of canvas what I have to do is I
need to create a new variable and I call
this canvas draw one my canvas num1
which is the name of the canvas right
here the reference that i created on
this line right up here to get access to
those methods so that i can play around
with the canvas need to send it to d
there are no 3d libraries available and
then i can of course check to make sure
that this guy actually as a result which
is always a good idea so checking as a
normal value and if it does I want to
jump out so I'm gonna hit return again
to jump out of this function whatever if
everything's fine I'm gonna show you
here a couple different strokes and fill
styles and so forth inside of here
meaning html5 you can do fill style you
can do stroke style and you can do the
line width so those are your three
little things you can mess with here now
if I wanted to find a new fill style I
have to pay reference to this guy right
here and I'm just gonna type in fill
style and let's set it to green and then
if I want to draw a rectangle on the
screen I go film rectangle and these are
all functions that are available to me
because I ran get context up here so
that's where that's all coming from they
don't want to define the upper left hand
point so I'm going to say 10 10 X&amp;amp;Y and
then I want to define the bottom point
so I'm defining a square or rectangle on
the screen it's gonna start up at the
ten ten position in pixels and then go
down to 200 200 in
two pixels and if I file safe you're
gonna see that up here on the screen see
drew that right inside of there which is
real nice
and I can also define line width just
like we did before so you want to change
or create a stroke again you're gonna
define you want to change the line width
and let's make it 5 pixels you know you
can also change the stroke style I'll
get into using patterns and other things
like that later on in the tutorial so it
was just the royal color in here and
then to actually draw it on the screen
you need to call stroke rect and I'm
just gonna use the exact same values
that I have up here of course you don't
need to do that and now you're gonna see
that there is a gray stroke around the
outside of this rectangle know this is
gonna get a little bit more fun we're
just starting off real simple here and
if you'd like to delete or in essence to
redraw a rectangle on the screen using
the same background color as the canvas
itself type in clear rect let's say we
want to define 10 10 and then we'll just
say a hundred 100 to not delete the
whole entire thing won't file save that
reload it you can see that we cut out a
piece of this however if we decide that
we want to get rid of it altogether no
problem we just put in exactly the same
dimensions that we used whenever we
created our original rectangle or we
could make it the full size of the
canvas if that's what you're looking for
you can see we deleted inside of that
area
and we're actually gonna have to come in
here and go just a little bit bigger to
get rid of the whole entire rectangle
and five and five and that is because of
the stroke that was on there now we can
also create gradients inside here and
you can see I'm just redrawing overtop
of everything in here so let's say we
want to create a gradient I'm gonna call
it gradient Sam okay I'm just draw one
and you have to call a function called
create linear and there are linear as
well as radial gradients in here I'm
gonna define again the upper XY point
and the bottom XY point for this
rectangle so let's just say 200 so that
it looks the same as before then what
you have to do is define all the colors
that are gonna go inside of this guy all
the different parts of your gradient
make a gradient samp
and to do that you go add color stop you
have to give these row values so that it
knows how much of the overall wreck
tangle to take up and we're just gonna
copy this paste it two times and here
I'm gonna define that I want the color
that I define here to take up one-third
of the space of the rectangle and let's
say I make this purple and I'm gonna
create another one this is gonna be a
third that's gonna be a third and that's
gonna be a third and let's say we want
it to be white so I tell you to final
your colors and he's gonna be forced you
can have some colors take up more of the
gradient you can you can do whatever you
want with it
but then we need to actually draw it on
the canvas so we're gonna have to call
canvas draw one again and Phil stop is
equal now we created this nice little
new customized style so we have to
assign it to the fill style for the
canvas we're gonna be drawing on and
that's how you do that and and we're
gonna call this canvas again and we're
just gonna call Phil rect we're just
gonna define the points that are needed
to be known to draw rectangle on the
screen reload and you can see it true
this nice little gradient here on screen
that's kind of neat canvas is really
powerful you just have to get your head
around it like I said before you can
define radial gradients so I'm gonna
call this gradient Radio is equal to
camera strong and we have to do pretty
much the same thing we're gonna call a
different function of course this is
called create radial gradient which
makes a lot of sense and we're gonna
define our upper point and then we have
to define our radius MSA is 5 pixels for
radius and then I'm gonna have this or
this is actually the center point so
this is gonna be the center of the
ellipse that we're gonna be drawing on a
screen so it's gonna be 100 pixels
hundred pixels so hundred pixels 100
pixels and when I have the next one here
be hundred pixels so that these guys all
overlap with each other except I'm gonna
give it a radius of 50 then I have to
define all the different colors for this
guy just like we did with the previous
gradient and all the code that I have
here there's a link underneath of this
video you can get a hold of it and of
course it's all free and you just add
color stop just like you did before and
you can define multiple different colors
this time I'm not going to I'm just
gonna say white and you can divide those
colors up as well here I'm just going to
say 1 and I'm gonna say blue so I got my
colors all defined I know how much it's
gonna take up and again we made a
customized style inside of here so we're
going to have to assign it for the fill
right like that and to make this a
little bit fun let's say we want to draw
an ellipse on the screen for this no
just go canvass draw one and to draw an
ellipse you have to use the arc function
and we're gonna start off with x and y
then the radius of this arc that we're
gonna be drawing then we're gonna have
the starting angle and the ending angle
and if we want this to be an ellipse
we're gonna go to x math dot pi and then
canvas draw one fill right like that
reload and you can see that we drew an
ellipse on there with a gradient so
that's a quick run-through as some of
the neat things you can do with html5
and canvas more specifically I'm gonna
be jumping around with a bunch of
different tutorials trying to make this
a fun tutorial if you have any questions
