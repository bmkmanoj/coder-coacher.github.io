tutorial on spotting bluffs and tells in
poker or how I made an extra $300 a week
in college the reason I'm doing this
tutorial is de i/o productions wrote in
and said make more psychology in
behavior videos so here is one and I
have a bunch of other words planned in
the future but most definitely if you
have something you'd specifically want
me to cover please leave a comment below
and also I've covered numerous subjects
on my channel so you should definitely
check that out I'm sorry about the lack
of organization chances are I've
probably covered something you'll want
to see already and you just can't find
it so sorry about that now on to the
basics of winning at poker the easiest
way to make money in poker is just find
a bunch of inexperienced players and get
them drunk that's to a certain extent
what I did I know that sounds very bad
but if specifically in this video I'm
going to teach you some more intricate
ways of spotting Bluffs and tells so
that you don't just have to rely on
alcohol after you master the
fundamentals of Poker all there is to
learn is the psychology behind poker
bluff syntel's you need to master these
techniques to get players to stay in the
game when you have the best hand
spawning poker tells will also keep the
other guy from stealing your money
through aggressive bluffing now in
regards to what's the difference between
a bluff and a towel bluffing is when the
other guy wants to make you think they
have a bad or a good hand a towel is a
mannerism that informs you on whether
their hand is good or not spotting
bluffing is pretty easy to do but
spotting a towel will take a little bit
of practice now on to the most common
poker Bluffs you should always do the
opposite of what your competitor is
trying to get you to do most amateur
players act timid when they have a good
hand and the opposite when they have a
bad hand also if someone acts like they
have a weak and they almost definitely
have a strong one this is the number one
way amateurs Bluff think about it why
would you ever want someone to think you
have a bad hand or a good and for that
matter also if an opponent exaggerate
their motions when putting chips into
the pot or has any type of exaggerated
hand motions they're trying to make
their hand look better of course
everybody does this differently so study
the different players you're playing
against during the game and figure out
exactly how they exaggerate different
motions in regards to lack of interest
there are two forms of lack of interest
if a player all of a sudden starts
staring down another player for no
specific reason chances are they're
bluffing if however they start staring
off and act totally disinterested in the
game chances are you should probably
fold because they probably have
and in regards the chips if a player
reaches for or towards their chips
before it's their turn
chances are very good that they're
trying to fake you out this is something
that even very good bluffers do time and
again and again just ask yourself why
would they want you to have any idea
what they're holding here are some poker
towels that you can actually use against
even very good poker players the most
important thing to watch for is the
player's reaction after they see their
cards their reaction immediately after
they first see their cars you want to
trust this first reaction and then
distrust the second reaction that occurs
as they look at everybody else if they
look at their chips after the cards they
probably got a good hand and if they
look at their cards then chips and then
off into space
you should probably fold because chances
are they have a very good hand and also
the longer they look at their cards the
worse the hand and the more they look at
their chips they're after the better the
hand in regards to Poker towels you can
spot in regards to hand movements and
such sudden hand shaking is a sign of a
very good hand however if the jittery
hands stop as you reach for your chips
chances are very good that the player is
bluffing and remember you want to use
things like that reach for your chips
and test different ways that the person
is reacting and watch how they react to
how you are reacting
if a player shows someone else their
hand chances are it is good and any
touches towards the face or normal signs
of bluffing if you haven't seen my
gestures and body language tutorial you
can check that out and you'll learn a
lot more about spotting if somebody's
aligned and also if the player starts
protecting the cards unnaturally they
probably also have a good hand in
regards to poker tells you can spot in
the eyes if a person looks at you
briefly and then looks away chances are
they are bluffing also looking at the
cards multiple times is also a sign of
bluffing the person should know if they
have a good and or not in specific to
Texas Hold'em looking at the cards after
the flaw means that they don't have a
pair but however they may be getting
very close to a straight or a flush and
again looking bored in any way is a sign
of a good hand in regards to leg
movements if a person bounces their legs
and they are normally sitting still they
are probably bluffing and if a person
flattens their feet they are showing
that they are sure themselves and
chances are they have a very good hand
and if they cross their feet underneath
themselves chances are they're bluffing
and there's just a couple of the random
poker towels players with a good hand or
more apt to talk and laugh bluffers
normally don't
at all and also this is very important
any change in posture breathing and if
you want a spot if a person's breathing
pattern has changed just watch their
shoulders because their shoulders will
rise when they inhale and fall whenever
they exhale this is a sign that the
player is planning on changing their
playing style meaning that they're
planning on becoming more aggressive or
less aggressive and this is a very good
thing to be able to monitor and any
change in check or raise speed is also
another sign that the person is planning
on changing their overall style I'm by
no means an expert of Poker but like I
said before these are just some things
that you can learn to pretty
dramatically increase your odds if
you're playing against amateur players
or even pretty good poker players any
