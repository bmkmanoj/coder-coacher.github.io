5 of my jquery video tutorial today I'm
going to show you how to perform a bunch
of different types of animations using
jQuery and just to jump into it I'll
show you how to hide logos show you how
to bring a little goes back onto the
screen and interesting ways show you how
to completely fade a logo I'll show you
how to bring it back I'll show you how
to fade it just a little bit show you
how to toggle text I'll show you how to
slide away text slide that text back
create custom animations woo shake
bounce highlight size do a whole bunch
of things inside of jQuery and part of
these animations actually come from the
jQuery UI library and here it is this is
the theme picker but if you just go to
jQuery UI dot-com you'll be able to come
in here and this is kind of nice because
you can come in here and go download and
then choose just the components of this
library that you want like let's say I
just want to be able to use the buttons
and the autocomplete and the accordion
okay will it'll automatically pick all
the other things that are needed and
then I can click on download and then
I'll have all that available to me and
also like I said before you can have
things based off of different themes and
you can even create your own theme or
there's a whole bunch of themes that are
already created for you on the left side
of the screen and then you could
download all these different components
based off of the theme that you like
specifically so that's a jQuery UI
dot-com and you can see here on the
screen I actually just downloaded the
whole entire library but you probably
wouldn't want to do this I did this
using the same Google service that I
talked about in the previous tutorial in
the first tutorial in which it'll
automatically load the jQuery library
based off of the location of the person
that's looking at it or your client or
no matter where they are in the world it
will automatically download the version
on the closest Google server available
so let's just jump into it here on the
right side of your screen you can see
just basic HTML I closed off all these
other different things just to prove it
to you see high/low go doesn't do
anything what he did here was just
loaded in an image loaded in some
different text and created a whole bunch
of buttons ahead of time and as you can
see here on this side of the screen this
is what will fire when the documents
ready to
great and here I bound a bunch of
functions to be triggered if one of
these buttons is clicked on and I showed
you this in previous tutorials and if
you haven't seen the previous tutorials
definitely watch them otherwise you will
be confused and then down here I assign
different ID names to all the different
parts that I plan on changing and then
down here I just created some buttons so
I'm just gonna jump right in here now
and actually create some functions that
are gonna allow us to animate all of
these different things that I have on
the right side of the screen first thing
I'm going to show you I'm going to
create a function here and I'm gonna
call it hide image and I'm actually
going to show you some animations that I
didn't show you in the beginning of this
tutorial I'm going to animate this logo
put quotes inside of here and the logo
is this little guy up here and I'm going
to use the hide function and I'm going
to use puffs in this situation and then
here you can put all kinds of different
attributes in between these curly braces
which I'm not gonna really get into that
much I might get into it a little bit
here later on in the tutorial but just
doing this will totally make this whole
entire thing function so that's all I
did and if I file save that and reload
this if I click on hide the logo you can
see that I just made that logo disappear
using the hide function now there are
numerous other different effects and all
of these effects come with the jQuery UI
library by the way so you need to
download that but there's also clip and
you can see exactly what that does and
there is drop sort of moves it to the
left side of the screen and also there's
explode as you can see it broke into a
bunch of different pieces kind of neat
there's fade which I won't show you
because it's very similar to the other
fade I'm going to show you here in a
minute
looks wise there's fold which also looks
kind of similar puff I already showed
you your slide and then there's scale
and with scale you would put in a height
and a weight and I'm actually going to
show you that here in a second so those
are the different guys that are
available and I'm just gonna leave
explode on there for now so I'm gonna
create another one of these guys called
show the image what this is going to do
is it's gonna bring the logo back so I
have to pay a reference to the ID name
for the logo and say show and all of the
guys that I just described right here
all those
different effects can also be used with
show so I'm gonna put fold inside of
here and again I'm just gonna leave that
blank right like that and now I just
created both a way to hide the logo as
well as a way to bring the logo back
after I destroyed it
and you can see that there that is so
that's also kind of neat I'm gonna use
toggle here and what toggle does is it
displays or hides matching elements on
the page so there's actually another
message that's underneath of here and if
you scroll down here you can see it
right here where I have an h4 tag that's
showing and then I have another h4 tag
that's not showing because I have
display:none set for that well I'm gonna
use toggle here to bring or to switch
those guys so that a different one is
shown on the screen
toggle the text so I'm gonna target all
the h4 tags which there are only two and
I'm gonna call toggle and the 2500 is
actually milliseconds in time so if I
make this a bigger number it'll go sit
over if I make it a smaller number it'll
go faster and if I save that reload it
and come down here and click on toggle
text you can see that message two
replaced message 1 if I click on it
again you can see that it moves again
that way so that's kind of neat create
another function called fade the image
here I'm gonna mess around with the logo
again and I'm gonna call the fade out
function and set this for 2500 scroll
this up and I'm also gonna show you how
to fade it just a little bit fade a
little in here I'm just messing around
with the opacity and I'm doing that by
calling the fade to function and here
I'm gonna define how long it's gonna
take and here I'm gonna define the
percentage of opacity so it's going to
decrease the opacity to 30% and I'm
actually gonna copy this guy and if
you'd like to fade the opacity a hundred
percent I'm gonna call this full opacity
image and pretty much all I gotta do is
come in here and just set this to 1 and
if I file save that jump over here fade
the logo you can see that it faded
completely I can bring full opacity back
and then I can fade it just a little by
clicking on that fade a little and
that's just calling all of these
functions that I just created right
there and just so you know hide show
toggle fade out fade 2 are all built
into the regular jQuery libraries you do
not need that
jQuery UI framework to be able to use
those nor do you need it to be able to
use what I'm doing right now create
another function here and this is gonna
slide the image actually this is gonna
slide the text using the slide up
function again built into the regular
jQuery library so you do not need the
jQuery UI to use this and I'm gonna copy
this function save some time and I'm
gonna call this one slide the image and
here I'm gonna change up to down and I'm
gonna leave 2500 where it is and if I
reload that slide away text you can see
that that text was slid away from or
deleted with a slide and I can slide it
back just by clicking that so that's
what those two functions do for you you
can also create custom animations now of
course you could also change the CSS
properties on all these guys but I
showed you that before but also there's
another function called animate and I'm
gonna call this custom animate and this
guy allows you to actually define CSS
changes that you want to take effect
with anything here I'm going to use the
logo and all you do is call the animate
function and then inside of curly braces
you define whatever you want to change
so here I'm changing the opacity but you
can put in any or pretty much any CSS
properties in here and change them
however you would like and here I'm
defining I want this to take 2,000
milliseconds and without the jQuery UI
library you can either have the next
thing be linear meaning that it's gonna
do this in exactly the same speed it's
going to decrease the opacity and
increase the height at the same exact
speed consistently or you can type in
swing and that is going to make the
change a little bit warbly you're gonna
see here in a second what I mean by that
is border play a word either way if we
reload this you can click on custom
animation and you can see that it faded
but on top of that the opacity went down
to 25% but the heist was also increased
by a hundred and fifty pixels now if you
have the jQuery UI library installed you
can do some really really cool things so
let's say ease out elastic again you
need the UI library see how it bounced
here I'll do it again there it is see it
bounced so it gave that kind of that
weird elastics
sort of feel well asides from ease out
elastic there's also ease out bounce and
I have all this code and everything
listed on my website and in the underbar
there's a link to it you can see there
it's a different type of animation
there's ease out elastic ease out bounce
ease out back I sort of slowed down as
it was getting up there and then you
have your ease in circ and here it comes
it's slow and it gets fast then you have
ease in out Expo and there you can see
that and then you have ease in out
elastic and that is all of the different
ways that you can ease these different
types of animations ooh you can see
there that is so there's a whole bunch
of different ways to play around with
those different things kind of neat and
like I said you don't just do this with
images you can do this with other
different elements of HTML wise on your
web page so you can see how we can
create some neat things and later I'm
gonna show you how to create some neat
logos another effect that's available
with the jQuery UI library is something
called effect and here we're gonna apply
some effects again to the logo that I
have here on the screen and how you do
that is by calling the effect function
and I'm gonna bounce it and we're gonna
define that I want it to bounce five
times here I'm showing you the
properties that you would put in here
down meaning I want it to bounce down
distance of ten right like that close
that and we'll file save that and here
is shake so you how it shakes and falls
off the screen now I'm actually gonna
copy these copy this one and call bounce
technically it should have been shake so
I'm gonna change this shake sorry about
that and here I'm gonna leave this as
bounce except I'm gonna switch this up
I'm gonna leave everything else the same
there's also highlight which actually
works a little bit better with text
doesn't really work with images so I'm
gonna change this to highlight the h3
tag and then to use it just call
highlight and with this the only
property change you have is the color
that you want to highlight it with in
here just to be simple I'm going to type
in purple even though you probably
highlight with yellow or something else
and I'm going to show you the last two
effects that are available one's called
pulsate so just type in Paul say
and here you just defined how many times
you want it to Paul say so I'm showing
you the properties this time and then
finally you can change the size and you
do that by just typing in size and then
here inside of the property area you
define two with a colon after it and
then another curly brace and then you
define the height you could also define
from but I don't really see any point in
doing that maybe you do if you do check
out that because normally you would
define what you want it to be from ahead
of time never really understood that if
anybody has an idea why that's there and
what I mean by that is you could
actually come in here and define from an
- and here you would define the original
size by either way we're just gonna
leave this is - and if we jump over here
I can show you all the different effects
that are available to you you could
shake your logo you can bounce your logo
here look right here playing with
animations you can highlight see
multiple times you can pulsate the logo
and you can resize the logo so there is
pretty much every different way you can
animate individual effects using jQuery
