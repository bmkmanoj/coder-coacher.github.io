1 of my java tutorial series in this
part of the tutorial I'm going to go
over all the basics that every Java
program has and I'm going to really
focus in on variables or attributes and
explain pretty much anything you'd ever
want to know well first thing you need
to know is how to create a Java program
and I'm inside of eclipse underneath
this video there's a link that shows you
how to install eclipse if you don't know
how to use that or of course you can use
any other type of text editor and
compiler or what-have-you but inside of
Eclipse you go new and then you come
down here to file and I'm gonna call
this guy hello world even though we're
gonna do a lot more than just the hello
world stuff in this tutorial I'm gonna
call it hello world one dot Java I'm
gonna hit finish and here we are ready
to code now what I always say to people
is just follow along with this the best
that you can because I believe that one
of the best ways to warn a programming
language is to listen someone speak it
and as I type out each individual word
I'm going to explain exactly what I'm
doing now inside of Java everything is a
class or an object and what we're going
to do here is define a new class or a
blueprint for all the things our program
needs such as attributes or variables or
storage areas for data and functions or
methods or things that we need to do
things inside of our program and now how
you always start these guys off is
public and what public tells Java or the
Java interpreter is that this should be
available to all other classes everyone
should be able to execute this guy and
the information that is in it then we're
going to type in class and like I said
before this is a blueprint for our
program and what we want it to do and
then I'm going to type in exactly the
name of the file that we just created
and then I'm going to have an opening
curly brace followed by a closing curly
brace and all of my code is going to lie
between those opening and closing curly
braces and then inside of this guy I'm
going to define a function called main
that is required in every Java program
you will ever create and it is the
function that always executes first and
to start it off we type in public again
and like I said before
just allows all classes to use this
function then I'm going to type in
static and oh by the way that's always
you always use the same sort of format
public static you're going to see a
second void main' and all the other
stuff that I'm going to go over here in
a second what static means is that only
a class can call for this function to
execute in the class in this situation
that's going to call for it to execute
is hello world and then we're going to
type in void and what void means is it's
stating that this function doesn't
return any values after it is done
executing and then we're going to type
in main which is the name of our
function and don't worry about this for
now but string args like we have right
here what this is doing is that every
main function must accept an array of
string objects but like I said don't
worry about that it can become confusing
and I don't want to confuse you
especially right here from the onset so
now inside of this for the basic hello
world common program that people use
we're going to call an object called
system out and system out is an object
that outputs information in different
ways well we're going to say we want to
use the print line function as inside of
here and we want it to print out to the
screen hello world and then we end this
line of code like we end most lines of
code with a semicolon now if we execute
this guy you're going to see over here
hello world pops up so pretty simple so
hoping you understand exactly how
variables work I mean it's just a place
as a storage area for your data now
let's say you wanted to create what is
called a class variable and on top of
that you want it to be able to be
accessible to any other method or
function you define inside of your class
how do you do that well we're going to
use static again because what the static
do it allows other classes to access
this and if we know we're going to use a
series of characters well we're going to
create a string storage area and I'm
going to call this guy random string and
that is the variable name now the rules
for variable names is that variable
names are case sensitive so if I would
have typed in random string like that
with an uppercase or instead of a
lowercase R those are two totally
different variables now
thing to remember is you can start off
all your variable names with either
lowercase or uppercase letters and then
you can also have underscores you can
have numbers and you could have a dollar
sign but most of the time you want to
stay away from dollar signs and just
stick with letters numbers and
underscores and then if we want to
assign a value well remember a string
contains a series of characters we could
type in string two prints right like
that and then we can take this guy right
here and throw that variable down inside
of there and if we execute that it's
going to instead say string 2 print over
here so that's how you would create a
class variable that can be used anywhere
now let's say you want to create a
variable that is always going to remain
the same well again we're going to type
in static because we want everybody to
have access to this and if you want it
to be what's called a constant you use
final and then let's say that we want
this to be a number that has decimal
places in it well in Java by default if
you want a storage area that's going to
be a number with decimal places it is
called a double so we're going to put
that in there another common practice
inside of Java is if you're creating a
constant that the variable name should
be all uppercase letters and in this
case I'm using PI as a value for this
guy and then just to show you that it
works you can use it just like before
execute and boom there PI shows up over
on the right hand side of the screen and
if you can't see this by chance watch it
full screen and everything will look
great because it's an HD video ok so now
I'm going to show you a little bit more
about variables now if you want to
create a variable or use a variable you
must declare it before you can use it
here I'm creating what's called an
integer and I'm going to give it a name
integer 1 for example and I could just
do that and this would be called a
declaration statement and that would all
be perfectly fine if I want to also
assign a value to it which also makes a
lot of sense I could do just that and
then also understand you could also
declare multiple different variables all
at once by going into juror 2 and then
as many commas as you'd want ended with
a semicolon but that's just the basics
right there so integer 1 we're going to
say is equal to 22 okay that's great
well you could also create a new integer
and it's going to be called integer
- in this situation and we're going to
say that integer 2 is equal to integer 1
if you want to increase that value by 1
for example well that's what you do just
with a plus sign and this is what is
called an expression statement okay so
this is declaration statement right here
and this is an expression statement
nothing you really need to know but also
understand that it is completely valid
to say int integer 2 and put this on the
next line and then put this on the next
line and then put this on the next line
Java does not care about whitespace why
because it cares about this semicolon
this tells it it is the end of the line
and then of course you could come in
here copy down paste that in there and
if you wanted to print this the screen
you do it like that and you can see here
the 23 showed up on the screen all right
so let's get rid of that for now I'm
going to get more in on the specifics of
variables and how they're used now
there's a bunch of what are called
primitive types inside of Java and
really the only thing that makes them
different is what values they can hold
so you have bytes and I'm going to call
this Big Bite because it's actually
going to be the biggest value that a
byte can hold which is 127 and the
minimum is negative 128 shorts so I'm
going to say big short doesn't really
make sense does it big sure is equal to
and then this situation is 32767 32,767
and the smallest is negative 32768 so
it's just one less than what your
maximum is there for integers against is
equal to and this numbers like 21 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 it's bigger than that but
basically understand that it is right
around two point one trillion okay so
that is the biggest int that you can put
in there it's actually a bigger number
but not by much then you have what are
called Long's
and lets go big long is equal to nine to
two and puts 16 zeros after that okay
and then you have to always end it with
L whatever you're defining a loan so
that's approximately how big along its
then you have floats which are just
decimal place numbers
load is equal to and it's a big guy I'm
actually going to show you exactly what
it is it's kind of machine dependent
just to understand you have to put an F
there at the end to be able to create a
float and then a double in essence is a
float except it is just a bigger more
precise float so you can put a lot more
numbers in there and you could ever do
with a float and also another thing to
remember is you can put a D at the end
of this double but it is not required
because it's a default we're using
doubles inside of Java if you're using
decimal place now remember I said I
could actually print out on the screen
the maximum size for my float now I'm
going to use system.out.print line again
and if I want to print that I just go
float dot and I'm gonna type in max
underscore value right like that and I
can also do the same thing with doubles
so this is going to tell me precisely
how big they are depending upon the
system that I am using might be
different for the one you are using and
we can print that out and find out and
you can see there is the largest float
you can create and here is the largest
double you can create make sure you
understand here e38 these are exponents
so these are big numbers 38 digits in
length is 308 digits in length just
understand that a float is precise to
roughly 6 decimal places and a double is
precise to approximately 15 decimal
places so like I said before you don't
need to memorize this stuff just laying
it all out there and you have boolean z'
and they are literally true or false
that is it they cannot hold a value of 1
or 0 or what have you like other
computer programming languages are
either true or they are false and they
are not uppercase true
they are lowercase true or false and
those will come more into effect later
on in the tutorial series then you have
characters and what they are is it's a
character is either a number or a
character it's it's a character that is
surrounded by a boss trophy so if you
want to create one you can go random you
can actually do it in a couple different
ways I'm going to go random CH AR is
equal to and I'm going to type in 65 in
this situation and then I'm gonna go
character another CH AR is equal to and
I'm going
oh right like that now if we come in
here actually copy this we can see what
the difference is make sure you do not
surround these with double quotes though
it will not work or at least it won't be
a character so then I want to go random
see har paste it inside of there and
then let's see if this guy looks like
you can see that in uppercase a shows
there on the screen which had just so
happens to be the same character code as
the a down here and just to prove that
I'm telling you right I'll change it to
66 run it again and now you see that it
is a B so those are character codes and
I have a little bit more information
underneath this about how character
codes work and all the different
character codes characters can also
contain what are called escaped
characters and they are things like back
spaces so let's just show this escaped
cars like that and they can be a
backspace which is that right there or
they can be a form feed which is a
backspace well actually these are
surrounded by apostrophes just to make
sure we got that all right so like I
said backspace form feed line feed
carriage return which is an our
horizontal tab a double quote a single
quote as you can see we're just doing
this and then a backslash so those are
all the different escape characters that
are available again nothing by any means
you need to memorize you'll easily catch
up and learn those as time goes by then
you have what are called strings and we
visited them before a string is
technically an object but like I said
I'm going to get more into that later so
let's say I create a random string like
I did before
I'm a random drawing okay
it's just string of characters inside of
double quotes that's a string that's all
it is
and you can print that to the screen as
well if you wanted to but let's say we
want to do create another string random
string and call this another string it's
equal to and I'm just going to say stuff
if you want to combine two strings
together
let's go string and another straight is
equal to you can go random string plus
and if you want to put a space enter no
problem just do that and put another
plus sign and then go
oh another string and there you just
combined a bunch of different strings
together and if we take this guy right
here drop it inside of there and run it
you can see it says I'm a random string
stuff so that's how you can find strings
and let's come in here again I'm going
to show you how to convert any other
type that I defined above into a string
well you go to create a string to hold
the thing and we can go byte string
that's just just the name of the
variable I'm creating and if you want to
convert a byte to a string you would
just type in byte with an uppercase B to
string right like that
and it's a function and we're going to
go in here and go Big Bite and I define
that up above so now this string called
byte string is actually going to hold
the value of the variable called Big
Bite and except it's going to be a
string so it's going to be 127 and then
there's actually six of these different
guys there's one for short there's one
for int there's no reason for there to
be one for character or CH a are just
one for long and they all follow exactly
the same format one for float there's
one for double and boolean and then the
only thing you need to do is replace
these guys with uppercase letters so
this is going to be short now dot two
string and then of course it's going to
be big short and then in this situation
it's going to be integer instead of int
and this is going to be long this is
going to be floats this is going to be
double and this is going to be pulling
except in uppercase letters so that is
how you convert any of the other
primitive variable types into string
types that you can use another thing
that you learn kind of at the onset of
learning how all these different things
work is how to cast or how to convert
from one primitive type to another so
let's say I create a double a double
value and it is equal to 3.14 blah blah
blah blah blah okay so there I just
created a variable called a double value
and if I create an int and double to int
is the name of that variable I want to
convert this double which is right here
into an int how do I do it real simple I
just put little braces like that
and then type int or what I want to
convert it into and then I just take the
variable that I want to convert right
like that
and then if I print screen' this new
integer you'll see right over here it
takes this big double three-point blah
blah blah and turns it into a three now
you may have a question of what happens
whenever the double is bigger than the
integer meaning the space for it let's
find out just go like that
hit return and what it does is it puts
in as many numbers as it can or the
maximum value that an integer can hold
so you can see by doing this casting and
converting that a lot of information is
lost along the way but it's important to
know how to do casting and so forth so
that is why I'm covering it and if you
would want to cast any of the other guys
it would just be byte short long inside
of varys's double and then the final
thing I'm going to show you here is how
to turn a string into one of the other
primitive data types and it's pretty
easy
here's int string up right here and
let's big int now if I want to create a
new variable called
string to int and I want to convert that
string which is right here and string
back into an integer well I'm going to
type in uppercase integer and I'm going
to type in parse int right like that
and then I'm just going to pass in the
string that I want converted into an
integer like that and I can come in here
and go paste and we can see what did we
got here and there you go
we printed it out and it is now back to
being an integer after it was turned
from an integer into a string and back
into an integer and there are parse
functions available for all the other
different types there's parse short
there's parse long there's pores ie
parsefloat parse double and parse
boolean and once again there's no reason
to parse a character so there's a whole
bunch of different things you can do
with variables inside of Java leave any
questions or comments below like I said
the code is heavily commented and
underneath of this video otherwise still
