tutorial on how to install zamp on
Windows 10 now zamp stands for
cross-platform that's the export Apache
MySQL PHP and perl and it is the easy
way to set up a webserver am database
for testing on your own local computer
and in this tutorial going to show you
how to setup zamp I'm going to show you
how to fix all common zamp errors I'm
going to show you how to create a MySQL
database a MySQL user account a PHP
slash my school configuration file also
I'm going to cover all the PHP code used
to retrieve and update data in the MySQL
database and a whole bunch more and so I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so very first thing I'm going to
show you this from numerous different
angles and I on purpose set my system up
to cause the most amount of errors so
that I can hopefully catch every error
that you could possibly get into alright
so this is Windows 10 and what I'm going
to do here first is I'm going to open up
the user account control settings I'm
going to do that by hitting a little
window button or the Start button
wherever you want to call it and I'm
going to type in UAC and change user
account control settings is going to pop
up I'm going to click on that and
whenever I do this little guy right here
is going to pop up on the screen it's
probably going to be up here somewhere
so just drag it down here and then we're
going to click on OK then what we're
going to do is we're going to go to
Apache friends dot org and index.html
and you're going to see something like
this and since you're using Windows
we're going to be clicking on this guy
Linux users as well as OS X users are
probably not going to use zamp because
there's already a built-in web server or
at least with Linux it's extremely easy
to install it's actually very easy to
install otherwise but zamp is an awesome
tool if you are on Windows so we're
going to click that we want to download
Zam and it's going to download for us
and you're going to see a little button
down here and we're going to click on
run so that we can install everything
after you do that you may or may not see
this error message right here where it's
basically saying that it can't install
certain things or certain things maybe
an issue because of the user account
control settings and I'll just ignore
that for now we're going to go in and
fix that and whenever you do you're
going to see this amp setup pop up on
the screen we're going to click on next
and we're just going to leave everything
checked exactly as it is right here just
make
everything's checked but it should be by
default and I'll click on next and it's
best to just keep everything installed
in the location that it sets up here and
I'm getting and we're going to click on
next and then you're probably going to
want to uncheck this unless you want to
receive a whole bunch of emails from bit
Nami if you do leave that checked I
uncheck tit and click on next and it's
going to say that it's ready to install
so click on next and it's going to
unpack all those files and install them
for you and whenever it's all finished
you're probably going to get a message
that your firewalls blocking this just
put a checkbox in right here where it
says private networks and uncheck this
one and click on allow access and then
the final setup is all complete we're
going to check here that we want to open
up our control panel and see what else
we need to fix and click on finish now
what we're going to want to do is you're
going to go to your C Drive and then
zamp
and then Apache and configuration and
extra and you're going to open up the
HTTP D - SSL file and you can open up in
notepad or something like that that's
what I open it up in or sublime text or
something like that and you're
specifically going to look for this so
just do a find until you look for 4 for
3 and we're going to change that to 81
81 and that's all you're going to need
to do with that file then what you're
going to need to do is again in your C
Drive zamp Apache and configuration
you're going to open up httpd get a
notepad that's going to work perfectly
fine you can see a little error message
I have right here and the error message
has to deal with this 80 you may or may
not get this error I'm just covering it
just to be complete and you're going to
do a little search for a T and once you
find that you're going to want to change
this to 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 or that's just
the number I used and then I know that
it's going to work on most systems and
you're just going to want to change that
from 80 to 1 2 3 4 and of course save
that file you're going to see here the
error message that pops up on the screen
and 443 but all that's going to go away
here really really quickly and then once
again in that same HTTP file you're
going to look for the other 80 right
here and change that to 1 2 3 4 and save
that as well now you have to go over
inside of the control panel for samp and
you have to tell it where the port
numbers have changed so you're just
going to click on config this is going
to pop up and you're going to click on
service and port settings and whenever
you do this is going to pop up and we're
going to put 1 2 3 4
here and 81-81 right here and then click
on save now we're going to want to open
up our control panel once again and you
just go to zamp one like that and you're
going to look for zamp
- control so just double click on that
and once you do you're going to see that
there are no errors showing on the
screen except for this one it says you
are not running with administrator
rights so we're going to fix that next
now what you want to do is click on your
little start button down here and type
in CMD + command problems going to open
up up here and we're going to right
click on that and you're going to see
run as administrator and you're going to
click on that you might get a little
message ask for your password and
otherwise we're just going to open up
the command prompt first thing I'm going
to do is you're going to type in net
with a space user and you're going to
see administrator default account you're
not going to see Derek Venus unless you
call yourself Derek Manas and you can
see guests like this what we're going to
do here is we're going to set up our
administrator account on Windows 10 by
default it is not set up but it will be
after you do these couple things so what
you want to do is type in net space user
space administrator space forward slash
active : yes exactly like that and it's
going to say that it was completed
successfully then you're going to type
in net space user space administrator
space star and you're going to have to
type in a new password for your
administrator and then retype it to make
sure that it's all the same then you're
going to want to log out as whoever you
are currently on Windows 10 you're going
to come down here click and say you want
to open as administrator and you're
going to type in your new administrator
password and click on start and a whole
bunch of things is going to pop up it's
going to say hi and all these different
things because it's a brand new user
account I'm just skipping that for now
and everything's going to be all set up
then you're going to go into a sample
control panel and whenever you do you're
going to see that all of the errors are
gone and everything is working
wonderfully one problem however is that
you are logged in as administrator
currently and it is not going to allow
you to open up things like Microsoft
edge so you're not going to be able to
run anything in browsers so that's sort
of a problem so we're going to fix that
by going into reg edit and change some
registry values you're going to open
that up by typing in red
edit and whenever you see this we're
just going to click on it and open that
up and then you're gonna have to search
for a whole bunch of different things
here so I'm going to walk you through
the whole process what you're going to
want to do is go to H key underscore
local machine and then inside of that
you're going to want to open up the
software tab and then inside of that
open up the Microsoft tab right there
and we just keep on scrolling down here
until we find Windows and there's
windows and then you're going to want to
click on current version and then scroll
down here until you see policies where
is that there's policies and open up
that and then you want to click on
system and then you're going to want to
look for filter administrator token and
you just click on that guy and whenever
you do you want to make sure that this
is set to the value of 1 and then click
1 ok and that's all you need to do with
that and then we have to set another
registry key so again we're going to be
doing basically the same exact thing the
only difference is is we're going to go
down here to where it says you ipi and
click on that and then for this guy
you're going to want to open up the
default and make sure that it has this
value right here it's 0 X and then
there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 zeros and a one
and then parenthesis 1 and closing
parentheses you're going to want to
click on ok I have a link in the
description that has all this
information all written out so it'll
save you some time and you're going to
want to exit out of that guy and then
restart your system meaning logout and
then re log back in or just restart
windows altogether and then we're going
to go into the samp directory again and
reopen the control panel and you're
going to see that there are no errors
here and make sure that you click on
these guys to start apache and then to
start mysql and then if you do that and
open up the edge browser you're going to
be able to go to localhost colon
one-two-three-four forward slash
dashboard and you're going to see that
apache is indeed running and everything
is running on your system now what we're
going to do is go in and set up a MySQL
user account as well as a MySQL database
and a whole bunch of other different
things also you're going to want to go
in and set up a user password for the
user ID of root because by default it
has no
value so the first thing we're going to
want to do is click on the SQL tab up
here and you're going to type in set
password for root at localhost equal to
password and I just typed in a password
called Turtledove you can type in
whatever you want of course and you want
to clip down here and click on go then
you're going to have to go into the Sam
folder again and PHP myadmin that
directory and you're going to want to
open up a file called config dot Inc
whenever you do there's a couple things
we have to change here and after you set
the password for root it's probably
gonna pop up a whole bunch of errors
don't worry we're fixing those errors
right here and how we're going to fix
those errors is we're going to
specifically look for auth type config
and password and there's nothing inside
of here we're going to change this to
cookie and then put Turtledove or
whatever your password is inside of here
for your password and then save your
config dot Inc file now we're going to
jump back over into PHP myadmin and
everything all the errors are going to
be going if they did show up there for
you and now we're going to create a new
database so we're just going to come in
here click on new this little guy is
going to pop up and I'm going to call my
database test3 and call it whatever you
want don't need to change anything else
and click on create you're going to see
here no tables founded database and I'm
going to create a table this is going to
I'm going to keep this very simple just
not to waste time so I'm going to call
this table students and I'm going to say
that it has two columns and I'm gonna
click on go and then inside of here I'm
going to type in first-name variable
number of characters length of 30 last
name variable number of characters
length of 30 leave everything else
exactly the same and click on save and
here you're going to see the table has
been created for us now I'm going to
click on privileges over here and I'm
going to say that I want to add a new
user account and of course make sure
that I have my test3 database or
whatever you just called your database
selected whenever you click on add user
account and I'm just going to call this
student web so I just typed in student
web I gave it a password then I clicked
on select insert update I'm going to fix
that here in second so that it works
exactly the way I want
click on go all right so that new user
has been added to our brand new database
so now you know how to create a database
a table as well as an account for it and
now I'm going to click on SQL again I'm
going to set up everything so that my
student web ID or account or whatever is
going to be able to work exactly the way
I want it to work with my database so
inside of the SQL tab I'm going to just
type in grant insert select delete
update on test 3 that's the name of our
database to student web that's the
account at localhost identified by
Turtledove that's where you would put
your password right there and after you
do that click on go and then it's time
for us to jump in and actually start
writing some code to test that not only
PHP works but also that MySQL works and
that I can successfully go in with PHP
and access my database I'm going to do
that is I'm going to open up my zamp
folder right here and htdocs' which is
where all of my files are going to be
stored on my web server so now I'm going
to go in and write all that code for you
right so let's open up sublime text
that's what I'm using here basic text
editor or wherever you want it to be and
the very first thing I'm going to do is
set up my configuration file that it's
going to open a connection to my
database I'm going to call it MySQL i
underscore connect dot PHP and you can
get all the code that I have here again
in the description and it's free of
course and just to show you where
exactly this is save that you can see
here is zamp and i'm going to save this
file right here inside of the mains amp
directory not inside of htd Doc's not
this guy I'm going to save it right here
inside whoops and cool down right here
that's where it is
ok so let's jump in here so like I said
a moment ago this is going to open a
connection to the database and I do not
want this to be accessed from a browser
on just anybody's machine so for that
reason that's the reason why I am saving
it outside of htdocs so the very first
thing I'm going to do and I also have a
more in-depth PHP tutorial and MySQL
tutorial and all those different things
I'll put a link in the description
underneath if you want to go take a look
at that first thing I'm going to do here
is I'm going to find some constants so
that these will not be able to be
changed so I'm first off going to define
the user that's going to be accessing my
database and this is student web
just as you saw previously and I'm also
going to come in and define a password
and this is Turtledove this is a
terrible password by the way I just it's
just the password that I always use in
my tutorials for some reason don't know
why and then I'm going to define my
database host and in this situation that
would be localhost and then finally I'm
going to define the database name
database name and it's going to be test3
all right got all those set up now I'm
going to go in here and DBC is going to
contain a resource link to our database
and we're going to put an app sign right
here which is going to keep the errors
from showing in the browser except for
the specific errors that I want to show
and we go connect and then I'll pass in
all of those constants so DB host and DB
user and DB password and DB name and
then I'm going to say or die and in this
situation I'm not going to be able to
access the database so my message is
going to be that I cannot connect to
MySQL and then I can come in here and
post a more detailed piece of
information if I'd like to connect error
and then close that off alright so got
that all set up and that is all I need
to do this guy right here is going to be
used in multiple different locations to
make a connection to our database so I
can save that and now what I want to do
is come over here to get student info
dot PHP and this is going to open a
connection to the database retrieve
information and send it to the browser
so now I'm going to make a call to that
file that we just saw so require once
this is going to get me my database
connection that I need I'm going to go
dot dot my sqli
connect dot PHP alright so now I've got
a database connection or at least
hopefully I'm going to issue my query
and if you don't know what queries are
once again I have a MySQL as well as a
PHP tutorial underneath of here that
goes into more detail so I'm going to go
select first name that's the name of the
column inside of my database that I
created previously and last name from
students this is saying that I want to
receive all of the first names and last
names for all students in the database
simple way that query is going to work
and I'm going to go response is equal to
and this is going to get a response from
the database by sending the connection
and the query again put the @ sign there
to subdue any errors miscue all I query
and all I need to do to get this to work
is pass in the database connection and
the query that I want to send to my
database now I need to check if the
query went through properly so I'm going
to go if response which means did I get
a response did it go through that's what
I'm asking here and if I did get a
response I'm going to go echo and I'm
going to open up a table on the screen
and print out all the users on top of it
so let's just keep this very simple I'm
going to go a line left and do a little
bit of styling next to nothing but cell
spacing and put a 5 inside of there and
cell padding and we'll put an 8 inside
of there going to skip into the next row
and put in a table row and let's go and
get ourselves let's let's do a line left
as well on this guy and we'll use bold
tag here and we're going to say first
name like that close off the bold tag
close off the table and then let's go
into pretty much exactly the same thing
with this guy this is going to be the
last name though so let's just change
this to last and then after we get to
the bottom of this we can close that off
and close that off now I'm going to come
in here and create a while loop that's
going to cycle through data for each of
the rows of data that we can get here so
I'm going to go row is equal to MySQL
fetch array and get a response and then
inside of this we go echo and we're
going to take all the information we get
as a response and put it inside of the
table and then get each of these
individual rows of data so go row and we
specifically want the first name field
here and then we're going to put in the
closing brackets for table close that
off and then we're going to go and get
this row so much just copy that paste
that in there change this to last name
close off that and then after week
this one we can go echo and then close
off that as well and next we're going to
come down here and close off our table
all together since we got all of our
data out of our database and now put it
on the screen otherwise we have a
situation in which we didn't get a
response which means we had some type of
error so we need to handle that as well
and we might as well keep this simple
something went wrong with the quarry we
don't know what it is so let's just go
couldn't issue database query and we'll
just throw in a break statement and then
we go echo nice qli error to get
additional information and pass in our
database connection and then that closes
off right there and then after we finish
all this stuff we want to close the
connection to our database all together
so we can do that by just going close
and passing in the connection we want to
close and that's all we need to do for
get student info dot PHP that's going to
get all that info now let's jump over to
add student dot PHP and let's allow the
user to add student information so I
just have HTML head I'm not doing
anything elaborate here with the HTML
I'm just sticking to the bare-bones what
we must have and if we're going to pass
in information of course we are going to
have to create a form here so form
action is equal to and we're going to be
using localhost and one two three four
because we set it up that way and
student added which is what we're going
to be calling which is what we're going
to be creating here in a moment PHP and
the method we will be using is the post
method of course and let's just go in
here right ahead and close off the form
and put like a little message right here
that's going to say something like add a
new student and then we'll go and put in
paragraph tag and we'll have first name
and then we'll open up an input box for
them to put that information in this is
just going to be regular text name is
equal to first-name size is equal to we
actually made our size 30 inside of our
database so let's just leave this be 30
value is equal to and it will close that
off and the paragraph tag will be closed
off as well put this on the next line if
you think it looks better whatever and
then we're going to do exactly the same
thing for the last name so much we'll
just copy that paste that inside of
there I change this to last name and
then change this to last name everything
else can be exactly the same and then we
need an input button so that they can
actually send information in and this is
going to be an input guys well so ago
input type is equal to submit and let's
give it the name of schmitt and let's
give it the value of submit or of sent
let's make it send just to be different
and that is all you need to do all right
so there's the form it's all closed and
ad student is finished so now what we
need to do is just create student added
dot PHP so that we can process all this
once again bare-bones HTML inside of PHP
tags we're going to create a whole bunch
of different things so what we're saying
here is if we received a submit request
post submit well then we want to try to
handle it make sure there's no errors so
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to I'm going to do a little bit more
information than I need to do I'm going
to create an array here that is going to
contain any missing information so if
they didn't input their first name or
last name we're going to store that in
array and then we're going to go empty
and I'm going to check if they didn't
send me a first name and I can just do
that this way just by going first name
down there so if they didn't send me a
first name I'm going to add that to my
dad a missing array and I can just do
this by this and go first name and then
I'll be able to open up a little message
here telling them hey you need to enter
our first name and
else if they did enter a first name I'm
going to come in here and I am going to
say that I want to trim any of the
whitespace off of it and I can get that
information by just going post first
name just like I did previously and then
I'm going to do basically the exact same
thing once again for the last name so
inside of here inside of the same if
block paste this down inside of there
and I'm going to change this to last
name of course and let's change this to
last name and let's change this to last
name then after all that's done I'm
going to say hey was any data missing
and I can do that by just coming in here
and going empty data missing so if
something was missing it's going to be
in the array and I'm going to try to
open up a database connection so I just
go require once once again dot dot
forward slash my sqli and if you set up
everything and stored everything in
exactly what I told you you should be
using exactly the same code here without
any errors if you are getting errors
just go and copy and paste my code
that's available in the link in the
description and we will go query create
our query here because we are going to
now be inserting data into our database
into and students is the name that we
gave our database and first name and
last name or the fields that we want to
change and then I'm going to say values
and then inside of here I'm going to put
a question mark and another question
mark close that off and there we go
there's our query now I'm going to
define something called a prepared
statement not going to get all into the
prepared statements if like you said if
you want to learn more about them look
for my PHP tutorial in the description
and I school I'll prepare and I'm going
to pass in my database connection and of
course my query inside of there then I
need to bind values being the first and
last name to our prepared statement I
skew Li statement find parameters
statement and inside here the SS stands
for two strings first name and last name
for wondering and then I'm just going to
go F underscore name
that works and then last name if you
wonder where that's coming from
right here up good thing I check that
that's last name and there's first name
so that's where those things come from
and now I just need to execute this
premiere this prepared statement and I
do that just by passing in that variable
then after is you that I want to make
sure that some rows have been affected
meaning that one row has been affected I
just inputted a you know new student
with the first and last name so this is
a way to check errors so rows statement
and then I'm going to say if affected
rows is equal to one I can only enter
one student at a time so there should
only be a situation which affect the
rows is equal to one if that occurred
I'm going to output on the screen
student entered so that they know that
that student was enter I'm going to go
SQL I statement close close my prepared
statement and then after that I can go
in and close my database connection so
close
DBC else if there was not one only
affected row well I know something
happens so I'm going to say error
occurred throw in a break statement echo
- Q Ally error occurred and I'm still
going to close my prepared statement
close and I'm gonna close my database
connection otherwise and come down here
and then after this one we're going to
say else once again and this is going to
pertain to whether data was missing or
not and if data was missing I'm going to
say echo you need to enter the following
data and then I can print out to screen
each of the things that they forgot to
enter so we can do that by just going
for each data missing
that's my array that's how I cycle
through my array as missing each time it
cycles through the array whatever the
current value is for that individual
part of data missing is going to be
stored in the missing variable and then
I'm going to just type in just thing cut
and a break statement then we'll let all
that close and then down
we can allow them to enter new student
information again and just to save us
some time we're just going to come in
here and copy this form right here
there's that form copy it jump over here
and paste it and then we could save that
and then open up our browser and we're
specifically going to go to localhost
colon 1 2 3 4 get student info dot PHP
if we reload that you're going to see
maybe some information pops inside of
there what we want to do is add a
student so we're just going to go in
here to the browser again and we'll say
add students like that you see that pops
up right there we can say something like
Sue Smith hit Send student entered add
new student or what we can do is jump in
here again and go get student info and
you can see Sue Smith pops up there now
we know our PHP works we also know MySQL
works we also know we can create
connections to it we also know we have
accounts and everything with zamp works
