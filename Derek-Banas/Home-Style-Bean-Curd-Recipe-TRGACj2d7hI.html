you my recipe for homestyle bean curd it
goes down silky smooth this is like the
essence of comfort food but then it
heats you up from the inside out this is
also known as Mei PO tofu but I replace
the pork with the chicken cuz I prefer
chicken and here you can see pretty much
everything we're going to use first
thing I'm going to do is get myself a
little ball and add three tablespoons of
just regular old water to it then I'm
gonna get myself some cornstarch and I'm
gonna add two tablespoons of cornstarch
to my little bowl and then I'm gonna mix
it together until it has a nice
consistency now it is gonna be time to
create the rest of the sauce so we're
gonna be using here so I'm gonna get
myself one cup of chicken stock and I
use a homemade chicken stock you can use
store-bought but it's a little too salty
for me so I prefer to use just regular
old homemade chicken stock and then I'm
gonna add my cornstarch mixture to it
then I'm gonna get myself two
tablespoons of just regular old
granulated sugar and add that to the
bowl and then I'm gonna either get two
tablespoons of either liquid aminos or
soy sauce totally depends upon your
taste and then you're gonna mix all of
that up until it has a really nice
consistency to it and pretty much your
sauce is all done so now what I'm gonna
do is I just have some store-bought
frozen precooked chicken nuggets and I'm
gonna grind those up in a blender then
I'm gonna get myself a leek that I have
trimmed off the dark green and of and
I'm gonna chop that up and then I'm
gonna get myself a green onion and chop
that up and that's gonna come out right
around 1/2 of a cup and then I'm gonna
get 14 ounces of soft tofu and chopped
it into cubes and I prefer to eat
jasmine rice was this I'm gonna add two
and a half cups of jasmine rice to four
cups of water and I'm gonna bring that
to a boil now we're gonna switch over to
the lock I'm gonna add in about 1 to 2
tablespoons of oil and add in my chicken
and I'm gonna stir this around in a wok
for about 2 minutes yeah you know taste
it and make sure it tastes good but this
is precooked chicken so you don't have
to worry about anything then I'm gonna
add in about another tablespoon of oil
and then go
add in all of my leaks then I'm gonna
stir in the leeks for about three
minutes and then I noticed the jasmine
rice was boiling turn it down to 40%
cover for six to eight minutes and then
I'm gonna get myself some Thai chili
paste and I'm going to add in 3
tablespoons to 5 tablespoons depending
upon how much heat you want then we're
gonna stir all that up until
everything's combined now I'm gonna add
in my onions and then I'm gonna get
myself some fermented black beans I'm
gonna add one tablespoon of that to the
mixture then I'm gonna get my tofu cubes
and I'm gonna stir those very gently
just to combine them and then I'm gonna
go over and get my sauce stir it up make
sure that it's combined and then I'm
gonna pour it in over everything we got
here and then of course I'm going to
stir until it starts to thicken and then
I'm gonna get my jasmine rice throw that
down in a bowl and then get my homestyle
bean curd and top that off and this is
just an absolutely fabulous dish you
have to try it please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
