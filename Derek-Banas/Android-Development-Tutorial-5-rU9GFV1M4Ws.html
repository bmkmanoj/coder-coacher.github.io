5 of my android development tutorial if
you haven't seen the previous parts of
this tutorial
most definitely check those out there's
a link in the upper right-hand corner
because I use a whole bunch of things
that I talked about in parts three and
four in this tutorial and today what
we're going to do is we are going to
handle events that are going to be
triggered by radio buttons radio groups
checkboxes dropdowns and so forth and so
on
that we created in part 4 of the Android
development tutorial so I have a bunch
to do so let's get into it okay so in
the last part of the tutorial we created
the layout for our whole entire app here
and all the code is available in a link
under the video in the description now
what we need to do is set this up so
that whenever any of these things are
changed we are going to change our tip
up here and then hence change the final
bill amount so there is a whole bunch of
different events that we need to handle
and we're going to be handling them in
crazy tip kappa and that is located over
here in the source directory right here
crazy tip Calva so let's go over there
and check it out alright so before I
continue here I wanted to cover update
tip and final bill which we created in
part three of this tutorial because
we're going to be calling it a lot and I
just want to make sure you remember what
it is basically all it's going to do is
it's going to get the tip amount and
it's gonna get the tip amount by calling
the editable text area called tip amount
we can jump over here and this is what
I'm talking about this guy right here
and if we come over here tip edit text
say that's where that's coming from and
it's going to convert it into a double
after it converts it into a string which
is what it does right here and this is
how you get a value from an editable
text area you go get text and we're
going to convert it into a double and
then we're going to come down to final
bill and we're going to calculate that
by just taking the total bill times the
tip amount and then adding that back to
the total bill and then if we want to
set text to the final bill editable text
area which is this guy right here all
we're going to do is list the name for
that editable text area call set text on
it then we're going to convert it into a
string and format it so that it only
has two digits in regards to decimal
places and fills the rest of the area
with zeros and that is basically all
we're going to do with that guy just
wanted to review it real quickly then we
can come down inside of here to where I
made all the changes last time and you
can see here is the seat bar change
listener we're going to be creating a
whole bunch more of those guys then if
we come up inside here the very first
thing I'm going to create is the set up
intro check boxes so I'm going to copy
that and of course in the last part I
went and initialized all the check boxes
so that we will be able to go in and
both get values from them as well as set
them so let's just scroll down inside
here so create all that stuff and this
looks like just about as good of a place
as any to start so I'm going to go
private void set up intro check boxes
and I'm just going to add change
listeners to these guys so that I will
be able to make changes to the tip
amount anytime there are changes in the
check boxes so we're going to have to
come in here first thing I'm going to do
is set up a change listener for the
friendly check box and to do that you
just go set on checked change listener
and then I'm going to go new and there's
a whole bunch of different ways to set
up these change listeners this is just
one of them and as the tutorial
continues I'll go over other were
different ways of doing it just wanted
to give you something here that you'll
be able to use right away and then you
just go change listener and of course
you don't have to memorize all this
stuff just get the code and copy and
paste it and at the end of this put a
little curly brace go like that and then
put a semicolon we're going to do all
this in line and of course make sure
this is an uppercase o and then it's
going to say add unimplemented methods
and we're just going to copy that and
it's going to throw this in here so now
basically we have to decide what exactly
we want to do when our check box is
indeed checked and what I'm going to do
is remember way way way way back here or
is it right here where I created check
list values this is going to just hold a
whole bunch of values that are going to
change depending upon check boxes being
clicked two radio buttons being clicked
and all those other different things and
in a minute here
I'm going to show you exactly how we're
going to be interacting with that to be
able to calculate a new tip so back down
inside here again alright so here we got
checklist values and I'm just keeping
this extremely simple what I'm going to
do is just say in the first array area
if the friendly checkbox is checked this
is how you check if it's checked well
then the ternary operator is going to
say for me assign the value of four if
it is checked and otherwise assign the
value of zero to that array and then
what I'm going to do after that is now I
have to calculate the tip using the
waitresses new checklist options and to
do that I'm going to go set tip from
waitress checklist and I'm going to
create that a second here actually I'm
going to copy it because I'm going to
create it next and then after that is
set up I'm going to go update tip and
final fill which is the very first thing
I showed you at the beginning of this
tutorial so now after that what I'm
going to do is come down here and set up
the tip from waitress checklist this guy
right here so we're going to go private
void setup from waitress checklist it's
a little bit of a mouthful and then I'm
going to go create an integer here it's
just going to be checklist total it's
going to be equal to zero then on what I
need to do is cycle through all the
checklist items or checklist values and
then I'm going to check checklist total
and just add all those values up inside
of it and there that is and after I have
all those set what I need to do is set
the tip amount to the editable text area
and how you do that is go tip amount
editable text set text I'm going to
string format this again and I'm going
to say all right well I want this to be
have two digits and fill up the rest of
the space with zeros and then I'm going
to take check list total and on top of
that at the end of this I'm going to
multiply that times 0.01 which is going
to give me a tip amount or a percentage
okay so now that I have that set up and
come back up here and handle the rest of
my check boxes so basically if we scroll
back up here again we come to our check
box area here we are I have the friendly
check box the specials check box and the
opinion Chuck box this is pretty easy
once I
one of these set up the way I'm going to
handle this is I'm just gonna come in
here inside of this and do this in line
again I'm just gonna copy this paste
that in there and then I'm going to call
this specials checkbox don't have to
change anything else this is gonna have
to be set to one I'm gonna change this
to specials checkbox and in this
situation if they tell me about the
specials I'm going to give them one
percentage more in their tip and if they
don't I'm going to give them nothing and
everything else can be set up exactly
the same way and now to handle the
opinions being if the waiter or waitress
gives me their opinions on what I pick
and here I'm just going to change this
to opinion check box and change this to
opinion check box change this value here
to two then if they give me their
opinion I'm going to give them two
percentage more tips and if not I'm not
gonna give them anything and everything
else could be exactly the same so that
is how extremely easy it is to handle
events on check boxes and Android so now
what we want to do is I'm actually what
I'm doing is looking here at these
little red dots here and that's how I'm
deciding where I need to go to fix these
method calls and here is add change
listener to radios so I'm just gonna
copy that scroll all the way back down
here again and I'm gonna handle those
events that are going to be called by
those guys those radio buttons whenever
they're clicked on void add change
listeners for radios and then what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna set all the
listeners on the radio group and then
handle them all here in one situation or
one little space here so I'm gonna go
available radio group because the radio
group surrounds all of the radio buttons
and we're just going to type in set on
check change listener and then we're
gonna go new on make sure that's capital
well checked change listener closed that
off there put a curly brace inside of
there closing curly brace right there
and it's limit : and then this guy's
gonna say any Dada unimplemented methods
do that for me and there is the only
unimplemented method which is unchecked
change and here I'm gonna use the Java
ternary operator again just like I did
before just to keep this nice and simple
so I'm just gonna come up here and copy
this guy come back down inside of here
paste it in
that three actually I'm going to do
three of them because I have three radio
buttons so that's going to be four and
that's going to be five and then these
are going to change to available bad
radio and if they were a bad waitress
I'm going to subtract one from their tip
gonna copy this paste that in there
paste that in there
and then if they were an okay waitress
put that there and then here handle if
they were a good waitress leave that set
is two and zero and then said this is
four and zero and then I have to do
exactly the same things I did before I
need to update my tip so I'm just gonna
copy this and then update my tip in my
final bill and I'm just gonna bounce
down here paste that in there and save
and that is how you are able to handle
events for radio buttons inside of a
radio group so let's save that and then
we're gonna scroll up here again to the
next method we're gonna have to handle
and this time we're going to handle the
spinner or the drop-down box so I have
to create this guy and here of course is
where I initialize the spinner which we
talked about in the last part of the
tutorial just scroll way down here again
and once again I'm gonna go private void
add items selected listener to my
spinner gonna do this in line again
problems spinner here I'm gonna go set
on item selected listener and then
inside of here go new on item selected
listener see looks the same again put a
curly brace in there come down here put
a semicolon of course it's gonna say I
need to add unimplemented methods just
click on that so you don't have to
memorize anything and I set the code up
so you could use it sort of like a cheat
sheet anyway so you wouldn't be able to
use these things and you can see here on
nothing selected I'm actually going to
ignore that altogether and instead I'm
going to focus on on items selected and
change this guy right here and then
guess what I'm gonna do I'm going to use
the ternary operator again so I'm just
gonna copy all these down in here paste
that in there and if they pick the first
second or third option
inside of my spinner are my drop-down
box I'm going to handle those and to
check which option was actually selected
from those guys we're not going to use
is checked we're instead going to use
get selected item and that's going to
return to me
whichever item they actually selected
and then after that I'm going to go
equals and see if it equals bad and if
the waitress was indeed bad we're going
to again give her a negative one on our
tip and otherwise it's going to be zero
and here to make this a little bit more
simple I'm just gonna copy that all
together paste that in there paste that
in there just like that and then now I
can just come in here and say alright
did they provide okay I can't remember
what it is I think with service or
availability if yes it's going to be
three in there tip otherwise I'm going
to set it to zero and if they provide a
good service I'm going to increase their
tip by six and otherwise this is going
to be set to zero and then what I need
to do why all I need to set up my tip
properly for the waitress and then
update my tip and my final bill just
like I did before so there that is file
save and then that leaves me if I bounce
over here so we got the checklist all
set up we have the radio button setup
and the spinner so now I have to make
the chronometer actually work like a
stopwatch which requires a little bit of
work so we're going to come up here
again and there we are so we're going to
set our button click listeners and then
whenever the buttons are clicked on and
when I mean buttons I mean start pause
and reset they are going to change the
chronometer so I'm just going to copy
that
scroll way to the bottom and this time
we're going to do something a little bit
different so if I want to add my click
listeners for my buttons I'm just going
to go private void again and here set
button on click listeners it's just the
name I gave it and then I'm gonna go
start chronometer button set on click
listener do this in line again
on click with a capital L listener right
like that throw curly brace in there
like that
throw a semicolon at the end and of
course it's going to say I don't
implemented methods no problem there we
go now I have to handle what exactly is
going to happen when the start button is
clicked on so pretty simple well the
very first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to create an integer here and it
is going to hold the total number of
milliseconds that a pause lasts so if
they hit start and a hit pause it's
going to save that amount I'm set this
to zero
because start has been clicked so we
need to start storing milliseconds again
for
future date but can be set back to zero
for now and if I want to get my string
from my chronometer just go string
I'm gonna go chrono text time waiting
chronometer and if I want to get the
text that is inside of the chronometer
just go get text and I'm gonna have to
convert it into a string and now that I
have that string
I can go string ring convert it into an
array by going chrono text and calling
split on it and it's going to come back
with a colon between the different
numbers for the chronometer and just so
you know what I mean I mean this is the
chronometer this thing down here it's a
0.0 it's kind of little you're gonna see
it in action here in a minute and then
what I need to do is take all these
different parts in the array and figure
out which ones stand for seconds and
which one stands for minutes so to do
that I can just go array length if it's
equal to 2 that means I'm going to be
dealing with seconds going by instead of
minutes going by and if I want to
calculate the number of seconds that
have gone by I'm going to assign stopped
milliseconds and go integer parse int
array which is gonna represent
milliseconds and multiply that times 60
math and stuff and then just go plus and
then I'm gonna go integer parse int
again just come down here and then this
is going to be array 1 which is going to
represent my seconds close that off and
then multiply the whole thing times a
thousand so that's how I'm gonna be able
to figure out the seconds and there we
go and then else I'm just going to
assume we're only gonna be dealing with
minutes here else if the array length is
equal to 3 in that situation I'm gonna
find the number of minutes and I'm gonna
do sort of the same sort of thing so I'm
just gonna copy this paste that in there
and stop milliseconds maybe wasn't the
best of names but either way it works
for this then here I'm going to multiply
this time 60 and then multiply at times
a thousand plus jump down here multiply
times 60 times 1,000 and then finally
add on integer parser a and then change
this to 2 and then multiply that times
so that's just calculating minutes and
seconds and all that stuff so now that I
know how many minutes and seconds that I
have what I'm gonna need to do is
calculate the amount of time that has
elapsed since the start button was
pressed - the time that we were paused
and to do that I'm just gonna go time
waiting chronometer and I'm gonna set
the base call system clock get the
elapsed real time and then subtract from
that the number of milliseconds that I
was paused after I hit start so that's
what that does that confused you this is
you know the math stuff so don't really
worry about it just a cool added feature
I wanted to put inside of here and then
after that what I want to do is set the
number of seconds that I have been
waiting for a waitress to come to my
table to fill my drink or do whatever
and I'm going to set this for seconds
you wait obviously in the real world you
wouldn't expect a waitress to be at your
table in 10 seconds but I'm setting it
this way so that we won't have to sit
and wait 10 minutes to see the results
of waiting so if you wanted to actually
change this into something usable you
would use minutes instead of seconds
which would be a ray - and I'm actually
gonna save this above so it's copy that
scroll way up here down in here
somewhere
seconds you waited no okay I already did
that in the last part of the tutorial I
forgot so just change that to seconds
you waited and then after that I'm going
to go update tip based on time waited
and then inside of there put seconds you
waited it's going to be minute you
waited then what I'm going to need to do
is eventually create update tip based
off of wait time and then also since we
are still dealing remember this was all
about what are we going to do when they
click on the start button for the
kilometer so after we do all those
different things I need to actually
start the chronometer so that actually
runs and to do that you just call start
on it so that's extremely simple and
then I'm going to create this guy the
update tip based off of time waited
right now and remember it's gonna get
seconds you waited so let's just copy
the whole entire thing and it bounced
down here
gonna go private void update tip time
waited time second she waited and this
is a long remember and then what I'm
gonna do is go check list values and in
the nine spot believe that's what it is
cut it out of that abetted uh yes
checklist values and there that is and
I'm gonna do another ternary operator on
this guy so I'm just gonna copy that
scroll back down here except this is
going to be considerably less
complicated in here I'm just gonna go
seconds you waited and here I'm going to
say if you waited more than ten seconds
you're gonna talk or tip again don't get
mad at me I'm doing this just so it's
quick
so she if you wait less than or more
than ten seconds she gets to taking off
her tip if you don't she gets to added
or two and then what do I need to do
well I'm going to save that now I need
to update the tip amount and then I need
to update the final bill so I'm going to
copy that again come back down here
again and save it and that leaves me
with just figuring out what I'm gonna do
whenever the pause and the reset buttons
are clicked pretty simple stuff so here
actually rather than cut now I'm gonna
copy this and that is going to be it
because I don't want to copy all this
other stuff so this time we're gonna
handle pause what happens when the pause
button is clicked on wrist this can all
stay the same like that put in that okay
so that's all set up and then of course
it's going to want my unimplemented
methods and there we are and there that
is don't need all this space and then
it's gonna be extremely simple to handle
what we're gonna do whenever the pause
button is clicked on all we're gonna do
is send a message just like we did here
time waiting chronometer actually just
copy that whole entire thing if we want
to stop or pause the chronometer from
ticking we're just going to call stop on
it that was pretty easy and then if we
want to reset it I'm just gonna copy
this whole entire thing bounce that in
there and then call reset chronometer
button and I'm just gonna go to time
wait and chronometer and if I want to
set it back to zero I'm just gonna go
set base system clock elapsed real time
and there we go and then if I want to
set my time counter as well for the
number of seconds you were forced to be
waiting
for the waitress to zero I'm gonna do
that and that is it all of our code has
been done so let's savor thing jump over
here make sure save everything and
execute and here is our tip calculator
and if I come in here and say change
this to $12 and the tip here is set for
zero and of course all that stuff still
works and you can see final bill change
as it goes on the screen but as soon as
I would come in here and type in
friendly it's automatically going to
change the tip amount if they also
talked about the specials give their
opinion provide good availability you
can see that that is all going up here
is our drop-down if they were good at
problem-solving 17% and then you can
also see here with the chronometer if I
hit start it's going to start
calculating the number of seconds that I
need to wait and remember this is set
for 19 that I set this for 10 seconds
that I was willing to wait now watch 19
here because I'm gonna hit start right
here and see how I dropped down by for
all the reason why is they lost that
part of their tip because it took them
more than 10 seconds to get me my food
or whatever and then of course the pause
works as you can see start again works
and there it goes again pause and then I
can hit reset it goes to zero so there
are a whole bunch of different things
you can do with Android hope you have
fun with them please leave any questions
or comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
