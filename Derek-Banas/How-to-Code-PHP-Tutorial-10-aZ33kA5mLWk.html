10 of my how to code PHP tutorial today
I'm gonna go over completely how you
would create a user account activation
script there I'll show you the code that
will allow a new user to activate their
account obviously you're going to need
to connect to the database and include
all the HTML needed see my first how to
code PHP tutorial for that information
I'm just going to include the PHP code
for the activation script to keep the
article brief though this code creates
the account and then sends the email
that the user will click to get their
activation page just to make you 100%
clear exactly what an activation script
is the above functions are used to
generate a random number that the new
user must have to activate their account
in essence this function creates a 32
digit random number here we create a
query that inserts all the information
into the database the function MySQL
query submits the query to the MySQL
server for us if there is a problem an
error is triggered and a message is
printed to the screen here I'm testing
that a row of data has been added to the
database here I'm creating what will be
the string of text that goes in the body
of the email we are sending the new
customer we're placing a link to our
activation page in the body of that
message the function lies SQL insert ID
will return the primary key for the last
row access to in the database the mail
function then sends the email to the new
customer when the customer gets the
email they will click the link inside
and have their account activated by the
following code remember X is the primary
key ID for the customer's new account
here were accepting the values x and y
and checking that they both have been
set with a value if they have we're
forcing value of x to be of type integer
with this code that I have the
characters int surrounded by brackets if
the variable X wasn't sent we assign it
the value of 0 we perform the same
actions on variable Y as we did with
variable X in this code then we're
checking that the pass code assigned to
the variable Y is 32 characters in
length because we know that is the
length the number we set we create the
query that will change the value of the
SQL column named active
if the passcode matches the passcode of
the primary key we were sent the
function escaped down as Strix out extra
slashes in whitespace I describe it in
more detail in a previous PHP tutorial
if the query was successful we print a
message or learning the visitor to that
fact if not we print an error here we
redirect the visitor to the index dot
PHP page or home page of the site and
the script continues on to the next
slide that is all that goes into
creating a user activation page hope you
learned a lot and hope that you found
this script useful if you have any
questions leave them in the comment
section below
in part 11 of the how to code PHP
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
create automatically updating multiple
drop-down boxes sounds kind of
complicated but it's quite useful and
it's really not that complicated when
you keep down to it till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
