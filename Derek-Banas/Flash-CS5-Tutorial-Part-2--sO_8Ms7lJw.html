teach you everything there's a know
about flash with the final goal being to
teach you how to do cartoon animation
with flash today I'm going to focus on
the text tool in flash cs5 we now have
what is called the text layout framework
which is just fancy words for basically
the fact that it comes with a whole lot
of different options many of which you
will never use first you should
understand to create a fixed text box
you need to click and drag after
clicking on the text tool in the tool
bar and once you do this this area will
remain fixed no matter how much text you
put in it I'm going to dump what's
called lips them into this text box and
as you can see even though the text
continues it does not make the box
bigger however if I was to simply just
click with the text tool this will
create a variable length and as you can
see right there but I'm going to just
stick with the fixed length here right
now at the moment to demonstrate a whole
bunch of things to it so I'm just
cutting and pasting that text back in
there I'm going to go ahead and select
all and of course you can define whether
your text is going to be selectable
which means whether you want people to
be able to copy and paste it or have it
be read only or have it be editable and
you would use editable if it was in a
form and with this little guy here you'd
be able to define the orientation being
either horizontal or vertical like to
show you exactly how that would play out
here you would define any fonts that you
would want to use and if you scroll way
up to the top you can see right here
what are called the feist fonts and
these would be used if you want to
guarantee that your fonts going to look
the same everywhere that you would use
it but you could also guarantee that by
using the embed tool now if you would
want to embed this font meaning you want
to guarantee that this font is going to
be seen exactly the same on every
computer you would click on that embed
button and you have the option to be
able to actually literally embed every
single possible character you would
almost never do this you don't want to
do this because it will dramatically
bloat the size of your flash files so
what you need to understand is if you
mainly use uppercase and lowercase
letters well then just choose uppercase
and lowercase letters if you mainly use
uppercase and lowercase letters and
numerals just click on that as well you
can go in
punctuation but you almost never want to
use all because what this will do is
it'll draw a vector version of every
single character and that's going to
make your flash files extremely large
but that is how you would be able to
embed them and then obviously you can
increase your size just by clicking and
dragging right here till it's the
perfect size for you letting refers to
the distance between lines this is kind
of a font tutorial as well and tracking
plays with the distance between
characters it's all the only difference
that you have right there kerning you're
almost always going to leave as Otto
Kern and that's actually a reference to
tracking that is font specific hopefully
hopefully that makes sense for you you
can also choose the color that you wish
to use and under anti-aliasing you can
see here use device fonts you would use
that if you want to make sure it shows
up nicely on every single the different
type of device even mobile devices if
the readability of the text is of the
most important versus the overall
ability to animate the text you're going
to have to make that decision on your
own what's more important animation or
readability normally readability is
going to be the choice so I'll just
leave it right there rotation will also
rotate your letters on a different way
this is also another tool that you'll
almost never use and of course you have
the ability to underline strikethrough
toggle superscript and so forth and so
on if you would like to provide a
specific length so that when someone
clicks on your text they would go to a
certain part of the Internet this is
where you would provide that you could
also automatically make every single
letter here uppercase by just simply
coming in here and clicking on that tool
or force everything to be lowercase and
multiple other different things are
available you can also do similar things
with numbers and also play around with
how numbers are displayed and in regards
to width break will define exactly how
you want to utilize new lines and
baseline shift will define how much
space you want to show in your text box
either at the very top of the text or
the very bottom of the text again
another tool that you more than likely
or not going to use very often the
alignment tools I'm sure you're well
aware of but also there's flash comes
with the ability to justify this type so
that we
can automatically have all the text
stretch out and fill the box which some
people like to do and down here next to
text justify you can actually define how
you want these spaces to be placed so
that you can justify your text whether
you want additional space between the
words or you want additional space
between each letter by default most
people are going to use word spacing and
whatever you do do this justification
you want to define exactly how you want
to last line in your text box to be
justified so you can see right here if
we come in and justify left or we can
have the last line centered and that's
all this guy does is pretty much defines
exactly what to do with the last line
that you have in your text box i'm just
going to undo out of this until we get
back to where we were and i'm also going
to change my font to something that's a
little bit easier on the eyes there you
go you can also define margins I'm sure
you understand that you can go left or
right in those margins you can also
define how much you indent at the
beginning of paragraph or how much
spacing you want above or between
paragraphs right here with this tool
already went over text justification and
then you can also define whether you
want this to be a single line or a multi
line which is more like what you're
going to do and you can also to find
whether you want this text box to be
broken up into columns and then how much
padding you want between those different
columns and also define how much padding
you would like to add to the text box
itself now as you can see here there's a
little box it's a red box here on screen
and basically what that's telling you is
that your text is overflowing how does
what it means whenever you have this
little red box here well in flash you
can actually define another text box
it's very very easy to be able to make
the text continue on into this text box
all we got to do is come over here
select this click on this guy and a
little chain link will show up on your
screen and if you click in there it's
automatically going to continue flooding
the text into this new text box but we
still see another red box so we're going
to come over here and create another
text box
come back to the previous box click here
and click in here and it's going to
continue to distribute the text until it
runs out of space so that's pretty much
all the different things you can do
inside a flash now of course if you are
not going to be able to guarantee that
the viewer of this text is going to be
using a flash 10 movie player you would
then want to jump back and go back into
classic text up here and that just
basically is going to mean that you have
less options available to you so that
was part two of my flash cs5 tutorial if
you have any questions or comments leave
them in the comment section below so
