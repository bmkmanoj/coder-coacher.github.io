8 of my how to code PHP tutorial in this
tutorial I'm gonna walk you through how
to create a example login script that
you can use on your website here we
continue our adventures in how to code
PHP if you haven't seen my previous how
to code PHP videos you should do that or
you will be completely lost I'm also
going to skip all of the HTML that would
normally be included so I can keep this
video brief I use the same HTML on all
of these script pages that I used in the
previous PHP tutorial so refer to that
for the rest of the code or refer to new
think-tank com to download all of this
code here I'm opening a stream so that I
can easily communicate with the server
for more information on this refer to
the previous PHP tutorial I'm creating a
session and connecting to the database
by pulling in the code in the file
config dot Inc PHP here's all the basic
HTML code you obviously will need to
fill in more content here I'm just
providing this basic information so that
you can understand how I laid out the
overall page here I'm checking if the
form has been submitted if it is I'm
checking if the visitor entered an email
address with the empty function if they
did I store that email address in the
variable named e if not I tell them that
they forgot to enter their email and
assign the value of false to the
variable e I'm performing the same
operations I did with the email address
except here I'm validating a password
here I'm making sure they entered a
value for both the email and password if
they did I create a query to send to the
database it will get me all of the user
IDs and first names from the table users
that have an email and password equal to
the one entered and an active account
the function sha is used in SQL to
encrypt the password I then assigned the
results of the query to the variable
result or alert the visitor to any
errors that occurred the if statement is
checking that just one result was
provided we only want one account for
each email address setup MySQL fetch
array takes the results of the previous
query and stores them in an array named
row MySQL free result is used to free up
the memory being used by the result
variable this is used to keep everything
running as fast as possible you should
always do your best to free up resources
on the server when they're no longer
needed the goal here is to turn you
to a good and not just an okay PHP coder
we no longer need the database either so
close the connection with the MySQL
closed function then I store the values
of the first name and user ID variables
to the session variables for useless
here I'm defining where I want to
redirect the user after everything
checks out when I use the key HTTP host
in the array server it'll return the
current page the visitor is on and PHP
self is the current script being run I
then delete any unneeded slashes from
the New York well I'm creating I then
add the name of the page and want the
visitor to be directed to being index
dot PHP and then I close the buffer and
quit the script if I couldn't locate the
visitor in the database or their account
hasn't been activated I alert them that
I thought if the variables erp contain
no value the visitor would be warm too
please try again and here is the rest of
the HTML code that you would enter to
finish off this script I hope you
enjoyed part aid of the how to code PHP
tutorial better yet I hope you learn
something in the next presentation I'm
going to cover how to write a forgotten
password script until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
