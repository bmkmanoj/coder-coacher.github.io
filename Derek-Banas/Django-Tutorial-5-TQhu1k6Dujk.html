5 of my django video tutorial in this
part of the tutorial we're gonna cover
style sheets admin pages settings models
and a whole bunch more and just like
always all the code and a transcript of
the video is available in a description
underneath the video and I have a lot to
do so let's get into it okay so pardon
my voice I have a bit of a cold but I'm
gonna work through this don't wanna hold
off too long and making a new tutorial
now basically aside from HTML that is
defined in your templates you're also
going to need images JavaScript CSS for
generating your web pages and we're
going to be storing those in our static
directory which we're gonna have to
create so what you're going to want to
do is make sure you're in your polls
directory and then you're going to
create another directory called static
then inside of that you're gonna create
another directory called polls and then
you could see we'll have a directory
here for images as well as we will have
our style sheets stored inside of this
polls directory inside of the static
directory so now what we're gonna do is
we are going to start styling our code
in the style dot CSS file that we have
created right here alright so you could
see on the right side of the screen here
is our list and I'm just gonna do some
very very simple style sheet type things
there so I'm gonna target our links in
our list and I am going to change the
color of them so just color and green
and that's it I'm gonna save that and
now what I'm gonna do is jump back over
into index.html and add my style sheet
by pointing to that static directory and
how we do that is we start off by a
curly bracket % load static let's
download our static directory and then
we just link to the code so we'll say
link relative is gonna be this is a
style sheet obviously type is gonna be
text CSS and then we need to reference
our file and how we do that is by
referencing static and then specifically
the file that we want
of the static directory and then close
that guy off and then close off my tag
and just with those couple changes
reload and you can see that now the
color is green instead of the standard
blue okay simple stuff now what we also
want to do is you're gonna want to go
into polls and go new and then directory
and you're gonna want to create a
directory called images and then inside
of this I have a repeating backgrounds
ping file and if I open this up you'll
be able to see it so static polls and
images and then here it is it's just a
bunch of little tiny squares nothing
that's that big of a deal just go on any
website and get a repeating background
and throw it inside of there so to use
it I'm going to go into style dot CSS
and I'm going to go body background I'm
gonna say use white if you can't find it
and inside of this I'll just point at
images and background ping file and save
that reload this and now you can see
there is our background image it's a
bunch of little tiny squares okay so
that's just the way it to import images
now I'm gonna jump over into my admittin
page which is in polls for it slash
admin dot py to show you some ways you
can customize that so there is the
current admin page and I can come in
here and it men and there that is all
loaded up there on our screen and you
could see how everything is all set up
can also see that I targeted the
question part of the admits come in here
and look at this and I basically just
said that I want the question to be
loaded in on our screen right there and
specifically if you click on the
question that is going to show first our
question as well as the publication date
and all that other information now if I
want to change it so that the
publication date shows up before the
question what I'm gonna have to do is
come down here and put in question admin
like that and if I reload it you're now
gonna see the publication date shows up
and then the question I can obviously
make a whole bunch of other different
changes let's say that I want to break
up the data into blocks on my page I
could change this from fields into field
sets let's break this up more
to solve none and then I'm going to put
in fields followed by my question text
because I think makes a little bit more
sense to have that there first and then
I could have date information and fields
and here I put my publication date and
reload it and you could see where data
information shows up there to break up
the information you have inside of your
admin page likewise I could also set it
up so that the data information would
collapse I had to do that I would just
come in here and type in glasses
followed by collapse save that reload it
and there you can see if I click on show
it shows it Haida chart and it hides it
obviously there you go it also makes a
lot of sense for the choices for each
question to be on the page so we're
gonna add those in as well and to do
that we're gonna create a new class up
here I'm gonna call this choice in line
and I'll show you two different ways to
show this information on the screen
first we'll go stacked in line here
we're gonna define the model we want
tied to this obviously it's gonna be
choice and then we can also define how
many empty spaces show up under the
number of choices that are currently
being displayed but I think it makes
sense to just show one could obviously
show more and we're also gonna have to
import our model here so I'm an import
question as well as choice
now what we can do is come in here and
show this the choice information
directly inside of the question admin
page do that by saying in lines is equal
to choice in line and reload it and now
you can see the date information as well
as all the different choices as well as
a blank one for you to enter in a new
choice so you just say purple and then
click Save if you click on what's your
favorite color
Purple's gonna show up in there as well
as a new block that's gonna allow you to
add in an additional choice I will just
show you another way this is stacked in
line we can do it in a little bit neater
way and to do that we can call it we
call tabular in line instead reload it
and there you can see it's a lot neater
so that it doesn't take up a lot of the
page and previously we had admin site
dot register
and then choice inside of it of course
if you don't want choice to be an option
inside of the admin section just get rid
of that all together and it won't be an
option we could also come up here and
change the question list page to display
the date published and whether it was
recent or not to do that we go list
display is equal to question text
publication date and then was published
recently and now you could see it was
published recently shows up right there
and now I'll jump over into the models
section and show you some different ways
that we can edit this it looks a little
bit prettier on our screen
so here's models py and I'm just gonna
come down here right after we have the
return statement for that function now
let's say that you would like to sort
this information you have here on your
screen based off of the publication date
you can do so just it was and then you
go admin order field and then just to
find how you want it to be sorted and
there it is
all done another option is since we're
using bold Ian's here we could use a
prettier icon that's built into Jango
usable as published recently once again
and follow that up with boolean and true
and we can go and save that and reload
it you'll see how those all loaded up
right there we can also go in here and
change the description of the top the
table so let's say you don't like was
published recently well we can just come
in here and go was published recently
and then go short description published
recently and there you can see all that
change and now we'll jump back over into
the min part of the site make a couple
other changes here let's say that you
would like to add a filter box into your
admin section that's gonna allow the
users to sorts by the publication date
it is extremely easy you just come
inside here make sure you're still in
the question admin class here you get a
list filter is equal to pub date reload
it there you can see it showed up say
it's summon it's so easy to add a whole
bunch of different functionalities here
you could also add search capabilities
so we could say search fields equal to
and you want to allow them to search by
the questions there you go reload their
that option is you could type what into
there and we sort of show you up
questions that start with word one
and you could also come in here and
change the title for your admin page but
you have to do something a little bit
more complicated now you don't want to
open up your settings page and make a
couple changes inside of here where we
have templates specifically you're gonna
want to replace what's here where we
have directories you don't want to type
in OS path join and inside here base
directory and then point at templates
and we're gonna create that in a second
here that's gonna tell Django to look in
our templates directory so of course
that means we have to create a templates
directory so you're gonna want to create
this file right here this directory
right here called templates and then
create another directory underneath of
it called admin and then to actually
change the base template for your
application for the administer and you
need to find a file that is called base
underscore site dot HTML that is a
template we're gonna be using here to
edit the template for the admin page and
to find out where that is located
you're either gonna type the in Python 3
or Python - C import django print
django got two underscores path two
underscores close that off and then have
a quote and that's gonna tell you
exactly where it is located on your
system then you're gonna want to open up
that file and here is that file on my
system you could say it's exactly the
same it's gonna be different depending
upon you know whatever you got here so
you're gonna want to look for that
directory have here and then
specifically Django can trim and min
templates admin base site dot HTML you
have to hunt around a little bit and
you're gonna want to copy that guy so
select everything and copy it then
inside of the admin directories you just
created a little bit ago gonna right
click new and file and then inside of
here
I'm gonna type in the exact same name as
that file we just opened up so base site
dot HTML save that inside here you're
gonna paste in all of that code that you
just copy and there that is and then
instead of having Django Administration
inside of here let's say that we want to
have polls administration inside of
there instead it's actually very easy
change just come in right here and
select everything down to the closing of
the tag delete it and then type in polls
administration right like that of course
you have to restart your server run it
come over here
reload it and now it says polls
administration so there you go guys that
is how we can change a whole bunch of
other additional things and how to work
with static directories how to change
our bin page how to do a whole bunch of
different things and I completely
covered the entire Django building
tutorial from their site I'm planning on
making some additional django videos of
course that are gonna get more into the
specifics of how to do a whole bunch of
other different things hopefully my
voice wasn't too much of a mess and like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
