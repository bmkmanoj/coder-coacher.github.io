9 in my C++ video tutorials series you
guys asked for more complex topics in
this tutorial and today I'm gonna give
them to you I'm gonna cover lambda
expressions sort copy if for each
transform recursive lambda functions and
of course we're gonna have a whole bunch
of problems like always also like always
all the code as well as a transcript of
this video is available in the
description underneath this video and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
alright so here we are inside of
NetBeans of course you can use any other
IDE though alright so basically lambda
expressions are gonna make it easy to
perform list operations normally in one
line of code and so what I'm gonna do
here is I'm gonna use a function that we
created earlier which is generate random
vector and of course you can either go
and pause the video and type all this
out or you can get a code get all the
code it's in the description of course
so what I did here was I created an
integer vector called Veck fowl and I
generated random values inside of it
tend to be exact
between the value of one and 50 that's
what our custom function did and if you
haven't watched the previous tutorials
you probably should watch those
otherwise you will probably be confused
alright so what we're gonna do here
first I'm going to show you how easy it
is to go and sort a vector so I'm gonna
go and get my vector and I'm gonna give
it a reference to the beginning of the
vector and then I'm gonna give it a
reference to the ends of our vector and
that's going to be what it's gonna
operate on and then what it can do this
part right here is these square brackets
are going to designate the beginning of
a lambda expression and it's like a
function and anonymous function doesn't
have a name okay so it's going to
receive parameters just like any other
function might and in between curly
brackets it's going to perform an
operation and the operation I want to
perform here is what it's going to do is
it's going to cycle through all the
values inside of our list and then it's
going to check if one value is less than
the other value and then based off of
that it is going to sort everything up
and I see that I got a bug
here so let's go in and throw the curly
brackets where they're meant to be and
everything looks like it's fine now
let's get rid of that and we got this
closed up and that is closed off okay so
we can just do it that's it that's how
we're gonna sort this and we can go and
run it whoops I've made an error I
forgot to put the semicolon inside of
there to close off that statement all
right now we can run it
oops I guess I have to go and actually
print out the vector though first
alright so we're gonna go in here and
we're gonna print out all our vector
values so I'm gonna go Auto and I can
just throw in anything that I want
inside of here and back vowels and then
we can go and print out all of the
different values that we have inside of
here so value you know what I'm also
going to print out of the vector before
it was sorted just to prove the fact
that it indeed was not sorted prior so
then go like this and we can run it and
there you can see here is the vector
before it was sorted and then you can
also see the vector once again after it
was sorted so just that one line of code
this right here was able to go in and
sort all our values and of course if you
just go and switch out the direction of
this guy that's going to easily switch
out this one right here if this is
greater than instead that would allow us
to sort in the opposite direction so
just a very very simple expression here
or a lambda expression and now what I
want to do is show you another function
that's going to allow us to perform
operations like we would in other
languages whenever we use the filter but
in this situation we're gonna use a
function called copy if alright so
basically copy if like I said is gonna
basically work like filter does in other
languages like Python and what we're
gonna do is I'm gonna create a funk or
another vector and it's gonna be an
integer vector as well and let's say
that I would want to take a vector and
go and remove only the even values out
of it and I want to store them in and
another vector how would I do that well
I'm gonna come in and I'm gonna go
standard coffee if and it's gonna copy
things from one vector into another
vector if they meet a condition so
pretty cool stuff and it can be any
condition you can ever imagine so we're
gonna do once again all the parts that
we're going to cycle through and then
what we're gonna do is we are going to
perform this back inserter we're gonna
take a value and store it in our in our
new vector values even vector values
vector if it meets this condition which
is going to be defined by this lambda
expression so it's gonna cycle through
all those values temporarily store them
in the variable X and any situation in
which it returns a positive or true it
is going to store that value so we're
gonna say anytime that we have a
situation let's go throw a semicolon
here and then let's close out that guy
right there and then the rest of it's
perfectly fine so anytime this condition
right here is true it is going to store
that value that gave that true condition
in the even vector values so let's go
and change this to even vector values
and save it and run it and you can see
well we're going to print out all the
different values let's go and shut this
off here temporarily so we don't get
confused by this and throw that inside
there and run it again and you could say
that it took out only the even values
inside of there and of course it's not
sorted because I didn't run the sort
function on this if I run it again and
run it again you could say that it is
going to continue to just give us the
even values that it found inside of the
vector so you can go and play around
with that and see if you can come up
with other neat ways of messing around
with copy F and now I'm gonna show you
how to easily sum a list of values
inside of a vector okay so if we want to
sum these different values we're gonna
use a function that is called a for each
and it's gonna cycle through all of our
different values so I'm going to create
some right now and give it a value of
zero and then I'm going to call for each
of course and cycle through each of them
and you'll be able to do anything you
multiply you can divide you can do
whatever you'd like
all right so once again we're gonna go
vector values define the beginning of
where we're going to start working with
these values and vector values and of
course and then we're going to define
what we want to happen now we're going
to put an and symbol inside of here and
what that's going to do is allow us to
capture all of the variables used in the
body in the body of our lambda
expression by reference and we're gonna
go and receive a value from our vector
of course and then we're going to take
that value and add it to some and get
that inside of there and close off the
curly brace and throw this all right
here and then we can just come in here
and print out some just to see that that
worked see out and some and then the
some variable and there we go and there
we go and you can see the sum comes out
to 247 we can run it again and because
the vector values are going to be
randomized you can say that the sum also
changes all right so there we go I went
and showed you three different ways of
using the lambda expressions more coming
but I thought it would be interesting
now to go and cover a problem for you to
solve okay so basically what I want you
to do is remember whenever we went
through and we created a vector that was
just even's so we went and took all the
values that were stored inside of Veck
valves and we only got the evens well
what I want you to do is I want you to
create a dynamic list that is going to
be divisible by a value so I'm gonna
start it and then it'll be your job to
go and figure out the rest of it all
right so we're going to have a divisor
and we are going to go and create a new
vector which is going to be an integer
Veck vowels like this and I'm gonna call
it vecas - and then you're gonna ask the
user for what they want the list to be
divisible by so I'm just gonna say list
of values divisible by and we can throw
the end of that on there like that and
then of course you're going to ask them
for input so you're gonna receive that
input and store it in the visor like
this alright and this comes up to the
copy if part which I'm gonna see if you
can figure that out now the only major
change here let's just go and print the
previous copy if inside of here now if
you would want to get a divisor inside
of here to perform operation and
operations on it you would have to come
in here and go a divisor like that and
this is inside of what is called the
capture list right here and this just
allows us to go and bring in values
outside of here into here so that we can
perform operations on them so now what I
want you to do is to pause your video
and see if you can figure out what you
need to do the one change you need to
make to copy F to make it work with any
divisor pretty simple problem but give
it a go alright so basically real simple
all you have to just come over here and
go divisor the next problem would be
more complicated I promise alright so
there we went we put divisor inside of
there and we can come in here and we can
run this whoops
even vector values up you might have got
caught on that because I did
so let's come in here and change that to
vector values or actually you know what
you're gonna change it to Veck values -
of course and say well there we go and
then of course we're going to also have
to come in and print out all of these
values so I'm going to go Auto and Val
and Veck values - and then print it out
so print out each of those values and
there we are
alright so let's run it it's gonna say
list all values divisible by I'm gonna
put two inside of there and you can see
I got 46 8 and 26 let's run it again
divisible by and I'm gonna put 3 inside
of there you can see
got 42 I'll be running again and three
and there we go
and we could run this as many times as
we'd like to just to test out that it is
actually working let's see if we got
anything divisible by five yes we did
all right so pretty simple problem but
just wanted to start off simple the next
problem will be more complicated and now
what I want to do is show you how to
multiply all values and inside of a
vector and then go and store them once
again all right so what we're gonna do
is we're going to take all of the values
in vector value and then we are going to
store them in a brand new vector and
that is going to be called double vac
and let's come in and let's just change
this right now this is gonna be double
vac whoops
back there we are okay so we're gonna
use our old buddy
for each once again to come in here and
do this so we'll go for each and vector
values again we're gonna use exactly the
same thing see lambda expressions seem
real complicated whenever you first use
them and then you realize jeez they're
doing the same thing just about the same
way every single time just a couple
little things change again we're going
to want to access the values inside of
here so we're going to go and throw an N
symbol inside of there to get the
reference for that we're going to go and
receive an x value which is going to be
a value outside or from our vector and
then what we want to do is we want to go
double and Veck and push back it's how
we add values to our vector and we're
gonna take X from our vector we're
working with MECA values and then let's
go and throw a semicolon inside of there
a curly bracket and a parenthesis and
close off of that guy whoops another
ones snuck in there somehow it's gonna
get rid of that parenthesis there we go
and everything looks fine let's run it
and you can see it prints out goes and
multiplies all the different values by
four when we can get rid of this here if
we want to verify that it actually
worked so let's get rid of that
and run it and here you can see that we
have 29 and you can see we have 58 here
and there we have 40 and there we have
80 so you can see that it indeed doubled
all of those values so no other neat
things we can do with lambda expressions
and now what I want to show you how to
do is how to perform operations using
multiple different vectors what I want
to do is add values that are stored in
two separate vectors and then save them
into another one all right so what I
want to do here is I'm going to have a
vector I'm gonna just call this vector 1
and I'm going to go and give it one two
three four and five and if you have any
problem doing that that's because you do
not have C++ properly set up here I'll
show you how to do this I show you how
to do it last time but I'm gonna show
you again so we'll go into properties I
just right clicked on that and then
you're gonna come in here and you guys
C++ compiler and then make sure this is
set for version 14 of C++ a standard
equals C++ 14 cover that last time but
just wanted to cover it one more time
okay and let's go and create three more
vectors here so I'm gonna go get this
one and we can just go get this one
right here it will change this to two
we'll just let those be exactly the same
this is going to be vector three and
then I'm just going to go
give that values inside of that and then
what we're going to use here now
remember we're gonna add these values
together and store them in our brand new
vector that we have here and to do that
we're gonna use a function that we saw a
long time ago it's called transform so
vector one look at this we're doing the
same thing or again
alright sector 1 and vector 2 it's
amazing how much power you have doing
such similar things then what we're
gonna do is this is uh we're also going
to come in and go and get vector well
this is going to be vector 1 get out of
there
and then we're going to go and get a
vector to begin that and then we're
going to go and where we're gonna store
everything which is going to be vector 3
and of course we're gonna store that at
the beginning of that guy as well and
then we need to find what we're gonna do
so we are going to go and receive two
values so we'll have int X which is
gonna be the first value from our first
vector and then Y is going to represent
the other value inside of there and
we're gonna go return and it's going to
be X plus y which are going to be those
two values that we have there and then
we can close that guy off and then what
we're gonna do is print out vector 3 so
let's go and just steal this guy right
here throw it inside there
this is gonna be vector 3 of course save
that right there this automatically
throws these parentheses inside of there
alright so now I got all that set up and
we can run it and whoops got a little
bug inside of here odds this guy right
here didn't notice that for loop was
there let's save it again and there you
can see it went and added up those two
values or all those five values and then
store them inside of our vector and then
printed them out on our screen alright
so some neat stuff now what I want to do
is cover the ternary operator and how
that works doesn't have anything really
to do with lambda expressions but it
allows us to do other neat things with
lambda expressions and then we're going
to have yet another problem okay so
basically a ternary operator works like
a compact if-else statement
I'm gonna come in here and I'm gonna
define an age and I'm going to store one
value in a boolean doesn't have to be a
boolean can be anything can I vote is
what I'm checking so it doesn't have to
be a boolean so what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to say can I vote is
going to be equal to 1/3 or another
depending upon a condition so if the age
of whoever this is is greater than or
equal to 18 well that means that we want
to store true inside of can I vote
otherwise if the condition is not true
we want to store false inside of it now
we want to show true or false in our
output
don't know if you remember how to do
that I'm gonna show you again so let's
go set F standard iOS and Bull alpha
that's going to by default say that any
boolean is going to be displayed as true
or false instead of 1 or 0 and then
we're gonna go and print out our
information to show that this worked and
I'm gonna say kam Tarek votes and we're
gonna find out and I'm gonna say can I
vote and I'll put that information let's
see if I'm a lucky enough person to be
able to vote let's run it and you can
see a canned Erik vote comes back as
true all right so that's how a lambda
expression works and what I'm gonna do
next is I'm going to show you a
recursive lambda function that is going
to operate using a ternary operator okay
so in the last tutorial we covered
recursive functions and one of the
things we did was we generated Fibonacci
numbers so what I want to do here and
this is is show you how cool it is to go
and use a recursive function inside of a
lambda expression to also generate
Fibonacci numbers now Fibonacci numbers
or so let's say we have a function that
is going to receive a value of 0 it's
going to of course return 0 let's go
create a couple of these just refresh
the old memory here all right so if we
get a value of 1 it is going to return a
value of 1
and then we are going to take the value
here will we give it a value of two it's
going to say what it's gonna add these
two values together which is also going
to give us a value of one and then if we
add three inside of there it's going to
add the previous two which is going to
give us a value of two and if we go and
put four inside of here it's going to
give us a value of 2 plus one or three
and five is gonna give us a value of
five okay so Fibonacci numbers so what
we want to do is generate those using a
lambda expression and you're going to
see why I taught you about ternary
operators also at the same time so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to go
standard and function and int and we're
gonna receive an integer here close this
off and then we will have fib which is
we are going to actually be calling a
function on itself and how you can do
that is go and and fib once again inside
of here it's going to receive value N
and then we're going to have the actual
calculations that are going to be taking
place so I'm going to say return and if
the value is if the value is less than
two in that situation this is where
you're gonna see the ternary operator so
basically if the value of n is less than
2 we are going to return n otherwise
we're going to perform a calculation to
define our Fibonacci numbers so we're
gonna take n minus 1 and then we are
going to add that to fib once again and
n minus 2 and then we can close that off
and then we can close off our curly
bracket and then throw a semicolon
inside of there after that then go throw
this down to the next line just to save
that alright so that is how we are able
to create a recursive lambda function so
nice stuff now what we can do is we can
actually call this function inside of
here so let's say we wanted to go and
get the Fibonacci for the fourth index
how would we do it well we would go fib
and throw 4 inside of there and then we
would get or throwing
a new line alright so there we go we can
run it and you could see the Fibonacci a
value for the fourth index comes back as
three and if you're in any way confused
about how Fibonacci values are
calculated check out the previous
tutorial I cover them there in detail
and now what I want you to do for your
problem is to figure out how to generate
a list of Fibonacci values or a vector
full of Fibonacci values and you're also
going to allow the user to tell you how
many they want so what I'm going to do
is I'm gonna do part of the problem for
you and then you can go and pause the
video and try to work your way through
this so we are going to have a vector an
integer vector and it's gonna be called
list of fibs list of lies but whatever
okay so we're gonna go generate fib list
and here I'm just gonna put ten inside
of there so I'm gonna say that I wanted
to generate ten Fibonacci values alright
so we got that set and then we were
going to come in and we are going to
print them out so we're gonna go Val and
I went and left this guy here for you
just so you could use it however as a
reference so a list of fibs and then we
can just print all of those out so
Scouts and Val and uh and there we go
alright so what you can do is you can
pause your video and then figure out
what you're gonna have to do in this
function right here to make this work
alright so the function prototypes
pretty easy to figure out what we're
going to do is generate a vector of
course and it's gonna be an integer
vector that's what's going to be
returned and obviously the name is going
to be a generate fib list and also it's
going to receive an integer which is
going to be the max number of numbers
that are gonna be stored inside of there
there's actually a bunch of different
ways of doing this and if you want to
share your version of this function feel
free
to do so alright so what I'm gonna do is
come down here paste that inside of that
and go and create this so what do I need
to do inside of my function well I'm not
gonna try to get too complicated with
this so I'm going to try to stay pretty
straightforward so I'm gonna come in and
I'm of course going to create our vector
which is going to be to be our return
value and I'm gonna just call this list
of fibs as well and then I'm gonna go
and use a while loop so what does that
mean
that means that we are going to have to
have an index that is going to change
values and then inside of it I'm going
to go and get our Fibonacci values so
I'm gonna go standard and function oops
you know what I don't need to do that
I'm just gonna copy this guy right here
so let's go and copy this right here say
I said this problem wasn't that
complicated so let's just go and paste
that inside of there and then what we're
gonna be able to do is just generate a
while loop or create a while loop I mean
and we're gonna say while I is less than
max nomes
and throw this inside of here then we
are going to go and add values to our
list of fibs vector and we're gonna do
that with pushback and we can call fib
and whatever the value of I is and
that's what will be added to that and of
course we're going to also have to
increment the value for I as we do this
and then after we have all of those all
set up we're gonna be able to come in
and go return list of fibs and there we
go
and now we can test it to see if it
works let's go and run it and there you
can see that we got zero one two you can
see these are adding up and eight and 13
and 21 and 34 all right so there you go
guys there is a ton of information about
lambda expressions on a whole bunch of
other different functions that work with
lambda expressions do all kind of really
cool things and like always please leave
your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
