kato has released some software free
software that make my videos a little
bit more interactive and I thought I
would explore these tools today live
with you I haven't even played with them
all yet and let's just check out what's
going on here and you guys can give me
your opinion on what you think of it so
basically to install the software it
works inside a YouTube which is really
cool all you do is go to the Chrome Web
Store and that's at chrome google com
webstore category apps and then you're
going to type in in kato like that and
hit enter and you're going to see in
kato education pop up here on your
screen and you're just going to click
add to chrome and add extension and
there you go it's all set up you can see
over here in kato education has been
added chrome that's all you got to do
and close that now what's really cool is
we can go inside of here and we can load
reload what we have right here this
works currently with my learn to program
series and if we do so you're going to
see an advertisement pop up as they're
always great no we love them and let's
just skip past that and now what you can
do is you can click over here where it
says open topics and you can see
everything that is covered in the video
so that's kind of cool we can click on
all these different parts and you're
going to see that it automatically jumps
directly to that part of the tutorial
which is really cool another thing
that's really neat is questions can be
embedded directly inside of here so it's
quick click right here like let's say we
have a question about four loops and you
want to check to see if that questions
already been asked so this says do I
need to use I as the variable in the for
loop ok this is in beta so that you know
I'm just playing around here so what's
makes this really great is normally my
comment section looks like this it just
looks like a whole bunch of craziness
and what some people don't know is after
a month pretty much every question that
has ever asked too many questions what I
got here
254 now I answer every single question
that YouTube sends to me but youtube
doesn't send all of them to me as you
can see right here there are some
questions I haven't answered because
youtube doesn't send them to me so can't
do anything about that but what's really
neat here is let's say you want to
search through every single question
that it was ever asked you're going to
be able to click here and say something
like variable will type variable
correctly variable like that and
obviously variable is going to show up
right here and there you go and another
thing you're going to be able to do is
come in here and say something like does
hi charm work with linux I don't know
and click on ask and you're if you're
not registered you're going to have to
register on the website but all they ask
for is your name and a user ID obviously
and a password and an email so you know
and it's not a spam sites I don't worry
about that so then what we can do is I
can click here and it'll go exactly
where I have the question about inside
of all this stuff right here so that's
really cool so I don't know where this
is going to go problem solution okay
we'll just throw it there and we'll say
something like does PyCharm work with
linux linux and click publish and it's
going to go in there and now you can see
that question pops up down here does
PyCharm work with linux and you can
click on there and it's going to show up
and i could come in and give a great
response like yes like that click on
publish and then the question is going
to be answered now I'm going to be
playing around here trying to figure out
how to answer these different questions
like I said this is beta I'm playing
with this idea and Cato's playing with
this idea we're trying to figure out how
we can give you guys better tools to
work with because I mean can youtube do
this right here with question-and-answer
system and to be able to search through
the comments yeah I think you two
Google could probably figure out how to
do that the fact that they haven't done
it for a long time many many years
almost a decade tells me that they're
never going to so that's why I really
think this is kind of neat and all it is
is a Chrome extension away and it's
pretty cool and another thing is we want
to implement I mean they're not paying
me or anything just so you know that and
I really have nothing to do with it
except they've asked me questions and
I've given them my input so that's it
and they've a lot of the things that you
see here are things that I asked for so
that's kind of cool you know they're not
charging me and I'm not getting paid by
them or just sort of working together
and it's kind of a neat collaboration
that I really really like because you
guys probably know I don't collaborate
with anybody so um another thing we
don't have quizzes in here right now but
we do have quiz system over in in kato
so if we go to the website and Kato calm
and we look for the world's greatest
python tutorial up look at that air it
is and we click on that on this okay
there we are we got that all working out
and let's just specifically look at this
one this is the tutorial and hopefully
it doesn't start blasting in my ear oh
oh it did okay so let's just shut that
off what you're going to see down here
now is there's also going to be a quiz
section so we're going to be able not
only are you to be able to from the
website jumped all all the different
parts ah sorry about that not only we
going to be able to jump to all the
different parts here but we are also
going to be able to click on quiz down
here and you can be asked quizzes so
that's kind of neat another neat little
thing we can do which of these is valid
syntax to define a for loop and then you
go through here and you can just click
on any of them so let's just say i don't
know let's click on that
whatever or whatever whatever and then
whenever you get it to the end it's
going to tell you what you got right and
what you got wrong so another really
cool thing and you know we want your
input both in kato as well as I want
your input in regards to other cool
things we could do with this stuff I
just wanted to introduce you to it and
because I think you know this is maybe a
really great way that I could
dramatically improve my videos at no
cost to you know anybody so YouTube
isn't doing it these guys stepped up and
I wanted to point that opportunity out
to you guys so just like always please
leave all of your questions and comments
below both for me as well as in kato and
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
