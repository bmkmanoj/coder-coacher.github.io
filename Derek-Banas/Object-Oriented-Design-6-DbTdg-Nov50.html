my object or InDesign tutorial today I'm
going to create what I like to call
better sequence diagrams I'm going to
take the sequence diagram that I created
last time and I'm going to improve on it
dramatically and make it so that if
someone sees one of your sequence
diagrams they have no doubt exactly what
the final program should look like so
let's get into it okay so in the last
part of the tutorial this is the
sequence diagram that we created and let
me tell you this is normally the type of
sequence diagram I get it is a sequence
diagram that I don't consider to be
complete but this is normally what
you're going to get you're going to get
a couple random notes you're going to
get the main objects defined you're
going to have some references that bank
computer for example holds the account
object and you're going to get things
like that I don't particularly like
sequence diagrams like this and what I'm
going to show you in this tutorial is
exactly how I would change it to make it
a hundred percent
understandable to a programmer who would
be under me and whose job would be to
design this ATM software that we've been
working on so what don't I like about it
let's just move ourselves over here and
give ourselves a little bit of room okay
so there's a whole bunch of classes that
are missing one of them would be my test
class now very often that is never
defined so I'm going to call this test
ATM and this is going to be the actual
applications name and I'm just gonna
leave it here as a cyan blue another
thing that is missing also is a count so
I'm going to go and get myself another
one of these guys and I'm going to name
this account see my job here is to make
it so that you can make sequence
diagrams and understand pretty much any
type of sequence diagram you would get
and know how to make a sequence diagram
that anybody can look at and immediately
turn into a program without even looking
at use cases or anything else
another thing that wasn't defined is
card another guy that was created here
sort of was customer but customer wasn't
completed as well as I would have liked
and I'm just going to leave this as
orange then we're going to have Bank
computer which was sort of defined but
there were some
notes that basically said refer to other
things and I just don't like doing that
so I'm going to actually come in here
and actually define some things with
Bank computer Bank network that was also
not defined very well just some
references that everything that goes to
bank computer goes through bank networks
so I'm not very happy with that so I'm
going to make couple notes there and
couple changes and then I'm also going
to refer to ATM because pretty much app
everything after that is pretty good and
then the final thing that was not
defined is transaction what we were told
was transaction lies inside of ATM but
we didn't get any real specifics on
exactly what transaction did except for
a simple note notes are good but for the
most part it's much better if you can
just define everything straight outwards
now the first thing we're going to do is
going to test ATM and then we're going
to think about what our application is
going to need to do we're going to walk
ourselves through the whole process of
creating the application now a lot of
people say don't do this don't make
these complicated complete sequence
diagrams but I would disagree with that
because I would much prefer to hand
somebody something where they know
exactly what they're going to get rather
than come to me numerous times
thereafter asking me questions and I
think whenever you create incomplete
sequence diagrams that's pretty much the
type of environment you are inviting
yourself into so I know that toast ATM
is going to do at least four different
things so let's think about what those
four different things are going to do
well the very first thing it's going to
do is it's going to create an account
because we need an account before we're
going to be able to actually do anything
so let's just throw a count inside of
here and define how we're going to use
account on my whole idea here is I'm
going to create an account based off of
customer information and then that
information is later on going to be
passed into bank computers so of course
we don't have to create that and then
Bank network and then bank computer goes
into Bank Network and so forth and so on
so let's think about how we're going to
create the account and I'm just going to
come in here and define account which is
my constructor for my account object and
there's attribute and classes which I'm
going to have to define now I'm going to
have a bank ID and that's going to be an
integer because I'm going to need
information to be able to go into Bank
Network and then find Bank computer
every single object that is inside of my
computer is going to have a bank ID to
separate them what else am I going to
need I'm probably going to need a
customer name that's going to make some
sense based off of the usage case that
we did before if you're not quite
getting it just stick here with me
you'll get it by the end we're going to
need a count type because remember in
our usage case we said that they're
going to be able to access either
checking or savings and account balance
of course every single accounts going to
have to have a balance to know how much
money they can access and in that
situation that is going to be a double
and very often people type real in here
that is what you're supposed to type but
I think double is much better and then
also a pin so there's going to be all
the different things that we're going to
want to define whenever we create our
account constructor and then just to
make sure that everyone is well aware
that a create is going on here we're
going to be creating something new I'm
going to come in here and say create
account
so everybody is definitely positive an
account is being created well then what
do we need to do well we're going to
have to create a card and we have to
think about how we're going to create
card and what information needs to be
inside of card and this is going to be
much more simple we're going to create a
card this is the card constructor we're
going to be calling what do we need
well the account already has the pin
inside of it
say right here hen so why don't we just
go inside of there since it's already
created and already has the pin why
don't we just get it from there so I'm
going to say account get pin and there
we go now we know that that is going to
actually have to be inside of there and
that is going to be an integer and then
a count get strip number and there is
strip number and that is going to be the
number that is on the card so there we
are
well now you might be thinking about
okay well what type of information is
going to be stored inside of a count and
what is strip number exactly and
remember let's not forget to come down
here and say create card even though
it's obvious what the heck we just took
a half of a fraction of a second made it
a hundred percent obvious so I like to
come in here and actually think about
based off of the things we talked about
in our use case how exactly
we should create all these different
things account type based off of the
previous sequence diagram it basically
says a one for savings let's stretch
this out a little bit and this is just
going to be a little note attached to
account or a two for checking so now we
know that that is what it's going to be
that if that has a value of one account
type this guy right here and we also
know that account types going to be
passed as a letter so we could also put
another note inside of here that says
whenever you pass in a s or a string
that begins with S assigned one to
account type or C assign the value of 2
for account type but we'll get more into
that here in a second so we're going to
put in another little note this in
instructor so there we go so there's a
little bit more information it's going
to make it a little bit easier for us to
be able to understand what type of
numbers we have here but we need some
more numbers for example account number
what exactly is account number and how
is it going to be structured whenever we
create it well if I didn't tell the
programmer they're not going to know
account number is going to be equal to
the strip number with a one or two from
account type at the end so the strip
number is going to be the same for the
card and then if you want to create a
savings account based off of that card
which you see one for savings we're
going to strap a one at the end of the
strip number or two two for account type
to the end of the strip number if it is
a checking account and this comes from
the usage case as well and let's think
about some other things we need to think
about what is account number and how we
going to create account number I think
what makes sense is to say account and
I'm doing all this out of my head by the
way so if there's a if I miss anything
then don't murder me I on purpose waited
a couple days to go in here and recreate
this and I have the sequence diagram
that I originally created in the last
tutorial in front of me and I'm trying
to improve it so there we go so I'm
going to have an account number
incrementer inside here and that's going
to be a field name and it's going to
start off at 100,000 and increment when
you add a new account so that is going
to be the center all
every account number and then what are
we going to have we're going to have a
one or two if it's a checking versus if
it's a savings account so how are we
going to generate our strip numbers
which means we got to put another note
inside of here
I can see I'm running out of space over
here so let's put a little note in here
to help the programmer figure out how to
generate my strip number well I'm going
to say that generate strip number is
going to be a method inside of here and
it's going to get strip number by adding
Bank ID to this guy right here account
number incrementer right like that so
now we know where the strip numbers come
from the account number is the account
type and we also know about account
number incrementer and how it is going
to make sure that all the accounts have
a different number so let's give a
little bit more information again on my
strip number and I'm going to say strip
number remember strip number is going to
be the number on my credit card strip
number is eight digits and I'm going to
say the first one or the first two in
this situation is going to be the bank
ID and I'll just say the rest account
number - checking or savings code which
is that one or two so there we go now we
know a heck of a lot more about these
different fields that are going to exist
and all of these are going to exist
inside of account you can draw little
lines here too from these notes over to
account okay so now that we have account
created we've defined a whole bunch of
things or all the different things that
might be confusing inside of the
creation of the account and we've also
created the card now it's time to create
customer remember previously we go over
here there's nothing defined inside of a
customer except that this method right
here is going to be called and I don't
particularly like that so I'd like to
change it so I'm going to come in here
this should line up pretty well with
what we had previously set as a sequence
diagram now what's going to go on here I
like using a lot of the setup inside of
the constructor so I'm going to say here
customer and everything I'm doing here
is going to be available in a link
underneath the video if you want to take
a look at it really understand this
stuff I would say it's a good idea to do
that so I'm going to say customers ATM
card of type car
is going to be passed to this and I
think pretty much everything is going to
be able to be defined from that point on
and then what are we doing here
we're also going to create customer much
more understandable and then what is
customer going to do for us well it's
basically going to do what it did over
here and we're also going to know
exactly how this locks up take that and
everything else is defined pretty well
in the previous sequence diagram so I'm
just gonna let it like this I think that
works pretty well it's just going to
continue on I don't want to change
anything I don't want to change the
sequence diagram at all but there's a
couple things that I think just need to
be changed to make this understand
understandable okay so now what well
bank computer I'd like to shore up some
things here in regards to how is test
ATM or the actual application going to
create Bank computer and I can see here
already that I'm going to need a whole
bunch more of these guys so I might as
well just make them now I'm going to
take Bank computer over here and let's
define how the bank computers are going
to be created well what do you guess I'm
probably going to call the bank computer
constructor which is exactly what I'm
going to do so this is going to be Bank
computer and what am I going to pass
over to Bank computer well let's say I
want to have a bank name and I'm gonna
have to refer to those a lot can't think
anything else that I'm going to need so
Bank name is and for now that's the way
it's going to be and create that
computer and because the previous
sequence diagram pretty much defined
that the way the bank computer should
work I'm just gonna go grab myself a
little note throw it down inside of here
and I'm gonna say everything continues
as designed in first design after this
okay so I'm defining that I need a bank
computer I'm just walking through the
whole entire process of I need an
account I need a card I need a customer
I need a bank computer so that I can put
all these things together and they all
make a lot of sense well then what do I
need well I'm going to need Bank Network
because I'm gonna have to stick Bank
computer inside of Bank Network got that
guy over here and this guy was
previously completely disregarded I'm
going to grab this just to make sure
that anybody that looks at it can see
instantly what that is referring to okay
now how am I going to come in here and
create Bank Network and Bank Network I
can't think of anything that I need to
do with Bank Network so I'm just going
to create an empty constructor and close
it off
like that and then we can come in here
and go create my network and there we
are now well now what I need to do well
I'm going to since I've already created
my bank the bank computer I need to add
Bank network or add bank computer to the
bank network because it contains all
those so how exactly am I going to do
that
add wrong cell flow line over here so
now I'm going to define the method that
I want called whenever I want a bank
computer attached to a bank network
because the bank network contains all of
them and I'm just going to give this a
real logical name add bank to network
and it's going to be the bank and I'm
gonna pass the bank over pretty simple
and I don't need to put any types of
other notes there I think that's pretty
self-explanatory especially because it
points over to Bank Network alright so
now what do I need to do well I'm going
to need to create my ATM which is going
to be very important and already come
over here in the previous sequence
diagram and created ATM see and here's
all the different calls to ATM however
I'm going to be making these instead I
don't like the fact that this is set up
as customer doesn't seem to make much
sense to do it that way so instead I'm
going to set it up as the application
itself doing all this stuff so I'm going
to grab ATM and I'm just going to stick
ATM like over here and I'm going to
define exactly how my ATMs are going to
be created and I'm sure you can guess
ATMs are going to be created by calling
the constructor file and then what do I
need for my ATM well I need my Bank
network that's pretty much it because I
want all the banks that go into all the
bank networks and there's only one bank
network so I want that sent over and
stored inside of every ATM that I create
so there's that and this creates ATM so
there's no doubt that as a constructor
as well well then what do I want to do
with my ATM well is strip readable now
you can see basically over here is strip
readable is going to be called and then
what else is going to be called insert
pin well I don't like that quite yet
find Bank associated with card and I'm
looking at this older guy here and
trying to find ways that I can improve
upon it find Bank associated with card
and on purpose kind of mess this up a
bit just ready to have some things to
talk about
now fine Bank associated with card that
sort of sounds kind of okay but I would
much prefer is ATM cards Bank in network
it's just sort of I mean it's long but
it sort of makes a lot more sense so I'm
going to say I'm going to rename this is
ATM cards Bank in network because that's
exactly what I'm asking so I want to do
that and then I'm just going to leave
the card as it is then while I'm over
here
why don't I go and make up other little
changes like for example verify the pen
why am i passing over the card and the
pen what I think makes a little bit more
sense is to store that information
inside of the transaction and then pass
the transaction over to this guy and
that is exactly what I'm going to do
here so here let's say I want to copy
that verify the pen leave the name the
same however I've decided that I want
transaction to have more power so I'm
going to go transaction and the
transaction object is going to be passed
inside of there and let's put a little X
over top of it and then I could also put
in a note here and just to make the note
stand out a little bit better I'm gonna
change its color to yellow what I'm
doing is I'm sort of like showing you
things that I do changed method because
I think this makes a little bit more
sense now if I change that that way I
think I also I'm going to want to change
couple other different things and I also
feel like I want to put a little note
inside of here it sort of defines
exactly some things that I want to go on
inside of this method so I'm going to do
that I'm going to say check if the bank
computer Bank ID is equal to the
transaction Bank ID and then call verify
the pin in bank computer object if true
and verify pin and the bank strip there
so I'm defining inside of here some
things or changes that I want made
basically what I'm saying is this is
what I want banking network to do before
this information is passed over to the
bank computer see that's what I'm saying
so I want to make sure that Bank Network
actually has a job to do and does its
job well well now that I changed that
I'm probably also going to want to
change request withdraw amount and just
have the
transaction passed over to this guy
instead of also passing the card because
it doesn't make any sense to pass the
card and the transaction I'm going to
take this little X use it again some X a
town and I'm also going to say that it
changed the method on this so this is
sort of how to improve a sequence
diagram and of course how to write good
sequence diagrams from the beginning so
you don't have to go in and do this
again and then here what I'd like to do
is say check if the bank computer bank
ID transaction again and then I want to
say that I want to basically what I'm
doing is we're just verifying that the
ID in the bank computer is the same as
the ID that is inside of transaction
this is just sort of something that's
coming out of my head that I think makes
sense to check sort of a security thing
and then call request withdrawal amount
inside of the bank computer object if
true and then I want to verify that
enough funds are in account which is in
essence what I'm doing right here say
transaction amount account amount I'm
changing I'm checking to make sure that
there is enough money to withdraw so
then since I made all these little
changes here inside of this I guess they
weren't that little I'd also like to
come in here and do a couple other
things which is basically I'm just gonna
pay reference to the fact that hey you
know what I think that you guys need to
pay more attention to Bank Network and
not leave it out of the sequence diagram
I'm basically saying you know I'd like
to change a couple things here and this
is why I made the changes to the
sequence diagram cuz you don't want to
make changes someone's sequence diagram
without explaining yourself I'm gonna
say everything goes from ATM to Bank
Network and then to Bank computer and
I'm gonna say using the same method
calls or method names so that's
basically what I'm doing I'm just
shaping this up and I would normally go
in and completely recreate this whole
entire sequence diagram but because I'm
limited in time here I'm just gonna skip
that part
leave that to you for homework if you'd
like to do homework okay so now ATM has
been created what do I want to do now
well let's look over here makes a lot of
sense the transaction the object
transaction should be created inside of
the ATM which is where it normally would
be created otherwise so a lot of common
sounds pretty much going on here because
ATM would hold all this information in
regards to the transactions that go on
then I'm going to define how we're going
to create transaction well guess what
I'm going to call the transaction
constructor and what am I going to pass
the transaction constructor the strip
number should be more than enough
because that is going to be my current
card that I'm going to be working with
and then I'm going to say create
transaction because that's exactly what
I'm doing there
and I could also put in here a little
note where ATM is going to be able to
get the transaction or the strip number
I mean to help people along I'm going to
say get the strip number from customers
ATM card dot get strip number so that is
where that is going to be coming from
and way up here you can see inside of
this application you can see that I
created a customer and all the strip
number and all these other different
things are going to be stored inside of
it so now I know exactly how I'm going
to get strip number so that I can create
a new transaction and now ATM is going
to have a whole bunch of things that are
going to be going on because it makes
sense for ATM to have a whole bunch of
things going on I'm just actually going
to delete that because what's going on
in this program the customer is going to
be dealing with the ATM it's not going
to be dealing with any of these other
objects so it makes a lot of sense for
them to communicate with each other so
what sort of things are my application
going to have to say over here to my ATM
well the same things that we're already
said over here on the right side of the
screen in this transaction which is
insert pin that's going to be one of
them pick account to access that's going
to be another one amount to withdraw
then that is going to be another one so
let's copy those and move them over here
and this is done just purely to make
sure that everything is being covered
and I'm going to leave this exactly the
same and it pins being sent over pic
account to access and the amount to be
withdrawn and then the final part and I
could draw a little arrows inside of
here I'm actually going to need one more
of these guys and this one is going to
call the ATM and say I want all the
transaction information after you are
done with it and it's going to spit it
out on the screen and I can throw in
another node right down here to complete
this picture so there is a rundown of
exactly how
to sort of make a sequence diagram
that's a hundred percent understandable
while working with other sequence
diagrams that people made and some notes
you can make to make the sequence
diagram more understandable and just
some of the basic things that you have
to think about whenever you're creating
sequence diagrams in the next part of
the tutorial I'm going to show you how
extremely easy it is to take this now
ship shape awesome sequence diagram and
turn it into a class diagram leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
