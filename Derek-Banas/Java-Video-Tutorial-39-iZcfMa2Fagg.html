my java video tutorial series today I'm
going to cover the J editor pain which
is a really neat component that allows
you to pretty much do anything with HTML
inside of it and not only will it open
up these individual files this is just a
straight HTML file but to a certain
extent it will also open up web pages so
I'm just going to go usatoday.com
what you have to understand is it does
not understand CSS where it does to a
certain extent and it does not
understand JavaScript so that's the
reason why everything is all fouled up
here but we can scroll through here and
just click on randomness and it will
actually open up web pages inside here
it has no problem with HTML just has
problems with CSS I'll cover that later
on in the tutorial but let's get into
the code all right today I'm going to
actually kind of program the way I
really do so I'm just gonna go public
class Java class 139 extends jframe
since I'm going to be working with swang
I'm going to need to do this now I'm
going to implement hyper linked lists
under C all I have to do here is
remember that I'm going to want to be
working with hyperlinks and Java is
gonna go get me the right library and I
also want to track any events that are
triggered on any of my components in my
swing and I just hover up here to jframe
for example just go import jframe hover
over hyperlink listener click on import
if your linked listener and then hover
over action listener and click on that
and there you can see it went loaded in
all my libraries now action listener
like I said before is going to listen
for different events on components in my
little swing frame that I create jframe
creates the window or the frame whatever
you want to refer to it as hyperlink a
listener is going to monitor user
activity with any links that are clicked
on or hovered over inside of my J editor
pane that I'm going to be able to create
here and I'm just going to come in here
and go public static void main string
args right like this and then I'm gonna
go new Java lesson 39 and by default
it's going to open up a file which I
went and copied and pasted this wants to
type that out it's just a standard HTML
file as you can see there and all of the
code is available underneath this video
as well as this HTML file that's right
here and that is all I'm going to do is
call the constructor for this guy so of
course I'm going to need to create it
but I'm going to create some other
things I'm going to go string default
URL this is going to hold my default URL
we're going to be using I also know I
need a J panel and I'm just going to
call it tool panel and I say equals to
new J panel right like this and I'm also
going to need a text field the URLs what
I'm going to call it I'm going to say
new a text yield and I'm just going to
guess we're going to need 25 spaces
there and then since this is a J editor
pain tutorial now with that and they're
gonna call it HTML page now I can just
come in here like I did before go in for
J panel import jtextfield and import J
editor paint then I'm going to need to
create my constructor since I went and
created it here or called for it so Java
lesson 39 and I'm going to pass it a
string which is going to be default URL
whatever it's called and that's this guy
right here this file that we put in here
then what do I need to do well I need to
create a frame that's going to open up
everything on the screen so I'm gonna
call that J frame is equal to new jframe
I'm just going to call this Java browser
I don't want you to think of this as
being limited in that it doesn't work
with CSS and JavaScript think of it
instead it is a lot more powerful than a
jtextfield because it allows you to do
HTML editing that's the way to look at
it glass-half-full close operation
jframe exit on closed ándale closing it
whenever they click and say they want to
get rid of it then we go this default
URL is equal to the default URL that
this was passed then I need to figure
out what I want to do with my text field
or how I want to call up my web page is
well what I decided to do the text
fields called the URL so I'm going to
say the URL and I want to add an action
listener to it and that just basically
means that I want to be alerted whenever
somebody interacts with my text field
area and then I can just say this which
is a reference to this object that we've
growing in here I'd also like to have
some default text in there so let's say
set text to whatever default URL is
again that's for my text field then I'm
going to go tool panel don't add the URL
I'm adding this to a panel even though
it is an individual component just
because I plan on maybe adding a back
button or a forward button or whatever
to this guy and it just makes sense for
me to do that so I'm going to go frame
then
and this is the window itself I'm going
to say toll panel and where do I want it
to go I wanted to go in the north part
of this border layout now of course it's
going to say oh but you forgot to bring
this in so I'm just going to go import
border layout and I like to list all of
my libraries that I'm using some people
don't you do whatever you want well then
what do I need to do I'm going to create
a try block here for myself because I
have to create all kinds of different
interactions so that my J editor pane is
going to have the URL that I want to
display inside of it so I'm going to go
HTML page which is the name for my J
editor paint default URL is the string
that I'm going to pass to it then I have
to handle what happens whenever the user
interacts with this J editor paint so
I'm going go h TM l
and I'm going to add a hyper link list
Center to this guy and this is going to
automatically handle and the interaction
that is done with my J editor pane in
regards to hyperlinks which means
basically it's going to take them to
whatever page it says next since I'm
going to be working with web pages that
I am NOT going to edit somewhat I'm
going to set editable to false if this
is set to true and you go to a regular
website page all kinds of havoc is going
to ensue however if you have access to
the page you're working with of course
you could set this to true and then
since I want to be able to scroll
through the guy I'm going to create a J
scroll pain sequel to new J scroll pain
like that and then I'm just going to say
HTML page I want to put my J editor pain
inside of the scroll pain and of course
again it's saying aw but you didn't put
this library in here no problem just
click on that and then to my frame or my
window or whatever you want to call it
I'm going to go add and I'm going to say
scroller and I'm going to go border
layout Center and that's going to put
everything in the center of the frame
now since I put this inside of a try
block of course that means I need a
catch area so I'm going to go catch IO
exception e in this situation and I'm
just going to go a print stack trace and
actually a more simplistic way to do
this is to start typing all this code in
here and don't use the try block then it
will automatically pull up the write
exception next time I do this that's
exactly what I'm going to do then I need
to say hey frame I want you to be a very
specific size and that is 1200 pixels
wide by 800
soles tall and also frame I wanted to
set visible to true to show yourself
okay so now what do I need what I could
sit and look at API is trying to figure
out since I'm going to be implementing
these different interfaces up here
exactly which ones I need or I could
just come up here to where this is and
say add on implemented methods and lit
Java do it for me and it's telling me I
need action performed created and I also
need hyperlink update so you don't have
to memorize all kinds of things actually
I'm going to take this guy right here
cut it out put it down here just because
I like it down there instead then I'm
going to perform a couple little checks
here so I'm going to say if I'm going to
go e dot get event type basically I'm
just saying hey okay what sort of event
type happened and we go hyperlink event
obviously it's a hyperlink so it's a
hyperlink event I'm going to say event
type and I want to check if it's been
activated or it's been clicked on that's
what I'm looking for
you could also if you wanted to find out
if it was hovered over you could type in
event type entered or if you wanted to
see if they actually didn't spell that
right entered like that or if you wanted
to find out if they left the hyperlink
you could type exit it that means if
they hovered over and then left like I
said for all this codes in is underneath
this video so then we're going to come
in here and we're going to go HTML page
which is the name of my J editor pane
and I'm going to say set page and what I
want to set it to well I want to figure
out what the URL is so I'm just going to
go hyperlink event which means the
hyperlink that was clicked on and I want
to get the URL for the link that was
clicked on and then make sure that this
URL is displayed on the screen then
after do that I'm going to go the URL
which is my text field
I'm gonna go e alright get URL again we
get that URL for that thing that was
clicked on and I'm going to go to
external form and what to external form
does is it creates a string
representation for my URL which is
convenient because that's exactly what
I'm holding there and I'm just going to
click over here set that the set page
and then if I hover over this is saying
underneath here surrounded with a
try-catch block so I'm just going to
click on that see now when in there and
created the i/o exception for me so I
don't have to worry about it that's kind
of handy and I'm just going to leave it
that way then I'm going
down here where actionperformed is and
this is going to be called whenever my
text field is clicked on so I'm going to
go string page URL is equal to nothing
then I'm going to go and figure out
exactly what was clicked on so how did I
do that
get source of course because that's what
you call whenever you're working with
any type of event and I'm going to say
if what triggered this action here was
the URL which is the name of my text
field that I created I want to perform
certain actions I want to go page URL is
equal to the URL get text which is
basically just getting the text that's
in the text field however if the thing
that was clicked on or whatever some
sort of action occurred here it didn't
involve my text field I want to print
out an error and I'm going to use J
option pane open up a little alert box
show message dialog Java lesson 39 dot
this comma and then I'm going to say
please enter a web address in that
situation and I'm gonna say put a little
error message there and animal cenote
option pain State that this is an error
message so that it looks the way 1 to 2
and then I'm going to come up here again
J option pain however and go import J
option pack then scroll this up I'm
going to go HTML page call set page this
is going to set the URL to be displayed
inside of again I J editor paint and I'm
going to say new URL and get the page
URL remember what they did was they
interacted in some way with my text
field okay so that's why I'm going to be
executing certain things whenever the
text field has been messed with
meaning they type in a link and they hit
enter or whatever they do I'm gonna
surround it again with a try-catch block
and you can see here it put both of the
potential exceptions that could be
thrown which is awesome what am I going
to do I'm going to copy this J option
pane and I'm going to show them a
different error message G option pain
and more than likely the error is going
to be please use HTTP calling now I
could have caught this in some other way
but whatever I'm just just doing this in
this tutorial and I'm going to make sure
that they put HTTP colon forward slash
forward slash inside of here and that is
that that is how to create one of these
guys go get the code get its underneath
the video pull in the HTML file
I used and mess around with J editor
pain to see all the different
functionality available it's actually a
very very very nice underused tool leave
any questions or comments below
