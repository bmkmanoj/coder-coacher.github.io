20 of my c-sharp video tutorial and this
part of the tutorial I'm going to focus
in on menu bars dock panels icon scroll
viewer fonts grid layout a whole bunch
more like always all the code is
available in the description underneath
the video along with the transcript and
I have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so I'm going to be covering new
stuff and then also covering some stuff
that I haven't covered yet so you know
just try some different things there
what I'm going to do is what if we are
this is just basically everything that
comes up whenever you create a brand new
window and some of the stuffs left over
from the last part of the tutorial I
suppose you still have it
now whatever you're working with a grid
something is kind of neat is you're
actually going to be able to create rows
and columns in the grid layout just by
clicking on borders so as you can see
whenever I move my mouse right here what
it's going to allow me to do is either
create columns right on the fly and
create all that code for me or also rows
something else is kind of neat if I want
to show how the scroll viewer works is
I'm going to be able to open this up
being the tool box down here and I'm
going to come down to the label section
so I'm going to go and drag this up here
you can see right here it says label I'm
going to drag a label up and drop it
directly over here let's say we want to
put a scroller view over here which is
just going to be a bunch of labels so
you can scroll through now as you can
see it automatically went in here and
created all of the the text needed
basically in zamel for me so that I
didn't have to worry about that and now
what I'm going to be able to do is grab
this guy and copy it and paste in a
whole bunch more so let's just go like
this
thoughts and then come in to this
section you can do some of the stuff
that's easy to do with the text down
inside of here and some of the stuff
that's just drag-and-drop a bowl easy up
here so this is the very first label I
am then going to come in here and do
something like mmm let's change this 25
just to keep the math a little bit
easier to work with and then take this
guy and put it at 50 and then come on
down and change this to 75
and then change this to 100 and I think
I have another label down here yep then
this is going to be 125 so as you can
see I was able to create a whole bunch
of different labels inside of here now
what I can do is come in here and select
them all so that I'll be able to
automatically create a scroller view for
them so you can scroll through them so
I'm going to just select this and hold
down the shift key as I select them and
then I'm going to be able to right-click
on them and then come down here and say
group into and a scroller view and it's
going to automatically create that for
me I can then grab the scroller view and
move it over here and I can also move it
up into the box to position it however I
would like so that is just a quick
little way that you can create easy
columns and rows inside of a grid layout
as well as how to easily create a
scroller view inside of there and of
course I could come in and shrink this
down as well so let's go a little
something like this
and if we come in here and run this guy
you're going to see there are all the
little guys and I would be able to
scroll through them like such okay so
just a couple little things about grid
layouts and how scroller views work now
I want to talk about the doc panel which
is another layout tool for us now to set
this up all i'm going to do is go in
here and replace grid with doc panel and
a doc panel is normally going to be used
as a container with other different
panels that you would work with in
comparison to do a lot of the other
layout tools that you've seen previously
which are normally only used inside of
other layout managers so let's come in
and let's create a label here basically
the way this is going to work is you are
going to have different items in the top
left right bottom and then center or
whatever space is available so I'm going
to give this label the name of label top
and then I'm going to define where it's
going to show up in my doc panel so I'm
going to say doc panel doc is equal to
and obviously I'm going to throw it in
the top and then I'm going to give it
the text of top just so that we can
easily see what that is all right and
you can see top showed up right up up
and
there all right so let's create a couple
more of them just so you can see how
these are laid out I'll create like four
of them or something like that that
makes sense all right so now we have
five of them the next one down here I'm
going to label this as left and it's
going to go in the left position
obviously and then we'll change this to
left and you're going to say that that's
going to show up as soon as I get rid of
all these errors that are showing up
down here because I have so many things
labeled with the same name I'm going to
have this guy be on the right give this
a name of right and then we'll go and
give this guy the name of bottom and
bottom and bottom and then for this guy
it's going to take off all the available
space in between so we're just going to
get rid of that all together I'm going
to change this to Center and then we
give this a name of center so there you
can see exactly how all of these are
going to lay out on your screen and how
doc panels can be used and actually in
the big tutorial in which I create the
menu bar and all the other stuff I'm
going to use a doc panel for that now
I'm going to be using icons whenever I
use this little menu bar system we're
going to create here and where I'm going
to get the Matt is right here you can
use anything you want but I'm going to
use these just so that I can use some
standard Microsoft icons you just get
them at Microsoft com that's uh exactly
like you see right there of course in
the description I have a link and you
can get all that stuff there and
specifically what I'm going to download
inside of here is this guy right here
the 2013 list of different items this
guy right here but you can get them all
or do whatever you want with him it
doesn't really matter I'm going to close
that out and I'll be using those here in
a moment alright so we're going to use
our doc panel with our menu that we're
going to be creating so I'm just going
to get rid of all the stuff inside of
the doc panel I'm going to shrink down
the toolbox down here because I'm going
to be doing a lot of this manually now
if I want to put a menu inside of it I'm
just going to go menu and doc panel and
doc is going to be equal to the top part
of the screen of course and I close that
down like that and basically what we're
going to be doing here is creating a
basic text editor it's going to have a
lot of the functionality you want
settar so I'm going to go in here and
I'm going to throw in now I'm going to
change it to a text box and I'm going to
give it the name equal to text box doc
and I'm going to give it a height that
is going to be equal to 290 and I'm
going to give it a width which is going
to be equal to 500 and then close that
off right there and then now I'm going
to create the actual menu part now for
the menu bar like what we're going to do
here is we're going to have two main
menu bar items we're going to file and
we're going to edit and then were going
to have a whole bunch of things inside
of those so if you want to create a new
let's go and add file at the top of this
you're going to use header as your name
and if you want it to automatically
react for either control F or option
apps depending upon if you're on Windows
or Macintosh you're going to put that
little dash there or that little line
before whatever letter you want it to
trigger on and then inside of here
you're going to define all the things
you want underneath the file so I'm
going to come in and I'm going to say I
want a new menu item and I'm going to
give it a name which is going to be
equal to menu new menu new then I'm
going to go header is equal to and then
once again do that little underscore and
I'm going to type in and e-w something
else is kind of neat is if you want the
shortcut to show up to the right of the
actual item what you can do is go input
gesture text and then after that so
you're going to go ctrl n and then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to add an
icon to this as well so what we need to
do in this situation is to close off our
menu ID and then inside of it where I
saved my different bitmap guys that I
went and stored inside of here is over
in my resources folder which we created
previously in the last part of the
tutorial get rid of that little extra
quote then inside of here to reference a
a icon inside of here we're going to go
menu item and icon and then inside of
here we're going to point points at the
actual source location for our icon
which in this situation is going to be
in resource
and then new fit nap and then close that
off at the end we can save that all
right we could actually bounce up inside
of here and take a look at that so let's
run it and there you can see is our file
menu and if we click on file you're
going to see that new shows up there is
the shortcut and there is the icon that
we went and added inside of there so
we're going to add more functionality
here of course I'm actually going to
copy this guy all of this stuff and then
I'm going to add an open command inside
of here so this is going to be menu open
like that and going to change this to
open and going to change this die to
control o and then down inside of here
I'll change this to open bitmap because
that's the name that I gave it once
again over in this resources folder over
here let's go into a couple more of
these guys paste that right there
actually before I do that I'm going to
put a click event that is going to be
tied into the open menu here and to do
that of course we just go click and then
I'm going to give it a name and it's
going to be menu open underscore click
and now I'm going to copy this guy and
we'll do the same thing for save as well
so paste that in there and we'll call
this menu save and then this will be
save as well and we'll do a ctrl s and
then menu save click is going to be what
triggers that and we'll just change this
to save bitmap alright and then let's
come in and do another one for exit so
menu exit and this is going to be well
let's change this up a little bit I'm
going to go and then underscore and exit
change this to control X then you exit
click and the icon for this guy is going
to be called hmm what did I call it yeah
I don't think I put one in there so
let's just get rid of it I forgot to put
an exit in my resources directory here
so let's just get rid of it don't really
need an icon for exit anyway and then
outside of the file menu item I'm going
to create a brand new one and this is
going to be for the edit so we're just
going to put header inside of here like
this and we'll do something like
underscore e
tea and then we're going to throw in a
whole bunch of other different options
inside of this so let's say we want to
do cut below menu item X name is going
to be equal to menu cut and the header
name for this is going to be cut and
then if you want to automatically be
able to use the cut option like control
X and so forth you're going to use
command is equal to and then application
commands and this is going to be built
into visual studio and we'll use cut and
then we could do an input gesture again
text and for this we'll go ctrl + X and
then we'll close that guy off let's go
and do another one that is going to work
with copy and paste as well don't have
to change many things here we're just
going to change this to coffee and
coffee and coffee and then this is going
to be ctrl C to change that to say and
actually I see that I have control X
here did I do that yes I did I did that
for exit let's get rid of that so that
we don't cause any problems and we'll
just cut this completely out of there
and we'll take the leavening problem
exiting the command there and then come
on down and you paste as well so we'll
just change this to menu paste and paste
and paste and this will be control V
alright so we got caught cut copy and
paste along with all the other things
that we have underneath our file menu
and now is the last thing well when I
also show you how the separator works so
you can just go like this separator
anytime you want to separate things that
are you know kind of different from
other things inside of your menu bar
just throw that in there and put the
little line inside of there and it'll
separate everything for you I'm going to
throw in some font options inside here
so we're going to go menu item and this
is going to be header is equal to and
then I'll do an underscore and font and
input gesture and this is going to be
control F is going to open that up so
control F and close that off and then
inside of here I'm going to have a whole
bunch of different fonts show up I'm
going to change
to control and then whenever they change
the font inside of the menu bar it's
going to automatically change the font
inside of our text box so here we've got
a menu item once again X name is going
to be equal to and I'll call this combo
ops menu font and we'll have Times New
Roman be an option so times like us have
the header be equal to x and then if I
want this to act like a radio button so
that the user whenever they click on x
the other fonts are going to be
unselected and so forth but also you
know give it the option to be checked
you just go is checkable and we're going
to set that to true and also I think
that it makes sense to keep the menu
open whenever you click on one of those
little checkboxes so I'm going to say
stays open on click rather than closing
also going to change that to true and
also we're going to have a click event
beyond this gun and for this one we're
going to come in call this menu font x
and that's going to be the guy that's
going to trigger that alright so we got
that for our x font let's do the same
thing for courier oops
let's change this so that it looks a
little bit better here menu font x there
you go
anything else look weird there nope
everything else looks good and change
that to menu font x and this guy I'm
going to call it courier and change this
to courier is checkable true yes stays
up and click through yes menu font and
then this is going to be courier you are
ie are all right and then finally we'll
do one for Arial just to do another one
so change this to Arial and this one to
Arial everything else is good menu font
and we'll change this to Arial alright
and that is all we're going to have to
do zamel wise to make our menu work and
as you can see it's coming together here
really really nice so now what I'm going
to do is jump over into the c-sharp code
and make all this stuff work alright so
here we are and right here after the
main window where we initialize our
window I am going to come in
and handle the event in which the user
wants the application to close to do so
I go private void and I call that menu
exit click and this is going to receive
object sender and routed events args
which is going to be information on our
event that was triggered or routed and
sorry about that and then just to close
the whole entire thing we just go like
this you saw this in the last window ok
so there you go that is how we're going
to close our window or our application
do something similar here for opening up
a new file so come down here paste this
in here and I'm going to call this menu
open click because that's what I defined
it as over in the example code and to
get this to open the open documents
dialog box I'm going to go open file
dialog and open dialog is equal to and
new open file dialog and there we go and
normally we would come in there and well
let's go and actually open it as well
the open dialog thought show dialog and
there it is I will open that up and
normally I would get the text out of
that and so forth but well recovered
file i/o so you will have no problem
once you get the documents name to get
the text and throw them in text box that
can be homework for you going to do
something similar here with save and all
we need to do with this it's just called
this save file dialog and this is going
to be save file dialog and let's call
this save dialog and this one's saved
dialog obviously so there you go now
we're able to open and close or save
files and now I need to come in there
and handle changing the font whenever
those checkboxes are clicked on so let's
come in and this is called menu font x
is going to match up with Times New
Roman let's get rid of all this stuff
and then if I want to uncheck one of the
menu bar items I just go menu font
courier it's going to be one of them and
I just go is checked it's very easy you
don't have to mess around like you have
to in other different languages and I'm
going to set up the false and
I'm an ass come in here like this and
this is going to be Ariel that there's
Ariel and that's now going to be also
unchecked and then if I want to set the
font for our text box I just referenced
the text box dock which is the name of
it and I change the font family for it
and how we do that is we go equal to new
font family and I'll change this to
Times New Roman like it also increase
the font size do all kinds of other
different things of course copy that
paste that in there and then we'll do
this for courier as well so courier and
then in this situation I'll just change
from courier two times so now that's
going to work and then we just change
this to courier there we are and then we
come in and do the last one for Ariel so
change this to Ariel and I'll show you
in a second where we can get the font
names for these guys and this is going
to be Ariel and there we are I'm going
to jump over into zamel there we go and
you can see right here if I go on the
right side of the screen and click on
text depending upon what font you want
to use you can see all of the names and
exactly how you are going to use
uppercase and lowercase letters when
you're defining all those different font
options okay alright so a whole bunch of
different stuff let's run it test it out
up there was an error let's go fix that
what I do probably name something wrong
I mean Windows does not contain a
definition for menu font times let's
jump over here I'm guessing I uppercase
the letters whenever I had them as
lowercase here let's go check it out see
if it is let's say in line 40 41 and 43
so 40 oh it's actually in the sample
code so 40 41 43 oh one thing I did I
actually cook this out of the Edit
window sorry about that it's hard to
work on my font so we super-huge on the
screen here close that now because I
know what the error is ah and I forgot
to put the click down here so click like
that and then we can just copy this and
put the click there with the courier and
then let's just come up a little bit
more and throw the click in for that
guy let's save it jump over and make
sure that all of this yes they are all
exactly the same let's go and check and
verify that the error is one of Y and
there we go if we open this up and we
type in some text so bunch of random
text and you're going to see here if we
go edits come down to the font and click
on times it's going to change I don't
know if you can see it's slightly
changed there it is you can see it right
there
so over here change it the courier
change the Arial you can see all those
work you're also going to be able to
come in here and copy and paste as well
as cut the information out of there if
we come down here and click on open it's
going to open up the open dialog which
would allow us to get a file and put it
inside of there and also if we would
come up here and click on save it's
going to open up the save as dialog box
to allow us to save that and of course
if we go file and exit it's going to
exit the application there you go guys a
whole bunch of information on how you
can work with menus as well as dock
panels and grid layouts and scroll
viewers and a whole bunch of other
different things and like always please
leave your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
