of my C++ video tutorial in this part of
the tutorial we're going to cover a lot
of things we're gonna cover friend
classes structs polymorphism abstract
classes virtual override final and a
whole bunch of other different things
like always all the code is available in
the description along with a transcript
of this video and if you haven't seen
any the previous videos you could
probably watch those first and I have a
lot to do so let's get into it okay so
here we are now basically classes have a
default private fields Wow as well as
methods while structs are going to have
public versions of fields and methods by
default they're very very similar and
basically structs are going to be used
anytime you want to model new data types
what classes are going to model more
complex real-world objects so I'm gonna
give me an example here let's say that
we want to create a shape custom data
type so what are we gonna have with our
shape we're going to have maybe a link
as well as a width okay so those are
going to be two variables we're gonna
have our fields and they're going to be
public by default as you can see right
there we can have constructors and they
were also going to be public so let's
say we get our length passed into here
you can also inside of your constructors
give default values maybe we want to put
a 1 inside of there and there's width
and let's also give it a value of 1 okay
so constructor just like with a class
and you can also use this which I'll
show you in a second but in this
situation we don't need to use whit this
just like we did with classes as well
and thus trucks are also going to be
able to contain functions so they're
very very similar and let's just throw
an area inside of here as you're gonna
see we're gonna be able to use
inheritance as well with structs so
there you go there is a default struck
that is based off of a generic type of
shape and let's get rid of some of this
space and you can see here all the
things that I have included I'll use
some of them some of them I won't I try
to keep that as a default just so it's
easy for you guys to follow along and
not get hung up you're also going to be
able to have private variables
inside a struct and you just go private
like that and then let's say I wanted to
have an ID or something with all my
shapes all right so there here we go now
I'm gonna show you how inheritance works
and then I'll go and create some strokes
and show you some more
so inheritance is gonna work very
similar to what we saw whenever we were
using classes so we're just gonna put
after the colon whatever we want to
inherit from or whatever the superclass
is whatever the base class is you're
going to be able to come in and override
the constructor so let's say we want
circle here and double and width so the
circles are only going to receive a
width in here I said I was going to show
you that this works exactly the same and
indeed it does so there this is and
there you go we're also going to be able
to override our different functions
so it's override area and because a
circle is gonna have a different type of
area and here we'll go return 3.14159
times and then we'll go and use the
power function here and we will just get
the width two and divide that and then
pass inside of it the to square that
okay so we got that and I think that's
enough now come down inside of main and
create a couple of these and like I said
before the code is available in the
description so if I'm moving a little
bit too quickly it's probably best to
get it and it's free so you know I'm not
charging you for anything I don't charge
anything ever all right so we went and
created a shape using our struct here
and passed in the width and the length
and we can go and get our area for it so
let's say Square area and then let's go
and output it and to reference a
function or a method inside of it that's
all we do we just just like we did with
classes and then we can throw a new line
inside of there and let's go create a
circle also and in circle and let's just
call it circle to keep it simple it only
receives one value so throw that inside
of there
we can go and output this as well so
let's go copy dot for that inside of
there and then this will be our circle
area instead so when we just need to
change this a circle okay pretty simple
stuff and there we go we got that set up
um you're also going to be able to
initialize a struct or class using what
is called an aggregate and we saw these
previously with arrays so I could throw
in ten and fifteen like that if I would
like I don't know just something that
some people like to do and then we can
go and get our rectangle area and I'll
put that on the screen as well and this
is just going to be changed a rectangle
and there we go
and there we are and if we run it you're
gonna see the square area comes out the
circle area and the rectangle area okay
so we'll do more with structs as the
tutorial continues but now what I want
to do is demonstrate how friend classes
work now of course private members as we
saw previously of a class are not going
to be accessible to outside code
normally unless you mark a class as
friendly so it's what we want to do here
is I want to create a class and it's
gonna be called customer and we're gonna
put private data inside of here and what
we want to do is we want to mark a class
that we're gonna create here in a second
as a friends and what that means is the
get customer data class that we're gonna
create in a moment is going to have full
access to information inside of our
customer class so let's just go this is
going very simple I'm just gonna put a
name inside of here and then I'm gonna
have public and the public is just going
to be our constructor and we're just
gonna come in here like this and when
you go name and throw that there and
this is gonna reference the name and if
there's anything I ever do that you
don't understand just leave a comment
and I will answer it just understand
that YouTube only sends me new comments
it will not send me comment replies so I
have no idea why that's just the way
they work I think it's because most
youtubers never answer their comments so
and I do so that's how we differ all
right so here we got get customer data
friendly class and it is going to be
able to go and get some information and
I'm gonna mark this is static and
basically using this as a utility class
it's not you know I mean look at the
name get customer data that doesn't
sound like a real mint real world object
it sounds like a utility and hence that
is why we have our method air Marcus
static and this is going to receive a
reference to the customer so it'll be
able to operate directly upon it and all
this guy's gonna do is go return and get
our object that was passed inside of it
and the name and return it
alright so pretty simple stuff and we
can keep this all on the screen here at
the same time now we go down inside of
main and we can create a new customer
Tom and pass in the name inside of there
so there we got Tom setup and then we
can go and call get customer data and
get name or whatever we want to call
that and then let's see if I have C out
yes I do
and let's go and just type a name inside
of here and then we can go and get name
so get name and then call get name and
we have to specifically whoops passed
the Tom object inside of it and
everything's fine and let's run it and
you can see that the friendly class good
customer data because it was marked as a
friend right here is able to go inside
of here and get access to private data
all right so pretty neat stuff and now
what I want to do is show you an example
of something that a lot of people think
is complicated but it's really not and
that is polymorphism all right so
polymorphism is just a feature in
object-oriented programming languages
that allows objects to be treated
similar similarly and a at the same time
they will also be able to utilize their
differences automatically for any
methods that you mark as virtual so I'm
gonna show you another simple example
let's just stick with our shape because
that's pretty easy to work with so we're
gonna go I'm gonna use protected and
that just means that the sub classes
that inherit from shape are going to be
able to access this information so we
are going to have a height like we did
previously and then we'll also have
of a width like we did previously I'm
then going to create public and what I'm
going to do here is create a couple
constructors I'm going to create a
constructor here and what its gonna do
is it's going to assume if the only one
value is passed inside of it that both
the height and the width are going to be
equal someone to go height is equal to
link and width is gonna be equal to
length also and there we go and maybe we
should have used a better name than
length but that's what popped in my head
at the moment all right so we'll go
shape again and create a another one and
I'm just gonna go double H and double W
and go and assign our height as well as
our width to this guy and then what else
we're gonna do oh well I'm gonna have a
function here that is going to be
overridden by classes that subclass our
shape class and if I want them to be
overridden automatically and have them
work even though I would define them as
shapes I have to mark this function as
virtual just like I did so I'm going to
go and have our area and it will return
by default height times width and there
we go and now what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna create another class
underneath of it and this is gonna be
our circle class that is going to
inherit from our shape class and the
public's are going to be I'm gonna have
circle and it's going to receive a W
which is gonna represent the width of
our circle and I'm gonna have our shape
constructor automatically go and work
with that so I got here and go shape and
pass the width inside of it it's
automatically gonna work I don't need to
do anything else so why not just not do
anything else all right so we got that
all set up and what else we gonna do
well I'm gonna override area which is
marked as virtual make sure you mark it
as virtual otherwise it will not work so
I'm gonna say double area
I will just go return one for just like
we did with our struct example times
standard and just get our width and
divide it by two and we are and there we
go
alright so we overrode that now what's
gonna be neat is we're gonna be able to
do we're gonna be able to store objects
Oh a bunch of shape objects even though
they are really circles and anything
else another thing we can do is we are
going to be able to create a function
that receives shapes for example but
it's going to use the correct area
automatically that is an example of
polymorphism so we're going to say we
can treat all these things whenever we
want I'm gonna call this show area I
think that's a better name and it's
going to receive shapes references to
shapes so there put the + symbol
underneath that then we're gonna go
shape and it's gonna work for every
single thing that is a shape or is a
subclass of a shape so it's extremely
useful and whenever we get into design
patterns and things like that you're
gonna see how extremely useful
polymorphism is it's very very useful to
be able to treat similar objects in a
similar fashion and then have what how
they differ
you know automatically work it's
extremely important alright so we went
and created our shapes and our circles
now what we're gonna do is we're going
to go and create shape and it's gonna be
Square and it's gonna have let's just
throw ten and five inside of there my
technically that's a rectangle but
whatever um what else are we gonna do
let's go and create a circle and circle
and it's just gonna have the width of
said circle and then I'm gonna be able
to go show area and pass in our Square
and it's automatically gonna work if I
spell show right there we go and then we
can do the same thing for circle and
circle is going to automatically work so
you polymorphism is a gigantic word that
is extremely easy to understand and if
we run it you're gonna see that it
automatically called the correct area
for our square shape as well as our
circle shape okay so that is just one of
what will be many more examples of
polymorphism as the tutorial continues
now I want to talk about abstract
classes as
as override now in our previous example
shape basically has no purpose except
for being able to group similar objects
so it really should be an abstract class
instead so what we can do is we can go
and get rid of all of this stuff so
let's get rid of that's and what's also
command and basically just define the
area is the only thing that matters well
I guess we did create a shape but either
way basically I was just trying to
demonstrate that we could inherit and
consider something a shape and still
have everything work so how we would set
this up is we would go virtual double
area and then after this I just get rid
of all that we get equal to zero okay
and that's all we need for this to
inherit and take advantage of the power
of polymorphism but at the same time not
really have a class underneath of it now
we can still come in with our circle
class and go and inherit from shape and
we could still have I let's go and let's
have a protected double in this
situation so let's go pro tected and
let's go double width all right so we
have that and then inside of public what
I'm gonna do is I'm not gonna call our
shape constructor in this situation I'm
just going to assign it width is equal
to double there we are and then down
here for area what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to note that I am going to
override it okay so I'm going to type in
override inside of there and you should
always use override to force the
compiler to check if the base classes
virtual function is the same as the
subclass okay so we just want to always
type in override don't forget that and I
can keep this exactly the same then I
can come in here and I can create a
rectangle class as well so it'll go
rectangle and once again I will inherit
from shape sort of shape like this and
then inside of it I'm going to go
protected again and
create a double that's gonna have the
height and the width inside of it and do
I need anything else not really
so we'll go public and what am I gonna
need inside of here well I am going to
need our constructor so I'll go
rectangle and it's gonna receive or
height and width for us so double and
width and of course it's just going to
assign those values is equal to H and
width is gonna be equal to W and what
else are we gonna need I'm gonna need
our area and I'm what are we gonna do
with the area we're gonna override it
again so let's just go copy this and
paste that inside of there and again
everything's the same double area
override the only thing that changes is
how we calculate our area and I'm just
gonna go to height times wit and there
we go
so I created all that and why not go and
demonstrate something else here as well
I'm gonna come in and I'm going to
create a square just to show you an
error so I'm gonna go public and it's
going to inherit from rectangle and we
can throw that right there and then I
public and square create the constructor
which is gonna receive a double and it's
going to receive double width and then
we will whoops let's go and call our
constructor so rectangle again and we
can pass in our height and our width to
that guy and we don't need to do
anything else because all we have with
our square is - width and then we could
go and let's go and show you something
this guy right here is actually going to
trigger an error so whoops there that
and override well one reason why it
might trigger that error is if I come up
here and I mark our area function as
final what final means is that sub
classes that inherit from rectangle can
no longer override this specific
function if it's marked as final okay
even if we have the override right here
is that that has nothing to do with it
the final is going to mean that our
square
are not going to be able to override the
function anymore okay so we can save
that and let's just go f6 and you're
gonna say error Declaration of error
area overrides a final function so this
guy right here is saying that we can
whenever we mark a function as final
that we are not going to be able to
override it all right so let's just get
rid of square altogether so we don't
need it and then we're also going to be
using show area once again it's gonna
receive shapes and it's gonna make
everything automatically work now what
we're gonna do is we're gonna come down
here and we are going to create a
rectangle so we'll go rectangle and
let's just call it rectangle and let's
just leave ten and five there just as
they are circle it's perfectly fine and
then we can go show area instead of
shape we're gonna say rectangle is gonna
be passed inside of it and we can also
have our circle inside of there and if
we save it and run it you're gonna see
that both of them work all right there
we go guys there he is a run down a
polymorphism abstract classes override
virtual functions Struck's final and a
whole bunch of other different things
hopefully you guys found that useful and
like always please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
