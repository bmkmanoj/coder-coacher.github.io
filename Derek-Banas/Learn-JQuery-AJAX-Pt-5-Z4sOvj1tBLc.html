my jQuery and Ajax tutorial today I'm
going to list out every event handler an
event object property that is available
to you inside of jQuery first off here's
the jQuery event handlers you have the
blur event handler which is triggered
when you leave an element change is
triggered when an element is changed
click is triggered when you click an
element with the mouse double-click is
triggered when you double click an
element with mouse
air is triggered when any error occurs
and the focus event handler is triggered
when you enter an element key down is
triggered when a key is pressed down key
press is triggered when a key is pressed
and released and I'm talking about the
keyboard here key up is triggered when a
key is released load is triggered when
your webpage is fully loaded Mouse down
is triggered when the mouse button is
pressed down Mouse up is triggered when
the mouse button is released Mouse move
is triggered when the cursor moves mouse
overs triggered when the mouse goes over
an element Mouse out is triggered when
the mouse moves off of an element Submit
is triggered whenever the submit button
is pressed and here are all the event
object properties these are properties
that are set every single time an event
occurs on a web page you have the event
Alt key this has a value of true if the
Alt key was pressed event dot control
key has a value true if the control key
was pressed event data contains any
value passed whenever you fire the vine
function which is used to assign event
handlers to elements in a webpage
event.keycode contains the key code for
the last press key event page X returns
Mouse coordinates on the x-axis page Y
returns the mouse coordinates on the y
axis event Shift key has value true if
the shift key is pressed screen X
returns the mouse coordinates on the
x-axis relative to the page screen Y
returns the mouse coordinates on the y
axis relative to the page event target
holds the value of the elements named
that issue in an event timestamp
contains the timestamp which lists when
the event occurs being both the year
month day
time millisecond all of that event God
type will tell you the type of event
that occurred yeah that is every single
event handler listed out in the next
tutorial I am going to show you exactly
how to use all these event handlers in
real life code and next you're gonna see
the webpage you're gonna create in part
6 of my jQuery and Ajax tutorial in the
next tutorial I'm going to show you how
to track pretty much anything in regards
to event handlers as you can see here
I'm tracking my X&amp;amp;Y mouse coordinates if
I press a key of any type you can see
that this is going to track those keys
that I'm typing in and if I move outside
of this text box you can see all these
have changed there's other ways that
we're tracking event handlers if I put
my cursor over top of this icon you can
see that I'm tracking that event I can
track clicks I can track double clicks
and I can even unbind an event handler
as you can see here now we are not
tracking any longer that I have my mouse
or cursor on the icon and also I'm gonna
show you how to put an event handler on
a submit button till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
