MySQL and SQL tutorial in this part of
the tutorial I'm going to explain what a
database is what - qo is what a
relational data management system is
what SQL is show you how to create a
table and go through all the datatypes
available to you within SQL there are
many common database misconceptions some
people think they are hard to develop
not true many people think they're very
expensive and in actuality there are
free databases available and some people
think the free ones are the best and for
those people that don't know how to
start using them you're in the right
place MySQL in actuality is a completely
free database server that many consider
to be the best heck even NASA uses it so
do you need one do you have trouble
managing your data do you have massive
amounts of data that is too complicated
to store in a spreadsheet
would you like to provide access to your
data on the internet or would you like
to be able to sort through and analyze
all of your data better if you answer
any of these questions yes yes you do
need a database
what is MySQL well a database is a
highly structured place you use to store
information of pretty much any type you
organize your information a series of
tables with rows and columns like a
spreadsheet so what's a relational
database management system the
relational word refers to the fact that
the database organizes data based off of
how it relates to the other data and if
you structure the database in the right
way it can access millions of bits of
data in seconds the management system
provides you with the ability to access
add to and delete the data within so
what's SQL you use structured query
language to issue commands to MySQL
remember you create tables of data in a
database so how do you create a table
here is exactly the code the SQL code
that you would use to create a table
within a database first start off with
the keyword create table followed by
whatever you want your table to be
called then you have a bracket and here
we're defining some different variables
that will go with it within the table
first I have customer name and I'm
telling the database of the data server
that information is going to be of a
character type meaning letters and I
expect it to be 15 characters in length
in the customer address field you see
here I do pretty much the same thing you
can see I end each one of these
definitions with a comma and then
finally I define that I want to be able
to store a telephone number and the
telephone number is going to be an
integer or a number that is going not
going to have decimal places then we end
the whole thing with another bracket
followed by simple so what do you need
to create a database well you'll
probably host your database on someone
else's computer and then access it
through the internet I write about
internet-based technologies so that is
how I'll approach this subject is PS
provide you with a database
pre-installed such as GoDaddy or what
have you but you can also access them
with a terminal or the ISPs proprietary
software putty for example is a commonly
used terminal but you'll probably just
use the ISPs personal system if you use
GoDaddy as your eyes page chances are
you're using a program called PHP my
admin this is the most common way on SPS
provide access to databases but in this
tutorial I'm going to completely focus
on teaching us QL so how do you log in
after you log into your account with
your user ID and password you'll be able
to start creating databases and tables
with SQL you log into MySQL by typing
the following command MySQL space then a
dash followed by you whatever your user
ID name is and another /np whenever
you're done or whenever you hit enter
what the- ql server is going to request
that you enter your password and then
you're in the system so how do you
create a database to create a database
just type the phone link create database
and then whatever you want your database
name to be this creates the storage area
for my company's customers you can name
the database whatever you'd like and
then with the use command you type in
use followed by the name of the database
you want to edit before you can start
editing table you need to select it and
what do you selected with keywords
select followed by the word database to
brackets and a semicolon and if you type
this in the on the right side you'll see
exactly what would be displayed in your
terminal so let's create a more
complicated table here I'm creating a
table called customers the first
variable I'm going to define is first
name followed by
the keyword var CH AR what this is
saying is first name the variable is
more than likely going to contain no
more than 15 characters but unlike the
character variable type variable
characters could go over that 15th
character limit with not null I am
telling the data server for MySQL that
this value is going to be a requirement
meaning that if somebody inputs
information into this specific row of
this specific table they must type in a
first name it's a requirement null means
non entered value or a non value I do
pretty much the same thing with a
variable last name here I create the
state variable and I say it's going to
be exactly two characters again not know
I'm going to put a default of PA since I
live in Pennsylvania most of my
customers are probably gonna be there
too then I still find that I'd like a
birthdate variable set up followed by
the variable name date again it's going
to be required so I have that not null
in there and with the en um data type I
am defining that I will only accept the
values of M or F no other values will be
acceptable with the cust ID variable I'm
going to get more into keys in a further
tutorial don't really worry too much
about what this says but basically I'm
telling it that it's going to be an
integer or a number with no decimal
places it's going to be unsigned which
means I am NOT going to allow negative
numbers to be entered it's going to be
required so I have not in all their
auto-increment means that I want the
data server to automatically add one to
the previous customer ID and it's going
to do that all for me and then like I
said I'll describe primary key is a
later date and then I define another
variable called last meeting and I'm
giving it the variable type of timestamp
which I'll explain you in a short period
of time it's basically just a
representation of time and then I'm
going to create the final variable here
called money owed it is a float which
means it's a number that does have a
decimal place and I'm going
say that that field can be left empty by
defining it with the keyword null so
what type of numeric data types are
there in SQL well you can see all of
them right here I'm not going to bother
going through all of them pause your
movie and look at them as you like but
it's basically integers are numbers
without decimal places and then you have
floats and doubles which do allow for
decimal place string types in SQL well
you have the character character string
with fixed length that is what a
character variable type it is then you
have the VAR character type what this is
saying is you don't really necessarily
know how many characters you're going to
put into this field then you have blob
which contains immense amount of text en
um which is used to store a predefined
set of values like we did before with
male and female and then you have set
and it's a list of legal possible
character strings
unlike the en um variable type though a
set can contain multiple values in
comparison to the one legal value that
is found with the variable type en um
and that is how they are different then
we have also some different datatypes
available to regards to date and time
and you see down here here's the time
stamp basically it is a time value with
the format of four numbers representing
the year two representing the months two
representing days two representing hours
two representing minutes and finally two
representing seconds and that's what all
that information means in the next
tutorial I am going to go through all of
the SQL statements such as describe
insert select where comments operators
count and group by and there's a link to
that tutorial below hope you enjoy this
