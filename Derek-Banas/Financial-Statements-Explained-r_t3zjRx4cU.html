financial statements tutorial in which I
will explain exactly how all the
financial statements work that are used
within a business and I'm going to use a
real world example in this tutorial I'm
going to fill in step-by-step the
financial statements and explain what
all the jargon means through the use of
a fake caricature drawing business this
tutorial came together because I
received this request from Ian and she
did not want me to give her last name
first off I'm going to go over the
balance sheet the balance sheet
describes a business's financial
situation at a moment in time the left
side details the assets a business has
and the right side details how those
assets were acquired at all times both
sides must remain equal you can see in
the lower right hand corner a very
simple way to start a business is with
cash and an original investment by me
the owner of course most businesses
start off with a loan and your rich
uncle decides to give you $100 and he
expects 10% interest to be paid on that
hundred dollar loan sometime within a
year's time a long term loan that
includes interest is known as a notes
payable and you can see in the lower
right hand corner here now I have an
original investment plus the loan from
my uncle also known as a notes payable
and when you add those two things up you
get my cash amount which is $200 now
there are two different types of owners
of a business there are people the
business owes money to or liabilities
say I changed the right side to the word
liabilities and then there's the part of
the business the owner owns this is
known as owner's equity and you can see
here original investment lies under
owner's equity and everything else still
equals out and also you're going to
learn the most important equation in
whenever it comes to balance sheets and
that is that assets always will be equal
to liabilities plus owner's equity
inventory is what you sell when you buy
inventory you decrease the value of cash
you do not decrease anything else or
change anything else so whenever you
purchase $50 in inventory you're going
to get for your caricature drawing
business 50 sheets of paper which cost a
total of $35 and then you're going to
get $15 worth of markers and colored
pencils and this image
Tory is going to allow you to create
exactly 50 caricatures in my sample
business now let's say you go to a party
later on that night and you draw 40
caricatures for $2 apiece that is $80 in
total sales well that would mean that
your unit cost is equal to the price of
inventory to create one finished good so
if you have $50 in inventory and that
inventory creates 50 caricatures that
means your unit cost is $1 now cost of
goods sold is going to equal out to $40
and what that means just quite simply is
you sold 40 caricatures as I detailed
above at a unit cost of $1 each so it
costs you $40 to create the goods that
you then sold for 80 you would then
subtract the cost of goods sold from
your total sales of $80 to find your
gross profit and gross profit is just
simply as I have here sales minus cost
of the goods that you sold and net
profit as you're going to find out later
is gross profit minus any additional
expenses so let's look at this more
closely we started off with $200 in cash
which came from our original investment
and the notes payable from our uncle we
bought $50 worth of inventory and then
we made a total number of sales of $80
that's how we get the cash amount here
of $230 well you can see down here I
have earnings week-ending this is
another part of the balance sheet I'm
introducing here for the first time how
I was able to calculate this is to take
the total number of sales minus the cost
of goods sold which is $40 to get a
final earnings week-ending of $40 if you
add both of these sides up you come to
the same number being 240 dollars you've
decided it's time to expand you've
decided to increase the price of your
caricatures to $5 each to rent a space
at the mall for $80 per day and to buy a
sign and an easel for a total of $50 you
then go on to buy $50 in raw material
inventory raw material inventory is is
inventory that is not prepared to sell
it will be
I'm a finished good as you're gonna see
here in a minute right after you're done
making the drawing let's say that your
first day at the mall you make $300 in
total sales by selling 60 caricatures
that's sixty times five dollars as we
have up here at the top and you're also
going to see here a new piece of the
balance sheet being retained earnings of
$40 that was some of the $40 that you
made during your first day as a
caricature artist and you see here your
additional sales of one hundred and ten
dollars and on the next slide I'm going
to go through exactly how that was
calculated can see here what I did was I
took my previous cash amount of $230
subtracted out the one hundred and
thirty dollars that I used to buy the
easel and all the other additional
things subtract out the cost of my
inventory and then added my total sales
to get $350 and I was able to calculate
earnings week-ending which is over here
by taking my total expenses out and my
total cost of goods sold and adding in
my total sales to reach an amount of 110
and if you add all of these things up
you come to $350 most errors in
accounting are caused because of a lack
of understanding on how to calculate
earnings week to date and another
financial statement the income statement
helps you to avoid making that mistake
an income statement is normally updated
on a weekly basis while balance sheets
can sometimes go for months without
being updated so what I did here was I
took my first day at the mall and I put
my sales in the upper right hand corner
and this is the basics of what an income
statement looks like then I take my
beginning inventory because remember on
my first day I had $50 of inventory to
sell and I only sold 40 caricatures so
that's what this is then I went out and
bought additional $50 worth of paper and
markers put that there then I add all
these up and put the total amount of
inventory that's available to sell and
then the amount of inventory left over
after my first day at the mall which was
zero that gets me my total cost of goods
sold which is $60 I subtract that from
the sales amount I then subtract out my
rent my sign my easel my total expenses
and that's where I came up with the
number one
in ten if you look over here that's what
you got earnings week-ending so this is
the reason why you use an income
statement it allows you to keep
everything straight because let's say I
didn't sell all of my inventory well and
this is a common error let say only sold
$50 in my total inventory well I would
only subtract $50 from this three
hundred and leave the additional ten
dollars here in ending inventory that
would keep everything straight you did
not subtract out all of your inventory
from your sales to reach your earnings
week-ending you instead only subtract
out the cost for the inventory that you
sold and I'm going to do a ton of more
examples
believe me this is going to become
completely understandable your second
wheaten business you decide to rent the
mall booth for three days for a total of
two hundred forty dollars in rent you
spend an additional $150 on raw
materials and use twenty five dollars of
the raw materials to create celebrity
pictures these are what are called
finished goods like I had mentioned
previously you sell 125 caricatures but
no celebrity pictures here you have your
total sales of $625 your beginning
inventory remember we sold out last time
so we had none your total cost for paper
and markers and this ending inventory
represents the celebrity pictures you
did not sale so we're going to subtract
that out 125 minus 625 leaving a gross
profit of $500 minus the cost in rent
which was $240 for three days
move that expense over here and come to
your final net profit which is also
going to be equal to your earnings week
today and go here again we can look at
how to transfer that over to the balance
sheet by taking the previous cash minus
the inventory minus rent plus sales and
that's how you get five hundred and
eighty five dollars here for cash and
you have your finished goods which were
the celebrity pictures that you did not
sell you want to leave them in there and
then you find your earnings week to date
of $260 by taking your total sales minus
cost of goods sold minus expenses and
you can see here over in retained
earnings that I moved up my previous
earnings week ending to return retained
earnings I decided to reinvest them back
into the business if you add all of
these up you'll come to six hundred ten
dollars well as you're leaving them all
and after you
finish your balance sheet a friend comes
by and offers to buy all of your
celebrity pictures for $50 on credit
when somebody buys something from you on
credit it is called an accounts
receivable meaning money that you expect
to receive the mall operator then walks
up to you and says that he wants one
half up front or a hundred and twenty
dollars well since you are not going to
immediately start renting them all at
that point in time this is what is
called a prepaid expense and you would
also put this over here under your
inventory so you would put your prepaid
expense 120 dollars here and subtract it
from cash you would put your accounts
receivable here of $50 and then you
would add the additional $50 over here
to earnings week-ending you add all
these up comes to 635 so what happens if
that debt your friend said he would pay
to you
he doesn't pay it real simple delete the
amount that's in accounts receivable
then come down to earnings week-ending
and subtract that $50 from here as well
but do not touch retained earnings if
you had already moved this 235 up into
retained earnings this would have an
amount of negative $50 so let's review
cash is cash real simple inventory is
made up of raw materials and finished
goods and prepaid expenses accounts
receivable are payments made in credit
prepaid expenses are payments made in
advance of receiving benefits cost of
inventory and prepaid expenses are
subtracted from cash whenever they are
purchased and let's review liabilities
accounts payable or short-term loans due
in a month's time roughly and they
normally don't require interest payments
however the loan that you receive from
your uncle was a notes payable because
it's a long-term loan that does indeed
require interest payments and let's
review equity the original investment is
the owner's investment in the company
retained earnings or earnings that have
been reinvested into the company
earnings week to date is found by
subtracting cost of goods sold and
expenses from sales and you can find
that information over on your income
statement and bad debt is subtracted
from earnings I hope that was very
understandable in the next presentation
I'm going to go over paying off your
debt to
Runkle hiring an employee and how that
changes your balance sheet and income
statement buying with credit and the
different accounting methods available
