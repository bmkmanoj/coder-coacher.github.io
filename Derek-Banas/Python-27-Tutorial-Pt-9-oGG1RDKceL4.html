9 of my programming with python 2.5
through 2.7 tutorial today I'm gonna
cover exception handling or to make that
real simple I'm going to show you
exactly how to catch errors that occur
whenever your applications are running
so that you're the users of your
applications never see these errors I'm
gonna do here first is I'm going to
actually show you all of the built-in
exceptions that lie inside a Python and
if you would want to see those all you
need to do and of course if you didn't
see the previous tutorials you most
definitely should watch them otherwise
you are going to be confused because I'm
gonna skip over a lot of things and of
course to what I'm doing here but here
all I'm doing is I'm gonna cycle through
a list of all the exceptions that are
available inside of Python and if I do
that you can see over here on the right
side of the screen all of those
exceptions are printed out these are all
the different errors that can occur
inside of the Python programming
language just print it out there for you
on screen and if you would ever want to
raise your own exception so for example
if you would want a error to be
triggered that you will then handle
somewhere else in your code it's real
easy all you do is type in Rays
exception and then provide a name for
set exception so if we run this you can
see exception occurred meaning an error
and it is called just disagreeable and
that's where you defined that
now I'm gonna jump up here and create a
junk class just to show you a
demonstration of the most common errors
that occur in Python here I'm creating a
private attribute and then I'm going to
try to refer to it which I am NOT able
to do because it's private and hidden
here I'm creating an object of type dog
and I'm gonna try to print out to screen
puppy
underscore secret and this will raise
the attribute error meaning that I'm
trying to access an attribute which is
what this is secret that is not
available for me to access I could also
trigger this error by trying to access
any attribute that didn't exist in a
class inside of Python so that's how you
trigger an attribute error inside of
Python another common error inside of
Python is the i/o error and this would
occur if I
to access a file that is not available
to me and I'm going to get into how to
access files in the next tutorial
and you can see io air pops up your own
screen meaning I tried to access a file
or a directory that does not exist
another common error inside of Python is
the index error so let's create a list
right here and then we'll try to print
to screen and index it doesn't exist
inside of this guy for for example you
can see index there the index doesn't
exist and we tried to access it and
that's what triggered that error and I'm
gonna get into how to handle all these
errors of course just want you to be
well aware of the common errors that
occur inside of Python and there is a
dictionary type that just has one key
value pair inside of it and if I try to
access something that does not exist you
can see I get a key error which is
another common error inside of Python I
could also trigger a name error which is
just calling a variable that doesn't
exist or I misspelled it and there's a
name error and then you have your type
errors and these occur when I try to
perform an operation on a variable type
that is just not possible so for example
if I tried to find the modulus of a
division of tomato by 5 obviously that
is going to give me a type error and
then of course you have a division by 0
error
ok so I've gone through the most common
errors how do you handle that what you
do is you start off with the word try
and let's say I'm gonna do my zero
division error that I just showed you so
how exactly am I gonna handle an
accidental division by zero error I'll
just put it in the word try and then one
way I could handle it is to type in
accept and type in the very specific
error that I want to protect myself from
triggering and then underneath this I
want to don't forget to colon and then
underneath of this I want to define what
I want to happen if this specific error
is triggered now I'm going to type in
you can't divide by zero if we run this
you can see instead of getting that mess
that we saw previously the user of your
program is just simply going to see you
can't divide by zero and then you might
ask them for these variables again to
perform the division again so that's one
way you can
keep yourself from having that error but
what if you want to protect from
multiple different errors occurring like
for example let's say not here is the
name of the variable you're trying to
divide by zero and you want to protect
against a name error so you're gonna
type in name error and then a comma and
then a zero division error so now you're
protecting yourself from two potential
errors you can't divide by those numbers
we'll print out to screen and then on
top of that if you'd actually want to
print the error out to the screen that's
going to provide more information you
could follow this by a comma here
followed by the letter E and then within
your exception handling error you can
actually type it on print if we execute
that you can see here you can't divide
by those numbers and then it provides
more information global name not here is
not defined now what would happen if
this error didn't occur you know what
what should you print out on a screen
well let's say for example 1/2 okay of
course that's perfectly fine so then
what you want to do is define what you
want to occur if no errors occur and
here what we're gonna do if no error did
occur we want to print out the answer
for the actual division that occurs and
what did I get 0 well the reason why is
I'm performing a division on integers
remember if you want to perform a
division and show decimal places inside
of Python you've got to put the point
zeroes in there so let's run that again
you can see now I get the right answer
and finally there's only one other thing
you can do and it's actually called
finally if there is something that you
always want to occur no matter whether
an error is triggered or an error is not
triggered you use this finally keyword
here and you can perform any type of
clean-up duties or anything this what I
just want you to know is this will
always occur finally will always be
triggered if you use it so just say
everything is OK and you can see whether
it's an error is triggered or an error
is not triggered that's going to show up
and just to prove that come in here and
you can see here you can't divide by
those numbers float division everything
is OK and that is pretty much everything
there is to know about exception
handling inside of Python up next I'm
going to go over file i/o and
show you how to work with different
files with a Python programming language
if you have any questions or comments
leave them below till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
