my definitive HTML tutorial here and
what I'm gonna do this time is go over
all the things I didn't cover in the
previous presentation first up I'm going
to talk about lists list tags first off
see right here is the code you would
actually input into your HTML file and
if you did type this exact code in it
would create this when a browser loads
that HTML file exactly this is called a
definition list and how you create them
is to first off use the DL tag this
tells the browser and definition list is
common then what you would do is use the
DT tag to title what you're going to
provide a definition for and this is the
definition itself you can also create
ordered lists as you'll see right here
if you type this code and this is what
will be displayed by the browser the
only difference is that opens with a no
alt tag ordered list and then you would
use a line for each list item that's
what L stands for
going to create an unordered list which
started off with ul tag then list item
Li and then a closing bracket if you did
you would get this but in most
circumstances you're going to have a
bullet item there instead of this line
now I'm going to talk about links or
anchors or hyperlinks or whatever you
want to call them to create a link our
anchor or a hyperlink basically you just
type this into your text tool that
you're going to save as HTML file what
this does here is opening bracket then a
tells the browser that an anchor is
being created
then href equals the location that you
want to send the user to if they click
on your link and this is what the link
would look like right here
target tells the browser what you want
to do and regards to where you want the
webpage to be open if you put an
underscore blank in the target section
the webpage is actually going to open in
your current web page and not oh
no one who ever if you typed in
underscore South it wouldn't actually
open up a new web page and of course you
think that website is what will be
displayed as your link that's basically
all there is regards to setting up
hyperlinks except for this neat little
tool if you wanted it to set up a link
system that would allow a person to
click on the link and jump within the
page mean jump somewhere else into the
page Lake I referred to this earlier in
this web page they click on it and they
jump there you would simply define the
area you want to jump to with a man
instead of each reference and give it a
special name you can see here it's great
stuff well you look down in this link
right here you can see great stuff so
hence if I click on this link this is
going to jump up here and it did another
neat trick you can do in regards to
links is to set up an easy system so
that your users can automatically click
on a link and open up their email system
send you a mail message go a page
reference but in this circumstance
you're gonna put your email address in
here and then a question mark followed
by subject and this would go in the
subject line and then this would be the
text that would be shown to users and
that's basically everything there is to
know about creating links or anchors
where I'd want to call now I'm going to
talk about tables to create a
full-functioning table that looks like
this down here
you would simply copy and paste that
this table code in Durrington alpha this
opening bracket followed by cable will
tell the browser you wanted to display a
table summary will not be displayed to
the user this is for people who may be
blind
who wants a description of what
informations in the table do not need to
do this but it's fine caption
if you put this in here and it will be a
caption at the top of your table to
start a new row within a table
use the tag TR if you wanted to draw
attention or create a header within your
table you would use the th tag if you
did not then you would use the TD tag
and this just creates an additional
column for xi1 close each column and
close each row and close the table
itself and that's basically all there is
to know about tables in the next
presentation and final presentation I
will go over everything you would ever
want to know about forms hope this helps
