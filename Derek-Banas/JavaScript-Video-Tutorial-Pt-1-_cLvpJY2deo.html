one of my JavaScript tutorial this
tutorial is gonna be very quick and I'm
going to go over most everything you
need to know to program in Java
scripting this one tutorial if you want
to see a slower version that goes
through this information much slower I
provide a link to another JavaScript
tutorial to that what we have here on
the screen is basic HTML I'm just going
to jump right into it normally you have
your JavaScript code in the head section
or you link to it I'm going to show you
how to do that later on but for now I'm
just basically and go into the body
section and I'm going to go over all the
different things that go into writing
JavaScript code first thing you want to
do is start with the script tag and then
you want to define the language is equal
to JavaScript right like that and I'm
going to follow that up with type equals
text word slash JavaScript and whenever
I create tags I like to automatically
close them and also what you're going to
do for browsers that do not have
JavaScript which really there aren't
many of them anymore but this is just a
precaution you want to put in the no
script tag which we have rights inside
of here and then you want to provide a
message that's going to go to the people
that do not have JavaScript enabled this
requires script for example inside of to
h3 tags close off that guy also to
protect in situations where people do
not have JavaScript running you want to
create an HTML comment section and how
you do that with this bracket right
inside of here you want to put all of
your JavaScript code in here and I'm
going to say hi script you don't need to
do this but it just provides information
on exactly why you are commenting out
all of this code and in this last line
right here close off the HTML comment
that's how you make comments in HTML
also by the way first thing what I'm
going to go over is variables and it's
very important to understand that
javascript is case sensitive that means
that all your variables and functions
all of their names must use the same
exact capitalization throughout all of
your programming code and your variables
when you define them must start with an
underscore a dollar sign or a letter
either lowercase or uppercase all of
them must start with that then after you
can use any of those symbols but you can
also use numbers so that's how you give
names inside of JavaScript there's four
basic datatypes there are numbers
strings boolean's and objects
there's also arrays but arrays and
JavaScript are actually looked upon as
objects if you want to write something
to the screen inside the JavaScript
start off with document right and then
for example I'm going to show you right
now the maximum number you can use
inside of JavaScript and just type this
guy in here right like that and I'm
going to put a plus sign and I'm going
to put a break symbol because while you
can put new lines in JavaScript they
don't really do anything inside of HTML
so there is the maximum number inside of
JavaScript but you also must understand
that javascript precision only works up
to 16 digits in length you go any
farther than 16 digits you can expect it
no longer to hold its precision so what
we're going to do is print the screen
here the maximum value as well as the
minimum value to the screen you can see
right here the maximum number inside of
JavaScript white a large number and the
minimum number inside of JavaScript if
you want any of this code I provide a
link to all the code in the underbar as
well as a link to an article that goes
into this information in depth then like
I said before there's also strings
inside of JavaScript and here I'm going
to create a variable with the VAR tag
here that says that you want to define a
variable that I'm creating a variable
name calling it samp underscore STR is
equal to here are some escape characters
and why I'm going into escape characters
is I'm going to show you the most
commonly escaped characters of course
you want to use a double quote you're
going to have two backslash followed by
double quote and if you want to show a
single quote you need to put a backslash
before that obviously if you want to put
a backslash in there you going to put
two of them in there and then false so
if you want to use tabs backslash T and
backslash and even though they're not
really technically going to work inside
of JavaScript but either way those are
the most common escaped characters just
so you understand again just backslash
must precede if you want these guys to
show up on the screen document write
prints them to screen and here I'm just
going to type in Sam underscore STR and
you could say here are some escape
characters and you can see the backslash
does not show up here does not show up
here or does not show up there so that's
how you would use those characters
inside a JavaScript and now I'll briefly
go over a couple different JavaScript
functions as this tutorial proceeds I'm
going to get more in depth in these or
each of these things
I just always see long drug our
tutorials in which people don't ever do
what I'm
right which is pack a ton of information
into one tutorial and I'm just creating
some strings here with some values I
like this if you want to combine two
strings you just put a plus sign between
them here I'm doing this to insert a
break statement inside of there I create
another one called combined and I'm
going to say that I want that to be
equal to first string plus just add
these strings together and now I combine
both of those values inside of one
string and if I want to print that out
the screen instead I'm going to put
combined in here linked first string
second string that came from this and
the value of combined is this string
Plus that string and then followed by
verax statement and we can do other
things inside of here like if I wanted
to print out the length of the string
just type in length o string right like
that and if I want the length of
combined the name of the strength all
that with length then I'm also going to
show you don't forget to put the plus
sign inside of here and if you wanted to
print out say a substring meaning part
of a string I'm going to take combined
and let's say that I want to be able to
grab string out of this guy so let's say
I want to print out string to the screen
well everything starts off with an index
of zero so the index of F in this string
right here would be zero so if I just
wanted to print out fi which they I want
the index of zero and it would print out
F then followed by one two three four
well if I want to print string out the
screen I this is index six and I
actually have to go one past that so six
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and
that will actually print out string to
the screen so start at the index of six
followed by twelve and then jump over
here and put in substring and it'll
print on exactly what I want and I'm
going to show you two other column and
string functions that are used like
let's say for example I wanted to print
out the last character of a string real
simple just come in here go combined and
then what I'm going to do is go
character at and I'm going to take
combined length minus one and that's
going to give me the last character in
the string it's going to print out to
screen here I'm also going to show you
how to print out the screen the index
value for the first location of in this
situation T that plus I just just go to
combined and fall
up with index of two followed by the
break symbol you can see it printed all
those out length of the string is 26
characters and then here it printed out
string starting from the sixth index the
whole way till the 11th or to the 12th
which is actually a blank space it
prints out that the last character in
the string is G and the index of T is 4
and here's the string 0 1 2 3 4 so
that's what that guy's talking about so
those are a bunch of different ways of
working with and manipulating strings
inside of JavaScript and now I'm going
to show you how to work with different
types of variables if you try to let's
say create a variable and even though
it's a number you're surrounding with
quotes it automatically makes it a
string and then you create another
variable it's actually going to tank a
value that is a number and you try to
add these two together
javascript is always going to assume
that if you are adding something
together and one of those values is a
string that you want it all to be
treated as a string and I'll show you an
example it'll make more sense so here
I'm creating a new variable called total
and I'm saying I want to combine the
values of num variable and string
variable however because there is no way
to multiply strings if you try to do
that javascript is going to assume that
you want the string to be treated as if
it was a number so here I'm going to
multiply a string times a regular number
it's automatically going to convert in
this situation this string value into a
number unlike up here where it
automatically treated this number value
as if it was a strength this will make
more sense so if I come in here and go 5
plus and equals and then follow that
with the value that total has and here
if I go 5 times 10 equals plus the total
after the multiplication and you can see
right here whenever one of these values
is a string it assumes that you want the
number to be a string and that's the
reason why you get printed out to screen
10 followed by the number 5 however
because there is no mo a to multiply
strings it automatically assumes that
you want this string which is the 5
right here to be treated as a number and
that's the reason why you get the return
value of 50 now you could also for
first data type conversion if you would
like to so for example let's say I want
to have total be equal to num underscore
variable plus and I want to force that
string to be looked upon as if it was a
number I would start off with number
this is a function and it's going to
convert this string into a number and
here I'm actually going to just copy
this guy right here put it inside of
there and go 5 plus 10 is equal to and
with the new value that is stored inside
of total you're going to see that this
time it treats it as if it is a number
because I converted it this time 5 plus
10 comes out to 15 so you use the number
function to force a string into being
looked at as if it was a number there's
also a string function just like there
is a number function so I'm going to
create another variable called num
underscore variable two and this time
I'm going to call the string function
and I'm going to force the number
variable to be treated as a string and
this time if I go numb underscore
variable + num underscore variable and
then copy these guys right here paste
and then put 2 inside of here and then
put 2 and so out of here
I'm going to see how those results
change here it actually looks at both of
these guys as if they are both numbers
and comes out to a total of 20 and here
because you forced the value of num var
2 to be equal to the string
representation of our this is treated as
if it they are both strengths and it's a
reason why you have 10/10 printed out to
the screen now let's say you want to
work with floats or just numbers that
have decimal places here I'm going to
create a variable called float var and
I'm going to give it a value of pi' just
a random number of digits there and I'm
going to create another one I'm going to
call this one float underscore string
I'm going to use the two fixed function
here to round this value of pi' to 5
digits that's what that two fixed does
right there if I want to print this on
screen underscore string reload it and
you'll see that it does cut them off to
5 digits so that's what to fix does
another neat function however you could
also use a function called parse and and
here it's going to print out the integer
or the decimal list word to screen I'm
just going to type in VAR IC int it's a
rebound float var in this situation and
I'll actually show you a couple more the
tight bulb function actually will return
the data type of whatever value you pass
it and just for good measure amount
print out the data type for both float
string and float for and you can see
that it properly represents that this is
a string and this is a number and here
you can see that it with the parse int
function that it automatically cut off
all the decimal places and just printed
out the integer representation for the
value of pi' and then you have boolean
variables they can only have one or
another of value false and false also is
looked upon as any value that is equal
to 0 or n a and n a n represents not a
number and bullying's can also have a
value of true which is literally
everything that is not either a value of
0 or a value of n a n don't worry about
the N part I'll get more into that later
so it's either true or false that's all
it is so bring that point across let's
create a bolin and here i'm going to
force the value just like I did with the
string and the number function to
convert the number 23 into a boolean
variable type boolean of 23 is put that
in there plus underscore var and you can
see here the boolean of 23 is true
remember everything that's not a 0 or
not a number is going to ultimately be
equal to true whenever you are forcing
things to become boolean values and
that's what we did with this boolean
function echo at right here I can also
show you a couple different ways that
you can compare values inside of
JavaScript and here I'll create a random
number 1 is equal to 5 and ver brand
number 2 is equal to 10 I can compare
these different values in multiple
different ways what I'm going to do is
come in here and say is 5 greater than
10 obviously I know the test is not true
and then I'm going to come in here and
go parenthesis random underscore number
1 then we'll put the greater than sign
inside
here Randor number two and then to show
you all the different ways to compare
all of these different values okay so we
can compare based off of greater than we
can also compare based off a greater
than or equal to we can also compare
based off of less than less than or
equal equal to which is two equal signs
or not equal to which is an exclamation
point followed by an equal sign we can
come in here and do this inside of the
actual place where we're doing this
testing right like that and you can see
that it properly picks out is 5 greater
than 10 no false greater than or equal
false less than or equal true less than
or equal you can see all of those things
all worked out and that is how you use
different comparison operators you can
see more of this here actually later on
in this tutorial and the other way that
you would compare different values
inside of JavaScript is through what are
called logical operators and it's better
to just show you here are the logical
operators there's and there's or and
there's not that's it so I'm going to
show you exactly how those work through
an example here again so I'm going to
print out doc right and this guy's going
to print to screen and I'm going to ask
it a simple question on the set is 5
less than 10 and 5 not equal to 10 okay
this is just a string over here is where
I'm actually going to do all the tests
so I'm actually going to need two
parentheses here I'm checking to see if
5 is less than the value of 10 which is
stored in this random number 2 and to
compare that both of these results are
true or put to n symbols inside of there
I'm going to actually copy this paste
this on screen I'm going to say is
random number 1 not equal to the value
that's stored in random number 2 and
then to demonstrate all the other
logical operators that are available
which there's only three altogether
print this out a couple different times
in the second check I'm going to say is
5 greater than 10 or is 5 not equal to
10 then I just have to come over here
type in that and then put the or symbol
the difference between these two is the
only way this is going to return a value
of true is if this is true and this is
true the way this will return a value of
true is if this or this has a value of
true in both circumstances are going to
come back both true because in this
situation five is less than 10 and five
is not equal to ten and in this
situation only one of these needs to be
true and this one is true so we know
we're going to get a value of true here
and here I'm going to use the knot
statement to just give me the opposite
of what it's supposed to give me again
we'll get more into the knot statement
and how it's actually useful later on
but here I'm saying is five less than
ten and you would think yes this would
give a value of true well it does but
the knot symbol immediately flips it
here we're checking if five is less than
ten yes that's true
and we're also checking that five is not
equal to ten and that is also true
that's why we get a value of true here
and here one of these guys is true
meaning that five is not equal to ten
and that's why we get a true value and
here we get a false value for if five is
less than ten which is obviously true
but because we put an on symbol in there
that kicks back the opposite result
which is false hopefully that makes
sense I know that's a lot of information
but we're just moving right along
because I'm trying to give you an
overview of the whole entire single
language all in one little tutorial
which is completely crazy now I'm going
to go into arrays here we're going to
create a a variable that isn't going to
be of type array it's going to be called
vehicles how you create an array start
off with the name new followed by a ra
ray like that and then here I'm going to
put a bunch of different types of
vehicles inside of this array and just
like before when we were talking about
how strings have different indexes well
with arrays you can actually store whole
entire words or whole entire numbers or
anything you want and they all index the
same way that strings do except in this
situation car is going to be in this
arrays index value of 0 then trucks
going to be in the index for this array
of 1 &amp;amp; 2 all right and you can see that
right here right Aang that plus I'm
going to go vehicles boom boom boom I
want the second value and that is the
reason why I'm putting one in there
because the first value actually has an
index value of 0 you can see it kicks
back the second item in the array is
truck and you can see up here that
indeed truck is the second value in
there now there is another
way where you can cycle through or in
programming language it's what they call
iterating through you can actually print
out all the values in the array by
starting off with the command for and
then give it a junk variable that's
going to temporarily hold values this
situation McCaw by and follow it within
vehicles the name of the array you're
also going to see more of this guy later
date what this guy's going to do is it's
going to cycle through and print out all
of the different values in the array so
in array and then I'm going to follow
that with plus sign vehicles and again
here I'm going to put the value of I and
this is going to start off with the
value of zero and then go to one and
then go to two for each of the different
values in the array and it's going to do
that automatically because that's what
this for in statement does for you and
you can see right here it's exactly what
it did print out the first indexed value
the second but index value and the third
index value right to screen so now you
know the basics of creating arrays
finding values in arrays and cycling
through arrays so now we'll get onto the
conditional operator and what these are
these are all conditional statements all
together I'm going to show you all the
different conditional statements and
what they do is they perform certain
actions if certain conditions are met
that's why they're called conditional
operators so I'm going to create a
variable that I called random VAR and
what I'm going to say here is if Phi is
less than 10 and then I follow that with
question mark I want the value of random
variable to be equal to the string that
says that 5 is less than 10 right like
that and if that is not true which it is
indeed drew what I'm going to do is type
5 is greater than 10 which we know isn't
true okay so just go through this again
this is the conditional operator
basically what it does is it said if
this condition has a value of true then
we want to assign the value of this
variable to whatever is here if this
condition is not true we want to assign
the value to this variable to the second
guy that lies after this colon right
here here we'll just say Rand or equals
I like that plus and just type in Rand
or you can see Rand or equals 5 is less
than 10 and 5 is less than 10 is the
right here and the reason why it was
assigned that value is because indeed
five is less than 10 and another
conditional that everybody who knows
anything about programming is well aware
of is the if statement and in JavaScript
if works just like it does in most of
the languages here I'll say if five is
greater than ten
I want certain conditions to be
performed and what it will do is perform
everything that lies between this
opening curly brace and this closing
curly brace I'm only going to ask it to
do one thing I'm gonna pronouncing each
side of here with document.write five is
greater than ten which obviously it is
not so if I want to run another
condition inside a JavaScript I need to
use what is called an else if statement
and here what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say if five is less than ten
and I'm gonna perform all kinds of other
additional commands inside of these
curly brackets and copy that copy paste
and here I'm going to say less than ten
okay so that'll print that out and
anything else that lies inside of these
curly brackets but what would happen if
I change the value of ten here to five
and did likewise there well in this
situation five isn't greater than five
and five isn't less than five so what
we're going to need is an else statement
obviously five is equal to five and in
that situation what we're going to do is
to print out the screen and then of
course come down here put that curly
bracket in there and you can see that
indeed that did print that out the only
other conditional statement that is
available to you inside of JavaScript is
the switch statement basically what that
does like let's say I create a variable
called state and give it the value of
Pennsylvania that's a string of quarters
well what I do with a switch statement
is it's going to test the value that is
stored inside of state right like that
and what it's going to do is it's going
to provide different options so if the
value of state in this situation is
California we're going to perform
certain actions you can just define case
followed by the value that you think
this state might have and then what
we're going to do is print out warmer
than me on the screen and if you want to
jump out of this whole entire
statement which of course is also going
to end with a curly bracket C open curly
braket closing curly bracket once you
get a hit here where they entered this
state of California where you're not
going to want them to continue on
looking because we already know what the
value of this string is so if we want to
jump out of this statement all together
we put the break command and we're going
to see the break command here in a
second again and that's going to
continue or cease to continue looking to
see what the value of this guy is let's
say they also vania here I'm going to
say same as me and what am I going to do
after I get a hit on the value I'm going
to jump out of this guy well what if
they enter something else and I don't
know what it is how are we going to
protect against that easy
default if they do not enter California
or Pennsylvania in this special
situation we want to give them some sort
of answer so here we're going to say I
don't and then remember if I want to use
a quote actually technically I don't
have to do this because there's double
quotes around it what I'm going to do it
anyway just because I just feel like it
and I'm just going to put I don't know
and you're going to want to enter break
after that same as me because I assigned
Pennsylvania to this guy it hit on
Pennsylvania is the value of this string
that is stored in state and that's the
reason why I printed out same as me to
the screen so those are all of the
different ways you can perform different
actions based off of whether different
conditions have been met inside of
JavaScript
remember I'm covering at all I know this
is fast if you don't understand anything
just leave a question below and I will
cover it now I'm going to go through all
the different ways you can loop inside a
JavaScript I'm kind of doing this just
for fun just to see what happens kind of
thinking people might just start
screaming at me but hey whatever one way
you can loop inside a JavaScript there's
actually well I showed you four in two
loop through different arrays and also
different objects which we're going to
get into objects in another tutorial
I tried to cover that that would really
make your head explode if you obviously
didn't know what JavaScript was first in
looping let's say I want to loop between
all values between 1 and 10 I'd use a
while loop and as I was looping through
all these different guys I actually want
to print to screen their values and I'll
just come in here go count which is the
value that I have
here when it first hits this Lube count
is going to have the value of one and if
I decide to jump through here and I also
want to put a closing curly bracket but
forgot something because if I hit this
and go through here what's going to
happen counts going to have a value of
one and it's going to continue
indefinitely until the computer crashes
to print one to screen so what do I need
to do I need to increase the value of
count how do I do that this is a
shortcut way to increase the value of
count by one each time this is hit so
all this means is increase the value of
count by one and you can see it printed
the value is one two three four five the
whole way through ten but what would
happen if I just for the heck of it
decide that I do not want to print
anything that is not a even number well
here I'm going to show you another
different statement that you can choose
inside a JavaScript and it's called the
continue statement and it's very similar
to break which we're actually going to
see break here again so one thing that I
can do is take count and get the modulus
of two what modulus does for you is it
returns the remainder after a division
so for example if the value of count was
equal to two well the modulus of that
would obviously be equal to zero because
two divided by two has no remainder so
what this guy's going to do is in
situations where this is even it's going
to of course increase the value of count
and then what it's going to do is I'm
going to call the continue statement and
then what continue is going to do is
it's going to jump out it's going to
eliminate this information down here
it's going to ignore it as if it never
happened and it shouldn't jump back up
to the while statement and then test if
it should continue looping through this
statement and you can see that it did
that right there
two four six eight ten it only printed
out even numbers now I keep talking
about how I'm going to get in here and
explain again the break statement
remember continue once it's hit jumps
out ignores everything that follows in
between this opening curly brackets here
and it jumps back here and it continues
to iterate from the beginning well break
is the absolute opposite here I'm going
to say well if count ever is equal to
let's say six for example I want you to
jump out of the entire while loop and
actually come down here
are after the closing curly bracket that
fall is the while statement let's say if
count is equal to six and I'm just going
to simply say break and if I do that
point you can see that it only printed
out two and four and that's what break
does continue makes you restart the
beginning of the loop break make you
jump completely out of the loop
altogether so those are those two guys
we also have the do-while loop the only
difference between while and do-while is
the do-while loop will iterate through
the cycle at least once even if the
value is false and how you start it
awful is you type in do in here I'm just
going to come in and go document.write
and I'm going to type in count right
like that and then here I'm going to
show you how to decrease the value of a
variable by one using this shortcut code
it's called the decrement shortcut now
all it does is it says hey I want you to
take the value of count and decrease it
by one and that's exactly what it does
and the do-while loop you actually check
whether it's true after you cycle
through and it might not be immediately
apparent to why you would ever want to
always do this and as this tutorial
continues I'll show you different
reasons why that might be true
so actually you'll see here the count is
equal to ten and the wild check down
here is a check to see if count is
greater than ten so technically this
shouldn't be printed and it wouldn't be
printed if this was a while loop but
you'll see here in this situation that
of course it is printed once they do
print out the value of count but then
after it hits this and it is indeed
false it jumps down here and continues
to cycle through additional information
in the program there's the do-while
statement and last but not least we have
the for statement here variable count is
equal to zero this is how the for
statement is different remember with the
wild that do while we were actually
creating this guy outside of those
looping structures well with the for
loop you actually create them inside of
it count is less than it's all
self-contained it's really the only
difference between the for loop and the
while loop everything is all in one
place you can see that I'm also going to
increment this guy here but don't put
the semicolon there and this for loop is
going to actually go through and perform
all of these actions just like we did
with the while and the do-while loop
that you saw previously blink and you
could use the break statement and
continue statement many of those other
things inside of here of course with no
problem at all and as your final test
and it's absolutely insane tutorial
where I teach you almost everything
about JavaScript in one tutorial I'm
actually going to show you how to embed
code from an external javascript file
and how you do that if you're still
there what I'm going to do is I'm going
to jump down here this is how you embed
external javascript again I'm using an
HTML comment inside of here
link to external write like that and of
course you don't have to type that but I
just like typing that in there and then
we're going to link to that file you go
script language is equal to JavaScript
and then you provide the location of
your javascript file and you end that
with dot j s to represent that this is
indeed a JavaScript file and here you're
actually going to put your script tag
afterwards what do we need to do we
actually I have to create the add
function to javascript file and you
create functions inside of JavaScript in
any programming language just so you
don't have to do things over and over
again so here what I'm going to do and
I'm going to create a function by
starting it off with the word function
and I'm going to give this function a
name of add these and then I'm going to
define that we expect this function is
going to be passed one value that we're
going to call number one and another
value that we're going to call number
two right like that and in JavaScript
like we did in for statements and a lot
of other different things in this
tutorial you surround everything that
you want to be performed in this guy
with curly brackets and this guy's going
to do some really simple addition it's
going to create a variable called total
and it's going to take the values stored
in the variable called number one I'm
just going to add it to the value of
number two and then what it's going to
do so we're going to return the value of
this guy right here with the return
statement real simple that's all it's
going to do and that's all the code you
have to write that's it I'm going to
come in here paste in the value that it
has right there and then we're going to
jump back into our regular JavaScript
code we have right here and we're going
to use the document right again function
call over in here between our two script
eggs that we had previously we're going
to call that function that we just
created in an external file and here
we're going to say if 5 plus 25 is equal
to and then we're going to combine the
value that this function passes back
we're going to give it a value 5 and 25
and then end with a very statement and
you can see that it properly called that
function from an external file ran that
function and it printed all that out to
screen so this is a completely crazy
tutorial but most you people probably
have not even stuck with it the whole
way but it was fun for me to try this
out if you totally hate it please tell
me and I will stop doing tutorials like
this otherwise if you liked it or you
have any questions or comments leave
