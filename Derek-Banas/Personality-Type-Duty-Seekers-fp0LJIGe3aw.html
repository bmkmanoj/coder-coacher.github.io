gonna go over the personality styles
known as Duty seekers in detail and Duty
seekers are people that predominantly
trust past experiences and facts and
plan before they act these are also
people that have the codes that you
could see here on the left side of your
screen meaning that if you took the
personality test I provide it with a
link over here to it and you come up
with these codes this is you you're
either a bull or giver a recipe follower
or a planner now specifically bulls love
to control everything they're involved
with they thrive at making logical
decisions while focusing on their goals
as well as the goals of others they have
opinions on nearly everything and will
tell you them and they will get things
done that's what a bull does they move
forward and get projects finished they
tend to be workaholics because their
whole entire Drive and life is the
finished projects and they respect
others who stand up to them if those
people indeed have all the facts
they will make what sacrifices are
needed to honor their commitments at all
time and they focus on solving problems
and then moving on to the next they're
good at weeding out illogical and
inefficiencies they take calculated
risks backed up with research they are
tough but fair with people and can be a
lot of fun after the work is done they
love having responsibilities and giving
their advice and can be trusted to not
give up until a goal is met givers on
the other hand even though they are duty
seeking are warm-hearted friendly types
that love spending time with others they
love feeling needed and appreciated and
while they know how to make other people
feel special they often disregard their
own needs they live in a world of
shoulds and should not and they're
obsessed with how others see them they
diligently get the job done through
organization they respect their leaders
and believe others should do as well
they lead through actions that are
admired and by treating others warmly
they create harmony within groups they
are extremely cooperative they create a
routine and follow diligently they
create teamwork by becoming friends with
each member of the group they're great
at follow-through they pay attention to
the details they
sure decisions are made but don't feel
the need to make them they focus on
people's best qualities at all time then
you have the recipe followers this is
the most predominant personality in the
United States they're very responsible
and dependable people they're very
composed people a few words who value
their privacy they expect people to be
on time and organized and make sure they
are as well they're very thorough people
that value solid concrete results they
dislike this organization prefer a
disciplined active approach to get
things done there are little workers
that work hard while taking on the
skills needed to get the job done they
analyze their work to make sure
everything is as perfectly done as
possible they are devoted detailed
oriented workers they are very loyal the
word is their bond they will not
tolerate those who do not follow the
rules they do not waste time worrying
about society's views on duress any job
worth doing to them is worth doing with
perfection giving them a list of rules
and a job and they will get it done
hence the name recipe followers and
finally you have the planners they're
dependable people who will go to any
lengths to be of service this is the
most predominant personality for females
in the United States they do what is
expected of them and don't question
authority they will take on as many
responsibilities as asked to them and do
their best to diligently handle them
they diligently work through problems
paying attention to each detail they
don't need to be in the limelight they
constantly strive for perfection and
beat themselves up over any error you
can trust them to get the work done
without pushing them before they begin a
new project they diligently prepare
step-by-step what they're going to do
hence the name planners always willing
to help co-workers and subordinates
alike they're very much self-motivated
they will respect Authority in question
why others don't they want to work with
people that they respect and they
express their love and respect by
attending to people's needs and those
are all the duty seekers if you want
