tutorial on how to make black bean
veggie burgers first off we're going to
start doing it for you to get ourselves
a whole onion and chop this guy up dice
it right here we can use a whole onion
this is going to make 16 burgers total
and you can freeze these and they still
taste very very good then turn your pan
on high and throw in we're gonna set the
onions aside and we're gonna get herself
a red pepper and we're gonna chop it up
pretty much same size as the onions take
off seeds out of course or you leave a
couple in there you worry too much about
the size of these peppers because okay
then you get yourself fourth cup of
garlic
remember this pan is hot throw that in
there then you're gonna add your onion
and in the pepper that you just cut up
and you're gonna cook this for
approximately five minutes until the
onion is translucent or taste sweet okay
it is translucent and the onions are
sweet and now you're going to add four
tablespoons of ketchup one-half teaspoon
of turmeric and 1/2 teaspoon of cumin
and stir that in there for approximately
one minute okay there's the consistency
of your stuff and you're gonna throw
this in a food processor then you're
gonna take three cups of black beans you
can either cook the dried ones are just
going yourself canned black beans
doesn't matter there you go then to that
you're gonna add two cups of rice this
is jasmine rice then you're gonna add
three cups of breadcrumbs this is a half
cup measure so I'm gonna put six half
cups in there obviously go through the
a little bit too much from my food
processor so I'm gonna dump it in ball
and start by hands as you can see these
are very very dense burgers and then
you're gonna need to make your patties
out of your little mix you have right
here and each patty is approximately 1/2
of a cup
now I'm gonna pay them that is heated to
50%
we added some oil if you wanted to keep
this a little bit a little more low-fat
you can use pan cooking spray and he's
gonna cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each
side and here they are after the first
flip just you can see the texture of the
bean burger then you can put it on
whatever you want of course here put it
on a hamburger bone and then you can put
some lettuce on it and you can put the
world's smallest tomato on it and of
course onion and any other toppings that
you like leave any questions or comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
