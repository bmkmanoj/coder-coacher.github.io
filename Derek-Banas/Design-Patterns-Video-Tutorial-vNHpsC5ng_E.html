brand-new design patterns video tutorial
you learn about design patterns so that
you can solve software design problems
in tried-and-true ways and I'm going to
try to do a whole bunch of different
things in this tutorial that I've never
done before it's going to be very code
heavy however it's also going to bounce
back and forth between the presentation
style that you see right here we're
going to start off in the beginning of
this tutorial reviewing basic olp
concepts and not so basic opie concepts
and I hope that this is very interactive
and you guys talk to me and tell me what
you don't understand because this is
definitely going to be to a certain
extent a lecture sort of presentation
lecture doesn't mean it's boring it just
means that I want you to completely
understand this concept now of course if
you've followed any of my other
tutorials and you have any interest in
java at all which is going to be our
chosen language for analyzing design
patterns you of course create a class
that class is made up of fields or
instant variables and these are all the
things that the object knows about
itself it also is going to define all
the methods or functions that this
object is going to need or in other
words what this object is going to do
whenever you are going to be creating
super classes like we have here with
animal as well as subclasses like we
have here with bird and other subclasses
such as dog you're going to figure out
what things are similar between all
these subclasses and then you are going
to technical term abstract out those
features into the superclass then after
that point you're going to either like
we do with the bird subclass up here
you're going to override certain methods
like we did here with move because a
bird more than likely is going to move
in a different way than most other
animals or you're going to extend the
superclass like we did here with dog
where we added a brand new method called
dig hole and this to a certain extent is
a UML diagram which we're going to get a
lot more into my goal here is to turn
you into a very very good programmer
that can create almost anything and this
whole entire game that is going on here
where we're taking animal and creating
bird from it and taking animal and
creating dog from it is what we refer to
as inherits it is inheriting a
all the fields as well as all of the
methods of the superclass then of course
you're going to want to take all of the
fields and make them private and we're
going to get more into that in a second
and you're going to create public
methods that you are then going to use
to change these private variables that
you have up here and as you can see here
we have the dog subclass of animal and
we're going to extend the animal class
using the extends word and then we are
going to further extend the animal class
by adding the new dig hole method like
we have right here and just want to
reiterate whenever you are going to
extend a superclass you of course all of
the methods as well as fields that are
in the superclass are already going to
be defined inside of the subclass dog
like we have here in this situation and
it is your responsibility only to define
what things change in the subclass so
what exactly is main four main is going
to be used from here on out I know in
the past I use main for all kinds of
things but from here on out main is
going to create all your objects and
then help them to interact with each
other like we did here we took the dog
subclass and named it Grover we're going
to create a new dog object and of course
we're going to set the value for name
using the setname method we are not
going to from this day forward ever try
to set a value for a field by
referencing int directly why well here's
a good reason it is called encapsulation
and what it allows us to do is to
protect all of our data like we have
here I have set weight now if somebody
wanted to come in here to the dog object
and give it a weight that was less than
zero that would never make any sense so
we can perform certain types of checks
inside of these methods like we do here
to make sure that the weight is greater
than zero
before we assign this new weight to our
dog object otherwise we're going to
throw an error and this by the way is
called a parameter whenever you define
the type of variable that is going to be
passed to a method it is referred to as
a parameter this however which is the
value that is going to be passed to the
method set name like we have here in
this situation is referred to as the
argument and then
we are going to like I said before hide
all of our data by making this private
meaning our fields or our instance
variables and then using what are called
setter and getter methods to make
changes to these private variables that
we have up here so what's the difference
between an instance variable versus a
local variable and I'm going to
demonstrate all this stuff by the way
inside of code an instance variable or a
field is declared inside of a class like
we have here with the private int weight
however local variables are going to be
created inside of methods like we have
here with gram mult
and this method if you don't know is
just going to convert pounds into grams
so this is a field it is created for the
class and this is a local variable it's
created inside of methods so how do you
decide if a class should extend another
class one way is to use the is a
principal and it's quite simple all you
would simply say is is a dog and animal
if the answer to that is yes and chances
are dog would be a good subclass for the
superclass animal however you can see
down here when we use the is a principal
one is a dog a cat this makes absolutely
no sense so in this situation cat would
not be a superclass for the dog you can
also use the has a principal to decide
if a certain class should have a
specific field if you can say dog has a
height well that makes sense then in
that situation that height would be a
field for the object or the class name
dog so when exactly should you use
inheritance well like we said before if
there is a principal works like dog is
an animal works then chances or
inheritance makes a lot of sense
also when a subclass needs most of the
methods in the superclass like we have
with the animal in relation to the dog
class we're almost every method inside
of animal is going to work with dog that
also is a good situation where
inheritance is going to help you out you
should however not use inheritance just
to reuse code once again if there is a
principle doesn't work or the is and
principle doesn't work inheritance also
probably doesn't make sense so what are
some other reasons why we use
inheritance
it helps us avoid duplicate code changes
to the superclass
passcode is instantly reflected in all
of the subclasses and the user knows
that all subclasses have all of the
methods automatically that are created
inside of the superclass so let's jump
into the code start creating some of
these guys so we're going to come in
here I have all the code underneath the
video and and it's actually a little bit
more verbose than what I'm going to
present here so we're going to create
our animal class and we're going to
create a private string and it's going
to be named private double going to be
height private int is going to be weight
private string is going to represent
sound and then after we create all those
guys we need to create our setter and
getter methods so public void set name
it's going to receive a string new name
and whenever I only have one line
statements like this I like to keep
everything on one line so I'm going to
say whatever the value of new name is in
this situation I'm going to set it up
that way and of course we're going to
have to create a getter function it's
going to return a string yet name and
again because it's only going to do one
thing I'm going to put this on one line
and it's going to return the value of
whatever name is and I'm actually going
to get height out of here because I
don't need it for this part of the
presentation copy that do a couple
things here like we said before with set
weight it's going to receive an integer
it's going to be new weight whatever in
this situation this guy's going to do
more than one thing so I'm not going to
try to put all that on one line which
would be a horrible idea I'm going to
instead go if and then I'm going to
check if the weight that they are going
to be sending is greater than zero if it
is and that makes sense I'm going to say
weight is equal to whatever the value of
new weight is right like that else I can
do something like system out and say
something like weight must be bigger
than zero and then also with our getter
function it's just going to go get
weight and then return whatever the
value of weight is pretty simple and
then I can also do a similar thing with
sound which is going to make a lot of
sense and of course change this to int
and then here we're just going to change
this to set sound new sound sound new
sound get sounds return sound and that
is all that we're going to need to
define at this point in time for animal
dot Java and next we're going to create
dog
and to extend this guy we're just going
to go public class dog extends animal
which is the super class and then we're
going to go public void because this
extends that super class system out and
let's just say dug a hole it's a pretty
simple and then the constructor of
course is going to initialize every
object that is created and we're just
going to go public dog if you want to
reference the constructor file or the
initializer method for this superclass
or animal you just call super just like
that and then of course we could do
things like set sound equal to bark like
we did right there well now that we know
that let's go in and create our cat so
we're going to jump into cat Java and
it's going to be very similar and except
this is of course going to be called cat
it's not going to dig a hole so we can
get rid of that even though cats do dig
holes but in this situation it's not
going to and then we're going to go cat
reference to super and our cat in this
situation is going to say meow and now
that we have that defined we're going to
create another class called work with
animals which is going to do exactly
that and this is going to be public
class work with animals and we're going
to see how these guys work together
inside of here you see alec static void
main which we've seen many times before
then we can start playing with these
guys so we're going to create a new dog
object and it's going to be called Fido
is equal to new dog that's a call to the
constructor file to initialize Fido and
then we can start doing things like Fido
set name and give it the name Fido and
then we can check that that name
actually stuck by going Fido get name
then we're going to do a couple other
things like photo access the method that
is only inside of the dog class and
we're going to see exactly what happens
when we try to give Fido a negative
weight let's file save that and execute
it and you can see right here fight owes
print it out and that comes from this
line right here dug a hole comes
whenever we call the method inside of
the dog class and weight must be bigger
which is the error that is triggered
from the animal class whenever we try to
give it a negative weight something that
comes up all the time that people have
trouble with is what you have to
understand is
everything is passed by value inside of
Java so that means if I come in here and
create an integer and give it the value
of 10 and then I'm actually going to
have to jump into fight or into the dog
class to create this guy I'm going to
create a method called public void
change VAR int random number and I'm
going to use the same exact name random
number is equal to 12 I'm gonna give it
a value of 12 here and we're just going
to copy this guy up here don't want to
copy that and then go R and numb in
method and I'm going to say something
like R and numb okay so R and numb was
passed into this and then I gave it a
value of 12 and then I'm going to print
out ran numb on the screen inside of the
method meanwhile after I save that I'm
going to jump back over into the work
with animals class and I'm going to go
fight Oh change bar and pass it random
number like that now based off of doing
that after I have already printed this
out the screen and random has changed
values I'm going to go R and numb after
method call like this and then print out
the value for random number you're going
to see random number here is 10 then we
call this method which is over here
inside a dog which changed the value of
random number to 12 random number in
method is going to print out 12 here
however when we bounce back over here
you're going to see this says 10 let's
execute it just to show you and there
you are random number in two methods 12
random number after the method call is
10 nothing has changed here and this
just it reinforces the fact that
whenever you pass a value to a method
even if it is passed through a variable
this on the screen is identical to this
so just understand that and let's undo
that that comes up way more often than
you would imagine
and objects on the other hand are passed
by references so down inside of here
let's just do it right here I'm going to
go public static void and static in this
situation what this guy means is that
any methods that are in a class however
they are not tied to an object must be
labeled as static so what static means
is every single object that
is ever created from this class they're
all going to have the same static
methods as well as static variables and
I'll get more into static variables
probably in the next part of the
tutorial but that's what static means
static unlike methods like we have here
with animal set name see you can see
here there is no static that's because
every single object is going to have its
own special set name method that it can
work with meanwhile this guy here is not
we're going to change object name and
we're going to say that it receives an
object and I'm just going to let it be
called Fido and then I'm going to go
Fido set name and I'm going to give it
the value of Marcus now if this worked
the way that other variables worked
remember this is an object or a
reference to an object anyway then the
value would not change whenever we would
go change object name and we pass it the
dog object named Fito and then we print
out the screen dog named after method
call and Flatow
get name and if we save that and execute
it you're going to see that the dog's
name has been changed to Marcus like you
have right there there should be a space
in there and there you go now you can
see Marcus so this is a reference to the
object that is being passed any changes
to this object will affect this object
across all of your code and this differs
from regular old variables whenever they
are passed just simply by value now in
the next part of the tutorial I'm going
to get into polymorphism abstract
classes interfaces final and a whole
bunch of other things that come up all
the time in regards to object-oriented
programming

or comments below otherwise the next
