17 of my learn to program series in this
part of the tutorial we're gonna
continue on part 3 of my regular
expression part of this tutorial in
which we will cover back references look
ahead look behind negative look ahead
and negative look behind along with a
whole bunch other different things if
you haven't seen part one of the regular
expressions tutorial and part two as
well I provide a link here to that and
as well in the description you'll find a
link to the entire playlist
you should watch all these videos in
order because otherwise you may be
confused also in the description is a
link to all of the code as well as a
transcript of this video and I have a
lot to do so let's get into it okay so
here is our cheat sheet it's gotten a
little bit bigger and this is every
single thing you've learned about
regular expressions so foreign in the
first two parts of this tutorial we
learned here that we can search for our
regular expression in this string using
search to get either true or false back
we also learned we can use find all to
get all of the regular expression
matches in this string and we could also
use length to find out the total number
of matches we can use compile to get
ourselves a pattern object that's going
to come with a whole bunch of methods
such as substitution and with
substitution we can substitute whatever
regular expression matches we have here
inside of this string and then
substitute whatever we have here at
those matches and here are all the
individual specific codes I'm not gonna
go through them all like I said in the
description you can get this and we can
learn some more all right so we're done
with our review now let's start learning
about back references okay now our back
reference is gonna allow us to reuse the
expression that precedes it now I'm
gonna start off here with a silly
example to show exactly how they work
and then I will create a more complex
example to demonstrate how they are more
commonly used in the real world so what
I want to do is I want to match for cat
here and specifically what I am trying
to do is I'm trying to match for a match
that has the exact same match
before it and in this situation that's
gonna be cat I'm gonna demonstrate it so
you will completely understand it
alright so what I'm going to do here
first I'm going to create my regular
expression call compiled on this I'm
gonna use a raw string here and
specifically what I'm looking to do is
match a word boundary and then one or
more characters followed by a space and
if it is then followed by the same exact
match I want to return it and how I'm
going to return that is by surrounding
it with parentheses and we surround what
are called sub matches with parentheses
to receive them as you saw in the last
part of the tutorial so here we go what
I want to get here is a word boundary
and then I want to get either letters or
numbers and specifically I want to match
for one or more of those letters or
numbers I then I'm looking for a space
and I want to match for one or more of
what precedes that which is going to be
the space and then you're going to put
in a backslash and a one and this is the
back reference this is a reference to
this guy right here and this is the back
reference so what I am basically looking
for is a match like this which is going
to match for every single one of these
guys but specifically what I want to
match for is a situation in which what
is here is exactly the same as what is
here and we only get that match whenever
we have cat cats I'm gonna show two
examples here and a whole bunch of
examples of this tutorial continues
believe me by the end of this you will
completely understand how back
references work all right so then we got
to get our total matches and we're going
to do that with find all fashion the
regular expression and then random
string we can also print out the total
number of matches that we received just
by length and matches and then we can
print out all of our results and if we
do that you can see we found one match
and that is going to be for cat okay so
there is a simple example now what I'm
going to do is show
more of a real-world example in which we
use a back reference to provide or to
cause a substitution okay so let's say
that we had a link like this just a
simple old link and put single quotes in
here so that doesn't mess that up then
inside of it we went and threw a bold
tag and then we just have the link is
the name of that link and then we close
off the link itself alright so what we
want to do in this situation is we want
to match for any situation in which we
have these bold tags like you can see
right there but what I want to do is use
a sub expression to grab the link out of
there and then delete the bold tags and
just put the link back inside of there
okay so how are we going to do that well
I just need to match the bold tags so
I'm gonna do bold like that and then
what I want to grab out is going to be
anything and that's gonna be 0 or more
and I want to make this lazy so I'm
gonna put a question mark in there so I
get the least number of results and then
I'm gonna put my closing bold tag okay
so what I'm grabbing out of here is this
guy and what I'm replacing is this whole
entire thing now how I can do this is
let's go random string is going to be
equal to or e sub I'm gonna throw in my
regular expression inside of here and
then I can reference my BAC reference
right like that and that just means the
first reference that's what that whole
point is we'll get into using multiple
back references here in a second and
then I can do random string and then
quite simply I can just print out random
string inside of there
and run it and you can see that we went
in here and we replace the bold tags and
just left the link inside of there so
that's one specific example of how you
would use back reference a lot they are
very very useful whenever it comes to
working with substitutions let's go and
get rid of all this stuff because it's
wrong really gonna matter and now I'll
show you even another example of how we
can use back references specifically for
substitutions let's say that we received
a telephone numbers
four one two one two all right so this
is the number we received and what we
want to do is match the phone number
using multiple sub expressions and then
what we want to do for our output is
have this come out as four one two five
five five one two one two exactly like
that so this is what we're taking in and
this is what we want to have as our
final output so how are we going to use
back references to do that well come
down into our regular expression area
and we're going to specifically come in
here and we're going to look for digits
and we're going to look for a specific
number of them being three and you can
see here we're getting a sub expression
and then we're going to get another
batch of these guys so we're going to
have another set of digits and in this
situation once again we're going to get
three we're gonna stay inside of that
sub expression because we don't want to
get out and there's your D and then
there's going to be four digits for that
guy all right so now just come in here
and do our substitution it's gonna be
very easy there just leave this as read
the X like that and then inside of here
we will put inside of parentheses the
first sub expression that we matched and
then after that we'll follow with the
second sub expression this got right
here that starts right here and goes
through the whole way to the end of that
if we run it you can see exactly we went
in there and grabbed and changed
everything exactly the way we wanted you
can see just how simple it is to use
back references to do things that are
rather complicated it would I mean this
is pretty much one or two lines of code
if you tried to do this using other
string operators it could really be a
hassle so that's just another example of
why regular expressions are extremely
powerful and now it is time for your
very first problem what I want you to do
is I want you to receive a string that's
gonna look something like this
or exactly like this actually
youtube.com and then you're also going
to be able to work with non secure
connections here google.com and then
what I want you to do is grab the URL
and provide this phone
output exactly as you can see right
there so you're gonna jump in you're
gonna grab this individual URL you're
automatically going to generate a link
and throw it inside of there as the
reference and then you're also going to
put in whatever the URL is inside and
they're all on separate lines so pause
your video and try that out and of
course we're going to be using back
reference substitutions to do so and see
what you get okay so hopefully you got
that right and if you didn't don't worry
about it we're just here learning and
learning is a whole lot to do with
making mistakes so what are we trying to
do here well we are specifically going
to want to get the whole entire link
here so I'm going to create a sub
expression inside of here and I'm gonna
type in HTTP and then an S however we
don't know if that s is always gonna be
there so we put a question mark inside
of there pretty rational colon two
forward slashes and then we also want to
get another sub expression because we
want to get this guy right here also all
by itself so in that situation we're
going to put backslash W as well as a
period because there's periods inside of
our URL we then got one to get one or
more for that match specifically and we
want to close off our sub expression now
down inside of this guy it's gonna get a
little bit more complicated we're gonna
come in and a H reference is gonna be
equal to and then inside of here we'll
get our first match which is going to be
the entire URL see the sub expression
starts here and ends here and then the
second one starts there and ends there
so that's gonna handle that for us then
we're gonna close that off and then we
want to get the second sub expression so
we just put a backslash in a two and
then we want to close off our link
altogether and then we could throw a
newline in there if we want to do that
and if we run it you're gonna see that
it comes back and gives us our exact
results exactly the way that we wanted
them there is the entire link here is
the shortened URL and there is the
entire URL so pretty cool stuff
hopefully you guys got that
yeah once again if you didn't don't
worry about it so now let's jump in and
take a look at look ahead now a look
ahead is going to define a pattern to
match but not return and the way you
would define this expression is quite
simply just put a parentheses question
mark is equal to and whatever your
expression is so let me just show you an
example here and I'll make a lot more
sense so let's say that we have 1 2 3 &amp;amp;
4 and what I want to do is grab all the
letters and numbers of one or more in
length separated by a word boundary but
don't include those word boundaries so
let's just come in here and that just
means I don't I want to get these
specific results but I do not want the
spaces inside of there how do I do that
well I'm looking for letters or numbers
specifically I'm looking for one or more
and I want to specifically look for word
boundaries but I do not want them
returned so I just come in here and put
a question mark is equal to and a word
boundary all right like that and we can
come in here and we're not doing
substitution so we can get rid of that
all together and if we run it you're
gonna see it comes back as 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 and
you can also see here that we did not
get those extra spaces at the end that
we didn't want and you could also do the
same here is added a homework go in
there and make this work with commas and
spaces and so forth and so on so that is
what we call a look ahead now let's take
a look at a look behind now the look
behind is gonna look for what is before
the text to return but it once again
isn't gonna return the whatever it's
looking for and the way you define these
guys is with a question mark and then
you're going to put like an arrow inside
of there which sort of looks like look
behind okay so something easy to
remember so in this situation what I'm
gonna have is I'm gonna have like a
grocery list
so we'll say bread and we'll say apples
and we'll say
lettuce so what we're going to look
behind for is this guy right here so how
are we gonna demonstrate that well we
need to find a number and a period and a
space but we don't want those returned
so we're gonna put a question mark and
then we're gonna do our little look
behind little thing here and now we're
looking for a number and then we're
looking for a period or one individual
character really doesn't matter you can
try it either way
and that's the end of that part and then
the part that we do want are going to be
all of the characters and we expect one
or more of those guys to be returned
pretty simple let's run it and you can
see we went in there we located these
individual pieces but we only got the
results that we were looking for so
pretty cool stuff you can also do a look
ahead and a look behind all at the same
time so let's say we wanted to come in
here and let's have an h1 tag and say
something like um portent and then close
that off and then let's throw in another
h1 tag so I am alright and then let's
close that guy off now we're gonna come
in here and grab and what we're
specifically looking to grab it is these
two lines of text and we want to throw
away these opening and closing tags how
do we do that well we can come in and do
a look behind and specifically what
we're looking for is h1 tags and then
we'll have one or more of what we're
looking for but we want this to be lazy
we don't want to go and grab the h1 from
there and the closing h1 to there so we
have to put the lays the inside of there
and then we're gonna do a look ahead
right after that is equal to and we can
throw in those h1 tags right there and
if we run it OOP so I'm important so am
i okay so pretty cool stuff so now that
we tried those guys out let's take a
look at negative look ahead
negative look behind okay so with
negative look ahead and negative look
behind what we're gonna do here is look
for text that doesn't match our pattern
and the way these work this is basically
how they are structured you're going to
have a question mark and an exclamation
point followed by expression and that is
going to be for the negative look ahead
and then likewise you're going to have
pretty much the same exact thing for the
look behind except you're gonna change
this into a little arrow pointing to the
left with an exclamation point and here
this is going to be look behind so let
me just show you an example how this
would be useful let's say you had a list
somebody had a grocery list and said
something like 8 apples is equal to
three dollars and one bread is gonna be
one dollar and then one cereal is gonna
be four dollars let's say you wanted to
come in here and completely ignore this
and just find out how many individual
items were going to be purchased
well how you could do that and I'll just
do the negative look behind in this
situation is you would just put in your
parentheses and question mark and then
you're gonna put an exclamation point
and then specifically what you do not
want to target and then this is gonna be
followed by whatever digits are there
and then we could do a find all on that
we could print out the total number of
matches and let's say we want to add all
these up well the list by default is
going to be set as strings so we're
gonna convert these into integers and so
let's just go for in matches to convert
all those into integers and then save it
back to matches and then let's use a
reduce here to sum all these so we're
gonna have to come in and get our reduce
function so we'll be able to use that
and then we could do something like
print and total items with format and
then we could go do
and we'll use a lambda here and get X&amp;amp;Y
and add each individual element if you
didn't see the part on reduce you can go
check out that part of the tutorial and
then of course we're gonna throw matches
inside of here
and if we run that you're gonna see the
ten comes back and the reason why it's
ten is eight plus one plus one is equal
to ten so there you go guys that is a
rundown of how we can use back
references look ahead look behind
negative look ahead negative look behind
and a whole bunch of other different
things and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
