to get people to like you or to be more
exact I'm going to teach you how to make
your best first impression Romeo six
four eight wrote in asking how to get
people to like you and that's why I'm
doing this presentation today
I'll give you numerous examples of ways
to get people to like you I'm going to
cover rapport building mirroring
matching representational systems and
rapport mistakes first I'm going to
cover what is rapport the first
technique we're going to cover is
rapport building the definition of
rapport is the development of a close
and harmonious relationship in which two
or more people understand each other and
communicate well most people try to
build rapport by being nice to someone
followed by a sharing of common
experiences by doing this you're saying
people like people like themselves and
these are the reasons unlike you these
common techniques can work some of the
time but definitely not all the time
building rapport is normally the
difference between getting someone to
like you or not I'll teach you now what
to look for and how effortlessly to gain
rapport with anybody when you are with
someone you trust you may not notice but
you naturally start to mirror him or her
mirroring is defined as when you copy
someone else's behavior movement body
position hand gestures tonal language
etc a clear example of mirroring is seen
when a couple naturally completes each
other sentences they are so in tune they
actually seem to read each other's
thoughts what most people do not realize
is that mirroring is a two-way street
you can actually mirror a person
slightly and get them to feel closer to
you naturally when mirroring people it
is very important that it stays outside
of their perception be very subtle by
caulking breathing the speed in which
they are talking and a few phrases
they're using don't make it obvious that
you're marrying them the first thing you
want to mirror when meeting someone is
their breathing pattern when a person
inhales their shoulders rise they exhale
when the shoulders fall and when they
speak monitor these two areas and copy
them now match the speed and tone of
their voice pay particular attention to
volume rhythm tempo and clarity
you could also study color changes
muscle movements and lower lip movements
but I'll keep it simple for now Albert
Mehrabian a researcher in the 1950s
found that the total impact of what you
say is 7% verbal words only 38 percent
vocal tone of voice and inflection and
55 percent nonverbal 60 to 80 percent of
the impact made is through what a person
gathers in regards to your body language
I just did a tutorial on body language
if you want to see that just click the
link above women rely more on the tone
of
voice and body language then what words
are being used actually so you've copied
the breathing patterns and tone of voice
now you will literally become the person
you're meeting you can now mirror their
breathing pattern voice posture
gesturing blink rate and
representational systems and I'm going
to cover exactly what that means
while you're mirroring they will almost
never notice just don't mimic their
gestures while they're speaking instead
wait until you're talking to mirror
those gestures if you want to be
positive they won't catch on weight to
mirror them after a few seconds now that
you're sitting as they sit with the same
posture and are following the tempo of
their voice breathing etc it is now time
to go over what I mean by
representational system humans store
memories as a series of images sounds
and feelings as a person talks they will
choose a representational system and
give you a clue to whether they're
remembering a story through images
sounds and feelings visual people talk
about color two or three dimensions
locations distance size brightness and
contrast auditory people talk about
volume sounds tone tempo distance from
sound clarity and continuty and feeling
or kinesthetic people talk about
pressure textures intensity weight
temperature shape and emotions if you
match the representational systems a
person will completely be in sync with
you here's an example if someone says to
you let me show you how bright blue the
sky was you should respond I see the
blue sky is very bright and beautiful
here I'm matching the fact that the
person with whom I'm speaking is in a
visual representation assistant keep
this up and they'll soon say it's as if
you're reading my mind
the reason they'll say this is that
everything you say will be instantly
understandable because their mind is
prepared to understand your visual
language
here are some common rapport mistakes by
mirroring and matching you will really
stand out from the pack here I provide a
few more tips that will get you building
relationships even quicker don't try too
hard to build rapport if you try too
hard you'll come off as being desperate
people do not like desperate people if
there is a true connection it will come
through with ease don't be overly nice
only be so nice that is not interfering
with the free flow of feelings and ideas
here are some other common rapport
mistakes people are comfortable being
either in charge subordinate or equal in
conversations let them be the way they
want to be people try to develop deep
rapport versus wide rapport this is when
a person latches on to one common
interest and focuses rapport building on
that subject wide rapport can only be
developed when you share many common
experiences wide rapport is
much better than deep rapport you can't
make the mistake of offering too much
information you show people you're
interested by giving them reasons to
interject and speak about their stories
you must convey to the other person that
you are worth getting to know this is
accomplished by changing up your
interest in them throughout the first
meeting remember people want what they
think they can't easily get you need to
suspend judgment and to listen to a
person with an attitude that they are a
great person and one worth knowing you
can help generate these feelings by
imagining that they are someone you
already admire now I'm going to teach
you how to find out if they want to be
in charge or subordinate you can
recognize if someone feels comfortable
in an authority subordinate or equality
role very easy when you shake their hand
if they place their hand on top of yours
forcing your palm down they are in
acting control if they shake on an equal
level they feel equal to you also the
first person to look away is subordinate
and the pressure they apply tells much
also allow them to keep their role but
move slowly towards equality here's how
you create wide rapport the more stories
you tell about different topics ideas
and themes the more they will sense your
entire personality this will also make
the person comfortable enough to feel as
if they can discuss any of their
thoughts with you using fractionated
rapport techniques will really hook a
person here's how you do that
focus on the person by giving them your
complete attention then let your eyes
drift away a bit acting briefly
distracted if they raise their voice or
in some way try to attract your full
attention you know you're properly
building rapport when you then fully
give them your attention they will be
deeply comforted and trust you more the
use of rapport hooks can allow you to
easily get a person interested in you by
creating rapport hooks you'll force the
other person to struggle to build
rapport with you taking the pressure off
of yourself you create a rapport hook by
starting an interesting story and then
before you talk about how you were able
to get through the problem you say to
cut to a long story short everything
worked itself out another great rapport
hook is the introduction rapport hook
it's basically out includes interesting
comment followed by another interesting
comment and then ended with an
open-ended question here's what I used
recently at a cocktail party in which I
knew nobody I walked up to a random
gentleman and I said excuse me
delete finding out how much money my
broker lost me and my newborn I forgot
to eat today what looks good on the
buffet what I did here is I gave this
person many interesting things to talk
about many people liked talking about
children so I interjected that I was
lying by the way I do have a child many
people also like talking about the stock
market gambling sports etc they're all
pretty much the same thing and also many
people like talking about food and also
by asking what looks good on the buffet
they have to give me an answer other
than a regular boring yes or no and to
end off this presentation I want you to
know that active listening does not work
many people use a technique called
active listening through active
listening we are told to hear what a
person says and then recognize those
words and repeat them back in a
different way they may say for example I
spent a beautiful day walking through
the museum with my baby in my arms
admiring each brightly painted picture a
day like that shows you how colorful the
world can be what a great world it is to
bring up a child this is an incorrect
response based off of active listening I
hear you
what better a place to take an infant
than a museum they always smell so clean
you don't have to worry about them
catching anything there it's one of the
few places you can take an infant and
not feel as if they'll get sick in this
conversation many mistakes were made the
first person is a visual speaker a
person that moves towards goals and also
refers to their baby and has a soft tone
the second while trying to find a
general interest speaks in audio and
kinetic terms moves away from problems
refers to the infant and even though
they're speaking of a similar experience
they're definitely not seeing it in the
same way here's a correct response based
off of a matching technique I see what
you're saying I spent many a beautiful
day with my baby in my arms walking
through the museums and parks enjoying
each bright and colorful day I used to
dress her on a little pink outfit and
paint the town what else did you see
that day active listening can make the
person believe you missed the point that
you have misunderstood them a technique
known as tracking back will gain you
much better results by tracking back you
actually speak in their language using
phrases that they have used well that's
the end of the presentation if there's a
question if you have please post it in
