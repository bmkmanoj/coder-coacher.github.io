tutorial on how to use HTML or hypertext
markup language whatever you want to
call it in this presentation I am going
to go over every single tag in HTML in
one video so just by watching this one
video you will completely understand
HTML and just to get the basics done
with web browser reads HTML which is
just a text file filled with tags hTML
is not a programming language and the
tags are just words or individual
characters and angled brackets that tell
the browser what text needs emphasis
what is a paragraph where you get images
or how to take a visitor to another page
if they should click on a tag there are
89 total tags but for the most part
you're only going to use 20 and to start
off any HTML document you have to define
what version of HTML you are using this
isn't something that you have to do but
it is something that would be required
if you were trying to write compliant
HTML and this isn't anything that you
really need to memorize you could just
copy it and there are links in the
underbar to everything I type here and I
actually did this presentation a version
of it anyway in a previous tutorial but
GB 19:48 told me that that tutorial
sucked so that's why I'm redoing it in
my new format and that's that so this is
telling the browser that you are using
transitional form of HTML in this
document right here then of course you
would type in HTML and this is telling
the web web browser that this is an HTML
document but of course that's what this
tells it already and you could of course
cut this out altogether and just use
HTML but we're going to be as compliant
as humanly possible then I like the tab
in everything as I go along you're going
to define the head section of your HTML
file and in this section everything that
lies between this opening head tag and
this closing head tag is going to define
what type of content can be found on
this HTML page I'm going to define what
language I'm going to be using as well
as the character set that I'm going to
be using in this document right here
content is equal to text for size HTML
semicolon character set and this is
based off the fact that I'm typing in
English for this in
formation is in English and anyone
always close off these tags if you get
in the practice of doing this you are
going to have no problem converting to
XHTML which I'll cover next but you have
to understand HTML before you can start
writing XHTML there's very little
difference but there are differences
then you can define write in your HTML
document styles this is frowned upon
with XHTML so for example if I want all
of my h1 tags to automatically get
defined with the color red that is how I
do it right like that and then of course
what do I do I close off a style tag
after I'm done with it
and of course I can also link to a text
document or a CSS file that has a whole
bunch of these styles inside of them and
I do that is with link and I have to
tell it that is a style sheet in here
CSS file and then anything that follows
after H reference is a link to a
location on the Internet
well since styles dot CSS is stored in a
folder that is the same folder as learn
HTML dot HTML the document I'm working
with I can just put that here also I
could put WW website comdata and link to
any document and i want to close that
off another common thing that you'll
find defined in the header section is a
description of what isn't on this
website content is equal to you're going
to use this same format name and give it
a name and then followed by content you
can define as many meta tags as you want
it's just additional information on the
website that's all meta tag is Bob's
hardware and close off your tag and then
another common meta tag again name is
equal to keywords content is equal to
and you quit hammers nails blah blah
blah blah blah whatever else you want to
put in there isn't going to be keywords
and then probably the only other common
one it's not even that common with the
author close off that tag and then the
final thing that you will commonly see
in the header section is title see these
are all just tags that's all it is
welcome to Bob's hardware of course
would be much better to play keyword
tags that you are targeting here and
that's it that is what you will find in
the header section in HTML for the most
part now what you're going to define is
everything it's going to be in the body
what's
going to show up in the HTML over here
and you do that with the body tag like I
said I'm going to go through all the
different things available so first you
have what are called h1 tags and I'm
just going to go each one inside here
and close this off like that and there
are six of these guys so just to make my
little life a little bit easier there's
an h2 tag and this is just defining
different sizes of text and you can see
right here this is red h1 why is it red
because we told the browser that's how
we wanted it to find but you can see as
the tags size has changed for these h1
defined pieces of text that the text
over here in the right side of the
screen decreases okay so as it goes up
each one's the biggest h6 is the
smallest and then you have the
abbreviation tag and what that's going
to do is let's say you abbreviate
something so you say as soon as possible
okay so you want as soon as possible to
show up on the screen if somebody puts
their mouse over an abbreviation like
that and I'm also going to define an
acronym because it's similar title it's
equal to I'm actually going to do
exactly the same thing here jump over
here and you can see whenever I put my
mouse over top as soon as possible pops
up here on the screen see and then the
same exact thing pretty much happens
with both of these tags and let me
define the bold tag and you define that
just like this fold and then you have
the big tag kind of similar and then I'm
also going to show you the break tag
what this does is it forces a line break
you define one of these guys and you can
see over here two different other
styling formats and now you see that
bold and bigger on separate lines
because BR the closing bracket here is
going to force her to be a new line then
you have blockquote
what that's going to do is it's actually
going to indent the text and you can see
how it indented that text right here
then you have the center tag the
emphasis tag which is just like an
italic tag you can see that there are
some tags that do pretty much identical
things
here's italic and you can see center tag
I like italic and me to see they're
identical they both show up same on the
screen just let me enlarge that then you
have a paragraph tag and what that does
is it just forces
a new line just like the break tag does
after it prints out the paragraph so
then if you'd like to define a quote
without actually using quotes you do it
with the cue tag and then if you want to
do what's called a strikethrough just
put an S inside of tag right like that
small and you have strong and you can
see over here what those all look like
I'm a quote I've been struck I feel
small I'm strong and then just to finish
these guys off
you have subscript and superscript and
those are all the different ways that
you can style text inside of HTML just
like that so now you know all those
let's jump on to image tags now you want
to define an image or pull of image from
anywhere on the internet this is how you
do it you start off with IMG and then
source is equal to and then you want to
define the location of that image
wherever it is on the internet with alt
we're going to provide text it's going
to explain exactly what this is
and then if you want to also define the
height that this is displayed in you
just do that with height you want to
define the width you just do it like
that and if you don't define it it'll
just stay whatever the default is and of
course you want to close that off and
you can see it grabbed that image and it
shot it here on the screen that's pretty
much all you need to know about working
with images in HTML now I'll go over all
the different types of Lists types first
you have the definition list and it's
probably better to just show it to you
here starts off with DL it works just
the way you would think it does DT
you're going to define the thing you're
going to provide a definition for and
then with DD you define the actual
definition and you can can you on from
there I'm just going to stop it right
there and then after that you have
ordered lists and that starts with with
oh L right like that Li and I and then
close that off that's an ordered list
and then you have unordered lists ul it
starts off with and then inside of it
use ally again so I'm just going to copy
that
and you can see right here the way that
this works bicycle has two wheels this
is your definition this is your ordered
list see it puts numbers inside of there
and you have your own ordered list which
puts bullets inside of there and that is
pretty much everything you need to know
about lists
Sen HTML so let's get rid of this now
I'm going to go over everything you need
to know in regards to creating links or
what are called anchor tags in HTML a H
reference remember this is a reference
to a location on the internet that I
want the person to be sent to if they
click close that off then you have
target and here I'm going to define
target as underscore blank and what
that's going to do is it's going to
force this webpage when clicked on
whenever the link is clicked on to open
in a separate tab in the browser a
separate window depending upon how your
browser set up and if you do not put
blank inside of here you could also put
self like this and what it would do is
open in the currently open window
instead and here you would define what
the link is actually going to say and
then you want to close it off with a
closing bracket right there and you can
see that it shows up right here so let's
say I wanted to create a table then you
can type in summary which is going to
give a brief explanation of what the
table contains you can also define a
caption like that then you want to start
off your table with TR which is going to
define a row and then th is going to
define each one of those columns so
Saturday close those off close off your
row copy roadbike and ran yes I'm very
into exercise hordley and then of course
you wanted to find the end of your table
and you can see over here there's no
styling around this table because I'm
working you towards understanding XHTML
which requires that all styling be done
with style sheets but you can see here
is your caption here is your row of
information and then there is an
additional row of information and then
the final thing you're going to do in
HTML is create what are called forms and
what this is going to do is it's going
to accept input from a user of your
website it's going to send it to a PHP
script for processing for example and if
you use the post method information
being passed is actually going to be
passed within what's called the header
section of the HTML file and not
displayed in the URL and if you use the
get method information going to be
passed in the URL itself
for the most part is considered good
form to pass information using the post
method the first thing we're going to do
here is we're actually going to define
what information is going to be placed
inside of here then we're going to
define that we want to create a text
input area we're going to give whatever
value is entered in there the name email
and we're going to define that the size
to be displayed is going to be 40
characters in length and you could also
use max length inside of here but I'll
save that for a later tutorial and you
can see what it prints out here and the
user could come in and enter text right
here inside here and then send it to
mail to dot PHP if you'd like them to be
able to enter large amount of
information then you would use what's
called a text area input tool and all
you would do to create that is instead
of putting input type text we're going
to type in text area and we'll define
how many columns we want this guy to
have how many rows and the name it will
be associated with whatever information
they enter in here and then this would
be default text that would show up
whenever this is actually loaded and you
can see how that shows up on the screen
instead as a big box for entering text
and then there's default text let's just
jump back to here let's say I wanted to
allow the person to enter this
information and not show on the screen
instead of text I'm going to type in
password and of course this is often
used for password input and then you of
course have what are called radio
buttons and with a radio button you're
going to define a default value
associated with it so let's just put
home inside of here and I'm just going
to copy that and here I'm going to put
work in load and you can see that these
are radio buttons where you can only
select one or the other and then you
have your checkboxes to find it with
checkbox give it a variable name sign a
value and we'll just put Hayden's out of
here again and you can see that puts
checkboxes on-screen and the final way
to accept user input would be the Select
dropdowns and with them you just type in
select and give it a name select input
was that on option
you able to love select I love and close
off that and you can put it I hate and
there are your two options and using
select boxes and the only other thing
that's left over in learning HTML is how
to send this information and how you
would do that is by creating a send
button and that is just input type is
equal to submit and then value is the
words that are going to show up on your
button whenever anybody hits that submit
button that information is going to be
submitted to this file right up here all
the information that was selected inside
of there and to finish off of course you
would close the form tag and the only
other thing that you might want to pass
in this form would be a hidden field you
find that with input type equal to
hidden and this is a value that is going
to be passed along but it's not going to
be displayed on the website common thing
to do pass a value that says that this
has been submitted so there is every
single HTML tag that is used on regular
basis I knew so long tutorial but you
know it all now if you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
