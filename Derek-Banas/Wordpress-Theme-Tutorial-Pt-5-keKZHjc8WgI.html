5 in my wordpress theme tutorial in
which i will teach you all you need to
know to make custom WordPress themes he
in the previous part of this tutorial
part 4 which you can see a link to in
the upper left hand corner we created
all the HTML that goes into creating
this wordpress theme and also before you
proceed you should definitely watch my
tutorial on how to create a menu like
you see right here on the right side of
the screen and there's a link to that in
the middle of the screen and also you
should check out my CSS layout tutorial
if at any point in time this becomes
confusing to you because in this part of
the tutorial what I'm going to do is I'm
going to teach you how to take this
which we created in the previous
tutorial and turn it into this which is
the basis of our theme so I'm going to
do all this by showing you how to create
the style dot CSS file that's what we
have here on the left hand side of the
screen and in WordPress whatever you're
defining this guy you normally are
supposed to define it in this way which
is to create a unique theme name I'm
just going to call this new think-tank
theme one and then theme your I this
would be the location but I'm not
actually gonna make this available
except all the code is available in a
link in the underbar so if you want to
get at this code there is a link in the
underbar and feel free to use this theme
if you would like to description and you
would provide a link to your website and
all of this information would then show
up if somebody searches for your theme
and it pops up on the screen and just
like that that's what you type in there
you can see it's all commented out
though so that's information that's just
provided to people whenever they search
and come across your theme and then the
first thing I'm going to do here is
actually one of the most complicated
parts of this whole entire thing
everything else is pretty simple in this
website you can see if i zoom in here
that there is a gradient in the
background that goes from this tan to
white as it goes down the screen well
what I'm gonna do is show you exactly
how I created that
basically what I did was I just used cut
and paste code I do that a lot where I
have code that I know that does what I
want it to do and I just copy and paste
and then I change a couple things by
default if the browser does not support
this ability to create this gradient
what I'm going to do is define a
background for it just so that I'm
positive that it's gonna work for me so
that's what I'm doing right there then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
copy and paste some code and this is the
only part of this tutorial where I'm
actually
do this and this creates a cross-browser
gradient for me in my background so I
actually come in here and just go like
this and paste all this in here now what
I did then afterwards was I defined my
start color which is this tan and then I
define my end color which is white and
then I did the same exact thing here and
here and you can see there's information
in regards to which one of these
gradients applies to which browser and
that's all I did I changed these two
little things here my start color my in
color and that was it and that's all I
need to define inside my HTML don't
worry I'm gonna go into more detail on
some of the other things but whenever I
don't need to go into detail why I do
that then I'm going to come into my body
section and I'm actually gonna copy and
paste that same information there so
that that all lines up together
and here I'm gonna define the font
that's going to be used by default
across the whole entire site so I'm just
14 pixels my line distance and I'm gonna
say I want to use Georgia and serif by
default for my fonts and then go in
there close that off and let's open up
this guy and I'll show you this as we
proceed so if I file save this jump over
here you can see now there's the
gradient and also the font changed but
not much more aside from that change but
believe me a lot of other things are
gonna change your give myself some space
now what I'm going to do is for layout
purposes this works I'm going to define
all the different blocks inside of this
theme I'm going to say display as block
and what this simply does is it puts a
line break before and after each one of
these guys and it just helps me with
layout purposes size from that nothing
really there it's that important then
what I'm gonna do is create my page
wrapper which is surrounds everything on
here on the screen I'm going to define a
couple things inside of it being that I
want the width to be 1000 pixels that
keeps everything nice and tight so it
doesn't move around the screen as the
person changes their browser background
color default is gonna be white and then
to make sure that it always stays
centered I'm gonna define my margin left
as auto and my margin right as auto and
that will make everything Center on the
screen so now I got that done I'll say
and you can see now there's the gradient
there but this is all white it's gonna
change dramatically by the end I'm gonna
come in here and say all matter CSS
really I don't always comment in these
tutorials but it is extremely important
to comment and roll
position for the header is going to be
relative and this is the header section
this stuff up here and relative just
means in essence just go with the flow
whatever surrounds you just work with it
I'm gonna define the background color
and here I'm gonna use this burgundy
like that I'm gonna define the height
for the header section at 55 pixels and
going to define my padding which is the
inside of the div the margin is the
outside of the div and I'm gonna put
that at 20 pixels and there I got my
header all set up if I reload you can
see that that's all nice and trying to
get in there in the right ways so I want
my blog title obviously to be above the
slogan because that's the way it is set
up here so now I'm gonna target the blog
title and set it up properly I'm going
to say that I want to position it
absolutely and that just means that I'm
going to tell it exactly based off of
pixels where I want it locate it and
then whenever you do that you define the
left position which is going to be 86
pixels so 86 pixels from the left side
of the screen and then top is going to
be negative 15 pixels and then I'm gonna
define my color for my text to be white
and then I'm gonna find my font to be
bold 40 pixels Georgia and surf and then
I'm gonna put a text shadow to make this
stand out a little bit and it's gonna be
black and it's gonna be two pixels down
and two pixels to the right and I'm
gonna give it a blur of one pixel and
after doing that the blog title is gonna
be set up as you can see it's right
there so now I gotta straighten up all
this other text that's around here focus
in on the blog slogan now I'm gonna say
I want to position it absolutely as well
and I'm gonna say left 86 pixels and
this is all relative to the box that
contains all this so it's relative to
whatever the header is and where it also
would normally be placed inside of the
header I'm gonna give it a color again
white and I'm just gonna copy this right
here paste this in I'm gonna let it be
bold but I'm gonna change this to 15
pixels and I'm gonna let everything else
be exactly the same and you can see that
that's going into place also real nice
well the one thing that's missing is
actually the logo which is not showing
up here and the reason why is I don't
have it in the folder I'm gonna jump to
where I have my web server set up and
here is the example stuff that I'm
working through with you and here are
the images that I need so what I'm gonna
do is I'm just going to copy this jump
over into exam
well and paste that images folder inside
of there if I reload you can see now the
logo shows up here alright super so what
am I gonna do I'm gonna come in here I'm
gonna say all sidebar CSS styling yeah
I'm gonna find my first sidebar I'm
gonna say that I want it to be a font of
13 pixels georgia serif and put a column
in there color of the text here I'm just
going to go 666 which is a gray I'm
gonna say that I want my padding
remember this is the area between the
text the actual content and the border
of the div that creates all the
information for you I'm gonna make this
5 pixels and of course I've done this
ahead of time so I know this all works
out and I'm gonna say padding-bottom
equal to 15 pixels and padding left is
gonna be 10 pixels that's gonna divide
up everything real nice I'm gonna go
background color and make that white and
I'm gonna define my width at 150 pixels
and then I'll line my text cuz it left
you're also getting kind of a little bit
of information on CSS here and then I'm
gonna float it to the right and that
just means that I want the sidebar to
shoot over here to the right side of the
screen so that's all that means just say
float right and it will margin left is
gonna be 5 pixels margin right there's
gonna be 5 pixels large and top and I'm
printing all these out instead of
keeping them condensed for reasons that
I'll get into later so there's the first
sidebar and I can actually grab this guy
copy it paste it call it the second
sidebar at all I'm gonna do different
here is create a border so I'm gonna say
border dash left is equal to 2 pixels
and I want it to be solid and for now
I'm going to use this burgundy color
might go in and change that later but
aside from that all of that is going to
say the same and the only thing I want
to do is I want to go in and
specifically style the sidebar title but
this is a class because there's a bunch
of different things called sidebar title
so I started off with a period and I'm
gonna say I want my font to be bold I
want it to be 15 pixels change that line
distance a little bit I want to make
this an arial sans-serif font and I'm
gonna make the color burgundy as well
and file save and reload this and you
can see everything is goin real nicely
moving over here and then I'm going to
define my footer
say the background color same burgundy
text-align is gonna be Center text color
is gonna be white and padding is gonna
be 20 pixels Wow say and reload and
pretty much everything is coming
together here all that I need to work on
here is to get this guy in line and also
get the menu set up well for the menu
like I said I'll provide a little link
to the tutorial on how it's made
basically there's just a couple files
that go into it what I'm gonna do here
is jump in the include section you can
see all this code here and I'm gonna
copy this and paste that in there and
reload and you can see the menu is now
working so I just gotta fix this one
part and how I fix that is I'm gonna
create another file called home CSS
because we've won all the individual
pages to have some custom information
which is gonna go in the main content
section save as
I'm not CSS and then the box that goes
around this is called main content
padding:0 pixels 5 pixels and what this
means is this is the top it's sort of
like a clock so this is the top padding
and then this is the right and then the
next one's gonna be the bottom you know
and the other ones the left and then I
gotta create a margin on the right to
make way for this sidebar information of
355 pixels and I'm also gonna make a
margin on the top 5 pixels just to
create some separation
I'll save let's see now it's starting to
tighten up a little bit the intro title
which is welcome to my website which is
here real teeny-tiny come in here style
that guy don't forget the hash
background color color the text again
will you give it some padding 2 pixels 2
pixels 2 pixels 5 pixels and then I'm
gonna give it a text shadow also 2
pixels two pixels one pixel file save
you can see you know that's setup intro
paragraph I just want to use the default
except I'm gonna make it italic and then
my post lists are these guys right here
the bullet in front of them I want to
get rid of that bullet so post this
position relative to everything that
surrounds it and then to get rid of that
bullet I just go list-style:none bullets
are gone this is now italic and then I
wanted to target these guys inside of
here and I want to move them over a
little bit so how do I do that well it's
a list so that means it's surrounded
with Li tags and it's inside of
this div called posts list so if I want
to target it I just go pose lists and
then I go Li because that's the tag
that's around it position:relative and I
want to say margin left and I want to
move it over so I go 40 pixels negative
and it will do just that for me as you
can see just moved in they don't want to
target post title if I want us to throw
a box behind the back of it I just did
it with a background color and I want to
change the color of the text to white
and then put some padding around it with
five pixels on all sides and let's say I
want to put a text shadow as well
pixels one pixel that's a nice effect
reload and you can see it's going in
there nice post image which is this
little image right there I want to
position it absolutely so what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna move it up into this
area where it should be and I just
define with pixels based off of where it
currently is sitting where I want it
moved to now if I want to make room for
it I got a target the post excerpt which
is this text right here and move it over
out of the way
say position relative adding zero pixels
and then I want to put 80 so it's gonna
padding of 80 on the left so it'll have
a room there and let's just say I color
this to a grey one again and I'm gonna
make the line height for this one point
five just the distance between the lines
that just looked nicer reload and you
can see it bounced everything in there
exactly where I wanted it post content
relative position padding zero pixels
eighty pixels make that grey line height
1.5 and then I have to go in here and
put the nurse banner inside of here and
after I put the nurse banner inside of
there inside of the right folder you
have the whole entire website all done
right like that all with just that
little bit of code CSS code and some
moving around of some images so now I am
ready to proceed and to actually turn
this guy into a theme so if you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below otherwise till
