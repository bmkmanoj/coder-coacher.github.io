17 of my how to make video games
tutorial series and this part of the
tutorial we're going to make pac-man or
miss pac-man or whatever and what we're
going to really focus on in this part of
the tutorial is I'm going to create all
the sprite assets we're going to need
for our game and I'm also going to show
you how to place them with precision
because we're going to be creating a
grids type game here in which numerous
2d games are based off up and then I'm
going to start setting up the project so
that we can continue in the next part of
the tutorial like always all of the
images and so forth in this tutorial are
available in a link in the description I
and I have a lot to do so let's get into
it
okay so we're going to be using GIMP
just like I've been using it's exactly
the same on Windows as well as on Mac OS
and everything else so that's a good
reason to use it first thing I want to
do is I'm going to create my sprite
sheet it's going to have all my
different sprites that I need so I'm
gonna go file and new and then I'm going
to think about what I want this to be on
the sprite sheet so I'm basically going
to need for ghosts and those ghosts are
going to have to be able to look to the
left to the right down and up as they
move in those directions because that's
how pac-man works so I'm going to need
four of those so that means on top of
that I'm also going to need my pac-man
of course a pack Oh miss pac-man is what
I'm going to create and I want to do a
little animation with her so why don't
we just go and say that we want to do
four sprites for her animation I'm also
going to need a dot as well as a larger
pill and I'm also going to need the
ghosts whenever miss pac-man eats a pill
and gets the power to eat the ghosts and
you know the blue ghosts or whatever and
I want to do a simple animation with
that so based off of that I think that
I'm going to need about 16 24 are
different individual sprites just off
top of my head and that means that I'm
going to if I'm going to make this 16 by
16 sprites that means that it is going
to be 64 by 96 or I could do it in the
opposite direction but I'm going to do
it that way and that looks like that's
going to be good I'm going to come over
here to my pencil tool I'm going to make
sure that I have this set for pixel and
my size set for 0 dining
off and also my eraser pixel once again
size to one dynamics off and hard edge
applied and everything else there looks
pretty good and here is my spreadsheet
I'm going to click on Z so that I'm
going to be able to zoom in on this
spreadsheet I'm also going to want to
make this transparent so I'm going to
come over here just like it did
previously click on that layers menu and
I'm going to say add alpha Channel I'm
then going to come up here and go to the
layers menu again and I'm going to say
that I want a new layer and that I want
it to be transparent and going okay then
I'm going to click on the background guy
here and I'm going to delete that layer
okay so now we're going to be working in
our transparent little spreadsheet now I
think it's kind of easier to do this if
I go and actually use rulers so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to come in here
and drag out some rulers just reach in
here and I'm going to go to 16 and I'm
going to go to 32 and I'm going to go to
48 and that's just going to help me
figure out where I can draw on where I
can't draw once again I'm going to come
down here to 16 and 32 and 48 and 64 and
I'm just multiplying 16 you know each
time so each one of these is going to be
16 by 16 so this is going to be 64 and
then the last I'm going to need is going
to be 80 all right so now we got that
all sectioned off and I know what what I
can do in the area that I'm working with
so that's good go in here and zoom in
again and I got to think about how I'm
going to draw well first thing I want to
do is I want to draw a ghost and then
you guys have said you want me to do
more in regards to actually showing you
how I draw so I'm going to do that very
first I'm going to do is I want to get
myself a red color so I'm just going to
click up inside of here and pick out a
nice red that I'm used as a base for my
Mario and I think that looks like a
pretty good bread so I'm going to select
that and then I'm going to come in here
and just draw my first ghost so I'm sort
of basing this off of you know the
actual ghosts that they have in the game
but I'm also going to play with it and
make it my own a little bit also so
let's
want to go in here and say one two three
four five six and let's draw the top of
the ghost head so I'm gonna go one two
and three okay so drew a little red line
inside of here we got six spaces on the
left six spaces on right four right
they're going to switch back into this
again and let's say I want to go and add
a little bit more to it and then we'll
add just a little bit more to it I'm
just playing around here with an idea
and loosely basing it off of a pacman
ghosts drawing in a couple more little
lines right there and then maybe go out
here and finish this off want to keep it
within the bounds of sixteen and I don't
want to butt it up against it so I'm
going to come right down here now I
don't want to do that I'm going to click
on the e to erase that click on end so I
can continue drawing then I'm going to
draw in the bottom of my ghost I'm going
to put like a little bit of a shadow on
this I think let's go and just play with
it see how it works out let's good this
and as I draw a little bit more you're
going to see what I'm working with here
really what pixel art and one of the
most important things just having things
be symmetric and if you can make things
symmetric everything will look like it's
you know it's professionally done like
it's supposed to be done all right now
I'm gonna finish that off all right so
let's see how this ghost is going to
work out here I already know it's going
to look okay at least because otherwise
it wouldn't be showing it to you here
and the two floral obviously there we go
we got the basics of our ghost now I
want to go in here and draw in our eyes
so I'm going to switch this over to
white I'm going to change this to all
f's
so that it's pure white say I want to
come in here one line and then start
drawing my eyeballs from this point
three and then go in and do a little bit
more all right so that's pretty good
looking eyes let's go and give myself
two spaces again everything all that I'm
basically just doing here is just
thinking make it symmetric that's all
that I'm thinking about and of course
make the eyeballs exactly the same size
and there we go and there's our eyeballs
and now what I can do is let's go and
get like purple for the actual eyes so I
click on over here and then find
ourselves a purple that we sort of like
that looks like a pretty nice little
purple color so I work out good there so
I'm select that and I'm going to
been here in drama eyeballs in line
let's just start off lips to move that
back over here I'm going to make the
eyeballs look to the left to start off
and then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to add some shading so that it
looks a little bit nicer so I'm just
going to get a lighter shade of red and
outline it on the left like the Sun is
hitting it you know in this direction
and then the sun's not going to hit this
side so I'm going to use a darker shade
of red
so let's come in here and find a better
shade of red and that looks like a good
enough color just something and then I'm
just going to come in here color that
see so it's just slightly different
color and I'm just going to highlight
the outside like I said just like the
Sun is hitting it so that's all we want
and this guy is going to be very very
small so it's not going to be all that
noticeable on our screen all right now
what I got to do is come in and get a
dark version for this side it's going to
give the illusion of 3d and that's
pretty good color click on this and then
we're going to come in here and color it
and of course you can color it whatever
color you want to color it so we are
shade in just the outside edges here and
then maybe come in and just color that
part right there and then come up here
do something like this
color that if you fill that in maybe
fill that in also and then fill in right
here and what's pretty good you know not
bad and then what I need to do is just
make four copies of that ghost with the
eyeballs going in different directions
and you'll see what that looks like here
in a moment now what I want to do is
draw them a miss pac-man now what I want
to do here is I'm going to have a
partially open mouth in this direction
they don't have a closed mouth and then
I'm going to go back to the partially
open mouth and then I'm going to have a
really wide open mouth and it's going to
jump between those inside the animation
so I want to start off with the base of
the completely closed mouth so I'm going
to switch over to my pencil tool and I'm
going to come down just one space I want
her to pretty much fill the space but
not quite so she's roughly the same size
as the ghost I'm going to come in let's
say 1 2 3 4 5 spaces and then I want to
use a yellow color let's go and get the
yellow first click on yellow here and go
and try to find ourselves a color that
looks good okay so that's pretty good
yellow let's click on OK and then let's
start drawing her so what I say one
space down and five
so one two three four five and then here
we are and then I can start drawing how
many do I want oh let's say that I want
to do like seven okay one two three four
that's pretty good and then I'm going to
try and you know basically just have it
be a circle draw that in there and there
we go and then I think I'm actually
going to stop it right there
drawing another line like that she's
going to sort of have pursed lips
because miss pac-man has lipstick on
so this is actually going to be red so
we'll just go and throw that and that's
where the lips are going to show up and
then we're going to throw two more
yellows underneath that and then I'm
just going to start filling it in to
make it more circular once again so
we're just going to like this and like
this and like this all right so there we
go we got miss pac-man sort of drawn in
so now what I need to do is figure out
the rest of it so I want to give our red
lips of course and that looks pretty
good and we'll come in here and draw our
red lips one two and one and two so
there's the red lips then I'm going to
have to come in and draw in her bow so
I'm gonna get some red colors once again
let's make it different than the lips
though
there we go it's like a darker color
grab that so what are we going to do
with the bow here I'm going to go in
like say mmm four spaces and start
drawing our bow inside of here so one
one two and three and then we'll also
color it up there and then drawing the
rest of the bow right there this is
going to be where the knot is so I'm
going to go one and two and then maybe
one and two and then one and two
okay so there's an approximation of a
bow actually you know what let's go like
this and then go like this alright there
you go
see it's just based off of everything
looking the same that's the most
important and having everything be the
same size same number of shapes and so
forth and so on that's the most
important thing with pics or at least
whenever you're first starting now I
need to figure out where her eyeballs
are going to go I'm first I'm going to
come in here and make this black
obviously we're going okay and I think
the eyeball should be something like one
two just a very simple there you go
there's eyeballs and now I'm going to do
the same thing well let's go and also
get
a different color for her bow I think a
little bit I'm going to lighten this up
a little bit so it's going to get a
different color red that's a little bit
lighter you know what I think I'm going
to make it the same color as the lips
just to have some consistency there for
the highlight on the bow so we'll go in
here and then add the highlight so this
and like this maybe up here and up here
and maybe like this and like this there
you go
now looks kind of good alright so there
we are and then I want to get a lime
feeling weird about this I feel like
there should be like something right
here in the lips area so I'm going to
get another shade of red and then just
do like a real light actually maybe a
yellow I'm going to use the same yellow
that I use for the highlight for this
alright so I'm going to come in here I'm
going to click on O and then I'm going
to come in and select my pac-man and I'm
going to get a lighter version of what
we have already here for our yellow
there it is just eyeballing this there's
no real you know science to it then I'm
going to come in and just highlight
around it just like I did previously so
yeah like this it's very very very
subtle color or at least I think it's
subtle I'm colorblind by the way and
let's go and this would sort of be like
her mouth closed or something like that
alright so just subtle and then I want
to go and put some highlights around the
dark side or the side I'm not facing the
Sun so once again come in here and just
eyeball a darker color I just click on
that and let's go and get one and what
I'm going to do is just come in here and
highlight it just like I did previously
so it's going from a distance it's going
to have like a 3d effect to it alright
good enough ok so now that I have that
as a base what I'm going to be able to
do is go and shape it into another
pac-man version which is the mouth is
going to be slightly different so I'm
going to come up here and select a
little square selection tool and I'm
going to select this whole entire guy
this whole entire girl I guess I'm gonna
do a copy on that then I'm gonna come in
and I'm going to do a paste and I am
going to keep this selected I'm going to
drag her over here like this and
position her in place and then I'm just
going to click anywhere to seal her into
place alright so there we got our
pac-man all set up now I'm going to try
to figure out how to make her look
normal with mouth open so
in here and I'm going to get my eraser
tool grab my oh yeah I'm going to come
in here and just sort of scribble on top
of what I got here already so I'm going
to come in and sort of draw that like
that's just to extend her mouth out a
little bit and then have this go out two
spaces and then I think I'm going to get
her lips up here so I'm going to go oh
and I'm going to go back to my pencil
tool and draw in some lips so it'll go
one two and three then I'm going to get
my eraser tool by capital E and I'm
going to go in there and start deleting
some stuff so won't - like I said just
eyeballing this and doing something that
looks like it might be good and that
looks about right so then I'm going to
jump down here and come in a little bit
more getting close to that eye so I'm
going to come down once again and I
think that's pretty good
so now what I just need to do is make
the bottom the same as the top so I'm
going to come in here like that and we
can delete all this stuff right here
because we don't need that delete all
that as well
once again just symmetrical it's all
named and four so I'm going to make that
symmetrical with that I think that looks
pretty good I'm going to go get oh so I
can sample the lip color once again go
back into the pen tool or the pencil
tool and put that in there and I think
that's a good midway mouth open sort of
look everything else is highlighted
pretty well and there you go so that's
basically that I'm going to go and draw
the other different pac-man's but I
think you get the idea here and I just
want to come in now and draw the dots
just to do something else a little bit
different actually I didn't leave enough
room for my four ghosts I only got three
inside of here so what i'm going to do
is i'm going to get my selection tool
once again gonna select my pac-man's I
pack miss pac-man
okay so just select that and paste them
in there and then position them down
inside of here once again looks pretty
good and then click anywhere just to
unselect that and now I'll come in here
and draw in my dot once again pretty
simple all its going to be its I'm going
to be about it's just going to be about
symmetry that's all the matter so I'm
just gonna click on this so I can switch
over into white I'm going to go down one
two three and four spaces and how many
of these are am I going to want well I'm
probably going to come in a certain
number somebody go one two three four
five six and then start drawing my dots
from this position here and let's say
that I want to do something like four
dots like that
a little bit hard to see since it is
white and I can come up here and change
that so I'll go file and whoops it's not
there it's going to be in preferences
under edit preferences and there's a guy
pops up and this is useful to know
anyway and default grid and since where
it is now it's display display and I'm
going to use looks like dark checks and
you can see they changed it looks a
little bit better so let's come out of
there now I can see my you know how to
draw those dots a little bit better like
I said it's all about symmetry so I'm
going to have this be the zoom and go
like this this is going to be the little
dot how many of these do I want so I'm
gonna want two three is that right let's
try it one two three I want everything
to be symmetric
so it's just the same one two three four
and one two three four five no it isn't
so I'm going to take it one more so
maybe like thoughts and like this and
then like that and there you go it looks
pretty good now what I'm going to do is
go and use a slightly darker gray inside
of here so let's come up here select
this let's change this from FFF - EEE
EEE
just to keep it nice and simple I know
that's going to be a gray and I'm
basically going to do the opposite of
what I've been doing instead of drawing
in the highlight I'm going to draw
around the highlight that looks good
select all that and there we go now I'm
going to draw a little bit darker on
here let's just come in here and select
it and I'll say something like 9 b 9 b 9
b I know that's going to also be gray
and we'll go and add the dark lines to
it so there's that once again just gives
from a distance it's going to give the
perception that that's 3d all right ok
and then after drawing in all the rest
of them I'm doing basically exactly the
same type of stuff I just showed you you
end up getting this look right here so
here are our four ghosts looking in two
different directions
there are going to be the different
animations for our miss pac-man small
dot big dot I'm actually gonna color
that yellow probably and then this will
be the different ghosts look and you can
see their mouth is going to move alright
so there is going to be our sprite sheet
I'm going to save that as sprite sheet
and open it up in unity and now I'm
going to show you what I did with the
grid okay so here is my grid system I
guess I should sort of zoom out
first so here is the grid that I created
for a pac-man game and it looks you know
very very similar to a pac-man type game
but I used an immense amount of
precision in actually crafting this I'm
going to zoom way way in here so you can
see once again I used rulers I want to
show you exactly what I did so the grid
system remember pac-man and all of our
assets are based around 16 by 16 pixel
sprites so as you can see this is a 16
by 16 pixel sprite this upper corner
this whole entire thing then I'm going
to have the path where the pac-man and
the ghostly thing all the dots
everything you're going to go inside of
and you can see right here this
perfectly fits there are four pixels
right here and then there is going to be
four pixels here going in and four
pixels coming down so we're using a grid
basis of the system that is going to be
insanely precise so we have the entire
game based off of that and if you look
around of course I have all of this
available in the description so just go
and get it if you don't want to draw
this out but this is how to make a
precise game that is going to do
everything that we expect it to do all
right
I've never made a game so far in this
tutorial that is this precise so
everything is a hundred percent precise
in regards to what we're doing here and
then we can zoom out once again and you
can see the complete game board so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
export that as a ping file so export as
after I got that done don't do the same
thing with sprite sheet of course make
sure is that this is set for ping and
then we'll jump over into unity and
start using this stuff okay so here is
unity I'm going to go new and I'm going
to call this miss pac-man so Miss
pac-man and this is going to be 2d of
course and I'm going to go and select
where I want to put it then after I have
that set go create project just like I
always do I'm going to come in here and
I'm going to create a whole bunch of
different folders so I'm going to say
create folder and I'm going to create an
animations folder and inside of my
assets here creates and folder and I'm
going to create a prefabs folder just
like before creates and a seems full
order and a scripts folder and a sounds
folder and then finally a sprites folder
and that should do for everything that I
need right now and I'm going to go and
get my assets that I just created so
there's my spreadsheet there's my game
board I'm going to grap select both of
them grab them into my sprites folder
drop them in there and now if I select
sprites you're going to see that both of
them show up inside of there so good
stuff I want to select my game board and
I want to set this to pixels per unit
216 extremely important because
everything's based off of the fact that
there's 16 by 16 pixel grids and I'm
going to be using that filter mode is
going to be point because this is pixel
art and that's all I need to do with
that I'm actually going to select my
main camera here on imply it
it says unapplied import settings apply
yes I forgot to do that okay then I got
main camera selected here I'm going to
have the background be black let's
select this it pops up over here and I'm
going to select black all zeros of
course close that you can see it's all
black now I'm going to also come in here
and change my size to 16 then I'm going
to grab my game board that I have over
here drag it drop it into my hierarchy
and geez that looks perfect that was an
accident alright um yeah looking good
but I'm actually going to want to
position this if we zoom way inside here
let's zoom in using my actual zoom tool
and to move this around I'm holding down
the right mouse key that's how I'm able
to move this around alright so what I
want this to do of course is I have this
grid system in here based off a 16 by 16
because that's what I defined that I
want to use so I want to take advantage
of that I want to make sure that this
lines up perfectly with that so I'm
going to select my game board and I also
want to try to get these numbers to be
normal I don't want yeah I want at most
to have say three numbers two numbers
something like that after it and I want
some consistency and how these are all
laid out so this is all at the zero zero
mark at this point and I'm just going to
grab this X and I'm going to position it
until it looks like everything is set up
the way that I want it set up and I
finally decided I want it to be 13 X by
14.5 and how I did that is by looking
right here you can see that everything
is lining up
ugly it looks like it is perfect within
our grid system okay so I'm going to
base everything off of that then I'm
going to adjust my camera so that the
camera completely surrounds it
so select main camera and I can go and
put 13 inside of there and then 14.5
once again and everything looks like it
lines up perfectly alright so there it
is and we can zoom out of this and then
start working with the rest of our
graphic assets I want to come in here
and splice my sprite sheet so I'm going
to select that so all these different
pieces all fit together so I'm going to
come in here instead of single this is
going to be multiple of course pixels
per unit of course are going to be 16
just like we did previously filter modes
going to be point because it's pixel art
I'm going to come down here and change
this to high-quality so that it keeps
all of my colors nice sometimes it
doesn't but for right now we're going to
do that and that should keep everything
looking good I'm going to come over here
and I'm going to click on sprite editor
yeah supply forget to do that all the
time but thankfully it tells me now I'm
going to come in you're here and goes
slice and grid by cell size of course
these are sixteen by sixteen cook
everything sixteen by sixteen click on
slice and then click on a plot and we
can close that and now we can come in
here to our sprite sheet click on it and
there are all of our different pieces
okay looking good and then some of them
a little bit mangled but you know for
what we're doing looks pretty good okay
now what I want to do is I want to get
my miss pac-man and position her onto
our screen and she's going to start off
right here in this position right there
so I'm going to get her entire animation
so that is 16 through 19
so we'll go 16 through 19 select them
all and then grab her and we'll position
her perfectly here in a moment but for
right now I'm going to drag her right
there this is going to pop-up animation
and I'm going to name this miss pac-man
of course so miss pac-man and that's the
animations and make sure you save it in
your animations folder so assets and
animations there we are
and click on save there she is and she
looks like she's pretty close but what
we can do is we want to use perfect
precision so we're going to use the
inspector to
perfectly positioner and that is going
to be a thirteen point five and six
point five so it was off by just a
little bit alright so that looks good
and if we zoom in once again it looks
like she is pretty well positioned in
our grid system I'm then going to come
in here and change this to miss pac-man
instead of sprite sheet sixteen because
that doesn't make any sense all right
got that click on that once again and
then we want to come over here and we
want to open up our animator tab so
select that and I want to just slow down
the speed of the animation to do that
we're going to select the miss pac-man
right here and I'm going to take it down
to say I don't know point five I just do
this because it normally is ridiculously
fast and what we can do is we can come
in here and play it and see how quickly
she's opening and closing the mouth so
there you see her right there yeah you
know what I think I made it a little bit
too slow let's make it a little bit
faster let's try like point six and run
it again and there you can see it looks
a little bit better okay so I'm like in
everything so far go back to our scene
another thing we're going to want to do
here out front is we're always going to
make sure that Miss pac-man is on top we
don't want anything else to ever show up
below her or above her like dots and
things that we're going to be placed in
here in a second so what we're going to
do is we are going to create a new
sorting layer so I'm just going to
select miss pac-man and you can see
sorting layer I'm going to come in here
and go add sorting layer this is going
to open up right here I'm going to come
over here select that and I am going to
name this new layer miss pac-man and
whatever is underneath is going to be
what is on top I know that doesn't make
sense but whatever is closer to the
bottom ends up being on top of
everything else you're going to see that
that's true later on is to do tutorial
continues so select miss pac-man and now
you can select miss pac-man in our
sorting layer so that's fixed and I am
going to actually fix the other stuff
here at a later part in the tutorial in
regards to making miss pac-man work in
the next part we'll do that now what I
want to do is I'm going to set up our
pills as well as our dots I'm going to
go create empty and I'm going to select
this and call it dots and then I'm going
to go create again create empty and I'm
going to call this pills and then we're
going to go and get our pills and dots
look there it is there is our dot so I'm
going to grab that guy and I can throw
him right there it doesn't really matter
what I'm going to do now that however is
I'm going to rename this dot and I might
as well just go and get the pill on top
of that so where is it now
there's there's a pill bigger one
drag that drop that right there and
rename that pill and then I'm going to
drag these make these prefabs so that
any change to one is going to affect all
the other ones so I'm going to grab this
drop it in prefab section grab the pill
drop it in prefab section and then I'm
going to go and delete the original
sprites that I put inside of there and
grab the dot drop it in there and grab
the pill and drop it inside of there and
now we are about ready to start laying
in these guy right so now to make sure
that everything lines up in a grid type
system what I'm going to do is I am
going to select this guy right here
the main dot inside of there and I'm
going to put it in the exposition of one
so just come over here and delete that
change up the one bleed dad change that
to one and then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to grab the dots the big
folder dots and I'm going to position it
so that the dot shows up down here where
it's supposed to so we're going to just
grab a hold of this guy and drag it into
place and then drag it down so it looks
like it's roughly in the right spot and
then what we can do is we can zoom in on
that and perfect it and until it is in
exactly the right space so that's
obviously not right so let's grab this
and let's just play around with it until
we get it in the right position so there
we are and that is going to allow us to
get our grid position exactly where we
want it to be so this is roughly there
and maybe just tweak this let's take
that down delete that altogether move it
over a little bit and just play around
with it until it looks really really
close to what you're looking for so that
looks then on perfect alright so now
that we have that dot once again in the
x1 and y1 position so we can work with
our grid system what we're going to do
then is we are going to duplicate it
actually let's go
this is let's copy this and this guy
right here and I have no problem with
that being negative point 4 9 that's
okay so we'll go and copy that to our
pills section as well so throw that in
there and this was negative point 4 9 so
that's perfectly fine also
so the pills and the dots are going to
line up and everything will be in the
grid and then we're going to grab this
guy and we are going to duplicate it a
whole bunch time so we'll go duplicate
and then all we need to do is we are
moving it on the x-axis so we'll just
change this to 2 and it will
automatically go directly where we want
it and that'll make sure that everything
lines up perfectly and then you'll just
have to duplicate it again change it to
3 and so forth and so on and this is
going to be tedious but there's really
no easy way around it and you're going
to have to draw all of those guys out on
your screen and I'm going to do that
right now ok
and got most of the board done here and
I'm just going to go and get the rest of
this right here so I'm going to go and
select all these of course just to save
some time all right and then with all
those selected once again come over here
and go duplicate and then change this to
29 and everything's in place
whoops I don't need those two inside
parents let's go and just believe them
so delete this is this and this one and
they are deleted all right so we got our
whole board filled up and now what I'm
going to do is go in place in the pills
so I'm going to go and grab this guy
right here and I'm going to place him
right here that says 1 7 so that's where
he's going to go so I'm going to delete
the dot the dot was that there it is
delete that and then we're going to put
our pill in the one 7 slot so we'll go
over here and change that one and change
that 7 and it's perfectly inside of
there and then we will go and - well
let's go and just write this down let's
get this one this is going to be 26 7
and then I'm gonna put the other dot
right here that is 125 and then this guy
is twenty-six twenty-five twenty-six
twenty-five so let's just go and we can
delete all of those so
leads and deletes and then finally the
leads and there is and then we'll go we
can close the dots so that we don't have
that taken a bold screen and then we're
going to make three duplicates so we'll
go to duplicate a duplicates and
duplicates and then we can select each
of these individual guys and put them in
the right place so the next one is going
to be twenty six and seven that's fun we
will grab this one and it will be one
and twenty five and then the final one
is going to be a twenty six and twenty
five see everything is in a grid system
everything looks perfect everything is
wonderful and there you can see is our
game board and if we run it you can see
there is miss pac-man going across the
screen and in the next part of the
tutorial I will cover exactly how to
move her around inside of our grid
system and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
