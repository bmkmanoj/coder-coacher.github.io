22 of my Android development for
beginners tutorial today I'm going to do
something that I've been asked for
numerous different times I'm going to
show you how to communicate with a
database using PHP and App Inventor all
in one tutorial I'm going to cover every
single thing so we might as well go take
a look at what the finished app is going
to look like and here is the finished
application what we're going to do here
is allow people to enter all sorts of
customer information and then store it
under an ID number so it's basically
going to send all this information to a
PHP script that's then going to put it
in a database and not only are you going
to be able to submit information you're
also going to be able to get those
customer lists from the database and
then on top of that you're going to be
able to update that data so pretty much
everything that you could ever want to
do using PHP and App Inventor and MySQL
so let's go take a look at how we're
gonna put this together okay so you saw
the finished app it's simple but it's
meant to be simple so that you guys will
be able to go out there and do anything
you would like with it now you don't
need to be an expert in PHP to be able
to use this tutorial you're basically
I'm gonna explain everything to you so
your going to be able to manipulate
things just hopefully based off of how I
explain things now I'm going to briefly
show you right here how I set up a
database now this is on GoDaddy it'll be
different for everybody but it'll be
very similar and I'm going to use PHP
myadmin
and inside a GoDaddy if you want to
start up or create a database you're
going to go into your account and it's
going to be very similar for everybody
out there like I said and then we're
going to click on web hosting and
whenever you do this is going to open up
then you're going to pick one of these
sites where you want to store this
information and just so you know all of
the scripts have been removed from the
account that I'm going to use in this
tutorial
so you're going to have to save it on
your own computer or on your own server
someplace basically you're just going to
pick whatever you want and click on
launch and whenever you do this is an
old website that I use the mess around
with this is going to open up on your
screen and then you're going to come
over here to where databases is again
it's going to be different for everybody
then you're going to come up
click on add and then this is going to
pop up you're just going to type in a
name friendly name it's just a way of
describing your database then you're
going to give it a database name this is
also going to be your user name in this
situation and then you're going to type
in your passwords like I said you don't
need GoDaddy you can use any account and
every account is going to be very
similar after that you're going to click
on OK and then your database is going to
be set up I'm going to use this one
called AI users - right there and then
after you have that all set up and
you're going to need to open up PHP my
admin in whatever way is available to
you and then you're going to type in
your username which is going to be what
we saw previously there and your
password and click on go this is going
to take you into PHP my admin and it
looks should look very similar to you
and then basically what you're going to
need to do here is come over on the side
where your database is and click on that
and whenever you do you're going to see
a window pop up and it's going to say
create a new table on the database that
you clicked on and you're going to want
to give it a name in this situation I'm
going to call mine customer and then
you're going to have to decide how many
data points you want inside of customer
in this situation I used 8 and you can
see them all right here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
oh actually I use 9 so in that fields
part you would type in 9 then inside of
here I'm just to keep this very simple
customer ID is going to be the only
thing that's going to be an integer and
what you need to know about that is that
it has to be marked unsigned right there
under attributes not null auto increment
needs to be turned on and this needs to
be checked inside of here it's called
the primary key and basically the way
it's going to operate if you're not
aware of how databases work is each time
you add a new customer you are going to
auto increment that number so everybody
has a unique number then I'm going to
type in first-name lastname so you're
just city state zip code email phone
number feel free to hit pause and then I
basically just typed in the maximum
length for each one of these fields and
I just used reasonable data here even
though 250 for email letters is not
normal that is the international
standard at least as far as I'm aware
and you don't need to mark anything else
for any of these other different
ables then after you have that all
entered you're going to come down here
and click on save and whenever you do
it's going to show you the actual SQL
that was entered and it is going to
create everything for you now if you
would come up here and click on
structure it's going to show everything
here for you now let's say you decide
you wanted to add another field inside
of here all you would do is come down
here which says add and input one field
and field is just another data point and
then come over here and then click on go
and then you would enter in any
additional fields you would want I
wanted to give every person that was
entering the data into this database a
unique ID so that we would be able to
sort who put the customer information in
it's just variable number of characters
35 and length not null
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah click on save
and that is everything in regards to
setting up the database now I'm going to
jump in and create all the PHP scripts
and explain how they work ok so here I
am in just a generic
text editor if you are on a Mac you
could use text wrangler if you want to
or if you're on a PC you could use
notepad plus plus if you're on Linux you
probably have your chosen thing now
basically what we're going to do is
we're going to create three files one's
called submit customers this is going to
handle submitting new customers into our
database customer CSV is going to return
a comma separated value list of all the
customer data and then we're going to
use it update customer is going to
update the customers so the very first
one I'm going to cover here is submit
customer like I said I'm going to do my
best to explain everything and if it
doesn't make sense
feel free to leave a comment below now
for the submit customer basically the
way you use page fee don't get worried
if you have never seen PHP before it's
going to be simple so you're just going
to start off by putting this bracket
right there this and then you're going
to put a question mark in and PHP now
what I'm going to need to do is I need
to define all of my user information my
password the host and my database name
so what I'm going to do is come in here
and I'm going to call this DB user and I
really tried to dumb this down it's not
the most secure thing on the face of the
earth by any means but I wanted to make
it understandable and it's very very
important that if you want to use this
in anything that has to be secure that
you are
to want to check and verify all the data
I do it to a certain extent that I don't
do it totally so this is the username
that we just previously entered you saw
that with the database whenever the
database rule is created now we're going
to come in here and we're also going to
need to define our password so database
password and then you're going to put
your password inside of here like that
save myself some time in here and just
copy and paste two more of these then
you're going to come in and put database
and this is going to be host and you're
going to have to get the host
information from wherever this is being
stored online so in GoDaddy I'm going to
come back here click on databases and
then I can click on actions if I want to
see it and click on details and you can
see the host name is down here so this
is where I'm going to get that from
depending upon who you use you might
have to use something different so I'm
just going to copy and paste this DB
host and then right inside of there I'm
going to paste that in and then this
here is going to be database name and
here this is going to be AI for me
anyway it's going to be different for
you and there we go
now what I need to do is connect to the
database so I'm just going to come in
here and just those database connection
whatever zoom in a little bit is equal
to and you could just copy and paste
this code like I said there's a link to
it underneath the video and there we are
and that's how I'm going to connect to
it and then I just have to go DB host
this is the information we just typed in
an DB user and DB password and there we
go now I'm going to verify that we're
actually we're able to get a connection
by just coming in here and going DB
connection and it's going to come back
to or false
and just close these brackets like that
and then if it did not work for us what
we're going to do is just say die
database connection failed just to keep
it simple and I said before we're going
to want to scrub this data and that's
basically I don't know you can leave a
comment below if you want to find out
how to do that I'll post a link to a
tutorial on how to scrub this data okay
so this is going to print on there if
the whole entire thing fails and then
let's just say exit and there we go
we're out of it and we're going to use
this same exact code in all three of
these different things then we need to
select the database that we want to
use is equal to MySQL I select database
and then you're going to pass in
database connection and then the
database name that you want to use and
that was defined up a got right here
same database name database user or
database name I mean and then we're
going to verify but that worked database
selected a bracket inside of there and
then if it didn't we're going to call
for the whole entire script to die again
database let's just say selection failed
and then the error that we have here and
then exit okay so that is how we are
going to connect to the database like I
said feel free to copy and paste rather
than typing this in then what we're
going to need because this guy's job is
to submit customers okay so we need to
submit the first name last name street
address all that stuff well to do that
we're going to pass a URL filled with
all of this information first name is
equal to and to do that we're just going
to come in here we're going to go real
escape string and then we have to give
the database connection and then we're
going to be passing this information
using the get way of passing data inside
of a URL and this is going to be first
name right here and there we go and then
we're going to do that for every single
field that we are planning to submit to
our database so that's going to be eight
different things here and then we just
need to change this right here this is
going to be last name and then we're
going to change this to last name come
back over here and this is going to be
Street and then come over here and this
is going to be Street City City State
state or province whatever you want to
call it zip and zip so it's exactly the
same information that's in our database
what we're using here email now let's
just go and do this all in a row phone
and then the recorder which is going to
be a special designation that's going to
say who entered this customer
information over here type an email
phone and then this one is going to be
recorder as well okay so we have those
all set up that is how we're going to
get the information that's passed from
App Inventor and then we're going to
store it in our database now what we
need to do is create what is called a
query that is how you put information in
a database and we're just going to go
insert into the table named customer and
then we have to put in what we want to
be inserted so I'm going to say first
name last name street address these are
the names of these locations in the
database city state which went over here
there's state zip code email phone
number and the recorder ID just closing
bracket here then we're going to save
values and then we're going to get this
information it was created up here all
this first name last name street city
blah blah blah all that and then when
we're going to put that inside of here
make sure we put it in quotes and I'm
going to say first name make sure you
have closing quotes make sure you have
the dollar sign as well last name which
is now over here
straight city state zip email phone and
then finally recorder and make sure you
spell it right after you do that closing
bracket and then we're going to put
double quote and close that off we're
almost done with this first one and the
rest of them we're going to go pretty
easy is it going to be a lot of copied
and pasted and then after we create this
query we have to actually execute it so
I'm going to go result is equal to my
SQL
I query DB C and pass in the query that
you want to be issued and then we're
going to say or trigger error and let's
say something like query my
skew L error there we go rocket there do
this and then we can go to my sqli
underscore error which is over here and
then pass in the database connection
again close that off and there you go
and then after we're done with that
we're going to go MySQL I close and pass
the database connection and we're done
this couple lines of code is going to
allow you to submit information from App
Inventor into your database this is all
you need right there now what we're
going to do is get the customer data in
a customer comma separated value list
and we're going to use PHP again for
that and what's cool about this is I'm
going to be able to come in here and
copy a lot of this stuff copy that over
here paste it inside of there just to
make sure you don't forget later on put
the little question mark and close this
off zoom out of that okay we just add a
couple lines inside of here just to make
sure that we can get all this data all
right so we logged in we did all this we
have to do this again to connect to the
database and then once we do that of
course and you're going to have to enter
your own password inside of there and
all your other information is going to
be different and then we're going to go
result is equal to my sqli query pass in
your database connection and then you
need to pass in a query and i'm going to
say show columns from customer like that
and then close that off and then what
this is going to do is it's going to
give me the number of rows of data that
I have in my database is equal to MySQL
I num rows and you just pass in the
result right like this and then close
that off now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to verify that the number of rows
is greater than 0 otherwise I'm not
going to do it any customers to work
with does that Brack it off and I'm
going to go values is equal to MySQL I
query do another query for the database
pass in the database connection we want
to use and then issue another query here
we're going to say select star which
stands for everything from customer
which is the table we're working
we're and then in this situation I want
to just get customer information that
applies to the ID Fred now the whole
idea behind this is that I want to only
send back
Fred's list of customers that he entered
that's going to be true for every single
person that is taking in customer
information they're all going to be
unique and then an administrator would
basically not have this on there they'd
be able to receive all the customer
information so if you're an
administrator all you need to do is
create another thing called customer CSV
like you could call this customer CSV
Fred that would make sense and then you
would create another one called customer
CSV admin and the customer CSV admin
wouldn't have the where port on it so in
that situation they'd get every customer
and closing quotes and there we go
alright so that is our query that we're
going to use to get the customer
information that we need come down
inside of here and then what I'm going
to do is cycle through all these and put
them in into a comma separated value
list so I'm gonna go of your or is equal
to my sqli and I want to say I want to
fetch a row of customer data and I just
need to pass it the values like that
it's going to keep cycling through there
in two or while there continues to be
additional data to get and then inside
of this I'm going to say for I'm going
to put a J is equal to zero I'm going to
say J we're going to keep incrementing
the value of J to get each piece of data
from the customer information as long as
I have rows of data to get at the end we
just increment J so it said I want the
piece of data in section zero and I want
the piece of data in section one and two
and three and four so hopefully that
makes sense doing my best to make this
tutorial understandable for people that
don't even know PHP that's the goal I
don't know if I'll succeed or not and
then I'm just going to go CSV output
this is what's going to be sent back
remember this information is gonna be
sent back to App Inventor so that will
get all the customer data I'm gonna
rrrow and then I'm going to go Jay put
the J inside of that and this row is
basically just going to be like a box
that is going to contain all the
customer data and each box for each
piece of data is going to increment so
it'll be box zero will contain the name
and box 1 will contain the last name and
in the street and data data and we just
increment that right there and that's
what this guy right here does and then
we're going to separate this with commas
and there we go and then to divide up
each of the individual customers we're
then going to also add on to this this
is the customer data it's going to be
passed back separated with commas and
then to separate each individual
customer we have to have a new line and
this is what this symbol right here
represents new line and then we will
close off these two brackets and then we
will call print and this will be the
data that is printed out and then after
that we go exit and then after that we
come down here and we make sure we don't
have any extra space in there for no
reason and then that's done so we got
that one done too and now all we need to
do is create a script that's going to
allow us to update the customer data and
we're going to need all of this stuff
and actually we are going to copy
actually let's go into the submit
customer is to save us a lot of time
we're going to copy this and we're also
going to copy all of this we just have
to make a couple little changes paste
all that in there so again we're going
to connect to the database and we're
going to enter the all that information
and the thing we're going to do down
here that's going to be a little bit
different this is where we're going to
update or change a customer in the
database what we're going to do is have
this be first name we're basically going
to delete the recorder that's not going
to be important information but one
thing that is going to be important is
we want to make sure we update the right
customer ID so to do that we are going
to also be receiving the customer ID and
over inside of here we're going to type
in customer ID that's going to be the
new piece of information that's sent
over and everything else can stay
exactly the same and then we're going to
have to issue a new query for the
database
come in here we're going to say it's
equal to if you want to update
information in the database you just
type in update and the table you want to
update and then set and then each piece
of the database first name is going to
be equal to the data that was passed
over put a quote right there and then
we're going to type in first name right
like that and then we're going to type
in last name is equal to and in this
situation that's going to be last name
and then we're going to type in street
address which I believe is over here now
which is again the name in the database
we'll make sure that's clear and then to
save you from having to watch me type
all that out you're going to enter in
your city you're gonna enter the state
the zip code you're going to enter in
the email the phone number and then
you're going to type in we're customer
ID is the customer ID that you want to
change okay which is passed in right
here alright then let's go and copy a
result this guy right here bounced back
over here paste that in there except in
this situation we're going to enter in
query instead of this and might as well
just go and do some more copying and
pasting or trigger err blah blah copy
for trigger err query MySQL error this
guy right here and then - - oli error
same exact thing we just had and the
only thing is we don't want to have two
semicolons there at the end and then to
finish it off we're going to go mysqli
closed DB c and then at the end of it
we're gonna go like this and like this
and we're done we just did all the PHP
scripts we're going to need for the
entire App Inventor app so now let's
jump over into App Inventor of course
you'd have to upload all of these to
your server and then after you do that
you're going to be able to jump into App
Inventor and start making this so here
we are inside of App Inventor and you
can just see I have a horizontal layout
I have a first name label say right here
you can make this cleaner and nicer and
then I went in and put in little text
boxes this is called first name text box
again I'm going to put all of this
information in a link under the video so
you can see first name text box this is
very very very simple I did that for
each one of these just simple label text
box and then I have a bunch of buttons
so I have a submit customer
button I get customer button an update
customer button then I have a list
picker that's going to pop up and show a
list of all the customers names then I
have a web tool that's going to allow me
to communicate with our PHP script and
then a notify and that is it that is all
we need you can see right there web 1
notifier blah blah blah very simple so
let's jump over into the block section
and make it all work
alright so what sort of things are we
going to need here I'm just gonna walk
through my thinking process as I go I'm
gonna need obviously a list of customers
so let's go and create that so customer
list and since it's going to be a list
I'm gonna need it to be empty to start
off so let's just create an empty list
there it is we're all done with that
what else we going to need well we're
going to continuously have to
communicate with the PHP script using a
URL we're going to probably need to you
are ELLs one is going to be a temporary
one and the other one is going to be a
main one obviously and let's just come
in here put nothing inside of that and
I'm going to name this the URL I could
probably come up with a better name if I
thought for a little bit duplicate this
and then this one is going to be called
ten URL you'll see in a second one when
I do with those then I need to handle
how to submit customer information now
they're going to enter it in those text
boxes and I'm going to send it using all
our little wonderful tools we have here
so the very first thing I'm going to do
is set up how to submit that customer
data so come over here click on submit
customer get a click drag this right
here drop it and then what are we going
to do well in the temp URL we're going
to start creating everything here reason
why we have temps and we have the main
URL is I'm going to have to replace
every space in the URL with a % followed
by 20 which represents bases because you
can't have spaces in URL if you didn't
know that and if you don't use the web
at a time you probably wouldn't know
that so let's go and get this we have to
create a massive join here that's going
to store all that information now the
very first thing we're going to do is
we're going to have to point towards my
website where the PHP
program that you just saw is located so
it's going to be new just in this and I
just want to reiterate that I am going
to delete all this stuff as soon as I'm
done using it so you'll have to do that
on your own but you can still basically
just copy and paste so this is what we
have to do submit customer PHP this guy
right here that's where we're going to
be calling drag it drop it right there
and then that is going to be followed
with the first name actually I have to
put in a little little bit more inside
of here come back down inside here I'm
going to go first name is equal to and
that is where we're going to pass in our
first name information and we're going
to get that first name information from
our text box so I'll come in here and
we'll get the text out of the text box
which is right here and drop it right
there and there you can see everything
we need a ton more joints we're going to
need 16 of them since we have eight data
points inside of here that's one 14 15
16 or at least I think that's right
all right so those are every one of the
things we need then what we're going to
need to do is come in here and separate
all the pieces of data with an and sign
followed by whatever I want to pass in
next well first name makes sense then
last name is equal to and there that is
and then I'm just gonna duplicate these
duplicate okay and then I'm going to
need to come in here and type in Street
city state zip email phone Recorder and
there we go and now I'm going to
duplicate some more things duplicate
this so we can quickly fill these in and
then just change them to what they're
supposed to be so last name street city
state zip email phone and then recorder
finally okay got that whole set now what
we need to do is go and get the real URL
which is going to have those values
inside of them and I told you about
before and to replace them we're just
going to have to go over here into text
and we're going to look for replace all
place all this got way down here
grab that whoops click it again place
all text drag it over here to rob it
right there
put that back some reason this jumped
over here to happen venner just being
crazy ok and we're going to get the
temporary which has the current you're
all information inside of it and then
we're going to say that we want to
replace all spaces so grab this guy
right here drag it put it right there
we're going to say that we want to make
all spaces make sure you come in here
after that and put a space inside of
there like that and we're going to
replace it with percent twenty which in
the URL world represents a blank space
then after we do that we go over into
the web part this guy right here and we
have defined our URL or we need to
define our URL if this guy right here
drop it right there
gonna have to get the main URL this guy
grab it right down here take it drop it
right there you can say it like that
we're going to click on web again and
call get and that is going to allow us
to submit data that's all we have to do
right there and now we can submit our
customer data now whenever we submit new
customer data chances are we are going
to want to update our list picker so I'm
going to create a procedure over there
click on this and I'm going to call it
update list picker that's going to allow
the user to go in there and select the
people they want to use or the customers
they want to work with and to get it
guess what I'm going to have to call my
PHP script so I'm going to go down here
and go into the web part and define the
URL that I want to work with set the URL
and in this situation I'm going to be
calling HTTP /nu justin.com forward
slash customer CSV dot PHP that nice guy
we created and that's going to return
that list for me and then I'm gonna call
get on that and there we go update list
picker da-da-da-da-da now whenever they
click on the get customer button this
guy over here get customer button click
if you've watched this video so far
really be happy if you leave a comment
that you actually watch that because I
like the only guy who makes long videos
on the Internet but I just think that
for certain people it works better so
that's what I do I'm not gonna tell you
to like favorite to all your friends
about this I just want to know if you
actually watch the video all right and
then we're going to come over to
variables and I'm going to create an
empty list it's going to contain all the
customers from my list picker so I get
this guy customer for list picker create
an empty list alright then after we get
all of the information which is going to
be the comma separated value you know
table or whatever file that we called
for with this guy right here we're going
to need to catch it so let's go in here
again and go to web and this is what's
going to be automatically called anytime
new information comes through and this
is got text in this situation now we're
going to go to our customer list which
is up here actually I'm going to drag it
down here so that I can get ahold of it
if I need it
there we go I'm gonna say that I want to
set my customer list this guy drag it
over here drop it right there and then I
want to come into the list area and
convert my CSV into an actual list that
I can store inside of here and to do
that role weigh down list from CSV table
is the one that we want there it is and
then response content is what we want to
get then we're going to go customers for
our list get this guy and let's create
or let's delete every single time any
information that might already be in
that list then we're gonna have to cycle
through all of the content that was sent
over and add it to our list picker so go
into control where you go for each which
is this thing right here drag it drop it
right there and in this situation it's
going to be customer list which is where
all that information was being stored
it's going to cycle through each one of
these pieces of information and then
store it in our list picker for us one
thing I want to do however is I'm going
to be both updating as well as getting
information from the list and a whole
bunch of other different things and as
you're going to see a little bit later
and whenever I update it doesn't send me
back a full list of every single
customers so what I want to do here is I
want to make a check I'm going to check
that I am getting at least two customers
whenever I ask for this information so
I'm going to create a variable it's
going to be called length of lists let's
go right here
and it's simply going to be there to
verify that I don't try to grab list
information that doesn't exist so length
of list I'm going to start it off with a
value of 0 which is going to be a no-go
then in here and right here I'm gonna
set it it's going to be the length of my
list so I come over here get length of
list length of list this guy right here
drop it right there for my item I want
to verify that I actually have the list
data in there before I try to grab it
how I'm going to do that is with control
I'm going to throw an if block inside of
here there like that and then I have to
verify that it's greater than 1 so grab
this and length of list get then I'm
going to verify that it's greater than 1
greater than 1 and if it is then I can
add that item to my list so come in here
to lists again add items to list and the
item I want to add is going to be
customer data and this is going to be
customers for list picker so there's
that and then I'm going to go over to
text and do a join and then I need to
select the list items I want the first
name and the last name first name is
actually going to be the second thing in
my list and the last name is going to be
the third thing the first thing of
course is the customer number so go into
list and then get select list item and I
specifically want the index there's that
and I'm going to have to get this item
up here get which is going to be each of
the individual customers in a list and
then I specifically want the second one
because that's where the first name
resides and I'm gonna have to put a
space in this join right here grab this
string throw that right there I'm also
going to grab the last name throw that
right there change this to 3 there we go
and put a space in between the first and
last name this is gonna this is all just
for the list picker so it's like just
enough information to do just about
everything but hopefully not too much
and then
and what I want to do is open the list
picker if this isn't an update so if I
just want to open list picker only if
the information was just updated inside
the list picker so to do that I'm gonna
have to get another if-then-else
drop that right there and again I'm
going to verify that the length of the
list was greater than 1 this is just
first thing that comes to mind in how to
do this and if I have more than one list
items then that means that I'm going to
be able to set my list picker so let's
come over here let's picker right there
and I'm going to need to set the
elements set list picker elements to up
that right there and then I'm gonna get
customers for listpicker that is all the
data that I need and then I'm going to
call from my list picker to open and
display all the customers there that is
drag it and drop it right there there
you go that's going to add all the
customers first and last names to the
list picker and then open list picker
now I have to handle what is going to
happen after the item is picked in the
list picker well basically what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take all of
the customer information the first name
last name street City and all that stuff
and put it in the proper fields inside
of my App Inventor app so click on this
and say after picking after they pick
the customer that they want to work with
I'm going to drop this right here then
I'm going to set the first name and all
the other ones whoops not that thing
this one right here I'm going to set the
text into this get the right customer
information drag that drop it right
there so that's the first name and then
select list item list I need to this is
lists inside of lists so I'm have to do
is get my whole entire customer list
pass it to the list picker index that
was clicked on or the customer was
clicked on and then grab the first name
last name and all those other different
things it's actually going to be quicker
to do then you can imagine so come in
here select this drag it drop it right
there and then I'm going to have so this
is going to be the actual list of
customer data and then this right here
duplicate this is actually going to be
the customer list that I'm going to be
working with so customer list there that
is get this drop it right there and if I
want the item that was clicked on in the
Specter I need to go Liz Becker and ask
specifically for selection index which
were then going to use to grab the right
customer and then right here we're going
to say we want the first name and there
that is now we can duplicate this whole
bunch of times because it's all the same
except in this situation if I want the
last name I'm going to have to say that
I want index number three because that's
where the last name resides do the same
thing for every other field
okay so last name street twin here get
the city I'm in here state zip over here
change this for just five whoops five
chains just the six seven this is
actually going to be nine in this
situation let's come over here and get
this zip code phone number this is going
to be the email address believe yes
email address this is going to be eight
this is just where the data resides if
you make an error that's okay I've made
more errors than anybody can imagine
duplicate here's the recorder person and
enter the information that's going to be
ten but then I'm also going to want to
have whatever the current customer is
that is selected I'm going to want that
later on whenever I want to find out
what customer I want to update so that
means I'm going to have to come over
here create a variable and this guy is
gonna be called current customer that's
going to be the customer that we are
working with or the customer data that's
being displayed on the screen or
what-have-you
current customer and let's just give him
a nothing value in the beginning and
like I said before there is no customer
zero that it starts off with one so I'm
going to use this to verify that I'm
actually working with a real customer
okay leave this down here so in this
situation I'm going to be able to set
this so that I can use it later on for
the update duplicate grab this put that
there and then in this situation this is
going to be the first item because the
very first item in our list of customer
data is actually the customer number and
there we go and we're almost finished
which is amazing we did a lot of stuff
here guys
now we have to handle what happens if
the customer wants to update to the
information this is the last one oh
we're pretty much going to have to
to make the Update button work is copy a
lot of what's in the submit part of the
blocks in App Inventor let's just drag
this up here just to make this a lot
easier okay well the very first thing
that we're gonna have to do we're going
to copy all this stuff from the submit
area and the first thing we're going to
need to do is verify that we do not have
current customer set for 0 so that means
we're gonna have to get ourselves and if
block drag it over here drop it right
there and we're gonna have to say well
let's go grab that thing so we don't
have to wait there is current customer
drag it up here
okay so we got current customer up here
and we just want to check that it's not
equal to zero so go to the math section
grab one of these guys drop it right
there current customer we want to get
its current value and we want to say if
it's not equal to zero then we are going
to be able to work with this so drop it
right there and then what it's time to
do a lot of copying we're going to take
the temp URL all this stuff we'll just
have to change a couple different things
drag this over here and we're going to
have to come in here and change this to
update customer right there so delete
this update customer and first name is
perfectly fine on that only thing we're
going to have to do is come down here
I'm going to zoom out again and remember
that we don't have the recorder because
that doesn't matter but we do need the
customer ID so we're just going to
change this to customer ID customer ID
like that and then we're going to say
that we want to get the current customer
so let's just delete this and let's get
the current customer which is up here
let's duplicate this drag it and drop it
right there and there you go that's the
only thing we changed right there and
scroll down here we're going to need to
replace these spaces once again so
that's just going to be another copy
this guy over here and actually we're
going to copy all a lot of this stuff so
let's just duplicate this drop it right
there
and then we're also going to set the URL
so let's duplicate this drag
there and then we're also going to tell
it to go get the information and there
we are so all that stuff is a copy once
again and the only other thing we're
going to do here is we're going to if
there was a situation where the current
customer was zero we're going to notify
the person that that was true well that
took off down here and there it is so
let's get an else block and drag it and
drop it right there okay and then we're
gonna have to come over here to the
notifier and let's say that we want to
do a show message dialog to tell them
that we have bad customer data for some
reason and I'm just going to keep this
very simple I'm just going to say bad
customer data and put that as my message
and we could put something else error
and then okay there we are and there you
are guys I covered every single piece of
information you would need to know to be
able to work with PHP scripts and
databases using App Inventor
I hope somebody stuck along and watch
the whole entire thing please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
