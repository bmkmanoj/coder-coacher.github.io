tutorial on regular expressions you
might not know what that term means but
it is one of the most powerful ways of
using programming languages and before I
spend a lot of time trying to learn
something new I always would love to
know ultimately what I'm going to get
out of it well a lot of you guys have
asked for tutorials on how to scrub
websites meaning jump onto a website and
take out all the information that you
want and then do whatever you want with
it
well with regular expressions you can do
that quite easily here I use the regular
expression to jump over to the
Huffington Post and grab the title for a
whole host of articles links to the
original article and a description for
said article and I did that using for
the most part about two lines of code
which you can see right here that's what
these two lines of code pretty much do
they go to the huffington post they grab
a whole bunch of information and they
sort it how i tell it to do it now
regular expressions are just simply a
series of codes that you use to define
exactly what text you are looking for
when I mean text I'm not talking about
just letters I'm talking about letters
numbers punctuation and so forth and the
reason I did this tutorial ultimately
was because I actually saw a guy who I
think works for Google who got all
confused with regular expressions in a
tutorial on regular expression so I was
like darn it I'm gonna fix this and
here's another example of a regular
expression that will search through
mountains of text to find either the
word Jennifer Jenny or Jen and it looks
real confusing but it's not going to be
confusing for too long so let me give
you some more examples here let's say
you're given a 10,000 page document and
you're asked to retrieve every street
address from that document this is a
very easy task with regular expressions
I'm going to start off simple let's say
you just need the street address and
that every city is the same and there
are no apartments or Suites
you can also trust that what you're
looking for will be of the form 1 2 3
Main Street
real simple simple address you're also
told that all house numbers will be no
long
than five digits in length street names
are exactly one word and every address
is either a Street or Avenue and a
period is always used well the regular
expression you would use to define this
would be a digit between one to five
digits in length that's what this means
right here this represents digit or
number or whatever you want to call it
and then whenever you use these curly
brackets
you're saying that you expect between
one to five digits which you can see
here three and then what's followed by
that a space with a regular expression
for space is just a backslash followed
by a lowercase s and then you expect a
series of characters that are going to
be between one two multiple letters in
length and this W represents anything
that's a character and this plus sign
represents one or more in regular
expressions and then of course you're
going to have another space because you
can see here's a space and then what do
you expect another series of characters
that are going to need one or more in
length and then finally you're going to
have a backslash and a period the reason
why you use backslash is with this
period here instead of just simply
putting a period just like that is
because this period is often used in
regular expressions to represent any
character possible except for newline
but we're getting into that in a second
so because it is a regular expression
code you have to put the backslash it's
not 100% understandable at this point
don't worry about it I go more into that
here in the future but that's basically
what it is it's a series of numbers
between one to five digits in length
followed by space followed by a series
of characters that will be one or more
than another space then a series of
characters one or more followed by a
period so there is an example of a
regular expression now it might be a
little bit confusing but it gets a lot
more confusing whenever you do this and
this
is the reason why people find regular
expressions to be confusing now imagine
if your regular expression is this long
this is why people think regular
expressions are really really confusing
but I hope you're kind of gathering
exactly what goes into them they're
really not as bad as people think so I'm
going to review here now a backslash
followed by 8d is going to represent any
number that's what it does a backslash
followed by a capital D represents any
thing but a number
backslash S represents any space
backslash capital S anything but a space
we've already seen backslash W any
character meaning letter capital W
anything what a character and then you
have period which matches any character
except for a line break then backslash B
matches for a space that precedes or
follows a whole word boy that's
confusing here is what I made my dog it
matches right here see there's a word
and then there's a space and then there
is another word so you would use this B
if you were specifically looking for
that and I'll give you further examples
but let's say you're tasked with
searching through a mountain of
documents for anyone named Jennifer how
exactly would you be able to do that
well you can also search for literal
text and you would this and I'm aiming
to be as unconfuse Amanda beliefs things
so yeah sometimes there will be
shortcuts and maybe there's easier ways
to do some things but I'm doing this to
be a hundred percent understandable this
will search for the word Jennifer
followed by a space one or more
characters and then another space the
plus signed again stands for one or more
of the code that precedes it in this
case I'm stating I'm looking for one or
more characters right here and what am I
trying to do I'm trying to grab a last
name so I'm trying to find not only the
word Jennifer but I'm also a space
followed by the last name for
Jennifer now there are other codes such
as the plus sign and they are the
question mark and this signifies you're
looking for 0 or 1 repetitions of
whatever code precedes it and then you
have the star and this signifies 0 for
more repetitions then if you know
exactly the number of repetitions you're
looking for using n to represent a
number you would use this code right
here to state that you expect n of the
code that precedes it to be within the
text you're looking for to try and make
this more understandable let's go back /
D followed by curly braces and then 5
what this is saying is in your code that
you're searching for you expect to find
5 digits in a row or as I showed you in
the previous example you could say that
you expect between 1 and 5 digits in a
row with this code right here and again
if there's anything that's on a little
bit confusing I'm going to be giving you
a gazillion code examples so you're
going to be able to really get this just
sit back and digest and understand as
much as you can possibly get now while
we can search for literal terms like we
just did with Jennifer above some
characters require escaping like the
period that I showed you before by
escaping I mean they must be followed by
a backslash the dollar sign is another
thing that needs to be escaped as does
the period as I showed you before so
let's say using both those examples you
need to search for a dollar amount how
would you do that just simply backslash
followed by a dollar sign and then you
expect a certain number of digits and
you are going to define that just like
that and then you're going to expect
that there be a period followed by
another set of digits that will be
exactly two digits in length and this
code right here would match up for this
for example in text that you are
searching for and there are numerous
other codes that need to be escaped if
you are searching for them being these
braces
as well as the star sign as well as the
plus sign as well as the question mark
you don't really need to memorize these
because you're going to use them all the
time
and you're going to start to understand
that okay well that's something that I
use in regular expressions so of course
I'm not able to search for it without
back slashing and these are all of them
this is every single code that you would
need to escape now if you wanted to be
able to search for specific whitespace
characters that I haven't gone over
before you would use these codes this
would be an escaped whitespace this
would be a form feed this would be a
newline which if you're not new to
programming you've seen before this
would be a carriage return and this
would be a horizontal tab so those are
all the different codes that you would
need there and if you need any of this
information it's all I knew think tank
comm you can copy it print it do
whatever you want and of course it's all
free and in this tutorial I'm going to
give you one more example and then we'll
continue in the next tutorial because I
have limited time on YouTube what could
you do if you wanted to search for
commonly misspelled words like for
example calendar is commonly misspelled
and here I'm going to show you how to
search for calendar spelled wrong or
calendar spelled right and you do that
with these bracket guys right here
basically what happens with these
brackets and this would actually be D
and basically what you're saying here is
you want to search for the word calendar
spelled either this way or spelled this
way because they're incorrectly spelled
so many times and that's basically
exactly what this guy does it will look
for calendar spelled correctly and if it
finds it it says here it is and it will
alert you I'm going to show you in code
how it will alert you or it's going to
find it with the e and then it's going
to say here it is misspelled and then
that's how you would be able to search
for that so I'm going to go more into
exactly what these brackets look like
let's say you wanted to search for every
single lowercase letter how would you do
that just like this that's it a through
Z with surrounded by the brackets and
what this is going to return is one of
any of these lowercase letters you
do the same thing of course with any
number of numbers or you could search
for all capital letters from A through F
and all lowercase letters from a to T
and all numbers from 0 to 4 and you
would just put those in your codes and
that would allow you to be able to
search for all those different little
things so that's the introduction to
regular expressions in the next tutorial
I'm going to give you more examples and
I'm going to show you how to do all
these different things in code and
you're going to be overwhelmed with
examples and the ultimate goal in the
end is that you truly understand regular
expressions and can do great things with
them if you have any questions or
