19 of my android development for
beginners tutorial today I'm gonna
answer a ton of different questions that
I have been getting I'm gonna focus in
on programming logic and more
specifically how to incrementally put
together an app inventor app and pretty
much any type of application for Android
or anything you can think of but more
specifically we're gonna cover this with
App Inventor also I'm gonna show you how
to make a contacts application and why
that's important is a question I get all
the time is how to create lists of lists
more specifically lists of contacts that
have lists of information inside of them
but I'm going to take in another step
and I'm gonna store these on a tiny web
DB and also access and change them on
multiple different screens so hopefully
this is gonna answer a lot of your
questions and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay something I've
been getting a question about a lot is
why don't I draw out an app inventor app
using a sequence diagram well this right
here is a sequence diagram just for
anybody that doesn't know and know I'm
not going to do that mainly because in
my opinion it would complicate the
process so I just wanted to get that out
of the way what I will do however is
create a use case diagram or a use case
description so let's take a look at what
one of those would look like
okay so this is basically it it's pretty
simple but if you do this it's going to
make developing applications very easy
and all you're basically going to do is
list out exactly what you want your
application to do and the more detailed
you are the easier is going to be for
you to make an application so right here
what I'm gonna do I'm going to
demonstrate how to create a use case
description and on top of that we're
going to model out exactly how we're
going to update a list picker based off
of names or contact names being entered
so basically what we're gonna do why
don't we jump over and look at what the
apps gonna look like okay so this is the
application interface that we're gonna
be working with and let's think about
what we need to do basically what's
gonna happen this is a list picker
whenever they click on this it's gonna
list all your friends okay and I'm
keeping this simple just so that it is
extremely easy to understand hey
basically what we need to model out in
our use case description is how they're
going to enter a name and hit add
contact and then it's going to be put in
our friends list picker and that's it we
want to start off slow and increment our
way up to create our application and
test test test all along to make sure
that each little part works so now let's
jump back over into the description take
a look and think about that okay so
basically what we need to do is just
list out exactly what we want to happen
all right so basically when the user
clicks add contact we want to check to
make sure that we have a contact to be
added basically do we have a contacts
name inside of the text box okay very
important if so we want to create a list
that will contain the contacts
information then we want to add the
contact list of data to our master list
we're gonna have a master list and then
we're also going to have a list picker
so we want to update our list picker
then when the list picker is updated
what do we want to do we want to first
create an empty string that's going to
contain the picker elements because how
we add elements to a list picker as we
create a string that's just a list of
items separated by commas we're then
going to make sure that the master list
has contacts in it and then we're gonna
say that we want to go through the
master list and for each contact we want
to put it in the string which is going
to represent our element list that is
exactly what we wanna do this page right
here and this one right here that is our
description of what we want our
application to do so let's go back over
into App Inventor and let's implement
that it may be useful if you have that
list of things in front of you because
we're gonna jump into the block section
and we're going to start modeling
everything okay so what I had in my use
case description is basically I'm going
to need a couple variables I'm going to
need a contact list and it is going to
be my master list so we're gonna go over
into lists and we're just gonna say hey
create an empty list okay we're going to
initialize or give it Ava
that is what we're doing there then on
top of that we're going to want
individual contacts so let's duplicate
this and these individual contacts are
going to be added to this list so I'm
just gonna call this in div contact and
there we go
now what do we need to do well from our
description we said that whenever they
click on the button add contact button
this guy right here we're gonna get this
and you can kind of see how this looks
like a sequence diagram that's why I
don't make sequence diagrams for these
then what I wanted to do is make sure
that I actually have a contact name in
the text box which is right here so I'm
gonna say that I want to go and get the
text from that text box so come in here
get that text and drag it out of here
and let's just drop it right here and
what I said I wanted to specifically do
is make sure it's not empty so to do
that I'm gonna go into logic and get not
drop that there I'm also going to go
into control
if remember I'm going to do different
things based off of different conditions
not and then I'm gonna check that the
text area is not empty so all right
empty there we go and there we go
alright so if that check works we are
going to do certain things now the
certain things we're going to do is
first off we're going to add the name to
the individual contact so I'm gonna get
this guy right here and because it's a
list I have to add it using list tools
so add items to list there we go drop
that right there yet this is the list so
I'm going to add the name to this guy
right here and if I had addresses and
cities and streets and all that stuff I
would just add multiple things to this
individual list okay then I'm gonna add
these individual lists into my contact
list which is going to contain every
single one of my contacts so basically
what I want to do now is I want to
duplicate this drop it right here and
this time the individual list is gonna
go there and the contact list is gonna
go here so that is how I'm going to add
lists of Lists let's just get rid of
this and then at the end I want to make
sure that this individual that I no
longer need it's stored in the list is
deleted it was just a temporary
that I was gonna be working with so I'm
just gonna go set individual and I'm
gonna make it empty again
okay so duplicate that drop that right
there then what I want to do is update
my list picker because that is what I
showed in the description so let's go
take a look at that so here we are
update list picker what are we gonna do
well we're going to go in here and we're
going to create an empty little
container that's going to contain all of
the elements that are gonna go into
lists picker then I'm gonna make sure
that the master list has contacts in it
then I'm gonna add each contacts name to
the list picker element list I just want
the names I don't want anything else and
then I want to add the element list back
to the list picker so let's go and model
that out and to do that I'm gonna go
create a procedure and I'm gonna give
this a name of update list picker and
then I'm gonna do exactly what I said it
was gonna do going to create a variable
and this is going to be the string that
is going to be used to create all the
elements in my list picker string for
list picker and I said previously that
wasn't gonna have any value I'll put
that right there let's move this down a
little bit then I'm gonna go into my
list picker elements from string this
guy right here I'm gonna set this to
nothing there we go and this is gonna be
the little guy that we're going to be
adding to so that we can then add
everything to the list picker gonna get
this guy right here we're going to
verify because update list picker is
gonna be called numerous different times
we're going to verify that that actually
has nothing in it and then we're gonna
need another one of these strings it's
gonna be a temporary string let's
duplicate this it's gonna be a temporary
holding cell for each of the items that
we want to add so I'm gonna give it a
name of temp string and come down here
we're set and let's also give that a
nothing value there we go
okay then we said we want to verify that
our contact list this guy right here
isn't empty so to do that we're gonna
drag this down here and we're gonna need
to go and get an if statement if drop
that right there and to check that it
isn't empty we're gonna need a knot just
like we had right there logic not if not
we want to check if a list isn't empty
we're gonna have to go into the lists
area list empty
right there and then we're gonna put
this contact list inside of here
now what we're gonna do if we get to the
then part we know that this is an empty
and we can add these things to our list
picker so we're gonna have to cycle
through all of the different list items
and I'm gonna use it for each block for
this and specifically what I'm gonna be
getting information from is this guy
right here then I'm gonna get and set
the temporary string and remember item
is going to actually hold the contact
because this is list inside of lists or
contacts inside of contact list and then
information on the contacts inside of
there as well so what we're gonna need
to do is use this guy right here what
we're gonna have to get the first
element inside of it which is going to
be the name so that means we're gonna
have to come up here and get a join up
that right there and then if we want to
get lists inside of lists we're gonna
have to go inside of the list area and
go select list item and this is going to
be the actual contact and if we want the
name we're gonna get the first item
inside of it that is where the names
gonna be located and then after that
we're gonna put a comma to separate it
and that's going to allow us to create
our string of elements that is going to
create the list picker now what we're
gonna do is get our string for the list
picker here drop it right here
we know it starts off with nothing
inside of it which is good and now what
we want to do is add this new temporary
element or name that we just got let's
just duplicate this drop that there I'm
gonna come in here and delete this and
then we're gonna go and get this drop
that there and then we're gonna get the
temporary string which is gonna contain
the name that we need that's gonna
create that list then after we go
through every single item in our contact
list what we need to do is store
everything in the list picker so go over
to the list picker set the list picker
based off of elements from string which
we just created make sure we put it
outside of the for each block and then
this guy right here is gonna contain our
list of elements and that's it basically
what we did was we took that description
we had well it's not quite it I need to
go into procedures and call update list
picker now that's it so that's how we
went and we created everything based off
of that
description of what we needed to do okay
so that's the translation we can quickly
go over and take a look at what that app
looks like right now on our device okay
so here's our application real simple
we're gonna be able to come in here and
just enter in a name and by keeping
everything nice and simple and
incrementally building this it's gonna
be very easy we're gonna hit add contact
and then whenever we click on friends
we're going to see Paul is there okay so
now that we know that works what we want
to do now is we want to add these lists
of lists of contacts to a database so
let's look at another use case that's
going to explain exactly how we're going
to do that okay so basically what we're
gonna need to do here to make this store
on the database is we need to first
catch any web service errors that are
going to occur then we're gonna need to
get data from the web service whenever
the app loads so that all that
information can then be stored inside of
our list picker as well as our master
list we're going to of course need to
verify that proper tags are designated
so that we get the proper data and if
the data should be updated we need to
check that it is a list and then store
it in our web DB and that would occur
any time new names are added so let's
jump back over into App Inventor and
implement all that okay so we're going
to implement everything in the exact
order in which we listed everything out
that we need to do and we have a tiny
web DB here so just click on that very
first thing we listed is we want to
handle any errors that occur so just
drag this guy out drop him right there
and basically how we're gonna handle
that is with a notifier so get a
notifier and i want to put a little bit
of information so i'm gonna get the show
message dialog drop that there and then
specifically what I want to do here is
for the message I'm just gonna get the
message that's sent it gives us
information on the air and then I'm
gonna call this I don't know error
downloading there we go right there and
then the button text is just gonna be
okay all right so got rid of one of the
things we needed to get rid of now what
we need to do is initialize the screen
and get all the information from the web
when everything
top man to do that we're gonna go into
screen and initialize and drag that and
drop it right there whenever we want to
get all of our data from the web I'm
gonna create a procedure that just does
that drag this guy out of here
and we should also get ourselves some
more room cuz running out drop that
right there get data from web and to get
the data from the web we're gonna need
to go tiny DB get value and I need to
just give it a keyword phrase that I can
find it with now what I'm gonna do is
type in NTT contacts and you might think
yourself well why doesn't he just type
in contacts well chances are since this
is gonna be a shared database on the
internet there is a very good chance
that somebody else might be storing a
tag name contacts so I'm gonna put NTT
for new think-tank on there to cut down
on the chances that somebody goes in
there and gets my dad or messes my dad
off so that's why I called it that I
have to always be thinking about
potential problems so get data from web
we're gonna do that whenever this is
initialized so there we go
and then on top of that I want to update
my list picker because the data could
have changed so also going to procedures
update list picker there we go now we
have all of that set up next thing we're
gonna need to do here is actually get
the value because here we're saying we
want to go get it but to actually
retrieve it and make sure it's the right
information we need to go into tiny web
DB and get got value this is the guy
that's going to be called after the data
is actually retrieved and if you can
remember from our list of things we
wanted to do very first thing we want to
do is verify that this is actually a
list so we're gonna go up here to
control if then drag this down here drop
it right there we're gonna say hey is
this an actual list list there we go
zoom out here is a list thing there we
go
and value this is the actual data this
is the tag or this guy right here so
we're gonna go and get the value verify
that it actually is a list then we want
to verify that it is actually our
content we want to make sure the tag is
NTT contacts so come up here you know
if then drag it right there and we want
to compare the text pair text that there
we want to verify that it's equal
duplicate that and then get the actual
tag there we go
and those should match up now if they do
match up then we know that we have our
data so what we want to do is update our
master list of contacts this guy up here
so we want to get this get our set drag
it down here you can see in a second
when i zoom in there we are and then I
want to actually get the value from it I
can just come up here get and store my
list of contacts inside of the master
list and then of course I want to call
for the list picker to be updated so
update list picker and there we go now
we're restoring this information on the
database another thing we want to do
however is send the data to the database
so I'm going to create another procedure
and that's if a new name is created and
let's drop this here and let's just call
this guy send data to dB very first
thing we want to do though is we want to
make sure that our contact list that we
want to send to the database isn't empty
so go into control.if then drag that
drop it right there and let's go and get
our contact list our master list there
it is and get drag that down there and
give ourselves more room and we want to
verify that the list isn't empty but we
want to check not all though we're gonna
have to get the not drop that there and
then let's go into lists and let's get
the empty part is list empty not drag
that up there and here is our master
list now that we verified that our list
isn't empty we can properly send all
that information where you go and get a
store value drop that there and
specifically what we're gonna store is
NTT contacts duplicate that that's gonna
be the tag and the actual data we're
gonna store it's gonna be our contact
list now the only thing we need to do
now is go way up here to the add contact
button area and whenever a new contact
has been added we want to call the
procedure to send the data to the day
and there we go so not only did we
create lists of lists and store name
data like I said that this can actually
be your homework go in there and also
store the city streets state or
territory any other types of information
store that in there and that would be
fabulous homework I'm gonna show you how
to do it though but based off of what I
just showed you you should be able to
figure it out on your own but aside from
that we also covered how to store all
this information on in the database and
in the next part of the tutorial I'm
going to show you how to update your
contact information on a different
screen and of course share all this
wonderful information please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
