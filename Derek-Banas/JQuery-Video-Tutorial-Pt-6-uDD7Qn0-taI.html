6 of my jquery video tutorial today I'm
going to answer a bunch of different
questions but first what I'm going to do
is get into exactly how to download
specific things from the jQuery UI home
page and basically what we're going to
do is we're going to create things like
this accordion that you have right here
I'm going to show you how to animate
images I'm actually going to show you
two different ways of you creating these
accordions based off of your questions
this is the jQuery UI way and I'm going
to show you a couple other different
ways if you want to get the jQuery
widgets like that accordion just go to
jQuery UI calm and then you want to go
through themes you want to find a theme
that you very specifically like so I'm
going to go here to the gallery and I'm
going to say well I like Cupertino so
I'm going to click on Cupertino I want
to make sure that I like it and if I do
I'm going to download it click on
download now normally if I was only
going to be using the accordion and
nothing else I would click on right here
where it says deselect all components
and then I click on accordion which
means it would only get me what I need
for accordion and then I'd click on
download but first I'm going to come up
here and then I want to find Cupertino
click on it and then click on download
and it's going to download the whole
entire folder with all the information
then what I do if I'm going to actually
get the entire library as I come over
here I unzip this guy go into CSS
there's Cupertino and this is actually
what I want to copy this is the CSS code
you don't need the library and all those
other things if you're going to use the
entire library however if you're only
going to use the accordion part and that
library is only going to contain that
code of course you would want to use
that either way here's the CSS code and
then you want to figure out where you
want to drop it here I have a folder
called CSS that makes sense and I could
drop the whole Cupertino folder here but
either way there's your CSS code so
that's all you need to do to get that
custom library and those custom themes
and all that stuff from jQuery UI so now
I'm just going to jump into the actual
coding alright on the right side of your
screen you see h4 tags that's what these
names are and this is comic book
references because somebody named Marcos
keeps asking me questions about how
powerful superheroes are so here's your
answer at least in my opinion I'm not
quite the comic book geek I used to be
so either way here is the title area
here is the jQuery
library itself here's the jQuery UI
library went over this and previous
tutorials didn't see them check them out
here's where we're going to be running
all our jQuery code and you can see
right here these are just this is a div
with the ID superhumans and then we have
h4 tags and paragraph tags that's all I
have here I'm going to show you how very
simply to create an accordion type tool
what we're going to do is we're going to
jump into this style section and this
specifically answers a question sent in
by Kelly she was trying to make an
accordion and wanted the paragraphs to
automatically close whenever you clicked
on an h4 tag I'm going to show you how
to do that here in a second so I'm just
going to make the background color dark
slate grey you know to make the text
white and I'm going to put some padding
and right like that
okay that's all the styling I'm going to
do there then for the div that surrounds
the h4 tags as well as the paragraphs
I'm going to set the background color to
light cyan I'm going to give it a
maximum width of 200 pixels then I'm for
overflow I'm going to mark this as
hidden and that just means if any of the
text overflows to a point of being
bigger than the div that any of that
information that additional text would
be automatically clipped and that's all
I need clipped
I'm just mean it's not going to show up
on a page okay so that is all the
styling that I need and I know there's
better ways to do accordions this is to
answer Kellie specific question what I'm
doing here that doesn't make it any
worse or crappy but that is maybe be why
I'm doing this in a way that's different
than the way you would want me to do it
so here I'm targeting all the paragraphs
inside of the div and the paragraph says
all these words right here and this by
the way might be the longest sentence in
recorded history
and what it's going to do is as soon as
it hits this it's going to automatically
hide all those paragraphs for me so that
the whole entire thing collapses okay
great and now what I'm going to do is
target the h4 tags and I'm going to say
if somebody clicks them I'm going to run
this anonymous function and I'm going to
pay a reference to this and this is just
a reference to whatever got clicked and
this is what Kelly was having a trouble
with I want to target all of the
paragraphs that are visible whenever
anything is clicked that is a sibling so
I'm saying if there is a paragraph that
is currently visible I want it to go
away
so I'm going to call the slide up
animation right like that so that's
going to close all the paragraphs so
that was what you were having trouble
with Kelly and then I'm going to toggle
the height on whatever was clicked which
is going to make it appear on the screen
so I'm just going to change the height
to toggle and I'm going to use this
custom animation and then I close that
off and then I close off my function
altogether so that is all the code that
we need and if I save that you can see
that I created a basic accordion so as I
click on things all of the other
paragraphs are hidden on the screen so
that is how simple it is to create an
accordion now I'm going to show you how
to create an accordion using the jQuery
UI widgets that are available to you so
if I'm going to use that jQuery UI
library I'm going to have to link to it
say that it's CSS code each reference
and I saved it the CSS folder additional
folder called Cupertino and it's called
jQuery - you I - one point 8.10 custom
dot CSS okay so now I linked to that CSS
code that's going to make me a custom
pretty-looking
accordion instead of this god-awful ugly
looking thing and now because I am using
this accordion provided by jQuery UI I
don't need that H for styling there and
I'm going to change my width to 300
leave overflow:hidden and take out
background color alright I got rid of
that and then since I'm going to be
using a nicer thing than what I created
right there I'm going to get rid of that
and this is how easy it is to add
accordion styling to this that's going
to be a lot prettier than what I have
here so I have to pay reference to
superhumans none of the code changed and
to make it an accordion I just type in
accordion now I got to define what the
header is these are h4 tags so header is
h4 tags and then close that off and
that's all I had to do right there
save it and you can see what nicer
looking accordion thing this code right
here this did it right there instead of
typing all that other code in so kind of
neat now I'll show you how to come in
here and create that picture animation I
showed you earlier we're going to have
to come down here and actually place
these pictures in so I'm going to create
a div and I'm going to call it flip pics
into a certain extent I got this code
from somebody long time ago but I can't
remember who from sorry about that
okay so we're going to define a class
here it's going to be the active image
or the image that's going to show on the
screen first and I'm going to come in
here go source I have these images
stored and images folder and I just have
them labeled pick one pick to pick three
and I'm going to be bad and just put
picture in here for the alt text width
is equal to 150 height is equal to 150
close that off and then close off the
div and I'm gonna have three of these
guys so I'm actually just going to copy
this paste paste and what I got to do is
change this to two change its the three
and that's it except I'm going to also
have to come in here get rid of this
class okay so the image I want on top is
going to be called active so I could
come up here and do some CSS coding
alright in a style tag area and again I
know it's bad style to do this in on the
HTML page I'm doing it just so that I
can do these tutorials quickly and
easily okay flip pics is going to be the
div that surrounds everything meaning
all the images and I'm just going to
make its position relative so that it
just goes with the flow on the page I'm
going to find the height as 150 pixels
because every image is 150 pixels width
again is 150 pixels alright so that's
all the styling of the div that's going
to surround all the different images now
I'm going to position all of the divs
that lie inside of flip X let's do that
move inside here position them
absolutely so we want all these images
to lie on top of each other in position
absolutely just means it's going to be
positioned relative to the parent
container which is 150 pixels and then
I'm going to define a z-index to 0 the
higher the z-index the higher it stacks
on the page meaning whatever element on
your page has the highest z-index it's
going to appear the highest on the page
if you forgot some of that I taught you
in the CSS tutorial then I'm going to
find a class Creve which is going to be
the previous image and I'm going to give
it a z-index a 1 just to make sure that
it appears underneath and hidden from
the active image that's going to be on
top all right so that's all of your CSS
code so now you get to come down here
and actually create everything else what
I'm going to do I'm just going to leave
this accordion on the screen I'm going
to call the set interval JavaScript
function what this is going to do is
it's going to call a function called
slide pix every two seconds so I guess a
better career
slide picks which is what I'm going to
do right here I'm a tab the send
function slide picks doink doink create
a variable called current pick which is
going to be the image inside of the flip
picks div that currently has the class
of active wear that was the first one we
defined below and all this codes
available there's a link in the underbar
then I have to worry about the next pick
and I'm just going to define it as the
image that appears next in the container
after current pick and what do we have
to worry about well there's only three
images down there so if I get to the
third one there is no next we're going
to have a problem if I start looking for
an image that doesn't exist so that's
what this is going to do this is going
to Tex if next pic exists and if it
doesn't we're going to start all over
again and I'm going to pay reference
first child element in the flip pics div
those off if current pick remove class
I'm going to take the active class off
of the image that we want to make go
away and give it the class of previous
which is going to shuffle it's going to
give it as lower Z index so it's going
to in essence look like it disappears
and then to the next image we want to
show on the screen going to change the
opacity to zero and we're going to add a
class meaning active which means it's
going to appear above the previous image
that was on the screen and then here I'm
just going to call animate and we're
going to slowly change the opacity to
full in two seconds and then tag on here
additional function that's just going to
remove the previous class from whatever
the current pick on the screen is remove
previous and we have to close that off
and then we have to close off our
function all right save that and you can
see that the images are cycling through
and of course you could put as many
images in there as you would like so
there is a ton of different things to do
with J Quarter if you have any questions
or comments leave them in the comment
section below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
