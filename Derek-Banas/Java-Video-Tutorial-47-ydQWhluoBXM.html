my java video tutorial series today I'm
going to be showing you how to draw
two-dimensional shapes and go over a
whole bunch of other things in regards
to two-dimensional geometry inside of
Java so let's just get into the code I'm
going to start importing my libraries
that I need here job x-wing dot J
component and J component like I talked
about before is the base class for
creating all swing components even
custom ones and we're going to come in
here job X swing and I'm going to be
drawing everything in a J frame so of
course we're gonna need to import the
jframe library Java Ott's gonna allow me
to create interfaces and also allow me
to paint graphics this is going to be
really simple I'm just trying to dumb it
down and all the code from this is
available in a link underneath of the
video and you should get this stuff and
play with it
nots only way you're going to learn it
and this last library here is for
defining two-dimensional shapes inside
of Java alright another thing I'm going
to do here as I told you before that you
can assign serial numbers to multiple
classes for compatibility sake in the
future well I'm going to shut that off
right here
right like that something I've covered
in the past but a big deal and then
we're going to come in here and go
public class lesson 47 and we're just
going to extend jframe so we'll be able
to create a frame here for us to draw on
on the screen public static void defined
main and then inside a main we're just
going to create a new object called Java
lesson 47 right like that and then
public Java lesson 47 to find my
constructor for this object and then I
need to set my size for my frame and I'm
just going to make this 500 don't expect
anything beautiful in this tutorial I'm
just going to go through one method
after another so that you know how to
draw multiple different types of shapes
give my frame a name set default those
operations so that everything is
automatically closed whenever they hit
the close button on the frame on the
screen and I'm going to add a new
components go draw stuff border layout
and it's going to be set in the center
of the frame that comes on the screen
and then we want the frame and
everything to show up on the screen so
we're just going to set that to true
then I have
actually create draw stuff no problem so
I'm going to go private class draw stuff
and since this is going to be a new
component I'm going to base this off of
the J component and then you have to
define function called paint I'm just
going to call this graphics G and
graphics right here is the base class
that's going to allow us to draw on our
components inside of the J frame and
then I'm going to extend graphics that I
can draw two-dimensional shapes and
images with graphics 2d and I'm just
going to crawl this graph too and then I
need to set some preferences in regards
to how this should be rendered
everything should be rendered on the
screen and I'm not going to get into all
the specifics here just going to go
rendering can't basically what i'm doing
here is i'm setting up what's called an
ALS thing which is going to clean up the
edges of whatever I draw on the screen
bounce down to the next line rendering
hints and then of course I can come in
here and come down to value in our
listing on which is going to save me
some time from having to type that in
and there we go now there are tons of
shape interfaces that are available tons
of different shapes that you can use to
draw under the screen I'm going to show
you most of them here again if you want
to see them all there the link
underneath the video is going to show
you okay so let's say I want to draw a
line how exactly do I do that well I'm
going to go new line 2d dot and then
you're going to see a whole bunch of
different things pop up here on the
screen and I'm going to choose to use
this float version as you can see
there's a whole bunch of different
versions here so I'm just going to
double click on that it's going to throw
everything inside of here on the screen
so this is going to really help
basically what I'm going to do is I'm
going to find the upper left hand corner
for X &amp;amp; Y so in this situation I'm going
to put in 20 and then I'm going to put
in 90 I'm going to draw like a really
bad picture on the screen and then I'm
going to come in here and put the ending
points for the line which is going to be
the ending points in the X Y dimension
and there you go so that's going to draw
a line and you can draw any type of line
that you'd like to draw with it and you
can you can draw all kinds of
complicated shapes I'm going to show you
here how to draw an arc or curve or
whatever you want to call it again
you're just going to do the same sort of
thing again new arc 2d and in this
situation I'm going to use double right
here you can see it throws everything in
there makes everything real nice
basically what you're going to do is
define your x and y starting position
and then you're going to
the width and height of the art and then
you're going to define the starting
angle position and then you're going to
define the extent
well the angular extent refers to how
many degrees the arc continues from the
starting angle so let's put an imaginary
point at 45 degrees on your drawing
surface and then let's say that you
would go 180 degrees with your angular
extent that means you're going to draw
180 degree arc or curve starting at the
45 degree point that doesn't quite make
sense
whenever you play around with this it
will and I'm going to show you of course
an example here so I'm going to come in
here and type in 150 and I'm just going
to make my height and width 100 both and
then I'm going to start out as a
45-degree angle and then I'm going to
draw 180 degrees and then at this point
you have to define what type of Arc or
curve you want to draw and you do that
by going arc to D and if you do not want
the ending and starting positions to
come together you would put open if you
do want the straight line drawn from the
starting and ending positions of this
arc in that situation you would put
chord and if you would instead like it
to be a pie shape so that they make like
a piece of pie you would put pie inside
of there I'll show you what all of them
look like so that you know so let's just
copy this guy and paste it in here three
times right like that and then I'm going
to change this slightly so you can
actually see them on the screen change
this to 45 change this to 250 and change
this to 45 and in this situation I'm
going to make this a chord which is just
going to draw a straight line and this
is going to be a pie which is going to
make me a piece of pie that's cool and
then after this if I want to paint an
object basically I can define a color
used for my rendering and I'm just going
to type in graph two so that you can see
what this stuff looks like and then you
can define colors in a couple different
ways I'm going to just start off here if
you don't put anything in here klipsch
is going to show you a whole bunch of
colors that are built in saying there's
a whole bunch of them and I'm just going
to choose black at this point in time
semicolon and then what you do is you go
graph two and you call the draw method
and then you tell it what you want it to
draw so I'm going to say I want to draw
a line which is the name of this
variable that I created right here
this shape right there and if I want to
draw other things I just continue to
call the draw method inside of here so I
can go and define this is 2 &amp;amp; 3 then
just copy this throw that in there and
then just call this 2 &amp;amp; 3 make it easy
and I can actually file save it let's
see what it looks like and here you can
see there's the weird-looking shapes
that I drew there is the arc that is
open there is the arc that's a curve and
there is the arc that's a pie shape so
bunch of scribbling like I said it's not
going to be beautiful the whole point is
to just let you know exactly what
methods are available and make this kind
of draw face here I'm going to let this
be 45 as well and now I'll show you how
to draw an ellipse or circle or anything
like that so just go shape I'm going to
call it draw lips just go new ellipse 2d
and I'm going to go float and then here
you define your upper left-hand corner x
position upper left-hand corner Y
position and your bottom right-hand
corner x position in your bottom
right-hand Y position there you go you
just drew an ellipse now if you'd like
to draw your self a rectangle that has
rounded edges just go shape draw round
erect new and then you're just going to
call a method called round rectangle 2d
and I'm just going to put double in here
and done matter 25:25 and basically
you're going to find your upper
left-hand corner XY position your bottom
right-hand corner XY position and then
you're going to define the arc height
and the arc width for the rounded
rectangle then just close that off you
could draw all kinds of crazy things
inside of here you can draw a curve
that's defined with four points and in
this situation that's known as a cubic
curve 2d and I'm just going to call it
cubic curve and then go new curve 2d and
of course you can call this constructor
and then define or set all the
constraints using an outside method
cubic curve and that method is called
set curve in this situation and then
basically you're going to define all of
the points for this for pointing curves
so we're going to go to find the upper
left hand corner I don't think I have to
keep saying that and then you're gonna
to find your second point and then
you're going to define your third point
and then you're going to define the last
point and then
I was just going to figure out what you
want to do there after that's all point
of that I don't know why but I forgot to
cover regular rectangle before I covered
a rounded rectangle and I'm just going
to go flute throw that inside of there
and you can see here X Y position width
and height so I'm just going to make
this 300 300 and with a width of 150 and
a height of 100 there you go
I can draw rectangles on the screen as
well and also you can draw curves with
three points and just go new this is one
of those tutorials I'm doing out of my
head and I'm just going to go float with
this one then again you're going to
define all of your different points for
the three pointed curve so I'm going to
go 300 100 400 200 150 and 300 and there
you go that's a three-point curve and
I'm also going to draw another rectangle
that's going to be transparent over top
of another rectangle and in this
situation and to find double and of
course this is very simple this is just
going to be 300 375 and 50 there you are
drew another rectangle like I said
that's going to be transparent over top
of another rectangle so let's start
drawing these things out on the screen
copy this up here because we'll be
drawing it out of stuff so draw and the
first I'm going to draw is my lips that
goes I could also change my fill color
like this you want to change your fill
color you call set color and I'm going
to call it color green and then if you
want to draw with a fill instead of just
empty lines you go fill that's it and
I'm going to draw a rectangle if you
want to change your stroke color call
set paint color and then this is going
to be black yeah we can draw some of
these other weird curves inside of here
so cubic curve there that is draw the
rectangle we're going to put inside of
here just change this to draw rect then
draw our quad curve which is going to be
a four pointed curve and then if you
want to draw things transparent you just
go graph two just like before and then
let's look for set composite save
ourselves a ton of time there it is and
I'm going to go alpha and pawza get
instance again this is for drawing
things transparent alpha composite I
start seeing over that and then if you
want to draw something at say sixty
percent transparency you're just going
to come in here
go zero 0.40 right like that and there
you go and let's file save this take a
look at what we did and there you go
right there on the screen there's your
little circle and I was trying to draw
like a little goofy looking face and
then here's all the different curves
that are available I guess I just go in
there and play around with it you'll get
really good at moving these guys around
another thing you could do here is go
graph to and fill and get new rectangle
to d dot floats just call this directly
to save some time and then go graph to
draw a filled shape this is going to be
draw and in this situation I'm going to
use that transparent rectangle that I
just created there and then if I run
this you can see here the transparent
shape shows up here on the screen over
top of our little alien weird looking
thing and then of course if you want to
get rid of the transparent of course you
could just delete it out of there but
probably a better way to do it is to
come inside of here and just set this
value over here to one and there you go
that's going to get rid of the
transparent for you and then we can
execute this and there you can see it's
no longer transparent it's black and the
last thing I'm going to show you how to
do here is how to draw gradients on the
screen for some reason people think this
is complicated but basically what we're
going to do is go gradient paint and
then go the gradient the name I'm going
to give it new gradient paint and then
you're going almost always type in zero
zero in this situation this is going to
be the starting point for your gradient
and then you're going to define what the
starting gradient color is going to be
so I'm just going to make it blue in
this situation and then you're going to
define how long so let's say that I want
this to be a vertical gradient which
means the gradients going to go from the
top to the bottom well I'm going to
leave this at zero for the x position
unless I want this gradient to go at an
angle again you need to play with this
stuff to get used to it and then I'm
going to find how many pixels I want the
blue to go to before it changes color
and I'm going to show you another way
using hex codes to define another
customized color and this code right
here six-six F F F F is actually cyan't
so if you would want to create any kind
of customized hex coded colors this is
exactly how you would do that of course
you have to put a zero inside of there
first and that's how you define a hex
color for using inside here for pretty
much a limitless number of different
gradients and then to use this
customized gradient inside of this
jframe we're just going to go again
graph to set paint and then we're just
going to take the off grid Ian right
here copy and paste that in there right
like that
right like that and now you're going to
be able to draw with gradients and we'll
see what that looks like there you are
there's a gradient now and like I said
coming down from the top and then if you
want to change the way the gradient goes
and of course you can just manipulate
these as much as you want you just
change this to 60 and change that to
zero and there you go now your gradient
is going to go from left to right
instead of the way you saw previously
and then the last thing I'm going to
show you how to do is if you wanted the
color defined right here the last color
defined to show up in the center of the
gradient and then move outwards all
you're going to need to do is go right
after this code football them in there
an input true file say and there you go
you got exactly what you were looking
for the last color that you define is
going to be the center point and
everything's going to gradient off of
that so there's pretty much all the
different 2d tools that are available to
you in the next part of the tutorial I'm
going to show you how to make a
customized paint application leave any
questions and comments below otherwise
