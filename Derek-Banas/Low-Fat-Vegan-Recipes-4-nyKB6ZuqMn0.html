4 of my low-fat vegan recipes today I'm
gonna show you how to make vegan cream
cheese vegan butter sauce peak and sour
cream vegan alfredo and ratatouille so I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
now for the vegan cream cheese I'm gonna
use 1 cup of extra firm more inu 1% fat
silken tofu and I'll be blending this
all up in a food processor so I'm gonna
throw in the tofu then I'm gonna get
myself some lemon juice I'm gonna add
one and a half tablespoons of lemon
juice 1 tablespoon of pure maple syrup
just dump it in there doesn't matter one
and a half teaspoons of liquid aminos or
soy sauce depending upon what you prefer
1/4 of a teaspoon of ground nutmeg and
then to finish off everything 1/2 of a
teaspoon of nutritional yeast dump all
that in there and blend it up and
refrigerate and there you go vegan cream
cheese and now it's time for vegan sour
cream I'm going to use the same exact
tofu as before except this time I'm
going to use 4 ounces of it again in the
food processor one-and-a-half teaspoons
of lemon juice and 1/2 of a teaspoon of
apple cider vinegar and then to finish
it off I'll add 1/4 of a teaspoon of
sugar as well as 1/4 of a teaspoon of
salt and then you just blend it up and
it tastes just like sour cream and this
is what it looks like when it's done and
I'll be making the vegan alfredo sauce I
have West so annoying fat plain soy milk
I'll add 1 cup of that and then I'm
gonna add the cream cheese that we just
made as well as the vegan sour cream we
just made and then to that I'm gonna add
either 1/8 to 1/4 a cup of nutritional
yeast it's gonna depend really on your
taste then add 2 tablespoons of regular
old lemon juice and then I'm gonna get
myself make sure you get white miso
paste I'm gonna add one tablespoon of
white miso paste and then blend it up
and it's done of course cook it that
tastes better now I'm gonna make some
vegan butter sauces is extremely easy
you're gonna get yourself one cup of
water turn the pan on high then add to
it 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and then
you're gonna mix that up make sure that
you get all the cornstarch out of the
bottom there and then add 1 tablespoon
of white miso paste and then get
yourself a whisk and whisk that up until
it's nice and creamy it's amazing how
much this tastes like butter sauce and
now I'm gonna make myself some roasted
ratatouille and you can see everything
here that I
all chopped up I have one eggplant and
it's diced 1 red pepper 1 yellow pepper
1 zucchini 1 yellow squash and 2 onions
and I kind of have them all uniform
because that works best for me then I'm
gonna take all those vegetables and put
them in separate pans and they overlap a
little bit that's no big deal and add
1/8 of a cup of water to each pan I'll
be cooking these vegetables at 450
degrees and 15 minutes and I'm just
gonna give them a quick stir and now
while the vegetables finish up for the
last 15 minutes I'm going to add some
low-sodium diced tomatoes I'm going to
add 3 cans and then I'm gonna get a
tablespoon of minced garlic add that to
the pan and then after a full half-hour
I'm gonna take all those vegetables and
add those in as well give everything a
nice stir and then I got myself some
fresh parsley I'm gonna add 1/2 cup of
that and then I'm gonna get some ground
thyme 1 teaspoon to be specific and then
to finish it off 1/2 of a teaspoon of
black pepper and 1/4 of a teaspoon of
salt and then of course you're gonna
stir all this up till it's very well
combined I then choose to cook it on the
stove top at 20% for about an hour or
you might like it exactly the way it is
right here and I prefer to have it on
top of jasmine rice or pretty much any
other way so hope you guys enjoyed these
recipes and please leave your questions
