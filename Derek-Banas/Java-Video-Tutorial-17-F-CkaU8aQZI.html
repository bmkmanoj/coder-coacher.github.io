my java video tutorial series today
we're going to talk about threads and
the date class now don't let threads
come across as being convoluted and
complicated because they're not whenever
you say that a block of code is a thread
what that means it's notifying the Java
interpreter that not only is it going to
run but other threads or other blocks of
code are going to run at exactly the
same time and execute print things out
the screen or whatever needs to be done
all synchronously and this is going to
be part one of the threads tutorial I'm
going to cover everything about threads
the old way of doing it the new way of
doing it and all those different things
I just think about how your computer is
able to check email download stuff play
videos and all that all at the same time
that's threads this program here what
it's going to do is output the current
time and then at a specific time it's
going to execute other code without
stopping the printing of the time on the
screen so there's some things we need to
import here we're gonna get ourselves
Java utility library and what this is
going to be used for is to get the date
and for locale or locations that are
specific to date and then we're going to
get text to be able to edit or format
dates and then we're going to come in
here and go to public class when I call
this get time 20 and we're going to say
extends thread what this does is this
allows us to use and access all those
different methods that come in the
thread class just extending this guy
just like we've done and all the other
previous guys now all the code that the
thread executes must be inside of the
run method so we're gonna go lick void
run and of course it can also execute
any other methods that is called from
inside of runs need to do that so now
I'm going to create a whole bunch of
fields here date and I'm going to show
you in a second with all these different
things mean locale which is going to
tell the interpreter to do things
specifically based off of where its
country of origin things like that ok
now I'm going to show you what all these
different guys mean first thing we're
going to do inside this threads create a
for statement I is equal to and I'll say
1 and this is going to continue execute
everything inside of here until we reach
24 I and this right here means increment
I by 1 I've gotten that question a bunch
of time so the reason I'm bringing it up
ok now what we're going to do is going
to create
a data object and it's going to contain
all kinds of date and time data and I
called it right now above so I'm going
to go equals new date call the
constructor for that guy make sure you
put the braces in there and we're going
to go current locale is equal to new
recall the locale constructor and I'm
going to put English inside of here and
it's going to get all the information or
organize it in a way specific to the
English region now I could do finish by
putting that fine side of there or
Bangladesh if I want it just by putting
B in inside of there but I'm going to
leave a TN if you want to know what all
the other codes are underneath this
video I have a link to all those
different codes depending upon country
of origin now we're going to use date
format what it's going to allow you to
do is define different dates and times
using predefined styles and so forth and
I'm going to go time for matter which I
defined above date format and in this
situation I just want to get time
information not date information and
here's where I can define what type of
format I want and I'm going to use
default people always ask me what sort
of things can we do after you watch
these videos well instead of putting
default in here try putting in short
medium long or full and see how the
dates and times and all those different
things change and then we're going to
put current locale which is going to
give me country specific information you
know just like that then basically what
I'm going to do is I'm going to get not
just the time but I'm also going to get
the date information that is going to be
specific for the current time if I want
to do that I'm going to change this to
date I'm going to change this instead of
get time I'm going to say get date and I
can leave everything else the same so
this first one's going to get me time
and the second one's going to get any
date and then if I want to output these
to screen I'm going to need to call to
time formatter and then I need to say
format what format right now which is
going to be a specific date and just go
there and gin change this to date and
then change this to date and that's all
that's doing is just converting them
into strings so they can easily be
printed out to screen system I don't
line and I'm going to output time output
which you're going to see what that is
here in second go in there and change
that to a period Haeju into a semicolon
yeah I'm going to copy that paste paste
I'm going to throw this guy in here just
for a new line and then this guy I'm
going to change it to date and then if
where we exit out of our for loop a
couple other things we need to do you
must wrap any type use of the sleep
method which is part of the thread class
inside of a try block so that we can
handle any errors they're going to get
thrown and to tell your code to sleep
this is milliseconds for two seconds
let's say you just put two thousand
inside of there then it's going to say
okay well we're going to go and get all
this information here we're going to
basically sit here and sleep for two
seconds and then you need to put the
catch down here and we're going to catch
interrupted exception which is thrown
every single time we call sleep and we
don't really need to do anything so
let's just put that there and everything
else is perfectly fine all this codes is
available underneath the video and
before we leave just notice need to put
time output here and then file save it
let's jump over into lesson 17 Java and
we're going to start playing around with
this threat okay first thing we're going
to need to do is create a new thread
that executes all the code that we
define in that previous class called get
time 20 and I'm going to call it get
time and you know equals new call the
constructor and then if I want to
execute all of the code that exists back
in that class inside of the run method
it's real easy I just go get time do I
start call this start method if I'll
save it execute and you can see over
here on the left side of the screen that
it's printing out both the time and the
date right like that and it's going to
continue to do that every two seconds
for twenty iterations that's going to
run forever even if I go and create
other additional code that I want to
execute which is exactly what I'm going
to do I'm going to jump over into get
mail now what this is going to do is
it's going to be printing out this date
and time information however every 10
seconds it's going to check to see if
there is any additional mail or whatever
it's actually just going to print a
message out to screen but you get the
point now let's look back here for a
second to get time 20 you can see here
that I'm extending the thread class well
that's not always the best thing to do
because remember you can only extend one
class so get time 20 is a subclass of
thread but you can only ever extend one
class well that's where the runnable
interface comes in because remember we
can use a ton of different interfaces
and pretty much get the same sort of
thing done so let's go public class and
this guy is going to be called get the
mail because that's the name of the
and then remember if we want to use an
interface we use implements runnable
right like that and now let's create all
the code that we need here first thing
we're going to do is create a private
int and it's going to be start time
right like that it's just going to
figure out how long before we go and
start having the execute code so create
a constructor here and it's going to be
past start time which is again how long
does it take for we execute I'm going to
set for the specific object start time
is equal to start time that is being
passed into it so there's a constructor
and that's all nice come in here and
change that to get the male it's not a
constructor unless it has the same name
as the class of course and just like
before all the code that's going to
execute is going to execute inside of
the run method so we're going to create
that and what are we going to do we're
going to pretty much do the same thing
when it create a try block and then
we're gonna go thread sleep and I'm
gonna say whatever start time they
passed times a thousand so for instance
if they passed over a value for start
time of 10 it's going to sleep for 10
seconds before it proceeds on and does
anything so that's all thread sleep does
and then let's save ourselves some time
by jumping over here going to this catch
block copy that jump back over here
paste that in there so that's nice and
then we're gonna do with this guys we
know system.out.print line and we're
just gonna say checking mail even though
it technically isn't gonna do that and
we'll file save that all right so we
created two different threads and
they're both going to run at exactly the
same time without causing any different
problems well now we got to come over
here and allow them to execute so I'm
going to come in here right after I
created our first thread that prints out
the times and so forth and I'm gonna
call runnable get mail is going to be
the name of this thread and I'm going to
say new get the mail call that
constructor and I'm going to say after
10 seconds I want everything over there
to execute and let's just do this again
let's go runnable it mail again
and this guy is going to go get the mail
and instead of waiting 10 seconds it's
going to wait 20 seconds and this down
here is going to execute all the code
that's going to print out the time and
then if you want to print out the thread
for the with the runnable interface you
have to go new thread get mail I like
that
and calls starter so that's just a
couple little differences here you have
to you know put in there and then if we
want to run that other thread so now
we're going to be running three threads
at once I'm going to type in get mail
again
and these are all our different threads
so if get time which is going to print
these times over and over again we have
get mail which is going to wait ten
seconds and then it's going to print out
check the mail on screen and then this
guy right here is going to wait twenty
seconds and then do that execute you can
see it's printing out to the time and
the date and the time and then date and
then right here it's going to say check
the mail yep check and mail and then
after another additional ten seconds
it's going to check for the mail again
so that's how you write threads and
allow things to execute all with exactly
the same time inside of Java in the next
tutorial to show you more advanced more
newer techniques you're using threads
inside of Java leave any questions or
comments below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
