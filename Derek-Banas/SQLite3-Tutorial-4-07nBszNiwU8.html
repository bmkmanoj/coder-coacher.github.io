of my SQL Lite video tutorial today I'm
going to talk about joins triggers I'm
going to give you a brand new real world
example I'm going to provide a review
for everything we've covered in all the
previous parts and on top of that I
structured this so I'll be able to
answer all of the questions that I've
been getting lately on SQL Lite so I
have a massive amount to do so let's get
into it one thing that seems to really
be confusing people about SQL Lite is
how it handles data types because it is
kind of strange there's basically four
types of data there's text there's blobs
integers and reals
text very easy to understand it's just
string of characters a blob is data that
is stored exactly as it is entered and
I'm going to show you here in a second
exactly how they work integers of course
are numbers without decimals and reals
are numbers with decimals if you would
want to store a boolean inside of SQLite
it's actually going to be stored as an
integer and dates and times can actually
be stored as text real or integer
formats and you can see here an example
of what those dates and times would look
like if they were stored as text and
this is the most common way to store
dates and times and then you have the
extremely odd way of storing dates and
times if you store them as a real data
type and then you have still a little
bit weird but not quite so weird way of
storing dates and times if you store
them as integers now we get to the part
that confuses people a little bit when
you were creating your tables inside of
SQLite you can actually enter the data
type as any of these different data
types you just have to understand that
they ultimately are going to be
converted into text blob integer numeric
which is technically kind of an integer
or a real datatype so it's convenient to
use these datatypes whenever you're
entering in your tables just understand
that for example if you would put in a
length restriction for your text that
you're going to be entering into SQLite
those length restrictions are going to
be completely ignored but it is nice
that you can use them just so you don't
have to change the way that you create
your tables blobs are created whenever a
data type is considered a blob or
defined as a blob or if no data type is
specified at all and then here's all the
different types of integers and then you
have numerix which are technically
integers and if you would create a
decimal data type such as this or a
boolean or a day
or daytime of course date and date times
fit in to numerix this is ultimately
what all these different types are going
to be transferred into inside of SQL
light so enough with the presentation
format let's look at some diagrams now
in this tutorial when to give you
another example it was very very easy to
use so I'm going to use the standard way
of teaching SQL by creating a student
database so you can see right here I
define student and you can also see
right here where we have sex and I have
defined one character remember this is
going to be ignored but we have it in
there just for the heck of it well as
you saw previously there are no
enumerator types inside of SQL Lite so
we're going to actually have to create
an outside table which is fine and
whenever we do that our sex ID which is
normally a number our primary key is
actually going to be text which is going
to stand for either male or female and
then aside from name each student is
going to have an ID number and
everything else is going to be built
inside of other tables in our database
and we come down into the test part and
the test is going to be very simple it's
going to have a date it's going to have
a test type which is actually going to
be either a quiz or a test and you can
see that I define those over here much
as I define sex above and then each one
of the tests is going to have a test ID
then if we come down here to test score
you're going to say that our primary key
for test ID up here is going to be
defined inside of the test score table
and then also student ID which is going
to come up here from our student table
is also going to be defined down in
there and then ultimately we're going to
have our score and the only other thing
we're going to have inside of here is
absence and it's going to have student
ID and date and it's also going to link
up to the student table and later on I'm
actually going to create a log table
that is going to store in absences and
when retests were taken but I'll leave
that for later on in this tutorial so
now that I've covered that let's go
create our database okay so here I am in
the terminal and I'm going to go in here
and actually create a new student
database pretty simple and then I'm
going to just start creating my tables
so like you saw before we're going to
create a table and it is going to be
called sex type which is going to be
male or female and we're going to have
sex ID text remember this is going to
stand in for an enumeration type
Mary Kay not null and then we're going
to have sex type integer and close that
off so there is how we're going to
create our sex type table so while we're
here we might as well go in here and
actually insert all the different things
the only things we're going to ever put
inside of here so we're just going to go
sex type sex ID sex type and then values
and then after that we're going to put
in male 1 just like that enter and then
I'm going to cheat and come in here and
go female 2 and there we go and that is
the only thing we'll ever put in our sex
type table so now let's create our
student so I'm going to go create table
student and everything I'm typing here
is going to be saved and there's going
to be linked to it in the description
for the video so you can look at it if
you really want to learn this stuff you
should do that and here I'm going to
show you that we can use these different
datatypes they're just going to be
ignored not and all just remember that
variable character here is going to be
treated as text and the 23 is going to
be ignored inside of SQL Lite then we're
going to go sex and then this is going
to be a character and we can put in 1
there if we want to null and this is
actually going to come from this guy up
here that's where that's from and then
we're going to put ID number and it's
going to be an integer and it's going to
be a primary key that is going to stand
for every student that is ever created
you have to be really careful whenever
you're putting these commas in here
because for some reason on occasion
you'll miss putting a comments out here
when you're creating a table and SQLite
will not catch it so that's really funky
and weird and then I'm going to create a
foreign key reference to sex because we
have to do that so we're going to say
sex which is this guy in this table and
then we're going to say references and
we're going to reference the table and
the specific ID inside of it that we
want to link and a foreign key is just a
link to another key and another table
that's all it is it just helps us
reference data so let's clear that
scroll back and let's create another
enumeration type that's going to
represent the types of different tests
that we're going to have either quizzes
or tests so we're going to go create
table test site and we're going to go
test ID primary key not null just like
before and then we're going to have test
type and it's going to be an integer
there we go that's defined and then just
like we did before we're going to go
insert into test type test ID and test
alright and the values we're going to
put inside of their course Q for quiz
and then bounce this up here and T for
test two and there we are there we have
all this graded and let's go if we want
to look at our tables there you can see
all of our different tables and I'm
going to change my mode here to columns
now that I'm thinking about that and I'm
also going to turn my headers to on and
then I could do like a real quick check
to see that everything is working there
just type and there you can see they are
working all right good clear let's crawl
back again now we're going to create an
or another table and this is going to be
the test table
I'm going to go date and I can define
this as a date type remember there is no
such thing then we're going to say type
of test and it's going to be text not
null test id integer primary key auto
increment so we don't have to put
anything in there and then we're going
to define a reference a foreign key
reference to and we're going to say type
test inside of here is either going to
be Q or T and we're gonna do that just
like we did before by pointing a
reference test ID boom whoops
messed up and the reason why that got
screwy is because I didn't come in here
and type in test so sorry about that and
then we're going to have our date then
we're going to have our type of test
then we'd have test ID and then finally
foreign key like that like that and like
that boom done tables now we're going to
come in here I'm going to clear this
scroll back again and create another
table and this one is going to have a
bunch of foreign keys inside of it this
is going to be a test score it's going
to have a student ID integer not null
it's going to have a test ID again
integer not null as you can see I'm not
using the fancy datatypes anymore
because it's really no point in doing it
integer not null and then define
ourselves some foreign keys so we're
going to say that test ID is going to be
referencing the table test and then test
ID specifically inside of the table test
foreign key and then this one's going to
be student ID references the student
table an ID number inside of the student
table and then after that if we would
like to do a composite primary key which
is going to combine two different pieces
of data inside of our table and use that
as a primary key you can't do that you
just go primary key I'm going to say I
want to use test ID and student ID to
create that composite primary key and
there we go we have that created and
then finally we have to create our
absence table inside of here and it's
just going to have student ID integer
not null it's going to have a date for
the date of the absence not null
it's going to have a primary key again
which is going to be made up from a
composite using both the student ID and
the date and then it's also going to
have a foreign key that is going to
reference the student ID which is going
to reference this student table and
specifically ID number inside of it and
there we go so there are all of our
tables that we're going to use for our
database now I need to insert values
into the student database so we can get
this thing going and if I want to look
at this real quick let's just go sima
and student and there you can see our
table that we used for our student
database and then if I want to insert
values into all these I'm just going to
do it this way we're just going to go
insert into student and of course you
just have to define name and sex and the
ID number is going to auto increment for
us we don't need to worry about that and
then we're just going to put in those
specific values so sally is going to go
into name and f is going to go into sex
and it mark is going to go into name and
mail is going to go into sex if we hit
that all those are in there and then we
can just come in here real quick select
everything from student boom and there's
all of our information all sat in there
so that's cool all right so now that we
have that all set up I'm going to go in
and insert values into my test area and
this time I'm just going to do it
because it's not going to be in the call
we'll get it so I'm going to say insert
into not that that was complicated but
there's a lot of typing and we're gonna
say values now if you want to put a date
inside of this pretty simple you're just
gonna say date just like we covered last
time now and that is going to be that
I'm going to show you in a second how to
enter a date whenever it isn't now and
this is going to be our quiz data type
and then we're going to say one and this
is going to be for the primary key now
if it was set up for Auto increment you
could just put null inside of there but
whatever that works as well and there we
go we have that all set up and here is
the design for the test table there you
can see there is date and there is date
and there is Q for test type and then we
have test ID which is right there and
that's the primary key like I said I
could have put Nall inside of there
instance this is autumn increment it
would added it but whatever save some
time okay
then what we're going to do I'm clear to
scroll back again is I'm going to be
working with a couple different data
types here all at the same time I'm
going to start off first here with test
score so let's go skiing a test score
there we go there's everything now for
all of these different students I'm
going to say insert into test score and
I can put in here values I don't have to
put in where they're supposed to go if I
put everything in and I'm going to say
one which is going to represent my
student ID and then I'm going to put one
in here again for the test ID because we
only have one test and then I'm going to
put in the score for that set student
and there we go
and there we are do exactly the same
thing for another student and then we
get in this situation where we have an
absence well with an absence I'm going
to say that we're going to say insert
into test score values and with this guy
let's say it's the third student or the
student with the ID 3 this is still test
1 and then inside here I'm gonna put
negative 1 and that's going to be able
to allow me to find it later on whenever
the student comes in and we have to do a
retest and other than that we're just
going to enter in all the rest of them
and hit enter just like before now we
come to a situation where we have to
fill in and actually document that that
one student was absent so we're going to
say well let's go in here again
EEMA an absence and there is my data and
then if I want to enter in my
information for the absence I'm gonna
say values and I'm gonna say three and
let's say that the student was absent
today so you know how to do that just
gonna go now just like that there's
nothing else that we need to do except
spell values right and there we go now
we have that absence set now if we want
to come in here and create ourself a
brand new test I'm actually going to
cycle back through this so where did we
get to the part where we actually
created the test and there that is and
you can see right here exactly how to
enter a date if you want to enter it in
in a very specific way rather than just
having it get the current date and
putting that information in there and
here we're going to create the test type
test and it's also going to have an
identification number of two again to
save ourselves some time I'm just going
to have all those insert statements go
in there for the test data type and all
the students and you can see right here
are the students that were absent and
with the negative ones right here for
the test and there we go that's all
fixed here once again we're going to
come in and we're going to enter in all
of our absences and there we go and now
since we have all of that information in
there let's start issuing some select
queries so we can actually pull some
information out of our database so
something that might be useful for us to
do is to be able to show test results
for students that took a certain quiz on
a certain date so we're actually going
to use two tables in this situation
we're going to be using the test table
and we are also going to be using the
test score table and there you can see
all that information so from this we're
going to grab a student ID we're going
to grab a score we're going to grab the
type of test and then finally we're
going to grab the date so how do we grab
all this information from multiple
different tables well we're going to use
something called a join so we're gonna
say select just like always exactly what
we're going to get and we don't have to
define table names before these guys
because there is only one student ID a
whenever you combine both of these
tables and we're gonna say score they
want to say type of test and then we're
gonna say dates so that's all the
information we want then we're going to
say from and we're gonna define both
of the tables we want to join together
and then we're going to define some
limits here so we're going to say that
we want the date for the quizzes that
are going to show up to be from 2013 oh
six - oh nine and we want to also say
that we want the test ID in the one
table and this is how you reference a
specific column inside of a specific
table just like that is equal to test
score dot test underscore ID and there
you can see all of that information we
can also see our absence that is right
there that's very useful and you can
also see exactly what happens if you
don't come in here and make sure that we
match up these two tables using test IDs
that are both in each of them you get
this long table nothing's joined
together and it is quite a mess because
it doesn't know how to properly group
this information we'll get more into
that here in a second now what we're
going to do is do another Select and in
this one what we're going to do is print
out the students names with the scores
just like before we're also going to
print out the type of test and date but
because we want the name and not the
student ID that means we're going to
have to bring in the student table to
grab that information and then what
you're going to need to do to avoid
having a mess you're going to just like
before we're going to have to match
student IDs for tables in both test
score and inside of the student table
and just like before this is going to
allow us to show the test score that
corresponds with each individual student
and not just dump out everything in a
mess and we're just going to say name
score type of test and date that's what
we want and then if we want it from
three tables it doesn't matter
put as many in there as you want then
we're going to say student to find a
condition in which our date is going to
be 2013 - oh six - oh nine and then here
we're going to say and the test test
underscore ID is going to be equal to
the
test score dot test ID and we're also
going to define the test score dot
student ID and join those two tables
based off of this common piece of data
that they both have which is a
identification number for each student
and there you can see there is all of
our information that we need so that's
how you can bind three different tables
and how you join them up using these
conditions in which we're matching up
test and test score by showing that they
both have the same test ID and we're
matching up test score and student by
showing that they both have the same
student identification so now we get
into a little bit crazier stuff here
let's say we would like to list all of
our students along with the total number
of absences that they have accrued well
to do that we're going to say select
name and then just remind you if you
want to use a different description for
the column name you just use the word as
and then we're going to count all of our
absences date and then we're going to
say as again as absences we're going to
pull all this information from both the
student table and the absence table and
we're going to define that we want
absence student ID to equal student ID
number now because this is an aggregate
query what we're going to have to do is
define exactly how we want to group our
data and how we specifically want it to
be displayed on a screen and what makes
sense to me is because we're trying to
get at number of absences based off of
students we're going to group that data
based off of student IDs so just make
sense and then in essence what we're
doing here is calculating the number of
absences for each identification number
and how you group them it's just growing
group by and I'm just gonna say ID
number hit enter and there we go there
is our whole entire list of absences
well it's early in the school year so
each one of them only has one but let's
say that we'd want to come in here and
say list every single student name and
even if they had zero absences we want
to list the fact that they had zero
absences just so we can track all of our
students at once well I'm going to use
different types of joins here just to
show you a bunch of different types of
to describe exactly how you do that now
above what we've been using with the
column is is what is called an inner
join and there's another way to define
an inner join here and we'll show you
that in a second now in fact the inner
joint is the most common join that you
are going to say and specifically what
they do or what the inner join does is
it returns only those records that match
within our table or the two tables that
you were going to join and you can also
come in here and say for example name
score test ID from two score and then
type in join instead of a comma you so
wish and students but then you're going
to come in here and say on student ID
equal to ID number right like that and
there you can see is all that
information regards to names and test
scores and so forth and so on so that is
how you would do an inner join in a
different way now we get back to exactly
how we would show the number of absences
even in the situation which a student
doesn't have an absence of any type and
to do that what we're going to do is use
what is called a left joint now how a
left join differs from a regular inner
join is a left join says that we need a
row for each piece of data that is
listed on the left side of the joint or
the table that is on the left side of
the two words left joint so here we're
going to say select name as name just
like we did before and then we're also
going to say count absence date then
we're going to say as absences just do
it then we're going to define where we
want to get our information from so
we're gonna say from student that is
going to make sure that we get all of
the student information to display since
it's on the left side we're going to say
left join and that information is going
to show up whether those students have a
absence or they don't have an absence
then I'm going to say on absence
thoughts student ID is equal to the
student dot ID number and it doesn't
matter in which order you put these this
absence student ID equals student ID
number doesn't matter and then we're
going to say just like we did before
group by ID number
and I slipped up just like before make
sure we put our calm is inside of there
very important on and group by and there
you can see all of the student names are
now listed whether they had an absence
or not that's pretty cool that's one way
to use left joint then you have natural
joins which are kind of similar to a
left joint except what it's going to do
is return all columns that match in both
tables and let's just do something here
normally you can get by just by using
regular old joins and left joins but
I'll show you what this is score and you
should go in here and play around with
this information inside of a database to
really learn and figure out exactly how
this stuff works and we're going to say
from student and then we're going to say
natural join with test score then we're
gonna say where student ID is equal to
ID number blah blah blah blah blah and
you can see there is a whole bunch of
information in regards to tests on all
of the different test types
so there's test one there's test two and
all the different tests so that's an
example of a natural inner join like I
said go play with this information I
don't want to cover it to death and then
you have something you're never even
going to probably ever use what's called
a cross inner join or a Cartesian join
what this does is it combines all the
records from two two different tables
and it can make quite a mess so let's
say you want to go test ID from student
you're gonna say cross join just so you
know what this looks like score like
that and there you can see it prints out
quite a mess and it's what it's doing is
it's printing out test scores for every
single test and it's combining too much
information like I said it's something
you're not going to probably ever use
and it's probably something you should
avoid then finally I know that I talked
on different functions that are
available in SQLite but I don't think I
really gave some great real-world
examples so what I'm going to do here is
I'm going to show you exactly how to
find the best and worst scores on all
the quizzes and all the tests and this
is a comment sure I covered this before
I'm going to just bring it come in here
briefly and show you the table and the
table data that is inside of it so
inside of test score we have student ID
and we have test ID and we also have
score and we're going to be using that
and we're also going to be using the
test table and it's going
to have a date inside of it it's also
going to have a type of test inside of
it and it's also going to have a test ID
inside of it and then finally we're
going to have the student table and it
is going to give us our name it's going
to give us our sex and it's going to
give us an ID number so those are going
to be all the tables that we're going to
use to create a list of the best and
worst on all of the different quizzes
and tests that have been taken so what
we're going to do is we're going to say
select and we're going to say to test
date and let's just go and cover a whole
bunch of things here let's say that we
want to change the column name for date
make sure you put that column in there
don't be silly like me then if we want
the minimum test score what we're gonna
do is say test score inside of men and
we're going to say score and we type in
as worst put that column in there and
then we're going to go in and say max
and we're going to say that we want the
maximum test score and we're going to
find that as best and then we're going
to say that we want all this information
from the test score and the test table
and we're going to specifically say
we're test score dot test underscore ID
is equal to test table dot test
underscore ID and then we're going to
say on top of that we want a group by
date and there you can see actually it's
going to come up negative 1 as worst
that's to stand for absences and so
forth but if you had this set up and
everybody in the class had taken the
test of course it's going to show the
lowest grade there and here it's going
to show the best grade and all of that
information is going to be sorted based
off the fact that we defined to group
everything based off of the test date
now if we wanted to come in here again
and say print the average score on each
of the tests how you would do that is go
select we're going to say test date as
date and we can say average and inside
of this we're going to say that we want
to get the average test score and we are
going to call this average score
remember if it's going to be two words
you need to put commas around it and
then we want to say from test score and
the test table and then we go to define
that we want to make sure that the test
score test ID is going to match with our
test test ID and we want to once again
group all of these guys by test date and
if we do that you can see the average
score on each of the tests and then if
we wouldn't want to come in here I'm
going to clear the scroll back and list
all the students that had a test score
over 40 for example to bring in the
students into this equation because
they're important we're going to say
name and we're going to say test score
and since there's more than one score
inside of these tables we're going to do
that let me say from test score and from
the student table and here we're going
to define that we want results for test
scores that are greater than 40 and test
score dot student ID equal to student
dot ID number and then on top of that we
want to make sure that we group by name
and there we go you can see all of the
different students that scored over 40
on a test so another thing we can do is
we could actually put select clauses or
select statements inside of select
statements so let's say we just wanted
to get the number of students that
scored over 40 the number the count well
we could actually come in here and go
select count and go name and let's just
say we want to type in as and then
scored over 40 and we're going to say
from the student table and we're going
to say where we're actually going to use
the exact select clause that we use
previously remember it just printed out
names and their score which was quite
useful what we can do is we can then say
how many student names are in your
previous select clause that you used so
here we're going to say like this and
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to actually paste in the Select Clause
this is what we just used to print out
the names and the test scores except I'm
going to put them inside of there and
it's going to match up and count all the
matching names in the student table that
are also in this list of students that
had a score over 40 and there you can
see it just says 5 say pretty cool
that's one another way to grab in for me
and use it pretty cool and then another
thing we have inside here I'm covering
everything in this tutorial I don't know
many people are actually watching at
this point I'm going to show you how to
make a view and what a view is is it's a
way to store query results but it isn't
going to be part of the scheme and it's
not going to be a table it's but it's
it's just going to be a quick way to
store a query that you're planning on
issuing over and over and over again so
let's say that we think that we're going
to want to use the query for gathering
the number of scores over 40 all the
time
well how you create a view as you go
create view and you go score you can
give it any name you want obviously over
40 and then you're going to say as and
then you're going to put in your query
that you want to store inside of here
this is very useful so we're going to
say test score put the score inside of
there
from the test score table and the
student table where test score
dot score is greater than 40 and test
score dot student ID is equal to student
dot ID number and then we're going to
say group by name whoops
take that inter all no big deal I mean
your real quick type in student again
group by and there you go it's created
and actually it will show up if you go
to tables save score over 40 shows up
right there and then what you're going
to be able to do is actually go in there
and execute that anytime you want and
you could for example use it in place of
the code itself so that's pretty cool
now we get into triggers now again I'm
just going to give you a brief overview
of exactly what a trigger is and if you
would want to drop that view for example
we can just go drop you schooler over 40
like that and it's not going to be there
anymore just in case you want to know
how to do that say it's gone so now
let's get into triggers now what
triggers are are their operations
they're going to automatically be
performed whenever a specific event
occurs that you define so we're going to
actually use a couple different tables
so we're going to use the test table and
we're going to be grabbing information
from date type of tests and the test ID
also going to be using test score and
we're specifically going to want the
student ID the test ID
and the score and we're also going to be
using the student and we got name and we
have sex and we have ID number inside of
there and I do that all the time
whenever I'm using us okay now what
we're going to do is create a table that
is going to be used as a log and I'm
actually going to call it log and what
it's going to do is it's going to log
all of the students that are going to
need to be go in and create or make or
take a makeup test so I'm going to put
inside of here id integer and this is
going to be a primary key and the test
ID the important if we're doing makeup
test we want to know what that is we'd
like to put a date inside of here the
student ID would also be very helpful
and it's going to be an integer and it's
going to be not null as well and then
we're going to reference foreign keys
for K test ID that school or test ID and
then we'll come in here and create
another foreign K and this one is going
to be the student ID and it is going to
go into test score also match student ID
like that close that off and there is
our log table now what we're going to do
is create our trigger so I do that is
just go create trigger then you know say
test I'm going to give it the name test
score update and what it's going to do
is it's going to say any time the score
table is updated what I wanted to do is
go into the log table and confirm when
the make up test was taken so create
trigger the name of the trigger they're
going to say after the update is
finished this is very important of the
table score and specifically on test
score anytime a test score is changed
this would also keep students from
cheating if they got ahold of the table
and they didn't know about the log
because they'd go in there and change
the test score and it would go into the
log table kind of cool so anytime inside
of the table score test score
specifically is changed we want to this
trigger to occur and what's going to
occur then is we're going to say insert
into our log table test ID and date and
student ID you're grabbing information
just like always values and then you can
either put in old dot and the
information you want to put in or a new
dot the information you want to put in
I'm going to say new you're not going to
reference tables you're going to
reference either old or new okay that
confuses people as well I'm going to say
new test ID and date which is going to
be now which is when the retest is being
taken then I'm going to say new I also
want the student ID you've put any type
of query inside here you want just make
sure you don't reference tables here you
reference new or old those are the only
options then after you got that all set
up you're going to go end there that is
clear the scroll back now let's say we
want to come in here and get everything
from absences there we are and then we
want to specifically update test score
inside of here and we want to set the
score equal to 20 and we want to say
we're test ID is equal to 2 and student
ID is equal to 9 which means we were
going to be changing this guy right here
enter and then if we come in here and
change like that you're going to see
that that was updated in the log so
there was an absolute ton of information
on SQL Lite up next I'm going to be
showing you how to use SQL Lite inside
of Android if anybody found around to
watch this extremely long tutorial I'd
love you leave a comment below to tell
me you did that and please leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
