presentation on how do i get twitter
followers or better yet how to get
twitter followers if you don't have
anything interesting to tweet this is
the most common question that i get i
get it every single day and in this
presentation i'm going to show you
exactly how i put on right around 10,000
twitter followers in two months using a
hundred percent free tools you don't
have to pay for anything first thing
just want to let everybody this is just
my opinion on things but there is no
point in my opinion to aggregate
news-post the best tweets post the best
videos etc there are countless numbers
of people doing it there's never any
supply of competition and there's no
point in doing it in my opinion also
don't try to be funny you're competing
against professional comedians for the
most part and chances are you're not as
funny as them so if your goal is to get
Twitter followers all you need to do is
find people on Twitter who want help
getting followers and help them achieve
that goal some really really simple
things here you want to make sure that
your bio tells people that if they
follow you you will promote them and you
will definitely follow them back you
want your twitter pic to be interesting
and non offensive also you want your bio
to be non offensive i personally tweet
out anyone that mentions me every single
time i follow every single fall or i
reach out and try to find people that
follow more people or have more friends
than they have followers and i do my
best to follow people when they are
currently online and currently on
twitter so now i'm going to show you all
the tools that i use all right it's time
to walk you through every single thing i
use I use yp.com to find a whole bunch
of people that are currently online have
more friends than they have followers
and it's a really simple process for the
most part I do all of this in a very
short period of time so you want to go
on tweet be calm and then you want to go
to follow tweeps and then users
followers and click on that and this is
going to pop up a little box and what
you do is you want to type in someone
who has a ton of followers well I
personally like to follow twitter hero
for the most part this is the guy that I
normally do this with so I'm just going
to type inside of there and it's going
to allow me to cycle through a bunch of
Twitter arrows
followers so I'm going to go into last
tweet because remember I want to follow
people that are currently online and you
can see right here one minute ago this
person tweeted they have more friends
that means they're following more people
than are following them so I definitely
want to follow this person so I click in
there and you can see over here what I'm
currently doing with that person and you
can also see here if I am following that
person in there following me back that's
what mutual means and again you can just
do the same thing now I want to make
sure that this person has at least a
hundred friends 200 would be even better
yet and I'm just going to follow these
people just like that this is all I'm
going to do and of course I do this in
the matter of a couple seconds there you
go 12 minutes ago 797 you know I don't
know you can either choose to follow
people whether they're using offensive
language or not it's the minor percent
up to you but if you just simply want
followers that's one way to do it using
twee p and again this is honored percent
free and of course at the end of that
you would just hit follow and you'd
follow all those people if you want to
see a list of people that have a
bazillion followers all you need to do
is go to Twitter holocomm and you can
just come in here real simply you can
see all of the top people that have a
bazillion followers there's lady gaga
justin bieber katy perry blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah so if your goal is
to find a whole gigantic list of people
that you could potentially follow that
are currently online that have more
friends than followers Twitter holic is
the place to go so let's move on a lot
of other people like this use a tool
called re follow calm I'm pointing this
out only because it's used a lot I
personally don't like it the reason why
someone would use this is to find out
people that are retweeting all the
things that they are putting on Twitter
which is awesome anybody that retweets
you you definitely want to try to
promote them more and more and more I
prefer however topsy.com I think this is
a much better tool and I just simply go
in here and I type in new think tank
right like that and do a search and it's
going to pop up all the different people
that are currently promoting or
mentioning my name which is really great
and I could also come in here over here
to see the people that just recently
tweeted me and I can click on past hour
and there they pop up and then I would
just simply commanding over here into
twitter and i like to use something real
short f4f which is just follow for fall
that's all that I type in and then I'm
just going to come over to these guys
and I'm going to make sure that i copied
them come in here I just right click on
a copy jump over here again paste that
in click again copy bounce back over
here paste all these people inside here
I want to promote them as much as
possible because they are promoting me
which you know and I see that as being
the number one mistake people are making
on twitter is they just go in and they
immediately try to find people to follow
and if that person doesn't immediately
follow them back they jump out now this
person promoted me which is great and
i'm currently not following on their
following 873 people they have 855
followers so i'm gonna follow that
person which is awesome this pops up so
i just say yeah go ahead connect so
there you go just accidentally by coming
in here to this tool i found somebody
else that I want to follow up so that's
cool and again just paste that in there
now if you do this chances are these
people are going to go and retweet you
and promote you and do all kinds of
other great things so that's awesome so
that's one way to do that you can also
use another tool and it's called favstar
dot FM and this is going to show you
your most popular tweets so we're just
going to pop in and also can show you
popular tweets overall so I'm going to
come in here and type in my username
again do you think tank there you go and
you can see here are a whole bunch of
people that retweeted me and you're
going to see the same names over and
over and over again because you want to
get as many retweets as humanly possible
so let's just come in here just to save
yourself some time paste those people
inside of there and then I'm just going
to copy those as well paste those inside
of there and then tweet so there you go
I paid people back for retweeting me so
that's favstar dot FM and it's just
going to give you a list of your most
popular tweets that you have sent out
there and I send out tons and tons of
like interesting links all the time
guess what nobody retweets them nobody
cares so you can do that another thing
you can do is inside of Twitter you can
just type in your name so I'm going to
type in anything tank up here and then
you're going to click on all and this is
also going to show you a whole bunch of
people that are currently talking about
you so that's another way you can come
into these guys and then just copy these
people right like that and then paste
them into another tweet out to support
them another thing as you can see right
here I have what's
clout now this is going to give me an
example of how much power this person
has in regards to promoting people
online and you can see all these
different clout ratings and that's
something that you could definitely use
as an example of people that you should
talk about and people that you should
tweet and promote because the more you
promote them the more they're going to
promote you and that's it and it this
looks like it takes a lot of time but it
doesn't take that much time at all
another thing that I like to do is to
pop inside of here and then click on
home and you want to look for people
that are also tweeting out lists of
people's names first you want to click
on and make sure you're following I'm
not falling this person they're
following 34,000 they have thirty-two
thousand followers that's definitely
somebody I want to follow up so that's
awesome another thing I want to do is I
want to click on this and I want to find
out who's retweeting this person so
let's click on that and you can see
26-29 2637 okay that's really awesome
and they already follow me however so
this is definitely a name that I'd want
to copy and I'd also want to tweet out
to other people so that I could promote
and promote and promote and also guess
what we know we know that this person is
currently online you know which is
something that we found out whenever we
come in here back into tweet be calm sea
we want to make sure that we are finding
people that are currently online have a
ton of friends also followers just make
sure that their friends are over 100 200
300 400 somewhere in that area and also
make sure that they don't have anywhere
near 2000 friends because most people
that have two thousand friends are
currently locked down account wise which
means they can't reciprocate and follow
you you never want to follow more than
400 people in a day and if you follow a
whole bunch of people and after two days
they don't follow you you can go to who
unfollowed me and it's going to show you
a list of all the people that were
irritated by your tweets and unfollowed
you or simply we're just out to get a
follower and then immediately dump that
person and then you just come over here
you want to make sure these ads load if
you're a problem with this as a reason
why is it set up to not work unless
those ads load and then you just want to
go to who unfollowed me and it's going
to print out a whole list of all the
different people that unfollowed you
since the last time you checked and then
you just want to unfollow them like I
said do this like after two days and
just click
unfollowed and you will unfollow all of
those additional people so those are all
the different tools that I use to get
followers on Twitter like I said I might
promote myself as being something like
super genius it I'm doing this because
you guys have asked me for it anyone can
feel free to leave comments below about
tricks that they know about getting
followers on Twitter and so forth and so

additional followers do you've any
questions or comments below otherwise
