my c-sharp video tutorial and this part
of this tutorial we're going to focus
completely on threads as well as how we
can use sleep lock priority passing data
to threads and a whole bunch more like
always all the code as well as a
transcript of this video is available in
the description underneath this video
and I have a lot to do so let's get into
it
okay so here we are over Visual Studio
or if you're on Mac or Linux you're
using Samarin and you're going to make
sure that you're going to be using the
system threading the guy up here and
otherwise nothing here is going to work
and then basically with threads they're
going to allow you to execute multiple
pieces of code that can share resources
and data without corrupting it and some
important things to remember is that you
cannot guarantee when a thread is going
to execute you also must lock resources
until a thread is done and if you do not
do that there is a risk that your data
could be corrupted so basically what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to create
a simple little program just so you can
see what a thread looks like so we're
going to create a thread so will you
just type in a thread t is equal to new
thread and I'm going to call for just a
whole bunch of ones and zeros to be
printed so I'm going to say print one
just to do something really simple so
it's going to be like a random binary
number we're going to be generating here
now if you want to start your thread
after you create it you just call start
on it and I'm going to show you a whole
bunch of their different ways you can do
it whoops let's change this to T and
let's change this to T all right so that
looks a little better now what we're
going to do underneath here is we're
going to create that print 1 method so
I'm going to go static void and print 1
just to keep it very simple and then
inside of here I'm going to have a for
loop inside is equal to 0 and while I is
less than 100 or 1 else give 1000 just
so we can see a lot of data I plus plus
and then this guy down here I'm going to
use a shortcut I always want to remind
you that just type CW tab tab and here
we're just going to say console well
to console right so we can keep
everything on one page and zero oh no
this is going to be the print one part
so let's keep it like that and then what
we're going to do up here is the main
function is actually a thread as well so
so that you know that and we come up
here and we will go after the start I'll
paste that and there just to show you
how things will change and up here this
is going to print zero on the screen and
then this is going to obviously keep the
console running so that we can see
everything that's going on all right so
you're going to so I'm just going to run
it you're going to see how this works
and you can see that it went and shared
times between the main thread and thread
you created so it's printed a whole
bunch of zeros then printed some ones
and then went back and printed some
zeros and then some ones and so forth
and so on and left unabated that's
basically what threads will do if you
run multiple threads it's going to shift
back and forth and let one thread being
the main thread main thread it's going
to run for a little bit and it's going
to jump down here and it's going to
allow this thread right here that's
calling print one to execute over and
over again until they are both finished
ok so that is a simple example of how
you can use two threads and now I'm
going to jump over and show you an
example of sleep and how that can help
us ok so now with sleep or the sleep
method what that's going to allow us to
do is have a thread be suspended for a
designated amount of time and I'm just
going to show you example here basically
what I want to tell my computer to do is
to run a program slowly so I want it to
print out 0 through 10 and I want it to
do it in 1 second increments so that we
can see it occur on the screen now what
I'm going to do is go for and int is
equal to 0 and we're going to continue
doing this well I is less than 10
and we'll increment I once again just to
keep that nice and simple and then
inside of here we are going to come in
and do a console.writeline and we're
going to print out our number however
after we print out the number we want to
call thread
sleep and tell it to pause for 1000
milliseconds or one second and you're
going to see how that is going to affect
everything and of course I'm also going
to come in here and increment namah each
time through so that we can count out
from zero it's actually going to be zero
to nine and then we can come down here
and we can just go and type off
something like thread ends so that we
know that the thread ends and we're
going to get into names and try wordy
and checking what threads are running
and so forth and so on just want to
start off with a very simple example so
now let's try to run that and you can
see right here it's printing 1 2 3 4 5
so forth and so on with 1 second
increments in between them and there you
can see thread ends prints okay so
pretty cool stuff so that's an example
of how we can slow down a thread using
sleep and now I want to show you a more
elaborate example in which we will lock
a thread so that we can keep from
contaminating data okay in the same
program I'm going to create a new class
and I'm going to call it a bank account
and the goal here is that we are going
to try to protect our bank account from
going below 0 we are going to try to
keep users from taking more money out
than they have in their bank account and
we're going to use lock to do that so
first I'm going to create this guy and
this is going to be the object that we
are going to use to lock everything down
so that the bank account can't go below
0 and then I'm going to have a balance
for my bank account because without that
that's not going to make much sense so
we can just go and do that and is there
anything else I want to do mmm not
really
okay so let's create a constructor for
our bank accounts and this guy is just
going to receive a double that's going
to be the balance for the bank accounts
we'll just go balance like that and
whatever balance they pass in we are
then going to allow them to withdraw
money from their bank accounts so I'm
just going to call this withdraw and
it's going to be passed some amount that
they're going to be able to withdraw
from the accounts here I'm going to
check that
our balance - the amount is not less
than 0 and if it is I'm going to come in
here and I'm going to say something like
sorry and let's print out the balance
amount in whoops so that like that in
accounts just to give a simple type of
message there and then I'm just going to
return whatever the balance of the
account is just to do something all
right
otherwise if that doesn't work I'm going
to use lock here and what this is going
to do is it's going to keep any other
threads from coming in here and trying
to access all of the code between these
curly braces or anything inside of here
until each thread is finished so here
I'm going to say if balance is greater
than or equal to the amounts that they
want to withdraw I'm going to gooo a
console right here and I'm going to say
removed and the dista left in accounts
and you close that off and then get the
two amounts so I'm going to have the
amount that they asked for and then I'm
going to get the balance whoops - of the
amounts all right so that's also and
then of course after I do all of that
I'm going to have to change the balance
amount and I'm just going to go balance
equal to whatever the amount was and
subtract the amount they took off of
there and then after this let's return
the new balance all right pretty simple
stuff now one thing it's important I'm
going to show you how you're going to be
able to pass arguments to threads in a
minute but by default you can only point
at methods without arguments and also
methods that return nothing or have a
void for the return amount so what we're
going to do is I'm going to say public
void and I'll say issue withdraw because
I should be withdrawal whatever I'm
going to keep it that way
and we'll say withdraw and I'm just
going to say that every single time
somebody takes money out of here they're
going to take one dollar out of it and
this has given me error messages but
going to be using this in a second so we
don't have to worry about that okay so
basically this is just here so that the
thread is going to be able to access
this guy up here and in the way that
like I said by default threads are not
allowed to deal with methods that have
arguments or aren't void but like I said
I'm going to show you how to pass
arguments to threads here in a minute
all right so now we're going to come
back up inside of our main function
we're going to start playing around with
this so the very first thing we're going
to do is we're going to create a bank
account
and call that accounts new bank accounts
and you're going to get to see how
threads sort of like hop around like we
did in the first example and I'm going
to create a thread array and I'm just
going to call this threads a new thread
array and we're going to create 15 of
these guys inside of here and something
that's interesting is the current thread
is going to tell you what's current
thread is being active and main is the
only one that's out there right now so
what we're going to do is we're also
going to use the name property here to
name our main thread main and I'm going
to show you in a minute how we can go
and get the current name of the thread I
didn't want to create 15 threads that
are going to call issue withdraw to
execute so go in I is equal to zero
while I is less than fifteen and
increment I here and then this guy
basically what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a thread obviously new
thread no and then we're going to call
thread start and then we're going to
call our bank accounts and we're going
to call the issue withdraw method inside
of it and like I said previously we are
not looks like this there we are like I
said previously we are not going to be
able to call methods that receive
attributes or return values I'm then
going to get the name
or I'm going to set the name for each of
these individual threads to whatever the
value of I is at the moment as we're
cycling through here and then I
to add it to my threads array so this is
equal to T then after that I'm going to
have all of these different threads
execute so I'm going to say I is equal
to zero and we're going to continue
cycling through this as long as it's
less than 15 and increment I of course
then we're going to go and check if a
thread has started or not so I'm going
to go thread and you do that by using a
property called is a lot so we're just
going to output that on the screen just
to show you something else you can do
with threads and I'm going to go threads
I and get the name that's what I
assigned up here where did I do it right
there we're going to have that print out
and then I'm going to check if it's
alive by going threads I and by a live I
mean is it's currently started or not is
live save that then after we do that
we're actually going to start the thread
so to do that we just issued start on it
like this and then we can check if it's
alive again so let's just go and copy
this and this is going to now we know
it's not going to be alive there it will
be alive here and we just want to output
that to the screen just to see it
another thing we can do is we can get
the priority of a thread and we're just
going to do this outside of here outside
of these threads executing so we're
going to be doing it with main so here
I'm just going to go console so what we
can do here to get the priority is just
go current priority and get that value
right there and we can just call thread
on the current thread that is running
and every thread is going to have a
priority of normal and this is sort of a
touchy sort of subject you can change
the priorities of your thread but that
doesn't guarantee that the highest
precedence but that doesn't guarantee
that the highest priority is actually
going to receive precedence so for the
most part it is kind of worthless to
play around with priority and kind of
dangerous but just so you know you can
change the priority to normal which is
the default lowest below normal above
normal or high
so you can play around with that and see
what happens and how it affects your
code but like I said it's probably
better to just ignore it altogether I
just wanted to cover it just so that you
know what it was all right and then we
can come in and say thread and ending
and this is going to be main and you
might see some crazy stuff that goes on
and then we'll just go current thread
and get the name right here and
console.readline and what's going on
down here it's giving me an error oh I
see why this guy right here needs to be
moved so let's get rid of that right
there and then let's put this down here
there we are go to our curly brackets in
the right place and save it and
everything should be good so let's run
it see what happens and we can run
through here exactly what's going on and
you can see thread 0 is alive false and
that it is alive thread 1 and so forth
and so on you can see how these threads
are coming to life and starting to
perform actions you can see right here
that we removed one dollar nine dollars
left in an account thread four is a lot
of true and so forth and so on so you
can see how these threads become active
however they are not executing they're
basically staying in line and the reason
why they are staying in line is because
we are locking the account down right
there if we did not do that that would
get all kinds of crazy results and go in
there and run it and just get rid of the
lock and you'll see exactly what happens
so basically a lock just protects our
count data from going down below zero
remove one dollar one dollar left an
account remove one dollar zero left in
account and then you can see right here
sorry zero is in the account and all the
other threads are continually trying to
pull money out of there but they are not
receiving it you're also seeing here
that we are using the thread name and
outputting it obviously we're using is
alive here to check if the thread is
currently active or not here you can see
is the default priority for the current
active thread which is main is normal
and you can see right here where we're
end or whenever main comes to an end
okay so a little bit more elaborate
example and very very important that we
understand lock and how it protects our
data and now like I promised I'm going
to show you how to it is possible to
pass data to thread
okay so you're going to be able to pass
arguments to a thread using lambda
expressions and we've covered those in
detail here in the past and I'm going to
show you a quick example of how exactly
that's going to work for us so what
we're going to do is we're going to
create a thread once again equal to new
thread and then let's go and create our
method here first that we're going to be
calling static void and what this is
going to do is receive a number and
count to that number so we'll go max
number and then throw a four loop inside
of here so int I is equal to zero we're
going to continue looping as long as I
is less than or equal to the maximum
number passed inside of it and then of
course we're going to increment the
value of hi and we're going to just
print out I inside of here
okay so let's save that that's what
count two is going to do for us now I'm
going to show you up here how we can go
and call for that to execute so we're
going to go thread and inside of here
inside of these parentheses we are then
going to point to count two and we're
going to say that we want to count to
the value of ten with that and then
we're going to go to start and execute
that and then afterwards I'm going to
show you how to actually use a
multi-line lambda to have multiple
different things execute here so I'm
going to go to thread once again and
then we've come down to this guy and
then have them start once more like that
and then like that and then inside of
here we're going to cau count two with
more values so we'll say count five and
then we'll also say count to six I don't
know just something and then you're
going to watch this because things
aren't locked down or sleep isn't used
and so forth and so on it's sort of
executed crazily but you're going to see
the fact that we are able to pass in
threads or pass attributes into threads
and see them execute and you can see
indeed starts executing zero one and
then the one two five comes in or zero
two five comes in and starts executing
and then you can see here is your
one two three four five six and then the
original thread that was called goes and
continues writing out to the screen to
ten so let's pay attention here so 0 1
and then it starts v5 let's run it again
see if we get the same results just
about done and here you see you get
different results 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and
7 and then the next stored kicks in see
it then goes to 5 0 and then the
original thread starts up continues to
10 and so forth and so on so it sort of
reinforces the fact that you're going to
want to use lock and sleep and things
like that with threads just to keep your
data protected but overall that is just
a quick run-through of how threads work
and as the series continues I'm going to
provide more real-world examples just
one to clear up a topic that is
sometimes kind of confusing so like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
