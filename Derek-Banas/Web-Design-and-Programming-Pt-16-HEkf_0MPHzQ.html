16 of my web design and programming
tutorial today I'm gonna focus in more
on MySQL and talk about some basic
queries you can issue as well as how to
insert information into your database
either by hand or through the use of
comma separated value files log first we
need to log in to MySQL and if you
didn't see the previous tutorials most
definitely check those out otherwise
this will not make any sense and I'm
going to use my customer table and since
the last tutorials I went in and added a
couple more tables to the specific
database and if I show you customer
table you can see here I've split up the
name in the first name last name street
city I should probably make city into a
separate table because I'm going to be
entering the same values but I didn't
for now and I did split state out into a
separate table and here zip code and
there's password phone order and
customer ID these are all references
that we talked about in previous
tutorial and if I come in here I can
actually show you the state table that I
created and if you wanted to insert
values by hand into this table this is
how you could do it you could either put
in here state comma state underscore ID
like that but I'm gonna choose not to do
that instead just put values otherwise
you would put it right here what I was
just typing in and let's say I just want
to put in PA for right now and I'm gonna
insert null because this is gonna auto
increment for me and let's say that I
also put in West Virginia no and I was
able to insert those values in there and
to show them I'm just going to query the
database and say show me everything from
the table name state and you can see
that it input those two values in there
I previously had two other IDs set up
and you can see here if you delete
values out of a table that it's gonna
continue to auto increment even though
those values no longer are located there
so that's just a note that you can think
on so that's how you would input those
that information just by hand and
another thing I put in here was a table
called phone and
to make sure you get it insert into
phone values and here I'm gonna put it
in all because this is gonna auto
increment for me and then I'm gonna put
it in a string which is gonna be in
telephone number and I'm gonna designate
this as a home telephone number and
again I can show everything in here just
by typing that in you can see it Ottoman
commented created one and put telephone
number in here and the phone type so
that's one way to input information that
you could also input it in other ways so
for example let's say that I was
entering in different product types ATM
supplies calculators cash registers and
so forth and this is what we call comma
separated value file or a CSV and you
could normally what you do is you input
this information into a spreadsheet and
you save it as a CSV file and then you
want to make sure that you delimit that
I use the separation between these
values with a comma and all text with
single quotes most of the time okay so
if I have this guy right here and I want
to input him into my database how
exactly do I do that I'm gonna show ya
and here you're gonna see how to
actually open the database and input
values and so forth and so on
so what I'm gonna do first is I'm gonna
define some constants being database
user it's gonna be database user ID and
you've seen me type this in a whole
bunch of times and then this file should
be hidden but for now I'm not going to
hide it database password and you're
gonna see the password I've been typing
in but I never use it for anything else
because I'm not stupid then you need to
define another constant which is going
to be database host make sure you put
the quotes around that and in my
circumstances it's going to be localhost
define database name and this is going
to be the name that you're gonna be
working with so in my circumstance this
is going to be customer and then you
want to connect to the database and I'm
gonna put a check in here with an if
statement to make sure that I'm able to
connect otherwise it's going to give me
an error message and you do that with
the MySQL underscore connect function
and then you would just pass it all of
the constants that you just set up
previously so what this is going to do
is if this does connect it's going to
proceed
into this if statement the following if
statement in here I'm going to check
that I'm able to actually connect to the
specific database that I defined and if
not I'm going to trigger an error that I
was unable to select that database no no
no for a break statement in here of
course you don't have to type this
specific format here this is just what
I'm using and then I'm going to
concatenate at the end of this the
actual error and of course you would
want to hide this this isn't something
that you would do whenever you were
actually going to deploy this for the
public to use this is something you're
going to use whenever you're testing
your database to make sure that it works
if it does trigger that error I'm going
to exit out I'm going to close off that
if statement and then else trigger error
so if I get down to this point what this
means is I was unable to connect to
MySQL so I want to make sure that I'm
alerted that I was unable to connect to
MySQL and then print that error out the
screen as well and then exit out of the
program and close that off otherwise I
can assume that if I didn't get any
errors there that I was able to open the
connection to the database so then what
I want to do is I want to open a handler
to the CSV file that I created because
I'm going to pull all that information
into my database and how I'm gonna do
this is with a while loop move this up
on the screens you can actually see it
and what this is going to do is pull all
that information from that CSV file with
the F get CSV function and only gonna do
is point it towards the handler for that
file type in I previously talked about
this in previous tutorials I'm going to
type in the maximum number of characters
that I expect and then between quotes
I'm going to define the delimiter that
is going to separate these values in the
CSV file which is going to be a comma
comma separated values makes sense so as
long as there is still information in
there this while loop is going to
continue to cycle they don't want to
combine all the values and separate them
with a comma and save them to this file
called get data and I'm going to use the
implode function here and I'm going to
say that all these guys are separated
with a comma
in the name of this array in this
situation info is an array so I want to
put in the array right inside of there
and then I'm gonna create a query that I
am going to use it's the insert SQL
keyword and I'm going to say I want to
insert into the table called
manufacturer and whenever you're doing
this it normally makes sense to actually
type the values in in this situation I
didn't do it previously because I wanted
to show you the different ways to use
the insert function values and I'm gonna
take all the information that's stored
and get data and create that query and
if you're wondering what this is these
are just the brackets that we saw
previously whenever we were querying
MySQL just like we did right here see
these are the brackets there's a bracket
and there's another bracket well I need
to put them into the query this is just
sending a quarry to MySQL just like we
previously did it I just have to save it
and I'm gonna echo that query out to the
screen just so you can see the quarry is
being entered and separate them with a
break just so it's easier to see exactly
what's going on and then to actually
issue the query nice ql query and asset
the query that you just created and then
again in test mode before this guy's
live I always do all this error handling
to make sure that everything's coming
through here perfectly throw the break
statement in there nice cue our error
and that's it that is how you access the
database and that is how you query the
database from PHP and then after you're
done you call the MySQL closed function
and that closes the connection to the
database and if I save this file
and then jump over here you can see that
it printed all this information on to
the stream these are all the queries
that I provided on the database and if
we jump over to the database itself you
can see that all that information is
going to be entered and I'm going to do
that now first I'll show the actual
table the manufacturer and then if I
want to output the screen all of the
information that I just input into
manufacturer the table manufacturer you
can see that all that information is
there so we were able to pull all that
information over and stick it in the
database so very
useful and if I also wanted to be able
let's say just describe customer you can
see there's the customer information if
I want to be able to manually inside of
my SQL insert information into customer
I just go insert into the name of the
table I want to enter information into
values these are all should be uppercase
but they don't have to be obviously and
then I'm gonna put in all of my values
and you can see them up above and
because I put them in order I don't have
to define where I want these values to
be entered I'll just go right in based
off of the order that I enter 3 is going
to be my state code my identification
number for that made up zip code and
here I'm using a function called sha and
what it does is it takes a password and
automatically converts it into a 40
character encrypted code no matter what
is entered so it's a nice function
that's available to you minus QL and
you're gonna see more of this later
and there's my telephone number the code
for it and then these last two them
we're gonna know being null and going
out put the screen all the information
that's currently stored in the cable
called customer I just do this and you
can see there's that 40 character long
code and I actually have to shrink this
down for you to be able to see
everything but you can see first name
last name street ID so forth and so on
and all that information is stored
inside MySQL so there is a bunch of
different ways to enter information into
your database in MySQL and in the
upcoming tutorials I'm gonna teach you
every single other SQL keyword and every
single other way you can interact with
databases with MySQL if you have any
other questions or comments leave them
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
