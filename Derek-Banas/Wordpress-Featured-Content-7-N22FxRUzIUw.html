7 of my wordpress featured content
tutorial where I will teach you how to
do just about anything with WordPress
and in the process create this nice
featured content tool well if you
haven't seen the previous tutorials
definitely watch them and what we're
going to need to do in this tutorial is
actually create all the HTML and CSS and
all that stuff in here dynamically every
single time somebody creates a new
featured content post and as you can see
there's three of these there's a total
max of fifteen however we want to make
it work if there's only five or ten and
in this tutorial I'm going to create all
that HTML and CSS dynamically inside of
wordpress so from last tutorial inside
of this function we created last NT t mb
image create i'm actually going to put
all of my code in there later on i'm
going to set it up so that all this
stuff is automatically updated whenever
they save a new post in the category of
featured boy that sounds confusing and
it kind of is but either way if you just
switch this tutorial just to figure out
a couple really cool things about
wordpress that'll get you a long long
way to creating really cool stuff with
wordpress so what we're going to do
inside of that function to scroll way
way way down to the bottom of it and the
first thing i'm going to do is get an
object that contains all the posts in
the category featured so I'm gonna go
call this pose featured I'm gonna say
get term by this is a function inside of
wordpress and i'm going to say name then
i'm going to provide it with the name
remember everything will go into the
featured content if it is in the
category featured if you can't see this
you can definitely show it full screen
this is an HD movie it'll look much
better that way and we're going to type
in category right like that and that's
going to give me an object that's going
to provide me access to every single
post that is in the featured category
and we're going to create this guy here
in a minute it's going to do a little
bit of work ahead of time then create a
new variable called ntt foes featured
and here i'm going to make sure that i
only receive a maximum number of 15
posts because that's all that my tool
allows for and how you do that is call
post featured which i just created
followed by dash and that bracket and
count and it's going to tell me how many
posts popped back from that query and
i'm going to say if it's greater than 15
I want the value of this variable to be
set at 15
and if not I want it to be set at
whatever this is so here I'm just
monitoring how many posts came back and
I'm making sure that they're raising
maximum of 15 posts that's all then I'm
going to call my function that's going
to create all of the stuff you see on
the right side of the screen dynamically
every single time somebody creates a new
post in the featured category I'm going
to pass over to it the number of posts
to fit that requirement and that's all
that I need to do there they can bring
this guy up here and close off that
function now we're going to actually
create all of the code that's going to
create this guy over here so let's
scroll this up enough PHP clothes off
bhp and the name of this guy is going to
be ntt make da da da da so come in here
have to make a new function like that
going to get the number of posts that
are in the featured category now i'm
going to figure out how many featured
content pages i should make knowing that
i need a minimum of five posts per page
so how do you do that I go ntt
underscore just creating a variable is
equal to i'm going to say floor which is
going to chop off any decimals inside of
PHP pages / 5 so it's going to avoid
whatever's passed over so if there's the
number I'll like say 11 on post is
passed over its going to divide it by 5
which is going to shoot back to point
whatever and it's going to chop off the
decimal so I'm always going to have
everything in increments of 5 so that's
what that does then I'm going to create
this guy that's going to be in a ray so
I'm just creating an empty array here
look I'm not sophisticated now I'm going
to get the URL for my plug-in directory
how you do that as go WP plugin URL this
is wordpress forward slash dot and then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to do
a string replace which is PHP basename
make a reference to the actual plug-in
which that's what I'm doing here with
underscore underscore file quotes and
I'm going to put in the actual location
here for my plugin folder this is it all
confusing don't worry about it what it
just simply does is it returns my
plug-in directory that's all it does so
you could just copy and paste this code
you don't necessarily need to understand
exactly how it works then I'm going to
issue a custom query that's going to
output all my titles for all my featured
content articles and a whole bunch of
other different things and like before
to issue these queries I need to hijack
that
you p query object however so that i can
use it later i'm going to store its
current contents in a temporary file and
then i'm going to create my version of
it by setting it to null then i'm going
to create a brand new WP query object
and then host featured i'm going to take
the total number of pages there's going
to be and i'm going to get the total
number of posts it's going to be
displayed and that's going to be
multiplied times five so this is the
total number of posts remember whenever
we did this up here with floor to decide
how many total pages we were going to
need well here this is going to tell me
how many total posts are going to be
needed and then I'm going to my query
and I'm going to say post or page is
equal to I'm going to jump out the
WordPress I'm gonna go pose featured
count that's going to give me the total
number of posts we have here being that
the category name is equal to featured
that's a query that I'm sending directly
to WordPress and then what I'm going to
do is cycle through all these different
pages and set the current post number 21
because that's how it's going to fall
and scroll this up a little bit and then
I'm going to issue a while loop it's
going to cycle through everything and
this you have seen before just going to
cycle through as long as there are posts
that are returned from that query that I
just issued my call the post just going
to get me all the information I need for
each of the post and then I'm going to
say that I want to output the title of
the post I'm going to save this inside
of my array that I created ntt host
number so this is going to be the first
post that's why I set at the one by
default it's going to be incremented
down below before the while loop ends
and if you want the title to be sent to
you from WordPress you just go get the
title and then you go Oh stash /i d
which is going to give you the ID for
the title of the post i mean i want to
retrieve the value of the excerpts and
trim this to 330 characters so that's
going to be this guy right here all this
discrete being created dynamically so
it's going to be created dynamically
every single time somebody makes a new
post as long as is in the featured
category so I knew I'm doing some really
crazy stuff here guys but no one's ever
done this and I just thought I'm doing
it get the excerpt this is how you get
the excerpt
wordpress and then if i want to shorten
that excerpt i'm going to call the
substring function inside of PHP take
the long excerpt that i just created and
just take out the first from the first
character to the three hundred thirtieth
character right like that and calling TT
featured content info and I'm going to
store that inside of that guy I can just
copy this so I'm putting everything
inside of arrays so it'll be really easy
for me to access this information in a
later period so just a 1 and T team
short excerpt then I'm going to get the
URL that is going to link to the post up
there and I'm going to store this in
this multi-dimensional array in the
second spot if you want to get the link
to the post you call a function called
get permalink post ash ID right like
that then I'll get you what you need
then I want to retrieve the URL for the
featured image which is saved as a meta
value we created this a while back so
I'm going to go into to post underscore
ID which is equal to say I want to get
the ID for this current post that I'm
working with right here i'm going to
call ntt featured image is equal to and
if I want to get a meta value that is
stored inside of here and meta value
that I'm talking about is this meta
value that I created here previously
right here so here's the gazelle
specific things this is what I'm going
to do for each one of these posts that's
created I'm going to pull this meta
value out of here which is the location
of the featured content image that's
what we're doing ok so how I do that I
go get post meta ntt post ID which is
the current post is being display and
then I gave that meta value and TT MBE
image as a name but you have to put that
forward slash there and we're going to
type in true no one close that off and
now that I have the value of that I'm
going to store it in my array that will
be used later on in the third part of
that guy featured image now here what
I'm going to be creating is this guy
right here previously we shrunk down the
featured content image this was two
tutorials ago using a tool called Tim
thumb well I have to actually create all
of that code directly inside here and
this is actually what's going to look
like so if we scroll down here and I
dumped this inside of here what I need
to create this time is all
this stuff right here I have to link to
the Tim thumb function that's going to
automatically shrink the featured
content image down save it in the catch
it's going to do a kind of things but I
have to create all of this content
dynamically remember so I'm going to
start off posting that inside of there
and then this is going to be equal to 4
is equal to and I'm going to go image
source is equal to and then i'm going to
put double quotes and in single quotes
and put a dot i'm going to say blog info
i want to find the template directory
because that's where i have Tim thumb
stored so how do you do that WordPress
you called template directory inside of
the blog info function and then that
ends that actually i'm going to copy
this because we're going to put more
inside of here i'm going to put a dot
operator inside of there so that it
automatically it pens to the end of it
and here going to go Tim thumb Tim thumb
dot PHP followed by source is equal to
close that off then I'm going to go ntt
I say Tim thumb I want you to take the
featured image and don't forget the dot
operator then you have to tell Tim thumb
the height that you want and the width
that you want and if you want it to be
cropped which I don't know why you
wouldn't want it to be you put z c is
equal to one and we're going to go all
is equal to and then we're actually
going to close that off and then we're
going to get some more information being
the title i'm just going to go control
paste that in there so i want to grab
the title that i created previously
which is 0 so you get the title say i'm
using that down sign here i'm actually
going to close that on grohl up now
let's create some more number dot
operator and then we go to define some
HTML in here make sure that the height
is also going to be equal to 48 and so
is the width and then we're going to go
title is equal to and then we're going
to put the title in here so we just got
changed this to 0 get rid of that dot
operator link like that and then end
that and then end this and then close
that off right like that and at the end
of this we have to call ntt post num and
we're going to automatically increment
that and then we're going to end our
while loop in the next part of the
tutorial i'm going to take all this
information that i stored in these
arrays and automatically generate all
this HTML pretty cool stuff i leave any
questions or comments in the comment
section below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
