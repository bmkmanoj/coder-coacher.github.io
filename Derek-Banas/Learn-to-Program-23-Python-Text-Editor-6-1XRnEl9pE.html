23 of my learn to program series in
previous part part 21 I created all
kinds of things for making a text editor
but I didn't cover how to make the
actual text editor part so in this video
I'm going to show you how to open files
as well as how to save files inside of a
text widget and then you'll be able to
add all those features covered in part
21 to make a fully functioning text
editor all of the code is available in
the description as well as a transcript
of this video and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay so here I am in
pod children let's go and import our
different modules we're going to use
let's just get everything from TK enter
and also we're going to need to import
TK enter file dialogue which is going to
allow us to both open as well as save
files and I'm going to create a proper
class for this I'm gonna call it text
editor it's going to be very simple and
it's going to provide you with the
ability to go in and add a whole bunch
of functionality now the very first
thing I'm going to do here is I'm going
to create a static method that is going
to allow us to quit our application so
quits app is what I'm going to call it
and event is going to be set for none
and quite simply all this is going to do
when called is just call for the quit
function to run alright so pretty simple
stuff next thing I'm going to do is
provide a function that's going to allow
us to open files and this is going to be
also passed event and we're going to set
that to none because these are going to
be called from menu items whatever
they're clicked on and very first thing
I'm going to do is I'm going to go text
file and I'm going to open a dialog that
is going to allow users to find the file
they want to open and then it's going to
be displayed inside of a text widget so
to do that you just go TK enter and file
dialog and then ask open file
is the name of that and parent is going
to be set for a route that's going to
tie it to our route or a main window and
then you're going to set your initial
directory now of course this is going to
be completely different than what I have
as an initial directory unless you have
Derrick manases a directory on your
computer which everybody should so there
we go and you're going to have to put
the C in there if you're on Windows of
course and all that stuff but I trust
you know that anti-drone projects is
going to be the directory that's going
to open up specifically and then I want
to check that I actually had a file
selected so if a file was selected by
the user then I'm going to call self and
I'm going to get my text widget and I'm
going to delete whatever is inside of
there and to do that you go 1.0 and end
and that's how you specifically delete a
text widget then I want to come in and
open a file and put the text from that
file into my text widget and I'm going
to use with here just like we've used
previously and we tell it the specific
file that we want to go and pull
information from and I'm going to say as
file and then inside here we're going to
go self text area and we're going to
call insert to insert the information
from the file you're going to go 1.0
again and then we're going to say file
and we're going to say read and it's
going to read that information and put
it inside of my text widget then you're
going to have to come in and update the
text widget if you don't do this it's
not going to update after it's done and
we'll say update idle tasks and there we
are and make sure you spell it right and
there we go and that's all we need to do
to be able to open a text file there
it's the whole entire function right
there on one screen how we're going to
be able to open up a dialog it's going
to allow them to select a file check if
the file exists delete anything that's
inside of there insert the information
from the file and then update the text
widget ok now that we have that set up
let's come in
show you how to save a file whenever we
make changes to it so once again we're
going to have self inside of here and
events and I'm going to set that to none
for default just move this up here of
course pause the video if you don't have
time to go typing everything in then
what I'm going to do is open a save
dialog box on the screen so we're going
to go file dialogue once again and here
we're going to say ask save as file
these are very long-winded and the mode
we're going to use here is a write mode
so we're going to write to the file and
say if file not equal to none then I
want to get all of the text that is
currently in the text widget delete the
newline that's at the end of it and then
save it so I'm going to go data is equal
to and self and text area and call get
on this and I'm going to go one point
zero once again and then I'm going to
call end and then after that this is
going to actually delete the last
character or the newline that is in
there okay so that's what that guy does
and then I just need to write the text
and close the file so we'll just go file
write and data writing and then we will
save file close and that's how easy it
is to save a file so that's how we open
a file and this is how we save a file
all right so now what we need to do is
just initialize our text editors so
we're going to go define underscore
underscore in it and this is going to be
passed a root and that's going to clear
up a whole bunch of errors that we're
showing right there and root of course
is just going to be our main window I'm
going to start off by going text to
right and just give this nothing here
and I'm writing this out of my head so
I'm not 100% certain I'm actually going
to use that so then we're going to give
in and go root title and give this a
flashy title like text editor and then
I'm going to define the width and the
height for the main window so geometry
and I'm going to
the width be set for 600 and the height
be set to 550 maybe that'll look good
maybe it won't we'll find out going to
then come in and define the frame that
is going to hold all of my widgets or
pretty much the only widget which which
is going to be the text widget and I'm
just going to have the width and the
height be exactly the same 550 for that
and what is a text editor without a
scrollbar so if you want to create a
scrollbar we're just going to get a
scrollbar and call scrollbar and you
pass the frame inside of that then I
need to connect my scrollbar to my text
area so I'm going to say self and text
area is going to be equal to text and
frame and I'm just going to have the
width also be 600 and the height be
equal to 550
I didn't constrain it so that these
can't be resized so you know they can't
be resized then I'm going to call Y
scroll command and this is going to
connect the scrollbar to the text area
for us and equal to scroll bar set and
then after we have that there you see Y
scroll command scroll bar set and then
I'll just add some padding so I'm going
to say 10 - on the XY axis and 10 on to
10 on both the X and the y axis okay so
that's the padding I'm going to call
scroll bar and config and command is
going to be equal to self text area and
Y view and this guy is going to be
called whenever the scroll bar is going
to be moved it's going to handle
scrolling the text for us and the scroll
bar is going to be on the right side of
the screen and I just need to go and put
it there and how we're going to put it
there
is go scroll bar HAC and then we're
going to say side is equal to right and
then we're going to fill the scroll bar
in the y-direction
I'll make sure we have right Beeler
right there and then the fill is going
to be in the y-direction now I need to
set up how we're going to put the text
area widget inside of here so I'm going
to say self
and text area and call pac---- on that
and I'm going to say that I want it to
be set to the left side of the frame
that we have surrounding everything I
want it to fill all of the available
space and then I also want it to be able
to expand and then after I have that all
set up I can go frame and pack and then
let's create our menu as well you saw
this in a previous part of the tutorial
we want to create the menu bar that's
going to go across the top of the screen
you know like we have menu bars up here
so here I'm just going to pass in routes
inside of there and then going to create
my file menu go to menu I to the menu
which we just created here and then I do
not want it to tear off the screen at
the top actually the next part of the
tutorial I'm going to create a little
toolbar and I'll show you how to use
tear off with that and now I just want
to add the items to the menu that are
basically going to show whenever file is
clicked on so whenever you click on file
it's going to display open as well as
save and then you saw the menu items or
the functions already above that are
going to be called whenever those are
clicked on so add command and we'll set
the label for the first one to be open
and then the function that's going to be
called whenever that open is clicked on
is going to be open file and you saw how
that works
likewise we're going to do the same sort
of thing for save so let's just come
down here paste that in there and we'll
change this to save and we'll change
this to save file and there save file
now those are both set up and just for
the heck of it let's come in here once
again
and add a separator that's going to go
between those two guys as well as a quiz
you already saw the function for the
quit as well file menu and then we'll
call add command once again and then
this one is going to have the label for
quit and then the command but it's going
to be called whenever this is clicked on
is going to be solved and quit app just
make that self alright so we're moving
along here we're almost done wanted to
do a real quick tutorial this time since
the last one was so huge now I need to
add the pulldown menu to our menu bar to
do that you just go the menu and then
add cascade and the label for this guy
is going to be file of course and then
menu is going to be tied to the file
menu that we just defined above then we
need to display the menu bar and to do
that we go config and then we say menu
is going to be equal to other menu all
right so we have everything all set up
down here see what's going on all right
there's the whole entire class there's
all that so I'm going to come down here
which is technically going to take us
out of the class area and I'm going to
say root is equal to care create our TK
object and then all we need to do is go
and create our text editor and to do
that we go text editor and pass root
inside of it and then after that we call
main loop which is going to run as long
as quit isn't run and we can circle up
through here to make sure there aren't
any major errors and that's perfectly
fine and all of this all looks good so
let's run it and let's see if it works
or if I made a little mistake and here
we go here is our text editor and I can
click inside of the text editor and
let's come in here first off and we'll
go up to file and I'll say open and
you'll see that the little dialog box is
going to open right here it's just slow
because I'm recording this video at the
same time and there you can see our all
the different files we have and I can
click on sample text this is a sample
text and here is more and I can come
inside of here and I can say and here is
some more sample text and then I can
come up here and go file and save it and
it's going to open up here which is save
as and I'm going to be able to come down
here and just click on sample text like
whatever and click on save I want to
replace it say yes and then if I would
come in and go file open once again it's
going to show me the exact same thing
there it is and there it is there you go
guys
you can go in to part 21 and change the
fonts and play around with all the other
different things just wanted to cover
this because you guys asked for it and
just like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
