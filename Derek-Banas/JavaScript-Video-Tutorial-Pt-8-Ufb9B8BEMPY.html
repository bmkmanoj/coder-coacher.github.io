8 of my JavaScript scripting tutorial
today I'm going to talk about error
handling we're going to create this
little guy over here on the side it's
going to divide numbers it doesn't look
very sophisticated but it does indeed
catch if somebody would type in a string
please enter any numbers or if they try
to divide by zero automatically without
crashing and then it will continue to
work there afterwards so the first thing
we got to do is create all this stuff
over here well I'm going to put all this
inside of a div within the body of my
HTML code I'm just going to say enter
numbers like to divide right like that
and a break statement and then I'm going
to create the input boxes and this
tutorial isn't just really about error
handling it's also to a certain extent
going to be a review so that I am
positive that you guys totally get how
to work with the hardest part of
JavaScript which is operating with the
child elements in the document object
model that's the most complicated part
of this whole entire thing so that's why
I'm reviewing it and I keep talking
about it and I suppose that you know
what I'm doing here and another break
statement I'm just going to copy this
paste it in here and see VOT VOT then
here I'm going to put in an on blur
event which will be triggered whenever
they leave the text box with their mouse
and here I'm calling get element by ID
and I'm going to be passing at the value
of a span that I'm going to create next
so that it knows where to put this
information and here is that span and
it's ID is going to be equal to you
guessed it answer and I'm going to leave
that empty for now just so you get this
this is the ID number for this guy down
here is what I'm passing to divided me
and all this codes available at new
think tank heavily documented
if you wanted to get it and it's free
now I got to actually create a divide me
function function and identification
number for that span that I'm going to
be able to edit and get the value stored
in the top var textbox
right like this and then just follow
that with value and it'll jump out there
and get it for you and then I'm going to
copy this and I'm going to say bought
for and change this to bought var again
just so you can see this is what I'm
getting this information from these two
boxes now we're going to get to the
error handling part whenever you want to
catch any potential errors you surround
your code what's called a try box as a
release that's what I call it and then
you think about all the things that
could go wrong so for example if they do
not enter a value in both fields you
obviously cannot do a division so we're
checking to make sure that they have
entered a value in both of those places
and if they have not you throw an error
that will be handled down below and it's
basically just going to print out a
custom message based off the error that
they made and then you close off that if
box and then you think okay what else
could go wrong well else if they enter
something that is not a number this is
how you check for that you call the is n
a n function and you pass it the value
so this wouldn't handle if they entered
a string or a character or something
crazy like that and if they did I'm just
going to copy this row please enter only
numbers in the fields okay super well
what else could they do well they could
try to enter a zero and we all know we
cannot divide by zero so if bot bar is
equal to zero we're also going to catch
that error okay so we got all that
handled now if everything worked out
fine well we're going to have to go into
the help ID span and I've done this
countless numbers of times in previous
tutorials this is asking is there a
value currently stored in the span with
the name help ID if there is we want to
eliminate everything that could
potentially be inside of that help ID
span node and this is how you do it you
have to put that period inside of there
L by D what just does is it cycles
through and removes any children
elements that may lie in that span it's
only going to be triggered if there's
something already in there and then
we're going to provide an answer that is
going to be stored in that span we're
going to perform the division and then
what do we have to do we have to come in
here go help ID call the append child
function and change dynamically the
value that is stored in the help ID span
that we have down below we have to call
the function create text node and pass
it the text that we want to show up
inside of there well then we go to close
off our try box because ever
thing worked out and now we got to catch
all of these errors that were previously
flown how do you do that with catch and
specifically catch is going to catch
these error messages if again we're just
going to copy and paste this before we
paste in here into that span we're going
to make sure that there is nothing
already inside of it before we start
pasting information inside of it call
help ID at Penn child document create
text node and then just pass it the
error message that it passed to us and
we're going to close the catch box and
then we want to close the entire
function that we just created if we save
that you can see that it works just like
it did previously without triggering
errors and making in the whole world
wonderful a nice have any questions or
comments leave them in a comment section
below
up next I'm going to show you how to
create delete edit get do whatever with
cookies and then I'm going to show you
how to create an entire menu bar using
nothing but CSS and JavaScript till next
