WordPress tutorial on taxonomy z' and
custom fields if you didn't watch the
previous tutorial on taxonomy x' you
should definitely check that out the
reason I'm doing this tutorial is
multifold person named Bill and another
person named John wanted information on
how you could associate given data with
certain posts like for example if you
wanted to associate an address or
something to a post or a price or a
weight or an item number or whatever and
I'm gonna show you how to do that and
you definitely definitely definitely do
not want to edit the WordPress core
files that was one of the ideas proposed
you never want to do that because if you
do whenever you update WordPress all
that information will be lost so what I
am gonna do is show you how to use
custom fields and taxonomy is to
basically do all the things that you
want and down here you're gonna see
something that I actually made you can
see this is a drop-down box down here in
the lower right hand corner if it clicks
on it you're gonna see different
manufacturer names pop up and then if
you would hit one of those it's gonna
take you to information on products from
those manufacturers but the first thing
we got to do is actually create a text
on me and I show you how to do that
previously what I'm gonna show you how
to do it again here now we're in
functions dot PHP and we're going to
create a function and I'm gonna call it
entity create taxon noemi's so we got
that guy right there and we're gonna
create a taxonomy if you don't know what
that is basically that's like a tag
except it's gonna be highly customized
you're gonna be defining exactly what
types of information is put into it all
right so to do this you create a
function again called register taxonomy
this is a wordpress function this isn't
something I made up and then you have to
define what the name of your taxonomy is
gonna be so these are all gonna be
containing manufacturers so I'm gonna
call it manufacturer then I have to
define that I only want these to be set
up for posts and then I have to create
an array and fill it with a bunch of
attributes so I'm first gonna go over
hierarchical and if I set this to false
what that's gonna mean is I don't want
to include any children well I don't
expect there to be children of
manufacturers it's not like there's
going to be big mass distributors that
have multiple different manufactures
or whatever we're not doing that so I'm
gonna set at the Falls and then I'm
gonna define that I want my label for it
the label name or the proper name to be
manufacturer and quarry VAR and this is
almost always gonna have a value of true
and then rewrite this is also almost
always gonna have a value of true and
that is how you would register that new
taxonomy for manufacturer and then what
I'm going to do is I'm actually gonna
copy it because we're gonna create a
couple taxonomy x' and the next one
we're going to create is going to be
called item number and this is going to
be called item number and that's all we
need to change there and then we're
gonna have another one this one's gonna
be called item type this is gonna be
like the type of product that we're
dealing with here and I got to change
this diet on plate and then to get this
function to actually run and create
these taxonomy the next time WordPress
is startup I have to call add action and
I'm gonna say whenever WordPress is
initiated I want to call the function
and TT create taxon Omi's 0 dota 2 to do
and that's what I got to do in regards
to changing function dot PHP I'm gonna
lead all that whitespace and I'm gonna
delete all this white space as well and
if we file save that and then jump into
the administration area you can now see
inside of WordPress that manufacturer
and item number and item type are all
set up and if we go into manufacturer
for example you can see that there are I
already previously put in these
manufacturers you're gonna see the three
different types of manufacturers that I
have in here and you can go and put
additional ones in if you'd like but if
you would go into your posts and then
say that you want to edit one of these
posts just click on it and you can see
over here on the right side of your
screen you can see here that they are
able to put in different manufacturers
and here we have different other
manufacturers set up as well as item
numbers and all these other different
things are already previously set up
inside of here and what's really cool
about that is once you have those set up
you can actually use them inside of
searches and this is something that has
been very hard for people to do but I'm
going to show you exactly how to set up
the drop-down so that you can search
based off of manufacture
and we're I'm gonna set that up is
inside Bart first dot php' going over
this in the past with this theme and if
you didn't see the previous news theme
tutorial I'll provide a link to that as
well well then what we're gonna do is
come inside of the side bar code and
we're gonna create that drop down menu
that's gonna allow you to search for
manufacturers or whatever based off of
taxonomy so what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to create a function it's actually
semi comes from something that I saw
online from a guy named earth man web so
there's a shout out but I made some
pretty dramatic changes to this so I'm
going to create another function and I'm
gonna call it get terms drop down and
this guy is gonna be passed whatever
taxonomy x' i want to include in the
drop down and i'm referring to the thing
that i showed you first in this tutorial
here so now i'm gonna create this
function first thing you're gonna do is
create an array and it's going to grab
these taxonomy x' up here this can be an
array of taxonomy x' but in this case
it's only going to be a single term but
either way it has to be an array then
I'm gonna call get terms and this is
going to extract all those taxonomy x'
that are sent that this function is told
that it wants to pull information from
make sure you spot right so that will
create that array and now what I need to
do is output the drop-down list of
taxonomy Zin manufacturers for example
so those three manufacturers you saw
previously and then what I'm also gonna
do is whenever one of them is selected
it's gonna automatically send the person
to whatever page lists all the different
products that each manufacturer sells so
I'm going to create a variable called
output and since it's a select box
I should go select name is equal to NTT
man you list and that's important
because I'm going to be calling for that
guy I'm gonna say on change so whenever
this selection box has changed
I'm gonna call location dot H reference
is equal to NTT man u dot M TT - man you
list options selected Inlet X and
basically what this is doing is whenever
somebody clicks on the drop-down it's
gonna say which one of those things will
select it and then it's automatically
going to forward you or the web page or
the browser or whatever to the
information that is
used by the manufacturer you're gonna
see here just stick with me starting to
do things that are a little bit more
complicated and they go option and I
want the default thing in a select box
to be manufacturers then I'm going to
close that option box and then close
that whole entire thing and what I got
to do is manually create all of the
different options that are gonna be
inside of that drop-down box so I have
to call for each statement I'm gonna go
my terms
we created this array right here so I'm
gonna be cycling through that array I'm
gonna say as term and basically what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna get the root URL
which for like my website if I had this
on there would be new think-tank com
that's what I'm gonna get here and how
you would get that is to go get blog
info and then type in URL and that's
gonna kick back the address for the
current website these persons on and I'm
gonna go turn taxonomy and this is going
to give me the folder or the directory
where the taxonomy czar located and then
you call term and you call term - and
just type in taxonomy basically what
we're doing here is we're just finding
the correct URL to send the person to
then term slug this will actually
contain manufacturer like that and then
term name is the proper name so this
will be manufacturer uppercase like I
set up previously and how you get that
is type in term - name right like that
then we're gonna create the link itself
and how you do that is go root URL just
getting all the information we just
grabbed and then we're gonna put in my
situation I'm gonna put index.php but
that is only because i'm on a local host
development server you normally would
not do this you'd get rid of index dot
PHP but you're gonna find that out if
you try to do this yourself so normally
on a regular computer it's gonna be -
what I have highlighted here it's only
gonna be a - because I'm on a
development server I have to do index
dot PHP so you learned how to do it both
on a development system and off dot term
slug and that's just going to be the
root name followed by manufacturer and
it's gonna take you to the proper page
so that's what that right there is doing
and then I'm going to add to output
is equal to option value is equal to and
this link it's going to be the actual
link for the URL the person's gonna be
sent to term name and if we also want to
just want to show the term count meaning
the number of products available from
each manufacturer this is how you do
that and there's that and then there's
the function closing itself off then
finally to close off put output is equal
to close the select box return output so
that function is going to automatically
kick out to screen the select box it's
gonna have all that information into it
I have to actually define the taxonomy
is that I want to show up in that
drop-down box and it must be in an array
and I could put multiples in here but
I'm just gonna put manufacturer because
I just want to list the manufacturers
and then args you have to define some
information about how you want
information to be displayed in regards
to those taxonomy so I'm gonna say order
by name so I want them in alphabetic
order and I went to hide so if I have a
taxonomy defined that doesn't have
anything in it I want to say I don't
want to show that because it's just
slowly like why would you want to do
that and then echo get terms drop down
so that's gonna call this function we
just created and echo is going to output
what is returned right here onto the
screen and then I have to pass to it
taxonomy and args just copy that put
that in there and then the final thing
we gotta do is close off our PHP code
right like that that's all done inside
bar - first dot PHP oops
up here where it says order by name that
needs to be an equal sign then once we
have all that code set up we have to
close off the form it's gonna surround
the whole entire drop-down box and up
here we're gonna create the form and
it's gonna have a name equal to and titi
menu and if we file save that you can
see if we come over here and click on
manufacturers it's gonna list all of the
manufacturers right like that on your
screen and let's say we click on Zurn
going to automatically take you to a
page that's going to list only products
by CERN so that's how you would print
out everything based off of how
economies are set up with different Oh
no if I would want these taxonomy x'
this information to show up on the post
itself so what I mean by that is let's
say I wanted to put manufacturer item
number or item id or weight or price or
whatever at the bottom of all the
different posts how I would do that is
go into single dot PHP that's gonna be
each of the posts so let's jump in here
now you see here there's just some
information on this faucet now what I
want to do is I actually want to put
some information in regards to the
taxonomy name and ID and all that
underneath of here well how would I do
that well like I said jump into single
dot PHP and I'm gonna jump in here where
it says the content where it's pulling
this right here the content and I'm
gonna add some additional information
inside here so let's scroll this up the
top of this screen
let's go PHP and then let's close off
our PHP and I'm gonna say ntt and this
is how you're able to pull the value of
whatever the taxonomy is set up for
manufacturer for each post something
called entity manufacturer is equal to
get the term list that is the function
you use to get the taxonomy that is
assigned to this post you pass it the
post ID the current post that's on the
screen and then you get past it the name
for the manufacturer or the taxonomy
which is manufacturing and then you're
gonna put in here any title or whatever
you want to appear ahead of this guy and
then you just define and basically you
just you're gonna put quotes inside of
here every single time so you're
basically gonna always type in this
information it's right here and then if
we want to actually print manufacturer
off the screen well first we're gonna
want to check if there's an actual value
for manufacturer before we try to print
something that isn't there on the screen
and if there is a value we're gonna want
to go echo and TT manufacturer now let's
say we want to put a break statement in
here just to make sure that everything's
on a separate line and of course close
off that if statement and if I'll save
that you're now gonna see if I reload
this that manufacturer Zurn shows up
right there on the post just exactly
like that and then if you click on Zurn
it's a
I'm gonna show you all the others earn
products that are available now if I
want to do this for all the other tax on
amis that created it's real simple
instead of manufacturer here I'm gonna
put in item number and then down here
I'm gonna put in item number and of
course for the title I don't want it to
be manufacturer I want it to be item
number
then basically gonna do the same thing
here is it gonna be item type and then
this right here is gonna be item type
and this take wild guess item type so
now that's going to get those values if
they exist and if we want to print them
on screen real simple what do you think
we got to do we to come in here and
change couple of these guys so this is
gonna be item type yeah let's copy that
paste it in here and item number copy
paste file save and now you can see that
manufacturer item type and item number
all shown there on the screen this is
nice easy organized way this really aids
searching it's an organized way of
putting information together instead of
trying to hack something together and if
I wanted to actually come in here and
print some information in regards to a
custom field that is created what I mean
by custom field we jump in here we go
all posts and then we go to this Zurn
product here well you can see down here
in the custom field area inside of
WordPress way way way down here see
right here i defined price and then i
put a value in there and then i saved it
well if i want to display that on the
screen that's also very very easy to do
all we're gonna do i'm actually gonna
put this in a separate PHP code block
like this there's the faucet we were
changing before all right so if we want
to put custom posts on the screen well
I'm gonna call something NTT key and I'm
going to type inside here price because
that was the name for the custom field
ntt price meta and then if you want to
get the value of a custom field you go
get post meta and then you pass it
whatever the ID is for the current post
and then the key for a custom field and
then true and then what we're gonna do
we're gonna make sure there is a price
before we try to print it out to screen
just like we did before and we're gonna
put NTT Price meta in here right like
that
file save it and reload and now you can
see that price shows up inside of here
right like that but of course it doesn't
have price written there which we can
correct that in a second there file save
reload and now you can see that it shows
up properly so those are some really
cool things that you can do with
taxonomy z' as well as custom fields
inside of WordPress to really improve
your organization on your site leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
