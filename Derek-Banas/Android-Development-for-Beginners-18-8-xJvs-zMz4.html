18 of my android development for
beginners tutorial today we're gonna
cover something that I've gotten a ton
of requests on I'm gonna cover how to
text inside of App Inventor so basically
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make a
pretty simple but it's gonna cover
pretty much everything in regards to
short message service inside of App
Inventor and I'm also going to talk
about some of the things that don't work
and you should disregard so I think it's
best to just jump over and take a look
at what the app is gonna look like in
the end and of course all the blocks in
this tutorial are available in a link in
the description below so let's go take a
look at it okay well here's the finished
application you're gonna be able to set
the number you want to text with you're
gonna be able to enter in a message and
send of course you're also going to be
able to click in a check box and what's
gonna happen if that's checked is if
somebody sends you a text message it's
going to reply based off of whatever you
have written there and of course it's
also going to display the messages that
you send as well as the messages you
receive down below and I don't have
telephone numbers on here because I
don't want anybody to call me sorry
about that so let's make it so you saw
the application and here it is again I'm
not gonna go through how all of this
stuff's put together because I've
covered it so many times
basically it's very very simple I'm
gonna have a horizontal arrangement I'm
gonna throw a text box inside of it and
a button I'm going to have another text
box maybe it even makes more sense to
just come over here and take a look at
this basically you're gonna set your
number that you want to text to hit set
number you're gonna type in a message
hit Send if you are driving or don't
want to be bothered and you want a
message to immediately pop back to
anybody that sends you a text you just
check right here and then you type in
whatever that message is gonna be and
right here is where all your matches is
are going to be displayed so it does
pretty much everything however it's not
real busy because I want to keep
everything as simple as possible and
then the final thing is you're gonna
want to put the little texting component
and a notifier component inside of there
and texting is over here inside of
social this guy right here and I also
want to talk about these guys because
they don't always work and it's better
that you don't just get frustrated and
pull
air out over nothing contact picker
email picker and a phone number picker
normally don't work on every single
phone so if you're gonna make those just
understand you're probably gonna be
pulling your hair out over them because
they just they don't work very very well
texting however it does work pretty well
so I'm gonna jump in here and show you
exactly how to make this interface right
here work by jumping into the block
section so here we are in the block
section and I'm doing this completely
out of my head so what I'm gonna do is
just come through here and explain my
thought process as I'm going so let's
just think here variables that I am
going to need I'm probably going to need
the ability to store the number to text
so I'm just gonna create it I can always
go back if I decide that I don't want to
use that but for now I'm gonna use it so
I'm gonna put 0 in there as a default
value and there we go another variable
I'm probably going to use probably a
message probably gonna want to store the
message that I want to send maybe not
maybe I do I'm just gonna come in here
my message and I'm gonna come in here
and just put a default value of nothing
as well also come in here and duplicate
this something else that I might want to
store message received
ok so with these tutorials I try to do
things a little bit different each time
just so we can think our way through the
process and then finally I'm probably
gonna want to store the list of every
single message so in that situation I'm
gonna want to store those in a list so
I'm gonna call this message list and
since it is a list I'm going to come
over to the list section I'm gonna
create an empty list okay so those are
the variables at this point that I think
I need now let's think about what we're
gonna need to do well let's jump back
over into the designer now let's just
start here to talk I need something to
occur for them to be able to set the
number that they want to text with so
I'll jump back over into blocks and
let's think about that well I think
whenever the set phone number button is
clicked on let's come up here grab this
I'm gonna want to save a couple things
I'm also gonna want to check for a
couple things some of the things I want
to check for actually I think I want to
check to make sure that it is actually a
number and I also want to verify that it
isn't empty so how am I gonna one
two things so that means logic and I'm
going to need an and so drop that guy
right there and I'm also checking things
that means I need if-then-else drop that
right there drop in the and because I
want to check two different things not
just one and what do I want to check
well I want to check that they actually
entered a number so I'm come inside of
here
and if I scroll down down here you can
see is a number is something that I can
verify so let's take that drop it right
there and the thing that I want to
verify is the number that is in the
textbox so I'm just click on that and
then let's say I want to get the text
that's inside of there and drop it right
there so right there I'm verifying that
the number was that or a number was
actually entered and also just to be
safe I also want to check that it's not
empty so I'm gonna go into logic again
not because I can check if it is empty
but I can throw that on there to check
that it is not empty I'm in here is
empty right there come over here drop
that right there and actually once the
not in front of it can I put it there no
I can't
so let's check if drop it right there
there you go and then I just want to do
all these tests on the same thing and
there we go so I'm gonna be able to
check if it's a number and that it's not
empty
if it actually is a number which is
what's gonna happen if I get down into
the then part what do I want to do well
let's say that I want to store that in
number to text so let's get set drop
that right there and then let's get this
guy duplicate and there we go
and the actual app that you saw at the
very beginning in this tutorial I tape
it at the end after I've made this so if
that worked you know what I'm doing here
worked so I just wanted to let you know
also let's say that I want to notify
them of some different things probably
just going to give them a short alert
here so drop that right there and that
short alert in this situation is number
is set so I think that makes sense to
put that there
at least for now as I'm thinking I'm
want to also be able to handle if they
didn't enter a number if they started
putting letters or other crazy things
inside of there so I'm gonna get an else
drop that right there and in this
situation I want to give them more
serious notifier so let's say I want
show message dialog drop that right
there and in this situation I'm gonna
tell them exactly how I want the phone
number to be entered so let's say in the
message area I want to say enter a phone
number without dashes okay that might be
something wouldn't mess something up and
there we got we fixed that and in the
title section let's say I want to say
invalid phone number like that and then
the button text is just going to be okay
like normal all right there we go and I
think that that's gonna handle
everything that's gonna come up whenever
we're trying to set the number that we
want to start texting with and I can
move this up here if I think it looks
better okay now what I want to do let's
jump over into designer again just work
our way through the next thing that can
possibly happen here is they actually
send a text message so let's figure out
how we're going to solve that all right
they're gonna send it obviously when the
send button is clicked on let's just
come in here grab this drop it right
there so what are we gonna do well I
want to verify that the number to text
is not equal to zero and I also want to
verify that I actually have a message to
send and numbered text is right here so
this means I'm gonna do an if-then-else
again grab this drop it right there and
I'm gonna have multiple different things
occur here so I'm gonna go into logic
again I want to check two things so I'm
gonna get the and and drop it right
there and what did I say that I wanted I
want to verify that the number two text
which was right here is not equal to
zero so let's just go number two text
and let's get it drop it right there and
then I want to verify it's not equal to
zero let's go into math and do that get
this drop it right there and not equal
to and let's get this and let's say not
equal to zero this is zero there we go
and I also want to verify that they
actually gave me a message and that's
pretty much what this is gonna say so
let's just duplicate this grab this drop
it right here except I'm not checking
the phone number this time so let's
delete that and instead let's go and
find out what is actually in the message
text box so my message duck box and
let's just get the text directly out of
there zoom out
there is all right so that's verifying
that we actually have a real number to
text and that there is a message to send
so what are we gonna do if those things
are true well oh I think that we want to
go and set the number get the message
and send it there's not much else to do
there so we're gonna do all that in the
texting area so we're gonna say that we
want to set the number that we want to
text to so let's drop that right there
and while we're here let's just go and
get the message as well set the message
that we want and then let's also come in
here and send the message so there we go
got all those things all set up so we
have to get our number there's our
number two text let's duplicate that
drop it right there let's get our
message that we're gonna want to send
let's duplicate that and drop that right
over here and we're gonna send the
message also however remember we have
this guy message list here that's gonna
keep track of all of our messages so I'm
gonna want to save that so we need to
get this and then we need to go up here
to the list box and add items to list
okay let's get that drop that right
there whoops okay and this is gonna be
the list we're gonna add to and I want
to add a couple different things here so
that means I want to get text and join
there we go and let's say that I want to
add three things so get another string
drop that right there
let's get myself a little bit more space
feeling kind of cramped okay so what I
want to put here is let's just say it's
gonna be you like this drop that there
remember very often whenever you do this
it doesn't keep that space so there's
the space is now I then want to get the
message okay because this is gonna be
the message you're sending and then
let's say that I also want to put in a
new line afterwards to make sure that
everything's on its separate line when
it prints out on the screen
and there we go now what I want to do is
update the message box that's over here
so this guy right down here it's a label
no message is what the fault value is
and it's called
all messages label and let's say that I
want to actually do that
in a separate procedure but also just
thought of something in screen1 whenever
you are setting up everything you're
going to want to choose an option in
regards to how the app is going to work
when texts are going to be received
so let's initialize this get the screen
initialize jump back over into the
texting area and what you're going to do
here is you're going to need to go to
receiving enabled and set drop it and
you can actually put your mouse over
this and it'll tell you all kinds of
things basically there's two different
options well there's three options one
you put the value of one in here
messages aren't going to be received to
put two in there messages are going to
be received if your app is running you
put three in there message is going to
be received even if your app is running
in the background so let's just say I
want to put three in there okay so
there's three so that's one thing I
forgot no big deal that's solved alright
so this gets back to actually updating
the message area inside of our app I'm
gonna create a procedure for that there
you go get this robit right here and
let's call this procedure update message
label update because that's what it's
doing message label there we go and what
am I gonna want to do here well I'm
thinking that I want to the very first
thing I want to do is I want to make
sure that everything's zero it out of
this so I'm gonna go in here to set the
text and drop that right there and I'm
gonna give it no value there we go drop
that there and what I want to do well
I'm probably gonna want a temporary
holding area for our messages so let's
go and create a new variable and I'm
just gonna stick it right here and I'm
just gonna call this temp messages
because that's pretty much what it is
and give it a default value of nothing
as well cuz it's not gonna have any
messages in the beginning and I'm also
going to set this to nothing in the
beginning because it's not gonna have a
value whenever it starts either inside
of update message label cuz we're gonna
update everything now what I want to do
is I want to pull out item for item all
of these items that I added to our
global message list so I haven't used it
before I don't believe I have inside of
control you can actually come down here
and the for each block actually will
cycle through every single item in any
list and pop them out one by one and
whenever it gets the end of list it'll
quit for you so you don't have to worry
about things like is the list long
enough and things like that
like we have covered in the past so
let's duplicate this and just give it
the list that you want it to cycle
through and then I'm gonna store them
inside of this guy right here
so set drop that there and I'm gonna
need a join because I'm gonna have both
the messages that were in there before I
added a new item as well as the new item
that I'm adding okay whenever it first
hits it it's not gonna have anything
inside of there but we will soon change
that so get that and then let's get the
new item and that's right here yeah you
can change that name but items fine and
then after I have that all set I want to
set this guy right here - whatever temp
messages has outside of the for each
block so duplicate that whenever it gets
out of there everything's gonna be set
up properly and then I can just go to
get messages duplicate this and it does
sleep wha and there we go so that's
gonna work everything's all set up so
that's pretty cool so that's gonna get
us back to our send button so let's go
and move these out of the way cuz we
need a little bit more room here drop
that third term and update message
labels gonna handle all that for us so
let's go into procedures update message
label drop that right there there we go
and let's say that we also want to put
in a message if their number wasn't
entered or there wasn't a message so
let's come in here and do an else drag
that over there and let's just use a
notifier notifier it's gonna be pretty
simple I think so I'll just use show
alert drop that there and what I want to
put inside of this enter a valid number
something like that a valid number cuz
that's the most common thing and there
we go and that brings us to the only
other thing that can basically happen
let's jump over here into the designer
section here we are we need to handle
receiving messages and also are we going
to send back an immediate response to
any messages we receive whenever this is
checked so back over in blocks and let's
make that do this over here a little bit
in here there we go and let's get this
little guy there we go alright and
basically all of that is handled
automatically for us with the texting
component they have a little method
that's gonna be called message received
anytime a message is received so that's
gonna be useful and there's all kinds of
other useful things here so I'm gonna
want to do multiple things if multiple
different things happen so I'm gonna go
into control if then drop that right
there and what do I want to do well
basically if the busy checkbox is
checked well then I want to send an
immediate response back that basically
says I'm busy so where's that at
busy checkbox there it is and is it
checked I'm gonna find out track that
right there put it there and that's
gonna return if it's checked or not if
it is checked well I want to send a
message back to them so let's come in
here come down into the texting part and
I want to set the texting phone number
that I'm going to be sending my canned
response to and that's gonna be right
here where it says number so let's just
grab that drop it right there and then
the message that I want to send again
come in here and just set message pretty
easy drop that right there and the
message in this situation that I want to
send this is the message they sent to us
the message that I want to send is my
unbusy message so that's a busy text box
or what that's called I just want to get
the text out of there and there that is
here's a text box I get over here and
then what do I do
well I'm going to probably store
everything so I want to add all this all
these messages to my list so I'm gonna
go to lists again add items to list come
down here drop that right there and the
list that I'm gonna want to add things
to is gonna be the message list let's
just duplicate that bring that over here
I'm gonna zoom out and grab this put it
right here there is the list that I'm
gonna be working with and then the item
that I want to add to it is gonna be
multiple lines long and in this
situation it's gonna be me answering
them okay so I'm gonna come over here
and go into text and we'll get a join
drop that right there get myself some
more space zoom in and what am I gonna
say uh-hum well I think I need about
four lines so let's go in here
get myself two more streams and remember
this is gonna be displayed on my screen
and I'm just gonna say you which it
means that you know you or whoever sent
the message sent this meaning you if
you're using this app and there we go
and then let's say well actually you
know what I don't even need let's go and
get rid of one of these strings okay
track that I think three is enough now
that I'm thinking about it
all right all right what do I want to
put next oh I want to put the whatever
the text is in the busy text box which
is this guy
so let's duplicate that upper right
there and then just like before I want
to put a new line inside of there there
we go
and there we are and then of course I
want to update my message label so go
into here and update message label drag
it over here drop it right there
else if I do not have that checked what
am I gonna do well I first need to put
the else statement in here else drop it
right there I'm actually gonna do
something different here then you're
actually gonna say at the end of or
you're actually going to say at the
beginning of this video because I don't
want my telephone number to be flying
around the world that would not be good
so in this situation well I'm actually
gonna show you multiple different ways
to do this so basically I'm gonna get
another string drop it right here if you
want the person that sent the text to
show their telephone number right here
all you're gonna do is you're gonna get
the number up here you're gonna get this
right here get number and drop it right
there in the real world you're gonna
want this because you're gonna want to
see the phone number of the person that
actually sent you the message and then
of course drop this right here drop this
right here and then you're gonna want to
put a colon inside here well let's just
do it go on there we go and there we go
and let's put another space inside of
there so that's why it's gonna be like
in the real world I'm also going to
update my message and there we go
otherwise in this situation delete this
this is what you actually saw at the
beginning of the tutorial I'm gonna call
this caller and there we go
and that is everything that is the whole
entire app it's pretty simple I
simplified everything to make sure that
you'll be able to make
cops just like this and of course you
can download this app it's in the
description underneath this video and
like I said before all the blocks of
course are also available at that link
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
