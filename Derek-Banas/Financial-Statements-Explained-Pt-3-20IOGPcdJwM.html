3 of my financial statements tutorial if
you didn't watch part 1 and 2 the links
to them are at the top of the screen you
definitely want to do that you're
already you're not going to understand
anything I'm talking about today I'm
going to focus in totally on the
difference between a service based
business and a product based business
and how their financial statements
differ and I'm going to completely focus
in on the difference between accrual
method accounting and cash method
accounting so that concept is completely
understandable okay so you want to start
a franchise for your caricature drawing
business and you have three people lined
up and you're looking to take advantage
of the tax benefits found in the cash
method accounting approach you teach a
class for $500 per student there's no
inventory so that means you can use the
cash method accounting standard remember
you're not allowed to have inventory
with the cash method but you are with
accrual and the only difference between
the balance sheets and accrual and cash
method accounting is a lack of inventory
so I'm not going to really worry about
explaining that just if you're using
cash method eliminate the inventory part
of the balance sheet and you're set the
income statement however quite different
a service company's income statement
focuses on two things the cost of sales
meaning expenses directly related to the
services you sell and I'm going to give
examples here in a minute and it also
pays a lot of attention to other
expenses this would be all other sales
that are not directly related to the
service you specifically are selling
remember this is a service based
business we're talking about here your
specific costs of sales are going to be
your travel costs to the hotel the rent
for the conference room in which you're
teaching handouts
and paper and markers for demonstration
uses as well as practice remember not
going to be selling them as inventory
your expenses are going to be your loan
payment which we're going to talk about
in a second the interest on the loan
marketing that you're going to do and
general expenses such as off supplies
business cards etc other common expenses
are sales commissions for sales people
cleaning services research and
development taxes and any selling of
fixed assets so for example if you
purchased a desk and then decide to sell
it that is called a fixed asset it's not
considered in
in Turin and any selling of fixed assets
would show up in the general expense
area inside of your income statement
inside of cash method accounting okay so
first off to start the new franchise
you're going to get a loan you're going
to get a loan specifically for five
hundred dollars from a local consumer
loan company here are the terms pay back
the loan in three months pay interest of
nine point seven percent over the term
of the loan which is going to come out
to a total of three payments of one
hundred and ninety two dollars each
month one hundred seventy-five dollars
principal and seventeen dollars in
interest roughly and you can see here
your specific cost of sales it's going
to be a hundred fifty dollars for your
conference room twenty dollars for your
travel cost thirty dollars for your
handout to $100 for paper and markers
and then other random things and you
have your expenses meaning fifty dollars
for a newspaper ad $175 for the
principal on your loan as I talked about
on a previous slide seventeen dollars in
interest charges and one hundred for
general expenses remember business cards
office supplies things like that here
are the different balance sheets that
are created this is based off of the
accrual method and this is based off of
the cash method remember cash method
accounting you only count a transaction
if cash exchanged hands accrual method
you count any transactions no matter
whether these transactions were made for
credit or for cash as you can see here
two students paid for the class with
credit and that means that with the cash
method over here you're missing a
thousand dollars remember you use the
cash method to avoid paying more taxes
and I paid for the conference room
travel cost handouts and papers and
markers one hundred percent with cash
from the loan I got so you can see right
here these sides are going to be equal
and you can see here how we subtract out
these expenses from the total sales that
were counted to get a gross profit of
two hundred dollars and then whenever
you subtract out all the other expenses
which were also paid from cash from the
loan you see that I actually show a loss
of one hundred forty two dollars here
with the cash method which would mean a
tax refund over here using the accrual
method you will see a profit of eight
hundred fifty eight dollars you can see
there's a dramatic difference between
accrual method and cash method
accounting now of course you're pretty
much just pushing
these profits to a future date whenever
these this credits going to turn into
cash but either way it does provide you
with the ability to avoid taxes on the
short term and that's the reason why
people use cash method accounting the
only thing you're probably questioning
right now is exactly what is a cost of
sale or what is an expense what I can
just say to you is don't get hung up on
this the IRS specifically just once
you're reporting to stay consistent so
it once your cost of sales to always
remain costs of sales from each period
to the next and your expenses also so
move them around as you like whatever's
comfortable to you and then just leave
them that way but I want to expressively
tell you I am NOT an accountant I just
understand this because I used to be a
stockbroker and that's just me passing
on some additional knowledge in the next
tutorial I'm going to explain how
financial statements are affected by
inventory and purchasing a fixed assets
depreciation I'm going to get into cash
flow statements and pretty much wrap up
this whole entire financial statements
tutorial there's a link provided on this
