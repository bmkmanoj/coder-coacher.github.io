3 of my tutorial on how to make Android
apps today we're going to focus in on
list views image views list adapters
layout inflaters views view groups and
more and it will be a hundred percent
understandable if you haven't watched in
the previous tutorials I provide links
to them both here on this video as well
as in the description underneath this
video so I have a lot to do so let's get
into it okay so in this tutorial we're
actually going to make three different
list views of increasing complexity but
it's not that complex don't worry about
it this is actually the most complex one
we're going to make but you're going to
get pretty much everything out of this
all it is is it is going to be a image
view right here where the dot is that's
an image you can put anything you want
there and this is going to be a textview
but I thought it would make a lot of
sense to take a look at this list view
that we have here in detail okay so
what's going on on our screen here is we
have a linear layout that is surrounding
everything the entire list view then we
have the list view itself that can be
further broken down into a linear layout
inside of the list view so each item is
going to have a linear layout and then
inside of that linear layout we're going
to have a text view and then we're going
to have an image view but it's also
important to understand that these all
come from different super classes so our
linear layout is a view group what does
that mean it contains a bunch of views
what's a view you might ask well a text
view is a view that is basically
everything just like we say an animal is
a superclass for dogs cats cows pigs and
everything else
well a view is pretty much going to be
the superclass for every widget you
would put it on your screen also view
groups are as well and like I said the
only difference between a view and a
view group is a view group contains
multiple views and a view is just a
widget something we put on our screen
pretty simple now with list views what
we're going to do in this example is we
are going to take an array that's going
to be my favorite TV shows and we are
going to put it inside of this ListView
once again a linear layout surrounds the
entire list view and then we have our
list view how are we going to do that
well in the most complex example I'm
going to start off with a very simple
example
and ratchet it up in the most complex
example what we need to do is we need to
adapt our array into list view rows
that's what we got to do so what do we
need to do to do that well we need to
pass it a context what's a context it is
just the current state of our
application along with additional
resources that we may need to make our
app work properly so it's contextual it
is the current state of our app all that
data about what our app is and the
events and things that have occurred
prior to this arrayadapter being called
the array adapter does one thing
converts arrays into ListView items like
that so else we need to pass in well we
need to pass in our array of favorite TV
shows and we also need to tell it how do
we want each of these rows to be
structured well inside of XML we're
going to create a file called row layout
and we are going to say that we want
this to be structured so that we have a
linear layout and inside of that linear
layout we want a textview which is going
to be the television shows name and an
image view that precedes it that is it
that is the most complex ListView you
can pretty much create and why don't we
go in and start creating them okay so
here we are and I'm going to go into new
project this is Android studio once
again and I'm going to call this list
view example cuz that's what it is
everything else we're just gonna leave
it exactly the same come down here and
click on next but purely this blank
activity come down here and click on
next and then once again we're going to
have main activity be our main Java file
where all our code resides and activity
main is going to be our main layout file
I'm down here click on finish and
Android studio is gonna put all that
together for us ok so here we are inside
of activity main.xml and I'm just going
to start working with this first off
what we're going to do is we are going
to change this from a relative layout to
a linear layout don't worry we'll get to
relative layouts here soon enough and
there we go
I'll just type in linear and there we go
and remember anytime we go and switch
from relative to linear layout we're
going to have to add in orientation
there that is and for this one I'm going
to have it be vertical and that's pretty
much all we need to do with that now of
course we want to add in a list view
inside of this guy so I'm going to
create myself a list view and I'm going
to have it be matched parent because I
wanted to fill the screen and I'm also
going to want this to be matched parent
and that looks great
the only other additional thing I'm
going to want to do here is give this an
ID so I will be able to locate it and
use it with that it's a new ID here it
is full screen make sure you can see it
now I'm just going to call this the list
view of course you would normally give
it a better name than that and that's
all we're going to do and if we go over
here to our little telephone and enlarge
it you can see right there is our list
view okay and you can put sub items
regular items and so forth and so on now
we're going to jump into
mainactivity.java and start making
everything else work now the very first
thing I'm going to do here I'm going to
save from typing here I'm going to put
in an array of my favorite TV shows ever
this is just off the top of my head no
point in you watching that so this
string right here is going to be all the
data that I want to put inside of my
ListView like I said before we are going
to have to create a list adapter to be
able to adapt our array into something
that our ListView is going to be able to
work with it's basically just going to
generate for us all of our rows for our
ListView Raye adapter you're going to
have to say what type of data you're
putting inside of here I'm going to be
putting inside here strings then you
need to pass it the context once again
provides contextual information on
what's been going on with the app along
with different resources that would be
useful one of those resources would be a
generic layout row and the one that we
are going to use is Android dot r dot
layout we're going to create our own row
layouts here in a second but right now
we're just going to use a generic one
this is very common simple list item one
and no you don't need to memorize this
so that's what that is it's just a
generic layout that we're going to use
for each row in our list view and then
we're going to have to come down here
and we're going to have to tell it what
data we want to put inside of there and
favorite TV shows our array is going to
be the data that's it now we're going to
get the list view itself so we're going
to go list view and define it so we'll
be able to work with it I'm just going
to call it the list view again and
remember everything is a view whenever
we do find view by ID find view by ID
returns a view object that we then have
to convert into a list view and then of
course find view by ID and the ID that
we gave it is located at our dot ID the
list view and there that is so we're
pulling that over from the layout file
then we have to tell the ListView what
data that we want it to use and we say
set adapter and pass in the adapter that
we just created for ourselves and then
I'm going to provide for an option to
catch any clicks on our list view and
how I'm going to do that is I'm going to
go the list view dot set on item click
listener there that is and inside of it
type new adapter view might actually put
this on the next line yes you can't do
that I'm going to go on item click
listener again if I have my mouse inside
of their little pop-up is going to show
up here I can click on this and go
implement methods on item click adapter
view this is the guy that I want to
implement and I'm going to hit OK it
automatically puts in the on item click
method inside of there that I need to
implement for this guy and all I'm going
to do for it is create a string and call
it TV show picked and I'll explain
everything that's going on here
and I'm going to open up a toast believe
I said that before it's going to just
show them what TV show they clicked on
and of course you could do more than
this then I'm going to go to string dot
u of then I can go adapter view and get
the item that they actually select it
and everything is going to be set up
with indexes because it's in a rack get
item at position and then int I this guy
right here you might want to change this
to position now let's change it to
position just so it's a little bit
easier to understand what that is that's
the position inside of the array
and then down here we can go position
because it's going to create these rows
one at a time for us and then close that
off and now that I have my string that I
want to print out I can just go toast
dot make text there we go I have to pass
the activity the main activity that I'm
using right here and then I'm going to
put in the string that I want printed
out on the screen and then I'm going to
put in that I want this to show up for a
short period of time and then call show
to say hey please show this as soon as
possible and there that as that makes
the toast and that's all we're going to
do for that and everything set up right
just so have to save it and let's run it
on the emulator there you go after
waiting for some time see after this
down here changes that means the
emulator should work the emulator
sometimes doesn't load everything so
just understand if you go and do this
and drag this over here sometimes the
Apple will not load still let's hope it
does and there we go it load it up and
there is all the TV shows right there
okay so everything works and if we click
on one of them click on Twin Peaks you
can see down here little toast popped up
you selected Twin Peaks you selected
Breaking Bad da-da-da-da-da alright so
now let's go into actually creating our
own customized rows and how easy that is
alright so to create a customized row we
don't really need to change that much on
our screen for the adapter we're just
going to have to say hey we don't want
to use this guy right here we want to
use a customized row design so what does
that mean what that means we're gonna
have to create a customized row design
and we're going to create that in the
layout file that's where all your layout
files going to go so new and I'm just
gonna call this file and the file name
I'm gonna give it is row layout row
underscore layout you never want to have
spaces in these guys ok and there it is
now it's giving all kinds of errors
because there's nothing inside of there
I'm gonna save my selves a little bit of
time I'm just gonna copy all this stuff
go back into this switch into the text
tab right there and paste everything
inside I'm going to keep this as a
linear layout I'm going to get rid of
all the padding and all this stuff out
of here cuz I don't want that in there
I'm going to create a customized row and
you don't use a ListView you would
use a textview in this situation so
textview there we go
and I want this guy to wrap content so
wrap content wrap content and then also
I'm going to add to it an ID so ID there
we are there we are and then the name
I'm going to give it is just textview
one so there that is
now if I want to customize how
everything looks inside of here like for
example let's say I wanted customize
text size I just type in text size there
that is and the customized text size is
going to be 30 SP remember with fonts we
use SP and I can do all kinds of other
things I could do text style since it's
right there and make it bold and what
else do it let's say I want to put in
some padding there's padding there we go
and let's just say 15 DP just for the
heck of it and there we go I have a
customize row now this is what my rows
are going to look like so save that
don't have to do anything with activity
main.xml and go into mainactivity.java
now like I said before we used a default
sort of like template here that Android
provides for us well now we want to use
our customized row instead so to do that
we're just going to go r dot layout
because it resides in the layout folder
and then row layout is what we're going
to use because that's what we called our
file I'll save that and run the emulator
again I normally use a device it saves
you so much time it's more than worth it
because you get an Android device so
cheap nowadays but for you guys I'm just
going to show you the emulator then in
this guy I'm going to use Nexus 7 for my
emulator which I talked about in
previous tutorials definitely in the
Android studio tutorial how to set that
up and here you can see that it's pretty
much the same except now everything is
bold so now what we're going to do is
we're going to create a custom adapter
so how hard is that well the very first
thing we're going to have to do is I'm
going to put an imageview inside of this
guy so I'm going to go over into
drawable hdpi right here and I'm going
to load inside of here a little dot
probably the easiest thing to do is just
open up a folder then go to resources
and then drawable hdpi and then draw a
little circle somewhere using some sort
of tool and paste it in there and
get a ping file now if we jump back
inside here you can see dot ping is
right there so that is what we are going
to use to create our little image view
our little dot now what we need to do is
we need to create a new layout we're
going to create a row layout - we're
going to create a customized row layout
and a customized adapter it's a new file
and then this guy is going to be called
row underscore layout - dot XML you can
put an underscore inside there if you
want to and hit OK and then this is
going to open up I'm just going to use
the row layout that I have right here
select all coffee jump back over into
this guy click on the text tab right
there and then paste everything inside
of there then we're just going to change
couple different things still going to
be a linear layout just like before in
this situation however I want everything
to be horizontal because I have an image
view followed by a text view so I want
them to be side-by-side and I'm going to
create my image view right here and
that's going to hold my little dot image
view and I'm going to have its width be
specific so I'm going to say 25 DP and
then I'm also going to have its height
be specific which is going to be 25 DP
let's say also that I want to put a
margin on it remember it's layout
underscore margin and we could do a
margin left that's right there and let's
say it's 10 DP and then I can do a
layout margin again and this time I'm
going to do a margin top since it's
right there and 25 DP and then I'm going
to referee I'm going to show you how to
both change this image inside of here
and also how to load an image inside of
here I know that's kind of productive
but if we - well let's just say pin
source like this and the image is going
to be in your drawable folder so at
drawable like that and then the name of
it is dot and you can see that it found
it so that's how you would do that put
an image view and also put a specific
image and like I said later on I'm going
to show you how to change that and then
for the text views or anything that I
want to change here not really I'm just
going to leave it to say okay so that's
your brand new layout you're creating
and now what we're going to do is we're
going to create ourselves a customized
adapter and we're going to do
that inside of our Java folder so Java
and right inside of this guy so I'm
going to say file new I'm just going to
say file and I'm going to call this my
adapter dot Java and let's make it a
class and call it my adapter and then
you're going to have to extend array
adapter which is what we have been using
over and over again we're just going to
use it as a starting point and it's
going to have strings inside of it just
like previously and it's going to give
me a little question mark here create
constructor matching super ok let's just
hit that and again there's the context
you know what that is in this situation
we're going to be using string a string
array because you know that string array
because we've been using string arrays
and we're going to call it values and
then we just want to change this to
values just so this is a little bit
easier to understand and then we're also
going to tell it what's specific layout
to use which is the new layout that we
just created row layout and we want the
second one so there it is calm in there
and everything's ready to go select this
little warning we got here
set the package name to calm new think
tank that it's going to be different for
you but that's just the package
information as you can see right there
and it automatically imported all this
stuff for me which is great then we're
gonna have to override the get view
method for our array adapter and to do
that just put a mouse right here and
inside of Android studio you can just
hold down control o if you're using
eclipse you're going to have to type
this in and we specifically want get
view this guy right there it's going to
throw that in there for us again
positions position in the array convert
view if you want to know is a reference
to a previous view that is available for
reuse it's Android's all about saving
resources and view group here is going
to represent invisible containers that
are going to hold a whole bunch of
different views like we've talked about
before we're going to get rid of this
return and we're going to have to create
what's called a layout inflator and a
layout inflator is just going to put our
layout into the right view for us pretty
simple I'm going to call this the
inflator
and to get it just go layout inflator
from and then you're going to call get
context and you know what a context is
and then we're going to actually create
our view and you know what a view is and
we're going to call inflate on this guy
and then we need to pass it the very
specific XML file that we want to use
for this and that's just layout dot Rho
layout - we just created that and we're
also going to have to pass it a parent
if we want to inflate it into a parent
in this situation we don't and because
we don't we're going to put false inside
of there so this is just basically just
going to be ignored because we have
false there if you want to inflate it
into something well then you would put
true there and actually have something
to inflate it into but we're not going
to worry about that right now then we
need to retrieve our text specifically
for one show we're creating one row at a
time here like I said before and to get
that item we go get item and position
which is what we want just the index for
that array then we want to get the
textview that we want to edit the text
view created this in row layout to
remember everything comes over as a view
so we have to cast it to a text view and
to get it we go the view dot find view
by ID right like this and the ID for
this guy is r dot ID dot text view one
because that's what we named it over in
our layout let's look at that again we
go down here this is where we got it
from and this is in row layout - okay
this guy right there so that's where
that name came from back over and our
adapter we got our textview for us now
we just have to put the TV show into the
text view the text view and set text and
the text we want to put in it is TV show
now we want to get the image view in our
layout as well if we wanted to change
that I'm going to show you how to change
it and I'm just going to make it the
same thing that it was before you of
course could change it to whatever the
image view is equal to we have to cast
it into an image view and call the view
find view by ID and the image view
specific ID is going to be our ID of
course and then followed by image view
one and just type in an image
that I write there what we called it
right oh I forgot to give it an ID no
big deal come in here ID fine fine
image view one there you get to see it
from multiple different angles so come
back over into this again image view one
pops up drop that they're put semicolon
now we got the image view if we wanted
to change the image view we just go the
image view and set image resource and to
get the resource from the drawable
folder drawable and the name of it is
dot and there we go and then finally
after we did all of that stuff we need
to go return view because it must be
returned or the view there it is and
there we go our customized adapter is
finished and of course all this code is
available on in the description now
we're going to go over in main activity
and make it work and how hard is that
going to be well we're basically just
going to change this guy here again the
adapter and instead of saying new array
adapter we're going to say new my
adapter there that is and in this
situation we are going to pass over this
just like before and TV shows but we're
not going to pass anything else inside
of that and if we jump back over into my
adapter you can see it wants the context
and it wants the stringer rack that's
all at once a little bug popped up here
make sure you spell inflator
right for some reason I spell it wrong
all the time error went away back over
in the main activity do we need to do
anything else even though we have this
customized adapter no so let's execute
it and there as you can see are all of
our TV shows as well as our image view
so we covered a ton there about list
views and emulators and ad and adapters
and everything else please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
