4 of my get video tutorial today I'm
going to answer a whole bunch of
questions that I have received most
specifically I'm going to cover and
demonstrate a workflow option called
fork and pull I'm also going to cover
how to use multiple github accounts on
the same computer and I'm also going to
cover SSH keys and a whole bunch of
other different things if you haven't
seen any other videos you pretty much
should watch them I provide a link to
them in the description underneath of
the video and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay so the very first
thing we're going to do here is cover
how to generate SSH keys basically you
see the command right here in front of
you just going to type in SSH - key gen
- TRS a - uppercase C and then you're
going to put in your email address now
the reason why you're going to want to
use these is SSH keys are going to allow
you to identify trusted computers
without the need of passwords and such
and I'm also going to show you how to
generate multiple versions of these keys
so you can have multiple different
accounts all on one computer then what
you're going to want to do is define
exactly what you want the name of this
to be and I just typed in Derrick baños
because each of these SSH keys are going
to have a name associated with them
after you do that you're going to enter
in a pass phrase and then you're going
to have a public key that's going to be
generated as well as what we're calling
a random art image and it's just a bunch
of squiggles whatever you type this in
you'll see it basically the reason why
we have the random art image is because
it's a lot easier to recognize and
validate by eye then a whole bunch of
just random digits after we do that
we're going to type in change directory
tilde forward slash dot SSH and this is
going to be where all of our SSH keys
are going to be stored and you can see
right there stearic baños and then here
is the public key right next to it now
what I'm going to do is open up my
public key inside of them and I just
decided to black out everything here
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take this private key that I have inside
of them and I'm just going to copy it
and you're going to want to copy every
thing from right here where it says SSH
- RSA the whole way down to your email
address and then next I'm going to go
over to github and sign in now we're
going to go up here inside of github and
specifically account settings and click
on that and then over on the Left
sidebar we're going to click on SSH keys
and of course this is going to be the
key that you want to associate
specifically with this account on github
then you're going to come over here and
click on add SSH key this guy right here
then you're going to want to type in a
title for this key and then the key
itself and as you can see I have SSH the
whole way through the email address just
so you know exactly what you want to put
inside of there and then after you type
in that key and we're copy and pasted in
there anyway you're going to click on
add key and then this window is going to
pop up and you're going to know that it
has been stored inside of github and now
what I'm going to do is go over
specifically how to generate multiple
github accounts and to do that basically
what we're going to do is just use
different SSH keys so in this situation
previously I had my Dirk baños at raw
as an email address
this time I'm going to throw in my gmail
address and again it's the same exact
command ssh-keygen HT or si si and then
whatever email address you want to
associate with over in github just like
before we're going to come over here and
give it a name this one I'm going to
call new think tank and there you can
say it again a public key is going to be
generated as well as random art image
which you're going to see right here
once again you're going to go into
change directory tilde forward slash dot
SSH this is the location for all your
SSH keys and you're going to be able to
see over here new think tank new think
tank there you go now we're going to go
back over into github except this time
I'm going to be in a completely
different github account and I'm going
to click on account settings again then
over inside of my terminal I'm going to
open up the public key using vim again
I'm going to come in here copy the
entire key again from SSH the whole way
to the end of the email and again give
it a title and then copy and paste the
key inside of here and then click on add
key ok so we use different unique names
for these two different keys and we use
names that made sense now what we need
to do is to tell SSH
about these unique keys that we just
created and to do that you're just going
to type in SSH - add tilde forward slash
SSH forward slash and then you're going
to type in your different unique names
and they're exactly the same ones I just
used it's Derrick baños a new
think-tank and now what we need to do is
come in here and create a configuration
file that we are going to use to
associate different hosts with different
unique keys so to simply create a file
inside of your terminal you're going to
type in touch tilde forward slash dot
SSH forward slash can fig and then
inside of them we're going to open up a
config file then inside of this config
file we are going to define two
different types of hosts normally what
you do and by hostess is just going to
reference a specific host using a
specific SSH key so again you see the
Darracq balance and the think-tank we
just saw those and that's going to
identify that specific SSH key that we
want to use and that is basically how
we're going to identify ourselves you
can see right here we're using github
for both of these because we're using
github but however whenever we want to
log in as a new think-tank on github
we're going to use this abbreviation and
whenever we want to log in using our
main account we're going to type in
github.com of course you could change
these and use numerous you could have I
don't know ten or fifteen or twenty of
these different accounts going through
exactly the same process I just showed
you right here and for this tutorial I
decided use my crazy tip calc again this
is just to do something so I'm just
going to change over to that directory
and you can see here I'm going to list
out all the different files then over
inside of github you can see crazy tip
calc it's right here and you can also
see if you go into github with this
account it's going to give you a brief
explanation of how to stage your
directories and how to commit them say
all this stuff right here but I'm just
going to cover that here real quick so
what I'm going to do is I'm gonna go
inside of them and I'm just going to
open up my Android manifest file just
for a file to come in here and mess
around with just like before I'm just
going to type in a random comment now
I'm going to save that and then of
course I'm going to stage the entire
directory with all the changes and then
I'm also going to commit it with a dash
M and just type in initial commit now
what I'm going to do is create an alias
called my origin and as you
see right here github - NTT you know by
looking at this real quickly because my
default is github.com in this situation
I'm using my new think tank account on
github and then I just have to come in
here and type in a colon and then new
think tank forward slash crazy tip calc
get and you can see that over here then
if I want to push all my changes over
I'm just going to type in git push my
origin master and the very first time
you do this it's going to say that host
github can't be established basically
what it's saying is it's not aware of it
what it's going to do however is it's
going to show you the public key for
getup which you can see right here then
if you go to this directory right here
help github comm articles blah blah blah
blah blah you're going to be able to see
get hubs public key and it's right here
so if we just look 1627 AC blah blah
blah jump back over into here 16:27 AC
there you can see and you can trust that
this is github so we're just going to
type in yes then you're going to see
right here that it is listed out that we
are permanently going to add github comm
so you do not see that warning every
single time you do this and if I go to
my new think tank account on github and
open up crazy tip calc you're going to
say that all of the files are here now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
my regular old Verizon account to log
into github after I log into github I'm
going to click on Explorer right here
and I'm going to look up that repository
that I just uploaded I'm just going to
type in new think tank forward slash
crazy tip calc which is the location for
the file and I can see that here it is
indeed now there's a couple different
things I can do first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to clone this repository
so I'm going to come over here and just
click on this little check board right
here then inside my terminal I'm going
to change to whatever directory I want
to save this clone to and I'm just going
to type in git clone and I'm going to
paste in the location that I have right
here and it's going to clone or copy all
of the files that are currently on my
new think tank account over here into
this directory right here and there you
can see if I type in change directory to
that location LS that they're all the
files
okay so now I'm going to cover the fork
and pull workflow now the way the fork
and pole works is that anyone can fork a
repository and then make changes locally
however thankfully they don't have the
ability to push potentially damaging
code back up in the repository they can
however request that the hosts of the
repository the owner of the repository
pull their changes after they make them
by making what is called a pull request
and the reason I decided to cover this
is it's a very common workflow in the
open-source community which everyone
seems to be very into so just like
before I went in here and I found crazy
tip calc which is a repository I want to
work with and if I want to fork it just
come over here and click on Fork
whenever you do the directory is going
to open up and show you all the files
you go out right here you're going to
want to come over here and copy this
directory right here again by clicking
on the clipboard right there then I'm
going to change to a directory called
git clones and if I click on LS it's not
going to show me anything and then to
clone that fork I'm just going to go get
clone HTTP GET up and there is the
location for it and you can see in this
situation it says Derrick baños which
is my version instead of new think tank
which was the original holder of that
repository it's going to clone
everything and then on my Derrick baños
account which is the account that forked
that you can see right here it says
forked from and it shows where it forked
from you're going to see all the
directories and all the files there then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
jump over in my terminal and type in git
remote add upstream and then I'm going
to refer to this repository as you can
see right there and basically what this
is going to do is it's going to assign
the original remote and not the fork to
the keyword upstream now what I can do
is just go get fetch upstream and it's
going to pull in changes made in the
original repository without affecting
any of my local files and you can see
all the files right there now let's say
I want to go into them and change the
Android manifest file again I can do
that I'm just going to come in here and
I'm going to put three inside of here
instead of random comment like it was
before I'm of course going to be able to
stage this new file and then all
so commit it and I'm then going to be
able to push it push my fork on to get
up and I'll just do that by going get
push origin master that if I jump over
in to get up and click on
androidmanifest
it's going to show random comment 3
right there but this is the fork say
initial fork this isn't the main
repository that I forked from another
thing I could do is commit here and type
and this is in the terminal again is
just type in get merged upstream forward
slash master and what that's going to do
is merge files on github with all of my
local files now in the situation in
which I think my files should actually
be merged with the original repository I
can make what is called a pull request
and all I need to do is just go into my
version of crazy tip calc this is the
forked and then come down here where it
says compare review create a pull
request the important part here is that
create a pull request because that's
what we're going to do and whenever you
click on that you're going to see all
the changes that are listed out here and
down here as well as other data that has
been associated with this fork version
like the number of commits and/or the
files changed or the comments or how
many contributors are involved in this
and then if you click on create pull
request what you should do is leave a
really detailed reason why the pull
request should be accepted and then come
over here and click send pull request
right here and then you can see exactly
what was sent over to the owner of the
original repository and you can check
back here to see if your pull request
was accepted now we are back to new
think tank this is the owner of the
original repository if they want to see
the pull requests they have they are
listed right here they can just click on
pull requests and whatever they do
they're going to see a list of all of
their pull requests it would normally be
a lot more than this but I'm just doing
this for demonstration purposes and if
they want to see exactly some more
information about this requesting just
click on it then you're going to see the
comment they're going to see a little
bit more information on your specific
changes you can see the commits and
files that have been changed if you
click on files change you're going to
see specifically what was changed in
comparison to the files on the
Forked version this repository adversity
original you can see right there the
only thing has changed is the number
three is right there with the comma and
if they decide to submit to the pull
request all they need to do is click on
merge pull request and all this
information is going to pop up here on
screen about how to do certain things in
a terminal but I think most people just
come in here and click on merge pull
request and then you can leave a comment
if you'd like in regards to why you
accepted this pull request so I think I
answered most of the questions that I've
received on git so far if I didn't
please feel free to leave additional
questions below up next what I'm going
to do is go back into App Inventor
finish off that tutorial and then I'm
going to start a brand new Android Java
Eclipse what have you tutorial that is
going to be completely different and
hopefully even better than my last one
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
