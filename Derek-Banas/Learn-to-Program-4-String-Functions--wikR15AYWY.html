4 of my learn to program tutorial in
this part of the tutorial we're going to
focus in on even more string functions
and how they can be used to solve very
very complex problems if you haven't
watched any of the previous parts of
this tutorial you definitely should not
provide a link to those in the
description as well as on this video and
also in the description there is a
transcript as well as all the code used
in this tutorial and I have a lot to do
so let's get into it okay so a whole
bunch of you guys asked me to use a dark
sort of theme in this tutorial because
it would be easier to see please tell me
in the comments if this looks better and
if I should switch back to white or what
I should do because I do everything you
guys tell me to do so what I'm going to
do here first is I am going to create a
string and on purpose I'm going to throw
some white space in front of it
Britten's string like this and then I'm
going to have a whole bunch of functions
do things to this string so I'm going to
say random string is equal to random
string and then if I want to get rid of
that extra whitespace on the Left I just
type in L strip exactly like that
and that'll be gone and likewise I can
get rid of the white space on the right
side by just putting our strip inside of
there like that or I could just put
strip inside of there and it would get
rid of all of the white space on the
left and the right
stripping whitespace is very important
then as you program further you will
learn that it is important and you'll
use it all the time
another thing that we can do with string
functions is capitalize the first letter
and I can come in here and just do a
print with random string and then follow
that up with capitalized and that's
exactly what that will do for me and you
can go and run this and you can see
right there that it capitalized that
even though this was lowercase over here
we're also going to be able to come in
here and make a string uppercase and
that is very useful and you're actually
going to see an example of how that is
useful in this tutorial we can also come
in
and set it to lowercase and an example
of how this would be useful is if you
don't want to worry about converting
from lowercase to uppercase and so forth
and so on whenever you're comparing
strings like I said that's very useful
and you'll see an example of that you
can also see on the right side of the
screen how this is capitalizing this is
lowercase and oh by the way if you're
wondering how I went and moved the code
from the bottom over to the right I just
right clicked on it right here and then
I went down here to move to and then I
changed it to right from the bottom
rights not on there obviously because
it's on the right another thing we can
do is turn a list into a string and
separate the items with a defined
separator so I could come in on next
part or I'll get more specifically into
lists but basically it is just a whole
bunch of pieces of data that are going
to be indexed sort of like we do with
strings so we could say something like
bunch of random words and then to
convert those into a string we could
just come in and say print and then you
would have how you want these things to
be separated so I'm going to say I want
all of these items in the list to be
separated with a space and then follow
that up with join and then inside here
you are going to pass in the list and if
we run that you can see a bunch of words
prints out lips I spelled words wrong
and you can see exactly how that works
likewise we're going to be able to
easily convert a string into a list so
let's come in here and we'll go a list
to is equal to and I'll go and do my
random string again and if I want to
split those up that's exactly how that's
done and then of course I could come in
here and cycle through all these items
in my new list and we'll just do a list
two for this and then we can print out
all those different items you can see
exactly how that worked over there
another thing we could do is count how
many times a string occurs in a string
so let's just go call print for this and
I could say something like how many is
is are there in this strings the
and then we can call random string and
count and then specifically what we are
looking for so if this is the guy it's
going to count this as it is and this as
an is both of those as is us you can see
we get two back from that result or for
that query or whatever you want to refer
to it as we can also get the index of a
matching string so we could say
something like where is string and then
call our random string again and we
would then follow or use find and then
specifically what we are looking for you
can see it starts at index 21 it's only
going to return the very first string
that we're searching for inside of there
and the index for that very first string
and we could also come in here and
replace a substring with a substring and
how we would do that is go random string
again and then we're going to call
replace and then let's say for example
when I want to replace is an and I went
and through a space inside of there with
a kind of like that with a space inside
of it and then you can see right there
it comes back this is a kind of
important string instead of printing in
just simply this is an important string
so there's a whole bunch of new
functions that we're going to be able to
play around with and now I'm going to
jump into our first problem okay so what
I want to do now is create an acronym
generator and by acronym I mean if you
would type in something like random
access a memory that would be an acronym
form Ram so that's what I want you to
make so what we're going to do is allow
the user to enter a string and then
using these new functions we learned
about I want you to convert that string
or that grouping of words into an
acronym and I want you to also convert
those to uppercase letters exactly like
I did here with RAM and that should be
enough information but if you want to
hint in regards to the structure of this
we're going to do something like ask for
a string and then the next thing we're
going to do is convert
the string to uppercase next thing that
we're going to want to do is convert the
string into a list we then want to cycle
through the list and then inside of that
as we're cycling through we want to get
the first letter of the word and
eliminate the newline whenever we print
out to screen so see if you remember how
to do that with the print function and
then the final thing that we want to do
is to add a new line and see if you
remember how to do that from previous
parts to do tutorials so pause the video
and figure that out and then come back
and see if you got it right
alright so asking for the string what
I'm going to do here is I'm just going
to go original string is equal to and
we'll do input of course and I'll say
something like convert to acronym then
we need to convert that to uppercase and
you saw exactly how to do that before I
do original string and then we're going
to call the upper method in or monk ssin
anytime I say method just you can think
of that as function or function is
method whatever then I want to convert
the string into a list so I'm going to
call this list of words but when I
spelling words wrong today list of words
and I'll call regional string again and
then we can call split on it
and it's going to split everywhere there
is a space in the string that we are
working with and if we want to cycle
through our list it's a forward in list
of words we want to get the first letter
of the word and then print it out the
screen while eliminating the newline so
you can just call print on that get the
very first item inside of there that's a
zero index and then if we don't want a
newline to show up we just type in and
and then put nothing inside of there and
then of course to add in our new line we
just call print again and if we run that
whoops indentation err on original
string
all where's that at I wasn't that silly
was going and putting an indentation
here for some weird reason let's get rid
of that let's get rid of that let's just
give her the whole thing tab that in and
then this one is perfectly fine and it
says convert to acronym and I can type
in random access memory and hit R and
you can see that Ram comes back right
like that so hopefully you got that
right now if not that's not anything to
worry about now I'm going to jump over
and cover some more string functions and
then do a really complicated example or
problem that you guys can solve to learn
more about problem solving and getting
better at programming okay so for our
next problem some additional methods are
going to be very useful so let's first
off start off here by creating some
strings so I'm going to have letter Z is
going to be equal to just a character Z
and then I'm going to go number three is
going to be equal to and then I'm going
to put a three inside of there and also
space and then inside of here I am going
to put just one space now what we're
going to be able to do here is call
different functions that are going to
tell us the type of data that we have
inside of our string so for example we
can go and find out if the string letter
Z is going to contain characters and
letters so we can easily call function
to find out if the letter Z string up
here contains only characters and
numbers or letters and numbers so we
could say something like is Z a letter
or number and then get a result from
that by just taking the letter Z and
calling is all numb and let's go and
copy this because we're going to use a
similar format a whole bunch different
times we're also going to be able to
find out if it is only a letter which
means it's going to come back as false
if it contains numbers or spaces or any
other different symbol and how you do
this is by calling is alpha we could
also check if a
a series of characters in a string
contain only numbers however this isn't
going to work for floats if you put a
period inside of there that is going to
come back as false I'll correct that and
show you how to create a is float here
in a second so we could say something
like is 3 a number and here we can just
put the number e inside of there and
then we can come in here and change this
to digit we could also come in and check
if lowercase or uppercase are being used
and that's going to be used in our last
part of our tutorial here big giant
problem that's coming up so is Z a
lowercase and find that out is all we
have to do is go is lower and then we
can also come in and check if it's
uppercase and here we'll just say is
upper and then finally we could also
come in and check is space a space this
is going to work for any type of
whitespace and we'll just throw a space
inside of there and then just change
this to space exactly like that and if
we run those you'll see is the a letter
or a number comes back it's true is Z a
letter comes back it's true is 3 a
number comes back is true is the
lowercase true uppercase false and it's
space of space comes back as true like I
said if you would come in here and let's
just change this from number 3 to 3.14
and we'll run that now you might look at
that and say well that's definitely a
number now you can see here it comes
back it's false so how could we come in
here and actually create a is float
function for example so we can check to
see if something indeed is a float we
can do that no problem and here I'm
going to create our very first function
I'll get more into lists and functions
in the next part of the tutorial but I
think you're definitely going to be able
to understand this now a function is
just going to allow us to avoid writing
repeated code and it's also going to
allow us for structuring our programs so
that it is very easy to start referring
to blocks of code with a name versus
blocks of code with just a great big
giant long lists of code so it makes it
easier to understand our code
and also avoids repeating code and
whenever you create a function you're
going to start off by typing in de F and
then you're going to type in whatever
your functions name is going to be and
then if your function receives any
attributes or values that are passed
into it you're going to put those inside
of there and let's say that you have
another one you're just going to
separate that with a comma or something
else okay but we're just going to keep
it simple it's just going to return or
it's going to receive one string that's
what our function does then if you want
to check if a value is going to be a
float or not one thing we could do is
use exception handling so we can come in
here and we could say something like try
to convert the string that was passed
into this function into a float now if
it can do that we can return true
knowing that indeed this string value
was a float just like this one right
here is if however we have an exception
occurred well in that situation we know
that we have a value error meaning that
this cannot be converted into a float
and in that situation we will return
false and you won't have to do anything
in regards to changing anything else
here and you can also see here how our
functions are able to return values
directly to whoever called those
different functions inside of our code
and then if we want to call our function
in this situation we can just say print
is PI a float and then we could call for
our function to execute this by going is
float and then passing in num and if we
run it you can see is PI a float comes
back as true so there is a way for us to
check if a string value is indeed a
float and how to solve that little
problem we had right there alright so
now it's time for our final problem and
this one's going to be a little bit more
complicated what I want you to do is
implement what is known as Caesar's
cipher inside of a program and the way
Caesar cipher works is you're going to
pass
a message that you want to be encrypted
and how we're going to encrypt
characters is by shifting them a certain
amount so for example if we were going
to shift the a3 spaces all the A's would
become DS likewise if we were going to
shift the B in that situation the same
three spaces all the B's would become
E's and remember from previous parts of
the tutorial that A through Z using
unicode's are going to be represented
with the numbers 65 through 90 inside of
unicode and lowercase A through Z are
going to be represented with the numbers
97 through 122 also if you don't
remember you're going to be able to get
the Unicode for a character just by
typing in Ord followed by whatever your
letter is likewise you're going to be
able to convert a Unicode into a
character by calling CHR and then
whatever your code is or your Unicode is
some rules for creating this is that you
should check if a character is a letter
and if not just leave it as default so
if it's a space do not change it in any
way or try to shift it into a letter
just leave it as a space likewise for
any other different symbols and you have
the functions here available to you that
are going to allow you to be able to
check what all the different characters
are and if you think you're up for it
you can jump in pause the video and
create it otherwise I will provide a
couple more hints so here's a couple
more hints here if you want to make sure
that you have the best chance of getting
this right your whenever you're creating
this program you're going to want to use
is upper to decide which unicode's to
work with because this is going to work
with upper case as well as lower case
letters also you're going to want to add
the key which is going to be the number
of characters to shift so you're going
to want to ask the user for the number
of characters you should shift and if
the key is bigger or smaller than the
Unicode for the different letters a Z
lowercase a or lowercase Z you're going
to want to increase or decrease by 26 to
stay within the range that we're
defining up here with the uppercase
letters here and the lowercase and I
think that's probably enough in regards
to hints to help you along so once again
you can pause the video try to write the
program or I can provide you with even
more hints just to make sure that you
can do this another set of hints here is
I'm basically just going to walk you
through the program and exactly how I
would create it in text form so what
we're going to do first is we're going
to receive the message to encrypt and
the number of characters to shift and
that's going to represent the key for us
you're then going to need a place to
store the secret message so we'll just
say prepare the secret let's just call
it secret message next thing is you're
going to want to cycle through each
character in the message it's cycling of
course means you're going to use some
sort of looping function either a for
loop or a while loop
more than likely a for loop you're then
like I said in the hint check to see if
it's a letter or not so if it isn't a
letter then keep it as it is you're then
going to get the character code and add
the shift amount for the key then if
uppercase then compare to uppercase
unicode's then if bigger then Z you're
going to want to subtract 26 from that
likewise if smaller than a add 26 and
that's just because there's 26 letters
likewise you're going to come in here
else if it is an uppercase you're going
to do something very similar so we'll
say do
oh the same for lower case and then
after you have that all set up you're
going to need to convert from code to
letter and then add to your final secret
message and then you come to a situation
in which this isn't a letter and you
want to be able to handle that so we'll
say something like if not a letter leave
the character as is and then you're
going to want to print out your message
to the screen then I could actually
because what I did right here to convert
it into the secret message I am going to
do the absolute opposite to convert it
back to the original message what I
should do is create a function but
because we haven't dwelled that much on
functions I'm not going to do that right
now so it basically means I'm going to
give you a prime example why functions
are useful by forcing myself to type in
the same code multiple different times
and as extra homework after you finish
this part using exactly what we have
here jump in there and try to figure out
how to streamline your code based off of
what you do know about writing functions
inside of Python but before we get to
that to decrypt the only thing that
changes is the sign of the key so you're
just going to use the opposite of the
key that you used for encrypting to
decrypt and then like I said everything
else that follows the same as above so
you can once again pause your video to
see if you can write this code out based
off of the hints that I just provided
you otherwise I'm going to come in here
and actually just start writing some
code alright so the very first thing
we're going to do is get the message
from the user and I'm sure at this point
you know how to do that quite easily
just ask the user for a message that
they want to encrypt then you're going
to have your key we're going to convert
that into an integer and of course call
for input on that and then we'll say
something like how many characters
should we shift and it's very important
that they don't do any more than 26
because that's all we have to work with
so ones
1 through 26 inside of there okay so we
have our message and the number of
characters we want on a shift we want to
prepare our secret message and we'll
just type in secret message and have
that contained nothing that we will add
to as we create the rest of the program
we're then going to cycle through each
character in our message so we'll just
go for character in the message that
they passed inside of it then we want to
check if it's a letter or not and we can
do that with if character and then call
is alpha and that like I said previously
is going to allow us to work with it if
it's character and if it is not a
character then we're just going to use
whatever it was previously tab inside of
here
then we're going to get the character
code and add our shift amount to it so
to get our character code we just go
home o Rd on the character to convert it
into a character code and then we're
going to add our shift amount to it so
there that works now if we are working
with an uppercase we want to come in
here and check if it's uppercase so if
character is upper I told you those
functions are very useful well then we
want to check if it is bigger than 26
since we added the key amount on to it
or is bigger than uppercase Z or the
character code for uppercase Z and to do
that we'll just go if character code is
figure than Ord and then throw the
capital Z inside of there well since we
already added the key to it we can just
jump in there and subtract the character
code by 26 to throw it back into the
space where it's supposed to be
otherwise if it is smaller we can just
copy this guy right here
throw that inside of there make sure you
keep all your whitespace exactly right
and here what we're going to do is we're
going to say less than and then we'll
change this to an uppercase a and then
in that situation we have to add 26 to
that and then you're basically going to
do exactly the same thing
you're dealing with lowercase letters so
we'll come down here make sure that this
F here is going to line up with this
else that we have here and that will tab
in and then what we're going to do is
we're just going to copy this and paste
that inside of there and then we'll copy
this guy right here and we will paste
that inside of there like I said make
sure the whitespace lines up then all we
need to do is change this to a lowercase
Z like that and change this to a
lowercase a like that well now that we
have those letters all set up for
ourselves we're going to be able to add
these to our secret message make sure
you tab in here to where the else is and
we will call secret message and then add
in the new converted character that
we're dealing with and we're going to
have to convert it back into a character
by passing the character code into CH R
but remember we also have the situation
in which this is an alpha or a non alpha
character so we're going to throw an
else statement inside of here and
remember we're just going to keep all
the characters that are not letters the
whatever they originally work so the
spaces will stay spaces and whatever
other codes will remain whatever they
were so here we'll just tell in else and
then here we'll type in the secret
message once again and we will just
replace this with whatever the original
character was so we can get rid of that
and then at the end now we know that
everything has been encrypted so we can
just print out in cryptid and then
follow that up with our secret message
so that's how we go and encrypt all that
and then everything here is going to be
exactly the same except the key is going
to change so let's just get rid of this
here and also let's take this print and
throw it over there so we need to
basically to decrypt it we're going to
go and assign key to the negative of
whatever the key is that's how easy it
is to convert everything back we're then
going to create our original message
that we'll be adding to as we cycle
through and then basically we're just
going to come up here and right here
where we have four characters
in message let's go and grab all of that
right down here where it has the
encrypted part and we'll paste this
inside of here and then we'll make
couple little different changes we're
still going to come in and check if it's
a letter or not and everything else is
going to be the same except we are going
to replace all the secret messages with
original message so just cycle through
here and there's a secret message right
there so let's change this to original
message right here and we'll change this
to original message right here and we'll
change this to decrypted and it will
change this to original message and
there we go and if we run it it's going
to say that we want to enter our message
inside of here so we can come in and say
make me secrets how many characters we
want to shift I could say something like
mom's just always bothered
whenever I have things misspelled inside
of here so let's come in how many
characters should we shift and there's
26 inside of there put that little space
inside of there and also throw this
inside of here all right so enter your
message make me secret how many
characters should we shift let's type in
four and oh didn't get the results I was
expecting hmm let's look and see if we
can figure out why we didn't okay so if
we look at this we are shifting four
spaces so we're going to take the M and
we're going to go n o P Q okay perfect
that shifted all right now if we're
shifting back from Q to the M we're
going to go four spaces back to the left
so the Q should go four spaces back to
the left and go P o n m that should look
right uh-oh but now I see where the
problem is if however we would start
from the M meaning the original message
and then shift it to the left four
spaces now we see our problem what I did
here is I went and basically encrypted
it by moving backwards four spaces so
let's look at our code and figure out
exactly how we can solve that well you
can see right here this is going to be
secret message this is what I wanted to
convert now did I
convert in my copying and pasting
madness let's come down here there we
have original message and there we see
our mistake we went and try to decrypt
the original message
so what do we want to really decrypt we
want to decrypt secret message now let's
go and save that and see if that went
solved our little problem right there
run it enter a message make me secret
how many characters four and you can see
right there that was able to work okay
so hopefully you guys enjoyed that
tutorial and like I said for homework I
want you to put the duplicate code into
a function and have that work for you if
you have any problems with functions in
the next part of the tutorial will cover
functions and lists so please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
