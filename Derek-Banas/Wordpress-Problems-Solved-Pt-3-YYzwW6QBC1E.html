WordPress tutorial the reason I'm doing
this today is Dan asked me how to make a
website in WordPress that operates more
like this like a traditional website
where you can click on an image for
example and be taken to another page
that has some other images in it and
then bounce over to a product where you
could actually buy said wig in this
situation dan has full rights to be able
to use these images in all of this text
just by the way so I'm not copying
anything they're doing anything illegal
here but there's a lot of different
steps you have to think about whenever
you're making something like this so I'm
going to come in here and go to the
specific page where it has a lot of
different images on it that I want to be
able to copy and let's say that I want
to come in here and I want to copy all
these different images these six
different images and pretty much knock
off what's going on on this website well
I'm going to have to come in here and
either do a screen grab or since i'm on
a mac i have to use this little guy here
so i'm going to capture selection again
on a pc just do a screen grab that works
just as well here i'm going to come in
and i'm going to grab roughly trying to
grab all of the images here on the
screen i'm going to copy that and jump
over into photoshop but you could do
this inside again and then one of the
tricks here is you want to make sure
that every single image is precisely
exactly the same size so i'm going to
take that image that i just copied
pasted it in here and then i want to
command and select all of this
information here all this is all this
whole entire image here my selection
tool inside a photoshop and then i want
to copy it jump over here into this box
that's going to have a set size and i
pasted it in there then I want to resize
this image inside of here make sure
everything lines up perfectly and I got
my image inside of there now okay now
whenever we jump over here to these wigs
in his situation you can do this with
any product obviously you can see these
are called vibra light sheer indulgence
well to keep all these images in order
so that I can easily tell which ones go
on which page over in Photoshop whenever
I name this file I'm going to save it as
V s I which is an abbreviation for the
all those wigs that rely within that
area and then i'm going to call it the
Excite because that's the name of this
specific weight then of course I'm going
to save it as a Jay
just like that so I got all those
different images and i'm going to show
you this one more time just so you see
the whole process so i come in here
select as close as I can possibly get
the entire image copy come over here
paste it in and then resize it with a
free transform tool again GIMP has is
free and i'm going to do a gimp tutorial
eventually because i keep getting people
asked 1 i'm going to go file save as and
you can see here's all the vsi files
here on the screen that i have say so i
know which is going to go on which page
and a lot of this is just stuff that you
don't really think of to save time and
to make sure all your images that are
exactly the same size unless you've done
this for a while they're like little
silly tricks and then after I have all
these images saved here i'm going to
show you how to upload them into
wordpress and then organize and further
okay so i have all my images all set up
and they're all exactly the same size so
now i need to upload all of those images
so i just come over here to media in the
left sidebar and then i click on add new
and then i want to select all those
files and because I name them the right
way it's very easy for me to be able to
find all the files i upload it as you
can see here vsi all of them are all
right here and easy to get a hold of so
i'm going to come in here this is called
vibra light sheer indulgence click on
that hold down ctrl or command or the
little flower if you're on a mac and
then select every single one of these
guys let's start with vs i think this
would have been a nightmare if I
wouldn't have put that vs I part in
there very easy click on open and it's
going to upload all these files into
wordpress then after all the files are
uploaded I want to come in here click on
show and I want to copy the titles once
I have nice names and put it in alt text
as well as the description dude of
course come in here and get rid of these
dashes but I'm doing this just because
Google likes it Google likes images to
be named and looks upon sites that name
their images as sites that are valuable
mainly because you've shown that you've
taken the time to do what is right okay
now all of your images have already text
as well as a title and a description and
you want to click Save all changes and
everything
is all set up then something that's
going to get you a lot more hits is
inside of wordpress you want to come
over here into the settings area and you
want to click on permalinks what this is
going to do is it's going to make the
titles for your page is much better you
want to come down here and click on
month and name as you see right here and
then of course save changes that
automatically is going to make the title
show up in the name of your website
which Google likes again almost
everything I do is for Google's pleasure
okay so we have that all set up real
nice so then we're going to come in
again we're going to be working with
pages so I'm going to click on pages and
i'm either going to create or in this
situation i'm just going to actually
take the page it was already created
called vibra light and i'm going to
click on edit instead of create new we
could definitely make a better title
here for this and i'm going to do that
i'm going to actually call this year
indulgence okay super then i'm going to
pop over here to this page or it has the
information on sheer indulgence of
course you might have to write this
information but in this example we're
just going to copy and paste this
information over here from that website
got all that information right there
might want to come in and clean up some
of this stuff because we do have right
to do that then we want to import all of
our images onto this page and then
organize them so that they're all nicely
structured like the previous site so we
want to click where we want our images
to show up and then we want to come up
here and it says add an image click on
that go into our media library because
we've uploaded all those images and then
we want to locate the image that was
just the block of text which is right
here click on show and then I have it
left justified in full size and sit and
click on insert into post so it's right
there again click up here media library
find the image you want to upload hit
show insert into post and then continue
doing that for the rest of your images
okay so now I have all my images all
placed inside here which is super
fabulous and one of course come in here
and make sure that i have an excerpt for
all of these different things if you
guys are wondering at all what this is
down here is a shop which is a free
shopping cart plugin for wordpress so
that's what all that additional
information is and i'll probably go into
a tutorial and
soon enough I'm going to put in excerpt
of what i have here and i'm gonna click
on update but we're not done here yet
because i want to make this all nice and
neat make sure it looks the same on the
screen so we got this all here and saved
and if we want to preview the changes we
can see all of this empty space here on
the right right inside here and i know
that there's more than enough room to
fit this third image up inside of here
just needs to be done in the right way
so i'm going to show you how to do that
we're going to do is we're just going to
put a table around all of this and to do
that we have to click on the HTML tag
then we have to look these are all
images that link to the original image
itself so we just have to look for the
ending tag for that link in this slew of
information then we're going to divide
all of these guys up into groupings of
three and I'm just doing this so that i
can easily organize everything put in
the space between each one of these a
lot of web design is just tediousness
and being organized okay so we have all
of our images all broken apart and now
we got to come in here and create a
table for all of them so i'm just going
to type in the table tag yeah i'll zoom
in here so you can see it and then what
do we want to do we want to have a row
of three images so i'm going to put TR
which is the code in HTML to define that
we're creating a row and then we're
going to come after the third image so
just scroll down there's one two three
and we're going to put a closing tag in
HTML which is /tr so now all that's all
going to be organized but then we have
to also define the three columns for
each of the images and we're going to
type in the TD tag and then the closing
tvtag just like that except ford / and
then surround the next one with a TD tag
and a closing TD tag and we're going to
do that until we get to the end of our
row and then we just create another row
after that followed by TD tag and just
to make sure that I keep these inside of
three I'm going to come down here and TR
again it says all tedious sort of things
that you do in web design ok so I have
all these tables
now set up remember starting with the
opening table tag we have at the very
top of the screen and then followed by
rows with three images on each that are
inserted between these TD or column tags
and of course i have to go scroll the
way down tube on the page and close off
with my closing table tag all right now
that i have that setup scroll up here
and click on update and you'll be able
to see that now all of those images are
all organized in a table with three
images / up so all nice and neat
whatever if we're looking at this guy
over here which is our template that
we're working from I know there's more
space in between here but I actually
wanted less so that's why I set up
everything well now we need to set it up
so that whenever you click on these
images you don't go to the image itself
but instead you go to another page so
here's the main page that we have right
stuff inside of here then we have the
vibe relate your indulgence which is
this site right here so I'm actually
going to come in here and select it get
coffee that was the actual website
address for that specific guy right
there then I'm going to click on the
image inside here and then come up here
to the link area and I'm going to paste
in the new location and I'm just going
to say same window and i'm going to type
in a description or a title which is a
good idea not needed but definitely
helps you with search engines and we can
click update on that now we have all
this saved so let's just go to pages all
together and since we have our page is
set up and just by the way see that you
notice you can see here if i zoom in so
he says brands and then we have our
Raquel Welch which was actually what we
were lurked working on before and you
can see all the different dropdowns that
come from here this is an elegant themes
theme by the way if you wanted to know
ok so we have all this set up how
specifically did I do this because I get
asked this question constantly also what
I did here if you look over here on page
attributes where it says page attributes
and then parent and I have brands set up
well as my parent if I had no parent
then if we click over here again see
here's brands so putting the Raquel
Welch page specifically here what that
allows me to do is to associate these
with the dropdowns that you see here on
the screen so
this is brands as the parent Raquel
Welch is a child of the brand's parent
and then our new page we just created by
relates your indulgence is a child of
the Raquel Welch page just so you know
then to save time what I'm going to do
is come in here okay hundred percent
human hair I'm actually going to jump
over to the site itself Raquel Welch
here it says human hair I'm just going
to click on that and this site is a work
in progress by the way and I'm going to
come in here and copy this and see
because we change the permalinks earlier
in this tutorial you can see there's
words inside of here in just that it is
random nonsense that helps you a lot I'm
going to click in here click where it's
already highlighted paste same window
name and freeform memory cap to click
over here again recap to i'm going to
copy this link up here jump over here to
edit page 34 memory cap to drill paste
just so you get it here and then i'm
going to update all of these links and
i'll show you exactly what it looks like
when it's all done okay so now i want to
actually have the product page actually
shown here so what I want to do is come
in and again copy what I want off of
this screen and it's going to force me
to actually copy a bit by bit but that's
okay so create a new post you could
create a new page but you probably want
to create a new post otherwise your drop
downs are going to get completely out of
control in this specific situation and
then just to make sure that my text
always shows up the same I click on the
HTML tab and paste inside here and you
can see that this is ace sans-serif font
and I want to use serif fonts across my
whole entire website so you can see that
by pasting it into the HTML that makes
sure that everything is all nicely have
organized for me now of course there's
other different ways to clean things up
and obviously you could also click on
the little folder with a tee on a paste
inside of here and then hit insert but I
found that clicking on the HTML tab does
exactly the same thing for you so why
not do that save yourself some time so
I'll come in and coffee the rest of this
paste it copy paste it okay and then
because I named my images so well it's
going to be very easy for me to find my
new it my images that I saved in my
media library so I want to click where I
want Miami
just show up and then click add image go
to media library and I could have
hundreds of images inside of here and
this is going to be a very easy way for
me to find it media library and I'm just
going to click inside here and i'm going
to type action search media and it's
going to find my picture for me see I
didn't have to struggle hit show insert
into post and there's the image exactly
where I wanted it to be and of course
you can come in here and click on this
image and edit it if you'd like to but
if I don't want to do that what I do
want to do is copy this link to this
image and I'm doing it right here copy
and then I'm going to come over here
also this is things that are done keep
your information nicely organized i'm
going to say specifically I want this
brand and this situation i'm going to
say short and straight course i'm
guessing not everybody watching this is
making a wig website but that's type of
things you're doing and of course
putting tags in here is great as well so
i'm going to come in here and that paste
boom hit add it adds the tags with
keywords and then click on publish and
then if i copy the link to this jump
over to one of my other tabs go to the
action image right here click on the
link paste into here the location for
that new webpage hit update and then
update this page as well and of course
you'd want to come in here and do all
those other different pages but to show
you exactly what it looks like I'm going
to go back to the main website we're
coming weeks for sale online go to
brands find Raquel Welch vibe relates
your indulgence this is all this stuff
will we just made and you can see here's
the page all nicely organized and if i
click on action it takes me to that post
that i created along with all that
additional information now of course i
could also go to the main Raquel Welch
page and click on same place viber like
sheer indulgence which is going to take
me to the Bob relates your indulgence
page with all of our informational
nicely organized in tables as you can
see right here and if i click on action
you can say it took me back to the same
place so that's how you create a website
or pages inside of wordpress that make
them operate very similar to a regular
website so if you have any other
questions or comments about wordpress or
anything else in this too
toral leave them below otherwise till
