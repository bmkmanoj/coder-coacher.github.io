show you how to make this it's a super
super thin crust pizza I know the outer
crust is not thin I'm talking about the
crust underneath of the toppings and of
course if you don't want too thick crust
on the outside like I prefer it just hit
it with a rolling pin well onto the
recipe to make the perfect though I'm
using a bread man mixer and i'm going to
add 3 cups of unbleached bread flour
King Arthur i've found is the best the
order is also very important witness and
why i don't know three then i found it
best to add 1 cup of soft as silk cake
flour the reason why is it makes the
dough much more light then i take one
and three fourths cup of warm water to
which I'm going to add 12 TSP of bread
machine yeast then going to mix that up
until it is completely dissolved in the
water once it's dissolved I pour it into
the flour I then add to that two
tablespoons of nonfat dry milk and this
is what that looks like and then across
the top I put one tablespoon of sugar I
then let this sit for 20 minutes and
then after that is done i close the
bread machine and select the pizza dough
option and then i let that mix for
exactly one hour after the flower has
blended for one hour dump it out of the
pan kind of tacky and wet which is good
you want it to come out tacky and wet do
not want this to be tight or firmed by
any means this is perfect this is like
the perfect consistency if i would have
been thinking would put a little bit of
flour on my hands to keep this from
sticking to my hands too badly get some
flour drove it on the hands of course
you wouldn't have to use a bread machine
i just find it to be a lot faster and if
it's too sticky of course just put some
more flowering hands but see how it just
sort of roll so nice and smooth
this is perfect up you want to come in
here and need the ball of dough how I
need is just press down into it roll it
over press into it roll it over over and
over and over again while adding flour
and light increments about that much
flour and then roll it again and again
and you want to continue doing this
until the dough is only slightly tacky
but for the most part pretty nice and
smooth kind of like a baby's butt as
they say then this dough makes two
pizzas so I'm going to cut that on the
mill take those two pieces of dumb
spread them apart need them again and
work that yeast through the dump and
when I do is get about half a tablespoon
of olive oil take the dough roll it
around any olive oil and then I let this
sit actually in the oven off of course
towel with hot water course rinsed out
put it over top stick it in the oven and
let it rise for five hours after two
hours I take the wet cloth off that you
see how much bigger this guy's got a lot
of people say don't do this but I've
made hundreds of pizzas to try and get
to this point and this works best for me
so this is how I do it I then take the
dough out Andrey need it I've found that
this helps me to get what they call
window painting effect which basically
means there's no way this is no show
forth but by needing it again the window
pane by the way means that you can
basically take the dough and pull it and
pretty much see through it so I'm going
to need my dad oh all nice again I'm not
putting any more although on it go throw
it back in here going to re-wet another
cloth with warm even hot water cover
this guy put it back in the oven of
course the ovens know it on again now on
to the sauce I have this
and very very hot I'm going to add about
a fourth of a cup of olive oil I guess
that was more like an eighth of a cup
then I'm going to add a very hot about a
tablespoon garlic then I got myself some
key cut very dangerous and we cut notes
all that at tomatoes to that I'm gonna
add about a tablespoon and a half of
fresh basil I normally would add this
after everything was cooked but the
pizza it's not going to matter because
it's going to get annihilated with the
heat then put in two teaspoons of pepper
then going to use this potato masher to
get those Tomatoes all nice and smashed
up and that is a very simple simple
simple recipe for making tomato sauce
and then I cook this down for about ten
minutes after your 5 hours are up this
is basically what your dough is going to
look like real pliable let's see how
thin it'll stretch just really nice nice
nice nice doubt you can either use a
rolling pin on and if you want but this
stuff's the pliable you really don't
need to do that and I don't really worry
about making things actly round actually
kind of prefer that it's not perfectly
round because then it looks like a
homemade pizza i'm not a frozen pizza
show then get a wooden pizza peel these
are infinitely better than metal one and
then put some flour on that rub it
around take your do
here you can see the consistency of the
tomato sauce this is intensified almost
like tomato paste really really comes
alive again I cooked that for like 10
minutes on high just constantly stirring
it around this is going to really go
crazy I then use real mozzarella cheese
just spread that around on the pizza
like you see it right there this guy is
going to come in in about 600 calories
so actually it's a pretty healthy pita
in general but at 600 calories it's
definitely not perfect then you want to
make sure it's not sticking to the pizza
peel you don't want to do this whenever
you're messing around with a 550 degree
oven they're sort of slipping and then
put it in 550 degree oven on a pizza
stone very very hot and this guy is
going to cook in here for 12 minutes wow
I'm waiting for that to cook what I got
here this is going to make it even more
fattening I have a 2 tablespoons of
butter a teaspoon of garlic powder a
teaspoon of oregano a teaspoon of basil
and I'm going to cook this in the
microwave and I'm going to spread it on
the crust whenever the pizza comes out
to infuse the crust with that flavor and
after being in the oven for 12 minutes
there's the final pizza here's the
butter mixture over here I love this
because the crust is super thick and but
the crust of it lies underneath the
toppings is super super thin so you get
kind of like the best of the both worlds
and pretty much everybody that's eating
this pizza recipe says it's the best
they've ever had and now you know how to
make it to till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
