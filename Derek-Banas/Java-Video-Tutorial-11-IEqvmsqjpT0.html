11 of my java video tutorial series
today we're going to talk about
collection classes and the reason why we
have collection classes inside of Java
is it makes it real easy to keep track
of groups of objects and specifically
I'm going to talk about array lists in
this tutorial and really you can think
of an ArrayList very that they are very
similar to an array except for the fact
that they automatically resize whenever
you both delete or add items to them so
they're really really nice little tools
to use so the first thing I'm going to
do is import my ArrayList library that's
going to allow many use ArrayList then
I'm going to come in here and also bring
in the iterator class which is going to
be very very useful and the arrays
library which you have already seen in
the past and then what we're going to do
is public class and this is called Java
lesson 11 and then of course public
static void main string args which is
mainly where we're going to be working
from today a lot of this stuff is going
to see similar to you because it's very
similar to what you're going to do
whenever you are creating and a simple
array that's how you create an ArrayList
variable and then you can go take
ArrayList one which you just created
here and actually create an array list
object just that simply and as you can
see here I didn't have to define how big
this guy is because it's going to
automatically change sizes and just
understand it by default it's starts out
as a default size of 10 then you said
that doesn't really matter to you
another thing if you want to define
everything all in one line well you can
do that of course let's just like that
is equal to new ArrayList there you are
just created an ArrayList all on one
line now by default an array list can
contain any type of object any type of
information inside of it but let's
decide that you want to only accept
strings well if you come in put these
little brackets right here it's going to
automatically only accept strings into
your ArrayList right like that and the
one weird thing is you want to make sure
you have these little ending brackets
here so now we just create an array list
that only accepts strings and we call it
names so what happens if you want to add
different elements to this new ArrayList
well you just call the add function and
let's say you wanted to add John Smith
to this and let's just copy this couple
times here and throw a couple other
different names in here so let's say so
when to put my home and a lawn in here
and you wanted to put these names are
totally pulled out of the air by the way
and Oliver Miller another way you can
add items is like I said there's a have
index values so they're very very
similar to an array so John Smith would
be an index value 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 well let's say
you wanted to add an item to a very
specific index and then just have
everything move into place like let's
say you wanted to go into the 2 index
and you wanted to add Jack Ryan to that
well that's all you need to do is call
the add function and then define the
index that you want to put inside of
there and if you want to retrieve all
these you're going to use the get method
I'm going to use a for loop here there's
numerous different ways pulling these
things out however now you need to know
how big the erase list is so it's real
simple just type in names size because
that's the name of it size will tell you
how big it is and then it makes your
life a lot easier here because like I
said for to get these values you're just
going to put the name of your array list
dot get and then put I inside of there
as you can see clips help me out there
if we execute this we can see exactly
what we're going to get pretty much what
we expect John Smith Muhammad Allah me
Jack Ryan and Oliver Miller everybody
printed itself right out there on our
screen which is good now if you would
want to actually replace a value inside
of an array list it's also extremely
easy just go names and set and the index
value you want to change and then John
Adams well if you want to put John Adams
in there instead of having John Smith
inside of there well we'll just copy
this guy right here cut him out of there
like that and all this code is
underneath the video you should
definitely get it because it's highly
commented and it's free so why not and
there you go John Adams has replaced
John Smith just like that we did away
with them and get ourselves a little bit
more space here can also come in and
remove items in different ways so let's
say we want to remove whatever lies in
that index value of 3 very easy to do
let's go like this just as a shortcut
and execute it and you're going to see
that Oliver Miller is no longer going to
be with us see he's going you could also
use names and remove range if you wanted
to delete say the first and the second
index value that's exactly how you would
do it and that would delete it off of
the array list no longer be there not
going to go into that that much because
you know it's pretty easy to figure out
on your own so there's no point in spend
a lot of time on it also if you would
want to print out all these items that
are in the ArrayList this is more for
debugging reasons you wouldn't really do
this anything else you just put
system.out.print line course number that
dot right there and execute and you're
going to see that it printed everything
out there inside of brackets I'm showing
you pretty much everything there is to
know in regards to how they use these
guys you can also use the enhanced
for-loop and we're going to use it
pretty much exactly the same way that we
had before like that the way we talked
about it whenever we were doing all this
stuff with arrays in the past and it's
just system out on and just put on
inside of there and just like it works
for arrays it's also going to work for
all of our other little things with
working with and you can see that I'm
right by just clicking there and there
you say it's printout everything all
over again now you may have noticed that
up above I could use day iterator
library well the reason why is because
before the enhanced for-loop
came around you had to use what was
called an iterator and again it's these
are all objects and all these objects
have methods and fields or variables
inside of them that allow you to perform
certain tasks now if you want to create
an iterator object just going to go
iterator and let's say I want to call
this individual items and I just go
names dot iterator and simply what this
does is it creates a new iterator object
with methods that allow you to iterate
through the values that are currently in
your ArrayList so let's do that
and like I said this is before the
enhanced for-loop it was always done
this way so I'm going to go through it
because chances are you may see code
that looks like this somewhere now if
you want to iterate through all of these
different values stored inside of here
you're going to make a call to has next
now see look here again there's the
individual items right there that's this
object iterator you created and then
you're going to call a function called
has next that is a iterator object
method and all this guy does is it
returns a boolean value saying are there
any additional values that we need to do
stuff with just a method not a big deal
and if there are well you're going to
call the next method and you're
print them all out the screen until
hasnext returns a value of false meaning
there's nothing left to print out and
you can see this is all very very easy
to work with and it's just printing
those names out there on the screen that
you've seen and fast well like I said
before you can create array lists
without stating the type of values that
are inside of them and just to prove
that to you I'm going to create a ray
list I'm going to call this name copy is
equal to new array list and it's not
throwing any errors because it's totally
possible to do that and just because I
need it here in a second I'm going to
create another array list it's going to
be called name backup and new array list
so I just create a two array list that
can hold pretty much any type of value I
throw at them now if you would want to
take all of the different values that
are stored in one array list and copy
them to another piece of cake just go
name copy the guy that you want to copy
stuff to and you call the add all method
and then you put inside of it the array
list that you want copied to the new
array list called name copy at all it's
just going to copy everything in names
and save it to name coffee that's all
I'm not going to print that out because
it's going to print out the same exact
thing again you can also let's say we
want to create a string and let's call
it Paul Young for some really bizarro
reason Paul Young right like that and if
you wanted to take this string and save
it to an array list you just go names
dot add and Paul Young because Paul
Young is a variable or a field or what
we want to call them so there's another
way to add those guys to it if you
wanted to check if a specific item is
inside of an ArrayList well we just
created this string called paul yong if
we wanted to check to see if it is
inside of there your names and call the
contain method Paul Yong whatever the
value is for Paul Young inside of here
and if Paul Young exists this is going
to come back true or the contains
methods going to come back true and you
could say something like Paul is here
and execute it and there you can see
Paul is here print it out the screen
because the contains method came back as
true because we put Paul Young in right
here and that's the reason why all that
printed out the screen you can see
there's a ton of methods that are really
really useful for you to be able to work
with this stuff now another thing you
can do like let's say you wanted to
if everything in one ArrayList is in
another ArrayList well you could go if
and go names contain all effin is what
you're going to be working here and what
you're asking is does the ArrayList
called names contain everything that is
in name coffee that's what we're asking
here that's the big question and in that
situation where that is true we're going
to say everything in name copy is in
names and execute and you can see
everything is named coffee is in names
what we did before was we took
everything in names and we saved it to
name coffee
however we then added Paul Young to the
names array list so you may be wondering
is this going to come back positive if
we come in here and change this to names
and change this to name coffee and it's
not going to come back I can just tell
you that right now see didn't pop up
reason why we copied names to name copy
so name copy has everything in it that
names did before but then we added two
names
so everything in name copy is going to
be contained inside of names the only
thing is is names has one additional
value that doesn't affect anything
because of what we said before didn't
quite get that just think about it for a
second you'll definitely pick up on it
and if you wanted to lead everything
that's inside of an ArrayList just call
the clear function and that's what's
going to do it's going to delete every
single item inside the names ArrayList
if you want to check if a ArrayList is
empty just call the method is empty and
it's going to return a boolean value of
either true or false
we can just say ray list is empty and
it's going to come back as a true or at
least it's going to print the ArrayList
is empty and it did now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to create using the
generic object datatype I'm going to
create an array called more names new
object and because it's an array I'm
going to have to say it's for deep it
has four little shells inside of it and
I'm going to show you how to turn an
array list into a regular array full of
objects
so I'm going to go more names is equal
to and you just go name copy which is
the name of my ArrayList and you say to
array right like that and now everything
that was stored inside of name copy is
now going to be stored inside of this
array called more names with that inerts
capitalized and if you want to see proof
of that fact I'm going to use the arrays
function to string and then have it
print out to the screen the array called
more names and as you can see that's
exactly what it did it printed
everything out there so that was a
run-through of pretty much anything you
could possibly do in the marais list
leave any questions or comments below
