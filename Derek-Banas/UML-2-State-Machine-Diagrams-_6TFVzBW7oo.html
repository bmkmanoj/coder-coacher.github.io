my UML 2 video tutorial today we're
going to talk about state machine and
package diagrams and pretty much wrap up
the meat of all the syntax behind
creating UML system models now state
machine diagrams model the changing
states of objects and the events that
cause these state changes and a state
diagram is going to show many different
things as we go through here but what I
got here on the screen is going to show
States and transitions and this whole
entire image and everything can be used
as a cheat sheet and it's available
underneath the video in a link now
transitions which is what these guys are
these arrows here going backwards and
forwards are going to represent how
states change and this is a state has
card and this is another state no card
and I'm using my common ATM sort of
thing to diagram all this stuff now the
events that occur like eject card and
card entered are going to trigger state
changes and these events are going to be
written across the transition arrows now
States and transitions are often listed
in a table format like you see here and
you're just going to list state and
trigger and then across the top you're
going to list your events and then
you're going to show how the individual
events are going to change the
individual States just as you can see
here no card now if a card is entered it
is then going to change to the new state
which is going to be has card so if you
prefer to list them in table form you
can do that however that is not quite so
common and state diagrams are normally
going to have an initial state like you
can see here and this is how you would
document that as well as a final state
and you're going to be able to document
behaviors that occur whenever you are
currently in a state by just listing do
with a little slash and then documenting
exactly what is going on wow your system
is in the state called verify funds it
is going to be verifying checking funds
in this situation and this is referred
to as a do behavior now transition
arrows can be a lot more complicated
like I said before they can have
descriptions and these descriptions
can be quite verbose and you can also
see here that we can self call our
states just by drawing arrows like we
have done in previous UML diagrams and
basically with these transitions that we
are going to be documenting here we're
going to first list a trigger and that
trigger is going to be the thing that
moves us from the request fund state to
the process request state so that's the
very first thing you know list then
you're going to list a guard statement
and the guard is going to be a boolean
condition of some sort or other that
either allows or blocks a transition so
you can see here if the requested funds
are less than or equal to the funds
available it's going to then move on to
process the request however if the
request for funds is greater than funds
available it's going to say now we can't
do that and it's going to again ask them
to request the funds that they want and
then finally you're going to have the
transitional behavior and this is going
to be the behavior that occurs as you
transition to the next state and things
like passing values for processing and
so forth are listed in this situation so
what we're doing here is passing the
actual requested amount that the user is
asking for and then that is going to be
processed over here in this current
state and then you're going to come to
your final state right here after the
request has been processed so that's
kind of a complicated transitional arrow
and then this is a couple other examples
of different state machine diagrams you
can have here you could also just put in
card valid and this is either going to
come back as true or false and if it
would come back in false in this
situation that's where you would come
back and request again another card and
then verify the funds inside of the
state description and then this is what
you're going to be asking for ask for
valid card however if the pin was
entered and the card was verified we
would come down here and verify that the
card in the pin that was entered
properly and so forth and so on until we
finally get down to request funds and
process the request and another state
machine diagram would be this guy right
here which is a little bit more
complicated here's the initial state
point and then we're going to get to
this part here and we're going to ask
our funds available and this is going to
make a request if the request is less
than or equal to funds available
then we're going to come over here and
provide the funds then at that point if
funds available is less than or equal to
zero we're going to come down here to no
funds but in most situations you're not
going to get less than or equal to
because of this guy up here and if funds
available is greater than or equal to
zero in this situation it's going to hit
this state and then bounce back over to
the funds available state so you can see
how you can bounce around and then
finally refused the transaction
altogether if the request is greater
than funds available so this is just
another way that you can document a
state machine diagram and lay everything
out it's kind of flexible but basically
you're just using States transition
arrows transition descriptions and in
some situations you're also going to
have state do behaviors like I said
before now there's other types of State
internal behavior as we scroll round
here and that is just simply called
state internal behavior and in this
situation we're going to put both an
entry point which is what's going to
happen when we reach this a verify card
state we're going to receive the card
and then we're going to check if the
card is valid and then after we have
checked if the card is valid we're going
to put an exit statement inside of here
all these things going to be handled
inside of the state you don't want
anything in here as an internal behavior
that's going to occur in any way outside
of the state you're going to inform the
customer in this situation whether the
card is verified or not and then you
have internal transitions and these are
going to cause something to happen but
they do not just like these guys up here
change or force the user to leave the
state itself
you always want to use transitions to
leave the state these guys here are
going to be actions that are performed
whenever you are currently in the state
so in this situation we're going to tell
the customer if the card is valid or not
and again we're going to use the same
format trigger which the trigger in this
situation would be we found out that the
card is either valid or invalid and in
this situation this would be the guard
behavior which is either gone back as
true or false and then we're going to
tell the customer whether the card is
valid or not so that's an example of an
internal transition and you can see that
over here internal transitions trigger
guard and behavior exactly the same
format as you use with transition arrows
and then you have what are called
composite States and they're going to
occur whenever you have two or more
states that are active
one time and each of these composite
states are called sub states as you can
see labeled right there and in this
situation you're going to call this guy
verify card and in this situation let's
say we wanted to verify the card as well
as verify the pin at the same time which
is definitely something that could occur
well we're going to have a transition
arrow coming in here and these two sub
states are going to be divided into
regions using a dashed line just like
that and then inside of here we're also
going to have two totally different do
behaviors occurring this one's going to
be verifying the card itself and this is
going to be verifying the pin and then
after those two are done we're then
going to come down here and pull it card
validated to transition to the next
point and you could also draw two arrows
out of here and then fork them together
into one arrow if you'd prefer to do
that and you could also do the same
exact thing we're we're also going to
have a fork that is going to fork into
these two guys if you don't want to use
just one arrow
either way it's completely up to you
then we're going to have choice facade O
States and they're going to be used
whenever a boolean condition is going to
determine the transition that takes
place so here what we're doing is
verifying the card and this is the guy
that represents the boolean condition
that's going to transition to this
transition or this transition depending
on if the card is valid or not so if the
card is not valid that comes back is
true and that's going to send it back
here and ask them for another card and
in this situation where the card is
valid we're then going to come over and
verify the pin so that's how you would
put in different transitions based off
of boolean conditions if you'd like to
lay it out that way and then the final
thing or diagramming signals again
here's initial state so let's just move
that out of here and here you're going
to represent triggers with either a
receive signal icon which is what this
guy is pin entered and then represent
transition behavior with a send signal
which is this one account information
request so they're going to come in here
your system is going to be in the state
of request pin a pin is going to be
entered which this is going to represent
a trigger or receive icon signal
whatever you want to call it I'm going
to come down here and if the pins valid
we're going going to move on to our send
signal which means that informations
then
going to be sending to this transition
state which is request account type and
for the most part that's all you need to
know about state machine diagrams so I'm
going to get into more things here as
the tutorial goes on but this is more
than the basics now we get to package
diagrams and this is extremely
simplistic which is the reason why I
tacked it onto the end of this tutorial
packages are going to group similar
classes and I'm sure if you've been
programming you know that and package
diagrams are used to show dependencies
between classes and the symbol for a
package is just going to be a simple
folder like this and you can either put
the name of the package inside of the
folder or as you see here you can put it
on the tab outside of the folder and the
contents of the package can be drawn
directly inside of the package and this
would be a class product description
that is public which you can see because
of the plus sign and this is going to be
a private class inside of the package
which you can see because there is a
negative sign you could also have these
classes listed as external to the
package just by doing exactly what you
see here and of course you could put
public or private on there if you wanted
to and if you'd like to document that a
package is contained inside of a package
like a catalog package may contain
another package called product that's
exactly how you would label that now it
is very common to document packages with
a name which is called URL in Reverse
packaging in this situation with my
website I would put com new think-tank
and then whatever the package name would
be and this is exactly how you would
document that however you could also
document it in other ways which is like
this just putting com two colons new
think-tank two colons and products
inside of there so there's two different
ways to document a URL in Reverse
package and then on top of that you're
going to be able to show that a class
belongs to a package if you wanted to do
that exactly like this just listing the
class name and then the package name
inside of braces right here or you could
just put in product two colons and
product description like we have here so
in this situation you would put the
package name followed by two colons and
the class name like that
if that is preferred it is preferred in
this situation that you would actually
name
all of your classes with first the
package name followed by the class name
just in case you end up having packages
with exactly the same class name just to
avoid any confusion that might come from
that so let's say if we had a product
description in a package other than
product we would easily be able to tell
which class we are actually referring to
in that situation and because this comes
up a lot just so you know classes in the
same package are said to be in or part
of the same namespace now if you want to
show that one package depends on another
package you can draw a dependency arrow
to it and there's a couple different
types of dependency arrows you can show
that one package imports another just
simply by listing one package and
putting import inside of braces like
that and putting a dependency error
you could also show that one package is
going to import a class from another
package just by pointing directly at
that class and just be aware that
whenever you're importing these packages
whether they be individual classes or
whole entire packages you're only going
to have access or be able to import
those public parts of the package and
you're not going to have access to the
other ones now if we would have merge
like we have in this situation this is
going to allow you to merge two packages
that are hopefully related into a new
package just like that and the final way
of importing packages for the most part
the most common ways anyway is to use
the access dependency era and this is
going to be used if the imported package
should have private visibility so there
is pretty much everything you could ever
want to know about package diagrams and
state machine diagrams a lot more real
world examples are going to be coming
very very very soon
so leave any questions or comments below
