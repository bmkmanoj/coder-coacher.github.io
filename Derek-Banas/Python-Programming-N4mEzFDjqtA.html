Python programming tutorial you guys
seem to like these videos in which I
cover an entire language in one video so
I'm going to do it today with Python I'm
going to cover like I said before about
90% of the language but that's pretty
much everything you're going to need
especially if you're just starting out
not a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so I'm going to show you how to
install Python is so easy on both Mac
and PC you're just going to go to
python.org downloads and you're going to
specifically go down here to python 3
point 4 point 2 and click on that and
whatever you do you're going to see all
the different ways you can install it I
have Mac 10 point 7 so I'm going to
click on this guy right here and this is
going to pop up and hit continue and
continue and continue I'm going to say I
agree and then I'm going to say install
and it's going to install it for me and
then it's going to complete the
installation and I'm going to close that
and then I'm going to be able to go into
my Applications folder and more
specifically Python 3.4 and then I can
either use Idol or I can use PI charm
which is what I'm going to use but feel
free to use whatever you want now we're
going to get into exactly how to install
for windows also equally easy I'm going
to come down here to where it says
windows x86 and my Sai installer click
on that window is going to pop up I'm
going to click on run and it's going to
install itself it's going to say is
there ok if I open this say yes install
for all users that's what I pick click
on next and then you have to define what
directory you want I just let it select
the normal directory click Next
don't really pay any attention any of
this stuff click on next and then it's
going to say do you want to allow this
program to install yes and then it is
going to finish itself then you're going
to be able to click on little windows
icon over here find python and idle if
you want to use that like I said I
decided to use PI charm for this this is
just the community edition of pycharm
and you can get that if you go to
JetBrains comm pycharm download right
there and of course you just click on
this you will you pick you the operating
system you're using and you click on
this and you install it alright so now
we're inside of PyCharm one thing you
might want to do is come over here click
on preferences or open preferences
inside of windows and then a couple
things you need to do is come in and
make sure that you have the right
interpreter you're going to use here I'm
going to go into console and click on
python console and then make sure that
you have the same version
Python that you just installed and you
just select it or find it on your
computer and then you're also going to
want to go to project interpreter and
also make sure that Python 3.4 is also
selected there that at least that's what
I'm using alright and here is PyCharm
and I am going to create a new project
and over here I'm going to name it hello
python py that's the extension you use
for python applications what we're going
to do first off is we're going to import
what are called modules which are just
going to provide us with some specialty
functions that we're going to want to
use one of them is around a number
generator another one is the cysts
module put these on separate lines and
then finally I'm also going to import
the operating system or OS module now if
I was going to do a simple hello world
all I would do inside of Python is
inside of quotes you can either use
single or double quotes they're exactly
the same inside of Python and I would
just run that you can see hello world
print it out right there on our screen
if I would want to use a comment I would
just use the little hash symbol like
that or if I wanted to do a multi-line
comment I would use three single quotes
multi-line dah-dah-dah-dah and three
single quotes once again so that's how
you handle comments inside of Python a
variable is just a place we're going to
store values and inside of Python you
can store pretty much anything there's a
couple different data types which I'll
explain but you can see right there I
just put name and equal two and I put it
a string name Derrick which is a string
is just a series of letters characters
whatever in between single or double
quotes like I said and of course we want
to print that out just go like this and
there you can see it printed a variable
has to start with a letter and then it
can have numbers or it can have
underscores so that's all we're going to
have there for variables and there are
five main datatypes inside of Python but
like I said we could take name like this
and store a number inside of it and no
problem would happen but here we're just
going to focus on numbers strings lists
tuples and I'll explain what those are
and dictionaries or maps whatever you
want to call them so those are the five
main types inside of Python and I'm
going to go through each of them one by
one one there are seven different
arithmetic operators you have plus you
have mine
you have multiplication you have
division you have modulus which is going
to return the remainder of a division
you're also going to be able to make
exponential calculations with two
multiplication signs and floor division
is going to perform a division and then
discard the remainder all together and
rotate down so if you have 14.5 as a
value it's going to change that to 14
and as an example of how that would work
I just went and put all these out here
I'm going to save that and run it and
you can see exactly how all of those
arithmetic operators are going to work
for you now whenever you're performing
arithmetic operations inside of Python
or pretty much any programming language
you have to understand order of
operation matters and basically what
order operation says is if you have
multiplication or division they are
going to be performed before addition or
subtraction so for example here we are
adding 1 plus 2 minus 3 times 2 that is
going to have completely different
values then if we would go in here and
put inside of braces the addition and
subtraction remember the multiplication
is going to happen first in this
situation and of course make sure that
you put the braces in here on both sides
of this and also pay attention here you
can see here we have what is a string
it's in between quotes and if we would
want to perform some arithmetic we would
just put a comma right after that string
we could have a never-ending litany of
these different guys in order and if we
calculate this you can see exactly
what's going on order of operation
definitely matters and you definitely
want to use braces anytime you can
whenever you're working with arithmetic
in pretty much any programming language
now like I said before a string is just
going to be a string of characters
numbers whatever between either single
or double quotes but you may ask
yourself what happens if you want to put
a quote inside of there so let's say
that I want to put a quote I would just
put backslash and then follow that with
a double quote and I could come in
here's a always remember you are unique
another thing to pay attention is we
don't have semicolons at the end of here
like most programming languages and we
could also in kind of a similar way use
a multi-line string here oh this
multi-line quote and this is the normal
convention of naming variables inside of
Python is to use underscores from each
of those so if I wanted to do a
multi-line string I just used the three
single quotes like that I then could
join these quotes like let's say I just
have a new string equal to and I could
have quote this plus multi-line quote
that's one way that I would join two
strings together another thing I could
do I'm going to show you a couple
different ways to format using print but
right now let's say that I'm going to
use three different types of strings
right now it's actually just two
different types one of these strings I'm
going to have embedded inside of here
like you're going to see here in a
second and then the other one I'm just
going to take the two strings and we
just create and put those inside of
there so inside of quotes since we're
using strings I'm have % followed by s
and then another % and then in here
let's say I want to actually have a
quote so I like the quote like this and
then I could actually pull in the
variables with the other string values
that I want to use multi-line quote I'll
save and there you can see I like the
quote always remember you are unique
just like everyone else okay maybe ask
yourself well how can I print things out
to the screen without having a newline
show up every single time I could say
something like I don't like this and
then put a comma and is equal to write
like this new lines and there you can
see I got rid of the newline that print
normally puts in there another thing we
could do is if we wanted to print
something multiple different times a
newline by the way is just backslash n
let's say we went into print 5 new lines
well we could do just that say new lines
alright so that's just messing around a
little bit what I'm going to do now is
I'm gonna come in here and cover lists
now a list is going to allow you to
create a list of values and then
manipulate them and each value is going
to have an index with first one having
the index of 0 and index is just like a
label so we can find our way around
alright so let's say we want to create a
grocery list all you're going to do is
put the square brackets inside of there
you're going to put everything you want
to store inside of here you don't need
to have these all be strings some of
them can be numbers you can put
other different data types in here if
you'd like so potatoes let's make sure
they're all in quotes don't mess up like
I just did go on to the next line if
we'd like keep everything neat bananas
that's probably good enough if we would
want to print the first item that's
inside of our list first item put a comm
inside of there and then just go grocery
underscore list and zero because
remember the first item is zero not one
and there you can see first item is
juice and there it is there's juice we
could then come in here and change the
value for that item if we'd like again
zero is going to be the index for it and
say green juice and you can see green
juice shows up there now that's how we
would come in and change values we could
also print just a subset of a list a
grocery list let's say that I want to
start with index one and print up to
index three not include index three a
little bit weird just something you have
to remember see tomatoes and potatoes
showed up there and there's tomatoes and
potatoes
you could also store those in a string
by putting an equal sign here with a
string name string variable on the side
and just to prove that we can put other
things including lists of lists inside
of a list let's say that I have other
events and I'm going to put wash car
pickup kids
cash check that's good enough I could
then create another list and call this
the to-do list equal to and then we
could just go other events and grocery
lists and store all those in one list
and then we could just print out that
list to-do list and there you can say
lists inside of lists okay if we would
want to get the second item say out of
that list the to-do list lists are
basically boxes inside of boxes so what
we would want to do is if we want the
second item out of the second list well
this is going to be a zero so we're
going to put one representing the second
grouping and then if I want tomatoes
which is the second item in the second
list I'm going to put one inside of
there and you can see it printed
tomatoes and if we look here you can see
tomatoes is the second item in the
second list we're also going to be able
to come in here and append
so let's say grocery list and we just
type in a pend and let's just say we
want onions inside of here to-do list if
we scroll down here you're going to see
onion shows up last pens to these
information that's already there we
would want to insert a new item in a
very specific index we're going to say
insert instead of append and let's say
that I want it in the second index or
number one with pickle inside of there I
could also come in and remove it push
your list remove and say pickle and I
could also come in here and sort these
items grocery list just by calling sort
another thing we could do is reverse
sort and grocery list again reverse it
pretty simple and if I would want to
come in here and delete an item de el
grocery list and if I went in
specifically get rid of whatever's in
index for it do that and we could come
in here just to see the damage and also
see that while I was making all these
changes to grocery list they were also
affecting the to do list changes to
remove instead of from whatever that is
and there you can see all the different
changes we made right there just like we
can combine strings inside of Lists we
can also combine lists together just go
in and to do list 2 is equal to other
events plus grocery list we come in and
get the length of the list to the number
of items to do list 2 we could get the
maximum or since we're working with
mainly strings here it's going to be
whatever is highest alphabetically by
just calling Max and then we could do
to-do list to do list to whatever and we
could also get the minimum item or in
this situation it's going to be whatever
comes first alphabetically by just
typing in min and there we go watch the
car cash check so that is a lot of what
you're going to do with lists so now I'm
going to get into tuples which are very
similar to lists I'm going to delete all
this stuff mainly what is different
about tuples is that unlike lists we're
not going to be able to change a tuple
after it is created
so let's come in here and create a tuple
call this pie tuple and why this is
useful is sometimes you have data that
you do not want easily to be changed so
that's whenever you're going to use a
tuple and really if you need to change
it to
you can convert it into a list and then
change it there and convert it back to a
tuple but that's not normally done
alright so we want to see how that's
done we can go to a new tuple and
convert a tuple into a list you're going
to do that just by typing a list and
then PI tuple there we go now it's a
list and then after you make all of the
changes that you want to make and you
want to convert a list into a tuple and
just type in tuple and then PI tuple or
whatever actually it would be new tuple
in this situation and along with those
two functions you're also going to be
able to get the length of the tuple by
just using le n and tuple whatever your
tuple is new list in this situation or
whatever and also you're going to be
able to get the minimum by also passing
in a tuple into the min function and Max
is going to work in exactly the same way
there's the different functions you're
going to use with tuples now we get into
dictionaries or maps basically I'm just
going to refer to them as dictionaries
because that's what I call them and a
dictionary is going to be made up of
values with a unique key for each value
you're going to be storing and they're
very similar to lists but you can't join
dictionaries together like you can with
lists with a plus sign
that's main difference there basically
let's say that I want to create a
dictionary of super villains I'm going
to do here is I'm going to use this
curly brace and then first off I'm going
to type in the key followed by a colon
and then whatever the value would be so
in this situation we're going to have
superhero or super villain names
followed by their secret identity and as
you can see it went in there and put all
those in there now if I want to get the
secret identity for one of my super
villains let's say that I want to find
out Captain Cold I'm going to use the
square brackets and I'm going to type in
Captain Cold
and you can see Leonard snart pops up
right there if I wanted to delete an
entry super villains again I'm just
going to type in whatever the key is so
let's say that Fidler is no longer with
us that's how I would delete it you're
going to use de L just like you did with
lists if I want to replace a villain
let's say that I found out that the
secret identity for the Pied Piper was
wrong just type in super villains and
Pied Piper is equal to hartley rathaway
we could also find the
number or length for our super villains
number of super villains we have stored
you can see for popped up on the right
side of the screen we could also come in
here and get the value by passing in a
key so super villains using get which
you're going to use get a lot for a
whole bunch of different things Pied
Piper
you see hartley rathaway popped up we
could also come in here and get a list
of our supervillain keys i just asking
for keys so if you play around with this
long enough you just start to remember
these things because the names are just
so logical and that's one of the reasons
why python is great first language if
you wanted to get a list of dictionary
values likewise you're going to go get
whatever your dictionary is and say hey
I want the values and there you can see
everything pops up over here on our
screen so that's everything
with dictionaries now we're going to
jump in and look at conditionals now the
statements if-else and LF are used to
form different actions based off of
different conditions and those
conditions are going to be whether two
things are going to be equal not equal
to greater than greater than or equal to
less than or less than or equal to let's
go take a look at a couple of these
basically the if statement is going to
execute code if a condition is met and
as you're going to see here white space
is used to group blocks of code inside
of Python in model different ways so
let's say that we have an age equal to
21 and if the age is greater than 16
you're going to put a colon and you see
how the whitespace automatically popped
in there just make sure that your
whitespace is always the same but if
you're using pycharm or some other ide
more than likely is going to do that for
you so let's say you are old enough to
drive is the condition so if the age
value is greater than 16 then this is
going to print to the screen else if
they are not then we'll pop in here you
are not old enough to drive and you can
say you are old enough to drive pops up
over there now if you want to check for
multiple conditions this is where LF
pops in so let's say we go if age is
greater than or equal to 21 you can put
something in here a tractor trailer and
then we could go L if I know it's weird
age basically else if age is greater
than or equal to 16 you were old enough
to drive a car and then finally if we
get the whole way down here we're going
to say print you are not old enough and
as you can see here I'm putting single
quotes and double quotes in here just as
an example that they don't really matter
and put that down there now another
thing we could do is we can combine
conditions with what are called logical
operators and logical operators are
and/or or not those are your different
logical operators let's see exactly how
they work come in here we could say
something like let me use brackets here
to separate these if the age is greater
than or equal to 1 and age is less than
or equal to 18 then we're going to do
something so this provides us for a way
to have multiple conditions match and
the only way this is going to go through
is if age is greater than or equal to 1
and age is less than or equal to 18 the
only way this is going to work is the
age is going to be equal to 1 or 18 I'm
just doing something kind of silly here
let's say you get a birthday so let's
say we're going to celebrate somebody's
birthday if they are between the ages of
1 and 18 L if the age is equal to 21 or
age is greater than or equal to 65 well
in that situation we're going to say
again we're going to have a birthday for
the person so if H is equal to 21 or 65
it's kind of explanatory just the way
that it works then we can say something
like L
if not what this does is it does the
absolute opposite age is equal to 30
well this is going to come back and say
is if the age is equal to 30 if that
comes back true it's going to change it
into false so that's what not does it
does the opposite of whatever comes to
the right of it and here we could say
print you don't get a and then finally
we could have else print you get a party
and then we'll put you a on here just so
it shows up on the right side of the
screen and we'll also say something like
30 up here changes the 30 and you can
see you get a birthday party a shows up
because it doesn't meet any of these
other conditions but you end up getting
all the way down here and another thing
that's very important to understand with
if and else if and all these different
things is if this condition is met this
is going to print on the screen and then
we're not going to go down to any of
this other stuff so once your condition
is Matt we're no longer going to check
anything else so that's important to
remember now let's get into looping and
basically looping is just going to allow
us to perform an action a set number of
times and let's say that we want to when
one way of doing that is with a for loop
there's actually a couple different ways
so let's say that I wanted to perform
something 10 times well I'm going to say
4x in range and I'm going to put 0 to 10
in this situation we're going to start
at 0 and we're going to work up to but
not to 10 just like we did previously so
let's say I wanted to do something like
print and then X put a space inside of
here and then let's say that we also
don't want to have new lines you can see
right there that it printed out 0 the
whole way to 9 so it doesn't go to 10 it
just goes up to 9 but it ends up being
10 digits because we started at 0 if I
then want to print a new line not sure
if I told you about new lines backslash
n that's a new line we could also use
for loops to cycle through a list so
let's go and create our grocery list
again like that we could then cycle
through it let's say for Y in grocery
list pull it inside of there and then we
could print Y there you can see it
printed out juice tomatoes potatoes
bananas that's a nice way to jump
through a list or cycle through a list
whatever you want to call it and you
could also define a list the numbers to
cycle through and this pretty much works
just like a list would say 2 4
or six eight ten but you're defining it
in the loop for an X and there you can
see it printed those numbers out another
thing we can do is we can double up for
loops to cycle through a list so let's
say we have a list of lists so number
list and we want to put lists inside of
lists we have our brackets and then
we're going to have another bracket two
and three and then we're going to put
another comma here then we can say
something like 10 20 30 and then we
could put another one if we wanted to
cycle through these using a for loop we
could say for X in range and since we're
only going to have index 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 we're
going to put 0 and remember it's only
going to go up to 3 but it's not going
to include 3 and then we could put
another for loop inside of here in range
and we're going to do exactly the same
thing because there's three numbers in
each one of those and then we could go
print num list and then in the brackets
put X and then Y and there you can see
it printed those out in order now let's
take a look at another way of working
with looping inside of Python and that's
with the while loop now while loops are
basically to be used when you have no
idea ahead of time how many times you're
going to need to loop so one way to get
something completely random is to
generate a random number and how you do
that inside of Python is go random
remember this guy right here import
random and then we could do something
like random range which is a function
that we're getting from that and let's
say we want to generate numbers from 0
to 99 that's how you do it and then
we'll get to the while loop part
basically we're going to say we want to
continue to cycle through Wow
random number is not equal to 15 again
there's a white space and we'll print
out random number every single time and
then of course we're going to have a
random number changed each time and to
do that we're just going to use this guy
again and there you can see it's cycled
through a whole bunch of numbers before
it actually got to the part where it met
15 and then it jumped out of the loop so
let's continue doing this over and over
and over again until this condition is
met and of course make sure you put that
equal sign in there forgot that the
first time another thing we can do is
let's say we want to actually use a
while loop and another more
additional manner sort of like a for
loop we're going to need to do is create
an iterator and this value is just going
to change over and over again and we can
say wow I is less than or equal to 20
make sure you don't put a space in there
and then we can put something like if
statement let's say we wanted to print
out all the even numbers well one way to
find an even number is to get the
modulus of two and if that is equal to
zero when there's no remainder after
division by two we know we have an even
number so let's print that out on our
screen and there that is we could then
go L if I is equal to nine let's say
that we only want to print up to nine
even though this is saying 20 up here I
know it's a weird thing it's just me
trying to figure out a reason why to use
all these different things if we want to
force ourselves out of the loop
completely and not continue checking to
see if I is less than or equal to 20
we're going to type in break and that's
going to handle that for us else if we
get down here we want to then increment
the value of I so we're going to use
shorthand notation I plus is equal to
one that is exactly the same let's put a
comment in here as if we would type in I
is equal to I plus one and yes you can
do the same exact thing with
multiplication division and all those
other different things just simply
replace that or replace the addition
with multiplication division or whatever
and in the situation which it is going
to be an odd number we're going to say
continue
and what continue is going to do is it's
going to skip the rest of the stuff that
comes that's inside of the while loop
that comes after this it's going to jump
back up here to the while loop that's
the reason why we're going to increment
I right there that's also the reason why
we're going to increment I here using
the shorthand notation again and there
you can see print it out zero two four
six eight it got to nine it jumped out
of the loop altogether and ignored
everything else so that is a rundown of
how while loops work now we'll look take
a look at functions which are going to
allow us to both reuse and write more
readable code and how you define a
function is you type in define de F
anyway and let's say that we want a
function that's just going to add
numbers
well after DF you're going to have your
function name and that's going to be
followed by the parameters that it's
going to receive so let's just say first
number last number
put a colon and then we could do some
nom is equal to f nom Plus last num and
then if you want to return something to
the caller of this function used to type
in return and some num in this situation
you're going to want to make sure that
you define your functions before you
call for them to use or call to use them
anyway if you want to call the function
just call ad number there it is right
there and we could type in 1 comma 4
exactly like that and there you can see
5 shows up on the right side of the
screen now you could also of course just
like always some type in string is equal
to take this out of here and that's
going to work in exactly the same way
another thing that's important to know
is even though some num this variable is
created inside of here it is not
available outside of the function
because it doesn't exist outside so if
we type this in you're going to get an
error say error name error ah you want
to look specifically it's going to say
some numb is not defined in this
situation we would say that some num
this variable right here is out of scope
so it's very important to understand
what goes on inside of these functions
happens there and stays there unless it
is going to be returned to us another
thing that is very useful is to be able
to get input from the user and so let's
say we go what is your name we want to
actually get the value that they type in
and you can see this is where sis is
being used
we're gonna go standard in and call read
line right like this and then we could
do something like print hello followed
by the name run it what is your name
third hello Derrick and it's just like
the computer's talking to you let's take
a little bit of a closer look at strings
because we've been using them a lot
let's define a string called long string
let's say that I want to print out the
first four characters how I would do it
is 0 for the 0 index and then for its
not going to print out the forth index
and you can see I'll pops up if I'm
going to print the last 5 characters
something a little bit weird here we can
do we put negative 5 colon and then not
then at the end of it you can see floor
shows up and if I also wanted to print
out everything up to the last 5
characters I'm going to do something
very similar again long string up in
this situation I'm gonna put
no number in the front and negative five
again there you go you can concatenate
or join two strings together using a
substring on a string and we can do
something like : four plus B there it
goes I'll be there and another way to
handle formatting with strings using the
print command is let's say that I want
to output it a character I'm going to
put up % and a C is my here I'm going to
have a string show up letter and my
number if I want to put a signed integer
I'd put % in D number is and here I'm
going to say that I want to use a
floating-point number or a number with a
decimal place and I want to make sure
that it has at least 5 decimal places
put % down here at the bottom and then
we're going to put in all of our input
so let's say that I want to say that X
is my favorite character and for the
string and I have to put favorite inside
of there and number 1 favorite number is
going to be 0.14 whoops and make sure
you put your brackets around this and in
the closing bracket and you can see
right there what it did is X is my
favorite letter and my number 1 number
is 0.14 and you can see because I put
the 5 there that it prints out 5 decimal
places even though it didn't exist
previous another thing we can do get rid
of this is if we wanted to capitalize
the first letter of a string let's go a
long string and capitalize there it is
if we want to return the index value of
the start of a string we could do
something like print long string find
and if the word we're looking for is
floor type that in you can see that's
the 33rd character right there just make
sure that this is case-sensitive so this
has to be exactly the same if we want to
return true of all the characters that
have been entered in a string or all
letters go long string is alpha we want
to make sure that everything is a number
is all numb we could also come in and
get the length of our string long string
and we could come in and replace a
specific word with another word long
string replace say we want to place the
word floor with the word ground there
you go sea floor became ground and
something else that's useful is if we
want to strip
white space there's no white space in
this situation but if there was we just
type in strip and then if we wanted to
split a string into a list get a long
string and split and then what we would
put inside of here is how we want those
words to be separated which a space
works up great there and quit list and
there you can see it took that string
and converted it into a nice list so
that's mainly what you're going to want
to do with strings inside of Python now
let's look at file i/o or input/output
if you want to create as well as open a
file I'm going to call this test file
you're just going to call open and I'm
going to give it a name and we call this
test dot txt and if I want to be able to
write to this file I'm going to send WB
as my command I could then output on the
screen the file mode that was being used
in this situation it's going to be WB by
just going test file and mode if I
forgot it for some reason I wanted my
files name I could just type in name
it's going to print that and then if I
want to write text to a screen or to a
file I'm just going to go mention test
file right it's a little bit odd you're
going to have to type in bytes and then
you're going to type in write me to the
file put newline inside of there then
after this you're going to have to type
in utf-8 about the only odd thing we've
seen so far with Python and then finally
if you want to close a file you just
type in close you can see WB and test
text prints out on the screen which may
asking yourself well how do we read
information from a file well since we
close the file we're going to reopen it
equal to open we have to tell it which
one of those we want to open test text
and make sure you type open then we're
going to tell it the mode here here we
want to open it for reading and writing
and make sure you put this inside of
quotes and reading and writing inside of
quotes is our plus we could go text in
file and read that data out of there and
how we do that is test file and then
call read and then finally if we want to
print that out on our screen text in
file write me to the file shows up over
here if we then want to delete that file
say we don't expect to use it anymore
this is where the OS module comes in we
just call remove and then tell it the
name of the file we want to delete
and it'll delete all right so that's the
major stuff you need to know for file
i/o now let's take a look at objects now
the concept of object oriented
programming allows us to model real
world things using code so just like
every real-world object has attributes
like color height weight and every
real-world objects has abilities like
walk talk and eat we're going to define
attributes using variables inside of
things called classes and the abilities
are just going to be functions now how
you define these real world objects is
you use a class which is a blueprint for
creating animals in this situation now
let's say we want to create our
attributes such as name and none
signifies the lack of a value you can
have it be whatever you want you put
none inside of here or you could have
just simple quotes whatever I'll use
either we're then going to say that our
animals are all going to have a height
weight and then it's going to have a
sound now by proceeding these variables
with two underscores what I'm saying is
these are going to be private and what
that means is if we want to change the
values here we're going to need to use a
function inside of the class that's
going to allow us to change it and if we
want to get those values we're also
going to need to use a function inside
of the class so for example if we want
to set the name we're going to do just
like every other function we're going to
type in DF for define and here I'm going
to say set named self automatically pops
inside of there and what self means is
it allows an object to refer to itself
inside of the class so for example when
I create this class animal
well no animals exist out in the real
world so if I want to refer to an animal
object I need a way to do it and self
provides that way so I'm saying I want
to change the object's self kind of bad
English but that's what I'm going to use
so if I want to set the name I'm just
gonna come in here and a name is going
to be passed inside of here then I'm
going to say if I want to change the
specific name I'm going to type in self
to underscores and name is equal to
whatever the name is they passed inside
of it
likewise if they want to get the name
they're going to have to use this
function once again because the name is
private because as two underscores are
good name and then in this situation I
will just return self dot underscore
name we're going to do that for
everything and this is called
encapsulation it just basically allows
us to say hey is the name they passed in
here valid and if it is then we'll set
it I don't have any of that in here but
we could use something like is it all
characters and if they typed in a number
we could say nah we don't like that we
demand that you enter all characters for
the name otherwise we're not going to
set it okay so that's what we're doing
verifying that the data is good another
thing you have inside of classes are
things called a constructor and
basically a constructor is going to be
called to set up or initialize an object
so we're going to say define and the
constructor is two underscores and knit
like that and then two more underscores
now in this situation whenever an object
is created we're going to demand that
all the values be passed in here so
we're going to say that we want the name
to be passed in the height to be passed
in the weight to be passed in and a
sound to be passed in then whenever
those things passed in we're going to
say that we want them to be changed or
defined so name the sound that was
passed in see I'm a neutralizing I'm
setting up those objects now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create
setters and getters for all of these
different guys and there you can see
setters and getters for every single one
of these different variables we have
defined inside of here and another thing
I'm going to do here this is going to be
used so I can demonstrate polymorphism
I'm going to have get type which is
going to print out the object name so or
the class name so it's going to be
animal put it inside of quotes of course
another thing you can do is let's say
that I want to print out all of this
information to the screen say let's just
create a two string here so and let's
say I want to return another way of
formatting output inside of Python is
use these curly braces like this to
represent where you want information to
go so I could say blank is that's going
to be the name and then I could have how
tall the animal is
and the weight of the animal and says
whatever the sound is for the animal I
could then follow this up with format
another way to work with these guys and
then if I want to refer since I'm inside
of the class I don't need to use the
setters and getters to refer to the
values of these variables so I can have
self dot two underscores and name and
let's jump down to the next line and
like it goes self dot underscore height
underscore weight underscore sound so
those are all of the different functions
and attributes I'm going to define
inside of this class now let's go and
take a look at exactly what this is
going to look like as an object we come
down here and the very first semi-dome
would create a object called cat which
is of type animal if I'm going to call
the constructor I'm going to pass the
name whiskers and let's say that he is
33 centimeters tall 10 krola grams in
weight and he likes the same Yao
well now that object is created and I
can trade it like it is a regular old
cat could also come in here and go print
and cat and to string let's come back up
here figure out what it did wrong oh
that's what I did wrong
is equal to the sound that was passed in
no big deal we all make errors and now
let's check it again we go whiskers 33
centimeters tall 10 kilograms and says
meow see now we're going to go over
something called inheritance and all
inheritance means is whenever you
inherit from another class that you're
automatically and you get all the
variables and methods or functions that
are created in the class you're
inheriting from so let's say I want to
create a class called dog and I want to
inherit from the animal class that's all
I need to do right like that and I
automatically get every variable in
every function that's already in the
animal class then let's say I want to
come in here and give it a name like
owner go so every dog but not animal is
going to have an owner I can then
overwrite the constructor for the animal
class let's say I want to do something
more specific here since it's a dog
let's say that I'm still going to be
able to or still require them to enter a
name a height away a sound but now I
also require them to enter a owner name
well to set the owner just like before
we type in self to underscore
and owner and make it equal to the owner
value they passed in so what happens if
I want the name height and weight and
sound to be handled by the animals
superclass's constructor up here
well pretty simple I'm just going to
type in super it's the superclass it's
the class above I'm going to type in dog
and then I'm going to type in self and
I'm going to follow that by two
underscores in it and I'm going to pass
in the name the height the weight and
the sound another thing I need to do is
allow them to set the owner so set owner
and owner is going to be passed in here
of course and then I just go self owner
is equal to the owner value they passed
in also want to do the same thing to get
the owner just do return so dot owner
and then I could also come in here and
define get type like I said before in a
second you're going to see what this is
for so and have it just print we are
using a dog object we can also come in
here and override functions on our
superclass I let's go and say that we
want to change the two string we just
create a new function with a name that's
already in the superclass
that's called overriding it and might as
well just come up here and just take
this whole thing paste that in there and
then let's just say here at the end we
say something like his owner is and then
we put our brackets in there just like
we did before and then at the very end
of this so got two underscores and an
owner and make sure you put that other
commenter and while we're working at
this might as well cover method
overloading
basically what Method overloading means
is that you'll be able to perform
different tasks based off of the
attributes that are sent in so let's say
that I wanted to create a function here
in multiple sounds like this and I want
them to have the option to send in how
many times we want our dog to bark for
example so let's here's an app tribute
but we're going to set this to the value
of none that means that it's going to be
okay for them not to send in a value for
how many then what we'll be able to do
is come in here and say if how many is
none well then we'll just say print and
so and get sound like that else if they
passed in a value
don't need that extra guy there else if
how many was passed in then what we're
gonna be able to do is go else print and
self again get sound and print it out
how many times they say they wanted it
print out so there's how many okay so
that's a way of getting around method
overloading this is just one way of
saying that we do not require attributes
to be sent into our function alright so
now that we did all that stuff with our
dog let's create ourselves a dog object
let's call him spot and dog and like I
said he has the name spot 53 centimeters
tall 27 kilograms weight let's say his
sound is ruff and let's say that I am
the owner there we go we can come in
here and print spot to string and you
can see over here spot is 53 centimeters
tall 27 kilograms says ruff and his
owner is Derek and then the final thing
I'm going to talk about here is called
polymorphism now polymorphism sounds
really complicated but it basically just
allows you to refer to objects as their
super class and then automatically have
the correct functions called
automatically and an example probably
explain it better than what I just said
so let's say we create a class called
animal testing and inside of it we're
going to create a function called get
tight and it is going to receive animal
objects then what it's going to do is
it's going to refer to animal and get
type so get type make sure that I put it
inside of here yeah there's get type 2
here it returns that it's a dog object
and up here get type returns that it's
an animal object now we're going to
create a test animals object of type
animal testing and you're going to see
that if I go test animals dot get type
and pass in a cat object which is
actually an animal object and test
animals dot get type and pass in a dog
object which is named spot if I save
this and run it in this situation the
cat is an animal object it prints out
animal and in this situation it prints
out dog all right so that's just a way
with I pass in a cat which is of type
animal and it automatically knows to go
and call this version of get type and
any other situation I pass in a dog
object and it automatically knows to go
and print the dog version of get type so
that's a brief explanation of
polymorphism and then the final thing
remember I said up here multiple sounds
and we don't need to necessarily pass in
how many in this situation I'll show how
that works
multiple sounds and I'll pass in four
once and then the second time I will
pass in nothing and there you can see
ruff ruff ruff ruff right guys so
there's a rundown of the Python
programming language covered as much as
I could hope you guys enjoy this and
