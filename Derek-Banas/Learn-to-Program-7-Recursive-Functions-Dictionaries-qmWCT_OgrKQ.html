7 of my learned programs series in which
we will learn to program by solving ever
increasingly complex problems and in
this part of the tutorial we're going to
cover dictionaries and as well I'm going
to show you how to use what are called
recursive functions to find Fibonacci
numbers as well as to calculate
factorials all of the code as well as a
transcript of this video is available in
the description underneath the video and
if you haven't watched any of the
previous parts you definitely should
because like I said this is progressive
tutorial in which we are covering more
and more complex problems so I have got
a lot to do so let's get into it alright
so first I'm going to cover our
dictionaries and they're similar to
lists now while lists organize data
based off of sequential indexes
dictionaries instead use what are called
key value pairs and here would be an
example of a key F name like that and a
value which would be Derek now of course
we would put quotes around those and I'm
going to show you an example of how we
can basically I'm going to create a
dictionary about myself so here is Derek
dictionary and to create a dictionary
you're going to use curly brackets like
this and then you're going to define the
key put a colon after it and then a
space and then the value and then you're
going to put a comma and then you're
going to put something else inside of
here let's say I put last name and colon
and then my last name and by the way you
can go on to the next line that doesn't
cause any problems and then we could
cover address and then I could throw in
address inside of here all right so that
is how easy it is to create a dictionary
you're also going to be able to easily
get values out of a dictionary we can
just go print and then I could say
something like my name and then follow
that up with their dictionary and then
inside of here you're going to put the
key that you want to pull information
back about and there you go right there
you're also going to be able to change a
value in a key so let's say I have a
situation in which I move I can just
reference my key right here and then put
in a new address and it is very
important to understand that whenever
you go to print out this information it
may not print out in the order in which
you may have thought so you can see
right here even though I put in first
name last name and then address whenever
I said that I went in to print it it
comes out as last name first name and
then address so like I said dictionaries
are non sequential so it's very good to
understand that so that you don't get
results that you're not expecting we
could also come in and add a new key
value pair inside of here so you just go
create a new key and you could use
single quotes here none of that matters
and let's say that I'm going to decide
that I want to list that I live in
Pittsburgh well that's how easy that is
I can also come in and check if a key
exists so I could say something like is
there a city and this is going to
provide either a true or false response
and I can just say City Inn and then I
could type in whatever the dictionary is
and you could say is there a city and
that comes back is true we're also going
to be able to get a list of our values
as well as our keys first I'll show you
how to get the list of values you just
go Derek dicted and then you go values
like this and then we'll also go and get
our keys and then just change this to
keys and if we run it you could see that
it prints out both the values as well as
our keys that we have inside of there
we're also going to be able to use a
for-loop to get both the keys am the
values and how you do that is you go for
and I'll just put K
therefore key and then V inside of here
for value and then you just reference
whatever your dictionary name is and
then this is an important part you type
in items and then let's just real simply
come in here and print both the keys and
the values and there you can see how
they all line up right there we're also
going to be able to get values
associated with a key or if no value is
associated with a key we could throw in
a default so we can do something like
let's just reference our dictionary
again and get is what you're going to do
and then I'm going to say let's say I'm
looking for middle name inside of there
and then if it's not there I want to
print out not here as the default and
you can see right there that not here
comes back inside of there however if I
type in L name and run it you're going
to see that my last name actually comes
back it's also going to be very easy to
delete a key value just type in de l for
delete and then whichever one you want
to get rid of so let's say that I no
longer want to track first names that's
how simple that is we're also going to
be able to loop through our dictionary
keys so let's just go for I in
dictionary and then let's print those
out and like that and you can see right
here that F name no longer shows up here
as a result and then we will also be
able to clear or delete all of the data
inside of here by just calling clear and
on top of that we're also going to be
able to create lists that are going to
be able to hold dictionaries so let's
say I have an employees list and let's
say that I want to be able to have the
user input employee data this is very
important because I'm going to have
problem coming up next that's going to
use a lot of what you're seeing here so
let's say we say something like enter
employee name and of course we're going
to use the split function so that we can
split the input based off of separating
between the whitespace and then we're
going to throw what's on the left side
of the white space in f9 and
then what's on the right side of the
whitespace into L name and then we are
going to come in here and append the
dictionary that's going to be created
here for us into our array so just go
like this and then if you want to
reference that variable value that they
just enter just put F name just don't
put it in quotes and then we can go L
name colon and then L name and then
finally we can just call for employees
to print and there you go and our
employee name and type in Derek whoops
gave me an error do you know why because
I only entered in one name instead of
two and Derek Venus and there you can
see that went and created that array and
through the dictionary inside of it and
that brings us to our very first problem
for this tutorial series what I want you
to do is to create a customer list and
basically what you're going to do is
create an array of customer dictionaries
and the output is going to look like
this so the program is going to start
it's going to say enter customer and
they're going to ask yes or no they're
going to be able to type in a why or yes
or no or n and there's a little bit of
trickery there you know in figuring out
how to make that work then if they
decide they want to enter a customer
name you're going to allow them to enter
it it's going to ask you to one another
one da-da-da-dah and the program is
going to continue to run until they get
to the point where you type in n and
then it's going to print out all of the
new customers on the screen so you know
how to do this based off of what I
covered in this tutorial what I've
covered in previous parts of the
tutorials so pause the video and give it
a try otherwise I'm going to show you
exactly how I'm going to do it right now
alright so what are we basically going
to have to do here well we're going to
first off come in and create an array
and that is going to be used to hold all
of our customer dictionaries then I'm
going to be asking them over and over
and over again for them to enter
information so what does that mean
anytime you say over and over and over
again that basically means I need to
create a loop of some sort or another
then it comes to the point in which we
are allowing them to enter in
either Y or n or yes or no and so forth
and so on so we have to figure out
exactly how that's going to be allowed
first off we're going to get input from
our user and make it work for y or n and
we'll figure out how we're going to do
that we're going to have to provide a
situation in which we leave the while
loop something inside of here
check to leave the loop otherwise we're
going to get customer data and then we
are going to add customer data to list
buh I typed in a Rea up here again
stop doing that list and then the final
thing we need to do is print customer
data there's a rundown on what we need
to do so first thing we need to do here
is to create our list that we're going
to use and I'm just going to call this
customers and you create lists by using
the squared off brackets like that then
I need to create a loop and I want this
to run over and over and over again
until they enter some piece of data
which means that a break is going to
make more sense to end this loop than
anything else so I'm just going to put
while true inside of there I need to get
input from the user so I'm going to call
this entry is equal to input and I'll
say enter customer yes or no and
remember they're going to have I want
the ability to allow them to enter in
either a wire and n or this could be
uppercase or that's good to be any other
different thing so I'm going to you know
put in a couple different ways to play
around with this basically the most
important thing is I'm going to cut off
just the first letter that they are
going to be entering in and to get the
first letter I can just do that and then
I can throw it in to lowercase so that
it will always work and that's all
that's needed right there then I want to
check if I want to leave my loop and how
I can do that quite simply is just by
coming in here and saying if create
entry is equal to and well that means
that it wants me to leave the loop and
how do we leave the loop
idiot Lee we just type in break then we
get into a situation let's come down
here and let's tap this in so it makes
sense and then we'll say else and I want
to get my customer data so I'm going to
say fname and lname is going to be equal
to and then I'll get input enter
customer name and once again I'm going
to want this to be split so that it has
room for all or both of those guys and
throws them into the proper variables
and then I want to add the customer to
our list as a have right here and I
showed you how to do that you just go
customers append and then we're going to
throw in our dictionary so we'll say F
name colon F name and then last name and
L name and that's all we're going to
need in regards to our looping structure
then we got to print out all the
information so I'll just say for cust
in customers and then I will print out
that information and I can get it with
just cost and then we'll do the same
thing for our last name inside of here
so just throw in a comma and we'll just
change this to last name and if we run
it we can see if we got this right here
and her customer yes or no let's type in
why that worked and I can type in my
name to enter another one yes and I
could say something like Sally Smith and
or another one no and there you can see
it went and printed that list of
customers so hopefully you got that
problem correct if you didn't that's
okay once again the idea here is just to
learn and see problems and then see how
they're solved and over time you'll get
progressively better at solving problems
so now we're going to take a look at
what are called recursive functions now
a recursive function is just a function
that refers to itself that is it calls
itself inside of itself and that sounds
really complicated but I'm going to show
you how could two examples here and it's
going to make a lot more sense so
basically what we're going to do is
let's say we want to calculate what are
called factorials
well a factorial which is let's say we
went
the factorial of 3 that's going to come
out to 3 times 2 times 1 and that is how
we're going to be able to calculate
factorials so basically what we need to
do is figure out how we would use a
function that calls itself over and over
again to solve this guy that is our goal
and I'm going to go here and I'm going
to create one and then I'm going to walk
you through exactly the process that's
going on so let's say we have a function
and it is called factorial and it is
going to receive a number and basically
what we're going to do now is we're
going to every well every fact every
recursive function that you ever create
must contain a condition in which it
ceases to call itself over and over
again all right that is true of every
recursive function otherwise you get
into a infinite loop so what we're going
to do here is we're going to say if this
function ever receives a value in which
that value is less than or equal to 1 in
that situation we are not going to call
the function again we are simply going
to return 1 otherwise what we need to do
here is calculate our result and our
result is going to be equal to num the
number that was passed in x factorial
and then num minus 1 so as you can see
each time we go through here num is
going to be decremented by 1 so
eventually it's going to get to a
situation in which num is less than or
equal to 1 and it's going to continue
cycling over and over until it gets to
that point and then it will end and then
we will say return result and that is
how easy it is to calculate factorials
inside of Python I don't worry about it
if that's not making sense I'm going to
run you through an example so here we're
going to say print and I'll call 4
factorial to run and I'll throw 4 inside
of there and run it and you can see
right here that the answer comes back as
24 and we come in
here and throw something inside of here
let's say for is equal to and there we
go so what exactly is going on here well
I'll walk you through the process
basically the first time that the
factorial function is called you're
going to have the result this guy right
here having a value because we passed
four inside of it that's going to be
four and this is going to be times
factorial of 3 so exactly what you see
there the next time that we run this guy
so let's go and copy this it's going to
run three times here so this is going to
be the second and this is going to be
the third this guy right here is
actually down here so this is going to
be three just like we have there and
what's this going to be two so this guy
right here is going to be this line
right here so we're going to pass a two
inside of that and this is going to be a
1 now what happens when the function
factorial is passed to one it returns a
value of 1 so this comes out to being
equal to 2 times 1 so where does this go
that guy jumps right up here and goes in
that place so what does this mean well
this is going to become 3 times and
what's 2 times 1 this guy right here -
all right and where does this go this
goes right here to replace that function
and that's how you get your final result
which is going to be 4 times 6 and that
is how you calculate the value of 24 so
that is the process and that is why
factorials or recursive functions anyway
work really well in calculating little
problems like this so now what I'd like
you to do is go and try to use this
logic to calculate Fibonacci numbers so
Fibonacci numbers are going to be values
like this it's a sequence that goes well
let's put commenting you slider here
it's going to go 1 and then 1 and then
what happens here in this situation is
to calculate the next value we add these
two values together so what's that come
to - to figure out what the
x-number is we just add these two values
together it gives us a value of three
and then we go five and then we go eight
and so forth and so on so what I want
you to do is to create a using a
recursive function I want you to
continue this process over and over
again and the main information that you
need to understand is to calculate this
what we're going to do is we're going to
follow this process so this is going to
be equal to n minus 1 so the value
passed n is going to be n and then we're
going to take n minus 1 and then we're
going to add it to n minus 2 then we're
going to have a couple conditions these
are going to be the conditions that are
going to throw us out of our recursive
functions and where if the value passed
n is 0 in that situation we will return
a 0 and in a situation in which the
number passed in is a 1 we will return a
1 now I think you could pause the video
and solve it right now but if you want a
little bit more of a hint I will give
you more of a hint
let's say that the user comes in and
they type in something like fib 3 what
exactly is going to be happening here
well the first run-through is going to
have a result which is going to be equal
to fib 2 plus fib 1 the next process or
the next step through is going to have
result equal to and then what we're
going to do is we're going to actually
break this into two values which is
going to be this guy and this guy so we
will change this into fib 1 plus fib and
this would be 0 so basically this one
call this function is going to create
these two guys right here and then this
guy right here is going to give us a
value of fib 0 and the condition that I
said up here is that if the value passed
in is 0 this is going to become a 0 and
this guy what's this going to become
also zero and what's this guy going to
become a 1 so what are we getting here
in essence we're getting 1 plus 0 so
knowing this piece of information what
are we going to be able to do well this
is our final result and what is 1 plus 0
equal to is equal 1 and where does this
one go that one goes right here into
this little box and then we have the 2
up here so what do we have for an
example the final example is going to be
2 plus 1 which is going to give us our
value of 3 so now I think you have more
than enough information to give this guy
a shot and now I'm going to walk you
exactly through how we're going to solve
it okay so what are we going to do we're
going to say define and I'm going to say
fib and it's going to receive a number
and like I said before if n is going to
be equal to 0 in that situation we will
return a value of 0 else if and has a
value of 1 in that circumstance we will
return a 1 otherwise in all other
situations we will calculate the result
and the result is going to be equal to
fib n minus 1 exactly as we said
previously and I'll throw this inside of
there just so we can see that a little
bit better so there is what we're
actually working on and we're basically
just transposing that function in that
definition into code and then we'll say
return result and we can run it to see
if it works
so we'll say print fib 3 and why don't
we go and do some more coffee and 4 &amp;amp; 5
and here you can see the results of
those calculations so if we come down
here and look at 3 you're going to say 1
2 3 &amp;amp; 2 is the result here if we put in
4 again 3 as a result in here if we go 5
spaces 5 is going to be the result so
there you go
hopefully you guys got that right but if
not and you have any questions just
leave a or any of your questions you
have in the comment section and I'll be
sure to answer them and in the next part
of the tutorial we're going to jump
in and learn about files so please leave
your questions and comments below
otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
