32 of my java video tutorial series
today I'm going to teach you everything
you could ever want to know about either
reading from or writing to files using
character streams and a character stream
is just a series of characters it's
something that complicated however most
of this important information is either
separated by a comma space or tab today
we're going to be separating everything
using just simple spaces now of course I
got to go and bring in the i/o library
if I'm going to be doing i/o type stuff
here and then I'm just going to be
bouncing back and forth inside of a
public static void main
and then different methods that I need
now of course I'm going to be creating a
list of customer information so I'm
going to create a customer class and I'm
going to throw a bunch of these customer
objects into an array and then I'm just
going to go get customers and slowly I'm
starting to use more object-oriented
principles in creating all this stuff
here so you guys learn proper way to
program so what do I need to do I have
to come down here and define my customer
class they'll come outside of main I'm
going to create my customer class first
so of course we can create classes
inside of other classes I'm going to
make it private static so that other
classes can call for this and then I'm
going to create a blick string first
name and last name two fields are going
to be needed in my class and then I'm
going to come up here and also create
public int and it's gonna be customer
age and what am I going to do well I'm
going to create constructor method
called customer just like the class of
course it's going to have string first
name string last name and integer which
is going to be customer age and this guy
is going to be able to build all of our
customer objects we're going to go this
which is a reference to the object that
is being built is equal to the first
name field that was passed to this
constructor to create this customer
object last name is equal to last name
that was passed over and then this
customer age is equal to customer age
that was passed and there you are I just
created myself a little customer
generating class here along with the
constructor that's going to be able to
build everything so that's good but I
still did
not create get customers which of course
we're going to have to create come down
here right after we define this class
and let's create that guy and I'm going
to go private static customer this is
what it's going to be returning in a
customer array and then get customers
and nothing's going to be passed to it
and what is it going to do it's going to
create a new customer object array and
I'm going to call it customers is equal
to new and I'm going to define inside of
here but there's going to be five
customers inside of this guy and then
I'm going to go customers bracket zero
to fill the first index is equal to new
customer what's it's going to do it's
going to call this guy up here so that's
what I'm doing I'm calling this
constructor method up here that's all
and I'm going to keep this real simple
I'm just say John Smith and I'm gonna
say he's 21 and we're just gonna copy
this and then I'm just gonna fill these
out 1 2 3 4 and I'm gonna have this be
Sally and then I'm gonna have this be
Paul some of the Smith family and
they're all 21 years old there you go
and they're all 21 years old well let's
change this let's make that one 23 so we
went and created this nice customer Ryan
and we're just going to return it
customers like that so basically what
happened here is I said that I want to
create a new customer array called
customers and we called the get
customers method which is right here and
it went and created that array for me
and then sent it back now what we got it
well we have to come in here again to
the main method and we have to create
what is called a print right sir and a
printwriter is used to write characters
to a file and that's basically what
we're going to do and it also can use be
used to write other things than
characters but like I said we're going
to focus on character streams right now
because that is the most common thing
you're going to be right ok so we're
going to go customer output is equal to
and we're going to call another method
called create file and I'm going to
specifically say where it needs to go
and if customers dot text doesn't exist
it's going to create it and if it does
exist it is going to overwrite whatever
is there right now all right what do I
need to do I need to create the create
file method
I'm going to do that scroll down inside
of here come off where we were and then
this guy again is going to be private
static print writer it's going to return
a printwriter that will allow me to
write to a file and then create files
name of the method and string it's going
to be receiving as you saw above is
going to be the location for my new text
file that I'm going to create now I need
to wrap everything inside of a try block
just to be able to catch any errors that
could potentially be thrown and then the
errors that could potentially be thrown
would include on the i/o exception which
you're going to see in a second and of
course it could be thrown if you try to
go and do something with a file that's
improper so we're going to get a new
file and then inside of this we're going
to save file name which the file name
was passed and then we're going to go in
here and create our print writer and I'm
going to call it info 2 right and then
you're going to go new print writer like
I said before print writers used to
write characters to the console to files
to anything you've actually used it for
a while with print line and print in
previous tutorials over and over and
over again then inside of that we need
to create a new and I'm actually going
to do this on a separate line create a
new buffered writer and what about food
writer does is it's going to gather a
bunch of characters and write them all
at one time
without this you would be trying to
write everything each time a new
character was needed to be generated
which is bad so we don't want to do that
and then inside of that we need to get a
new file writer and a file writers to
use to write streams of characters to a
file that's it that's what it does and
then inside of here we're going to go a
list of names get all those different
pieces there and we can close that off
and then we can also close off our try
block so basically what we did here was
we created this new file that's going to
be called list of names and we put it in
a location that we have right here and
then here we define that we want to set
up the ability to be able to write to
said file called list of names then what
we need to do we need to catch potential
error IO exception like said for E and
if this error is thrown system.out.print
line and I'm going to just send out an
error message it says n i/o error
occurred and then after that I want to
close the program because something
serious like an i/o error should
basically end the program altogether and
you do that with system exit and then at
the end here we're gonna return all and
there you are got that guy all ready to
go now we have files that we can
actually be able to create here so we
got that all set up now basically what
we're doing right now is filling the
file with information one way we can do
that I'm going to cycle through all the
different people that we created in our
customer array and I'm going to one by
one go and throw them into the file
itself and I decided to use an enhanced
for-loop and to do that we just need to
go customer which this is what it is
this is a customer object and then after
that I'm going to have the temporary
name be person and customers which is
this guy right here we're going to be
cycling through this array spitting out
customer objects and they're going to
have a temporary name of person and what
this going to do I'm going to call
another method called create customers
and I'm gonna send person which is going
to be that individual customer object
and customer output and customer output
is this guy right here so now we need to
go and create create customers and
what's this guy going to be a private
static this situation is going to be
void which means it's not going to
return anything its names create
customers and it's going to be cat and
past customer object I'm going to call
it customer and it's also going to be
past the printwriter which is going to
allow it to write to the new file so
what do I need to do pretty simple
actually I'm going to create a string
called customer info and then it's going
to go customer first name it's going to
get the value for first name for said
customer and then it's going to go
customer last name and get the value for
that field as well close that off and
then I'm going to go customer info plus
is equal to and I'm going to call the
integer to string method which is going
to turn that integer called customer age
into a string in then after we have that
all set up we can call customer output
which is the name of the printwriter the
guy that's going to allow me to be able
to write to the file and I'm going to
call print line it's print line in this
situation is going to be used to write
the file
a right to the file instead of writing
to the console like you might be used to
and in customer info is just a strength
and this guy all works that's pretty
much all you need to know if you only
want to write two files but of course
I'm sure that you'd want to read
information from files as well so I'm
going to jump in show you I'll do that
first off what probably going to want to
do here is close the printwriter since
we're not going to be writing to the
file anymore and there you are that's
how simple that is
so now we lost the connection to write
to the file that's not a problem we're
going to call another method here that
I'm going to create a second called get
file info so I'm going to copy this and
what this is going to do is read
information from the file so let's
scroll way back down here again and then
we're gonna go private static void and
get file info as you can tell I'm always
copying and pasting these guys so I
avoid any type of silly syntax errors
and then what are we going to do with
this well I think we should put a little
bit of a message out on the screen that
says what's going to be displayed so how
about we put info written to file and
I'll throw a new line in there on top of
the print line so that we have a little
bit of a gap then I need to open a
connection to the file and I'm just
going to call it list of names again and
I'm going to say new file and what are
we going to put inside here well there's
no reason to go and type all that out
again let's just scroll up here and grab
our file that we just wrote to roll back
down jump inside of there paste that in
there and then put semicolon at the end
okay so we just reopen the file and
we're going to be reading from it what
do we need to do we need to create a try
block because in this situation we
potentially could throw two different
errors and then we're going to go
buffered reader in this situation and
then what buffered reader is going to do
is it's going to read as many characters
from the file as possible before it
would make that information available
for use again this speeds everything up
I'm going to call this get info we're
going to go new offered reader and then
what are we going to do we're going to
get a new file reader
so remember file reader is going to read
each individual character and try to do
something with them that's why we're
using bufferedreader we want to grab all
the characters and then use them all at
one time we're going to list of names
that's our file then I'm going to create
a string called customer info is equal
to get info dot read line this is going
to read individual lines and save them
to the string it's very important to
know that read line only reads one line
at a time and whenever we reach the end
of the file the last thing it's going to
be sent to the read line method is null
so very very important to understand so
knowing that we can create a while loop
customer info and we can say keep
reading lines until you get to null so
that's good and if you wanted to just
simply print everything out the screen
that's real simple just go
system.out.print line
customer info and then at the end of
that after it reads that individual line
we're going to make a call so that it
goes and grabs all the other additional
lines until again it's null and for now
that's all we really need to do with
this I'm going to show you another way
of reading information here in a second
but we need to catch any potential
problems so we're going to go catch and
we're going to need to catch file not
found exception and this could be thrown
by the file reader that's why we're
specifically calling for it are we
inside of there and then in a situation
in which we can't read that file we
can't find it print line and print
couldn't find file and what do we want
to do system exit that would end our
program and let's just copy this because
we want to catch another potential
exception and that's going to be our i/o
exception
leave everything else the same except we
could say an i/o error occurred and then
and that if that situation also occurs
let's run this see what happens and
there you can see info written the file
and there is all the information that we
want to print out there's John Smith 21
and all these other additional
information now what if I wanted to
actually only pull out individual
information though well in that
situation I'm going to come up to this
while loop and we're going to change
some stuff inside of here so instead of
this guy which is going to just print
everything out screen we're just going
to comment that out then I'm going to
break all of my different lines into
pieces all the different information
that's stored in this so I'm going to
create a new string and I'm going to
call it individual customer data
customer info and I'm going to call
split and what I'm going to split it out
see it has regular expression inside of
there but I'm just
simply come in here and throw space so
everything's going to be divided up
based off of that space now of course if
they were separated by commas you just
put calm in there that's how simple that
is okay
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to create an integer called customer age
and if I want to use the age as an
integer I need to come in here and
convert it back into an integer so we're
just going to call integer parse int and
go individual customer data and the
integer is in the index of two so that's
good all right so now we got that and
then we can print out system out this is
going to the console print and we can
say customer plus copy this so I don't
have to type it out like that and let's
say I just want the first name to show
up inside of here well I'm just going to
type in 0 and then I'm going to say
something like is plus I'm going a
customer
age plus and then let's say I want to
throw a new line inside of there and
that way I'm able to pull all this
information out on an individual basis
and then execute it and there you want
customer John is 21 customer saw is 23
and so forth and so on so now you know
pretty much everything there is to know
about reading and writing character
streams two files leave any questions or
comments below otherwise the next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
