3 of my tutorial on how to make a
featured content slider for any website
including a wordpress website at the end
of the last tutorial what we had was
this basic featured content tool you see
here on the screen and a lot of people
would say you know what this is enough
if I want to offer any additional
features i'll just charge people for
that but i'm not going to do that i'm
just going to continue to add additional
features to this featured content slider
as you can see here now everything
rotates automatically and you can also
see i can still click back on these
little individual images and they're
going to stay there but then the
rotators just going to continue onwards
from that point on and also I got rid of
the little sort of clergy animation
where it's skipped now everything is
nice and smooth and in this tutorial not
only am going to show you how to make
this exact thing on the screen remember
this isn't the final feature content
tool this is just the beginning but i'm
going to show you exactly how to make
all this in this tutorial all the code
is in the underbar now all of the
changes that we're going to be making
are in the featured underscore content
jas file I Milwaukee step by step
through this guy and show you exactly
what's going on and this is what it
looked like the last time we saw it and
along the way in this tutorial I'm also
going to teach you a ton of things in
regards to how to use jQuery in really
neat ways we can actually leave these
first two parts alone inside of this
featured content or JS file but what
we're going to do here down here on line
15 is we're going to get rid of this
minus 1 because I fixed a little issue
that i had there now what this guy is
going to do is it's not only going to
return the first child thumbnail image
location inside of the featured content
tool but it's also going to return the
total number of images that way i can
use any number of images and this guy's
just going to keep on truckin so that's
what we're doing with this guy then
we're gonna have to add a new line of
code so i'm going to create another
variable and what this guy's going to do
is it's going to track the current
featured content that is being displayed
on the screen so we're gonna start off
with it being first child thumb because
that is the index the first thing that
we're going to be featuring and that's
all you got to do right there and this
guy is going to change later on in the
code and then right down here after we
add the selected class to this image i'm
going to add a click
event to all the images so that I can
automatically catch any clicks on any
images inside of this tool I'm going to
target anything inside the MTT thumbnail
frame that is an image now I'm going to
say if it is clicked on using the bind
function and then typing in click I want
this function to be called and I'm also
going to show you how to create your own
events here in a minute then on top of
that i'm going to show you a real neat
way to continually execute a function
over and over again so we're going to
use that interval what's that interval
does is it executes a function for you
within a certain period of time but what
we're going to do is we're going to tell
it to continually execute a function let
me scroll this up and that function is
going to be called rotate images and
then I'm going to use the arguments Kali
function which is a not often used
function which is really cool what it
basically does is it returns the
function that called this function over
and over and over again in essence what
it does is it continually says execute
this function rotate images over and
over and over again and then we're going
to define inside of here that we want
that to be called every four seconds or
4,000 milliseconds so that's another
neat little way to execute a function
multiple different times so now we go to
create the function rotate images and if
at any time you don't understand what
I'm doing or I miss something just leave
a comment in the comment section below
and I'll answer any questions you guys
have so now I got to grab the image that
lies in the same zero-based position as
the value of the rotator index which is
going to start off with the first item
that I have in my featured content
slider I defined this above so auntie T
thumbnail frame just so you remember
this is NT T thumbnail frame this class
arounds every single image that is on my
page so this is the guy that I'm
targeting right here what I'm going to
do with this EQ function inside of
jQuery is I'm going to say I want every
single one of those divs of that type of
class to be grabbed and more
specifically I want to grab the index
that is equal to rotator index remember
this is how you were able to put a
variable inside of here right opening
and closing those quotes and then i'm
going to say i want the image that's
associated with that so that's exactly
what's going on there then what
to do is I'm going to call the trigger
function to trigger a click event on
this image that I just grabbed here and
then what's that going to do that is
going to say call the change featured
content function because this has just
been clicked even though it necessarily
hasn't been click and then the change
featured content is going to change the
featured content that's on the screen
currently and then now i'm going to
change the value of rotator index based
off of the current featured content item
i'm going to say if it's less than or
equal to 0 i want to start over at the
first element that is on the screen and
this is going to be the highest value
for all the images that are currently on
the screen so that means if there's five
images on the screen this number is
going to be equal to five and then I
wanna say else if it's not I want to
decrement to this variable I don't want
to close that off and then I don't need
this guy anymore because I'm just not
using this the way that I previously
decided that I was going to use it I'm
going to instead create a function
called change featured content and the
event is still going to be passed and
then here I'm going to shut off the
linking ability just like we had before
and let me scroll or song I'm going to
remove the selected class from this day
of in this image and also i'm going to
set the opacity to a hundred percent for
these divs in these images but i'm also
going to add the selected class to the
div that surrounds the image and quite
simply how you do that remember this is
a reference to whatever has been clicked
so this is going to be the image that
was clicked so if i want to reference
the div that surrounds that image i just
call parent and put it on inside of
there and then that's done so now
they're both the div and the image
inside of the day we're going to have
the class selected which is going to
help me out later and then i'm going to
continue to scroll down and just touch
up a couple things here this guy before
was kind of jerky and i decided that i
don't like the way that this works so
what i'm going to do is I'm actually
going to come in here and change the way
that these guys work still going to be
operating on the featured pick which is
the big pic that is on the screen it's
going to be this guy this is the one
that I'm going to be playing with here
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a smooth animation and how I'm
going to do that is I'm going to change
multiple attributes using jquery meaning
i'm going to change the source attribute
i'm going to change the value and i'm
also doing to change the style i'm going
to set the opacity to 0 and this is
going to keep the source from changing
and then
being deleted and then coming back
slowly and that's what we did before and
it look terrible so getting rid of that
I'm going to close that off so that's
how you change multiple different
attributes inside of jQuery and the only
other thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to come in here instead of this opacity
increasing from forty percent to one
hundred percent over one second i'm
going to change it to two seconds and
that is all i needed to change to create
a much much much better featured content
tool and you may not have noticed but i
got rid of the arrows that are on here
because somebody send in a comment and
said they're stupid why would i even
have them honor and i agreed but then i
thought how can i add more functionality
to this guy so now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to have these arrows
whenever they are clicked on actually
bring in a whole brand-new set of
featured images and featured content so
I'm going to plan that in a future
tutorial and of course we're going to
eventually convert this whole entire
thing in what wordpress plugin have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below otherwise till
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
