11 of my Android development for
beginners tutorial today I'm gonna show
you how to build an interface a really
nice interface for our weather app that
we've been working on I'm gonna show you
how to draw all of the different icons
we're going to need and I'm also gonna
spend some time talking about why I
decided to layout the app the way I did
probably the easiest thing to do is to
look at the finished app so that's what
we're gonna do right now alright and
this is the final app and yes this was
completed completely in App Inventor and
in this tutorial I'm gonna show you how
I drew everything and how I decided to
lay out everything ok so now you know
what the finished app is gonna look like
and pretty much I'm actually gonna add a
couple other things to it and this is
the rough sketch that I use to create
what you just saw and what we're gonna
do here is we're gonna need to go in and
draw all of these different things so
the first thing I have here is a rain
cloud and let me zoom out here for a
second I have a rain cloud I have Sun I
have snow that's what this was supposed
to be partly cloudy this is gonna
represent a clear night this is going to
represent a foggy night or a foggy day
and this is going to be partly cloudy at
night I figured that was enough things
I'm not gonna get into tornadoes and
things like that it's gonna be a very
very functional weather app so it should
be quite neat so let's just go in here
and start drawing some stuff and I'm
inside of Inkscape of course so there
are first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna draw this rather than using the
Bezier tool which is what you would
think maybe that's what I would use I'm
going to instead use ellipse because I
think I'm gonna get much better results
if I actually draw with circles because
that's in essence what this is so I'm
holding down the shift key and yes this
is pretty much the most generic cloud
that is used all the time everywhere so
I just wanted to use it just kind of for
fun and then I'm gonna draw myself
another ellipse and hold down the shift
key and just put it down there and make
it roughly what I was looking for and
there we go and then the final circle
right here and there we go now I want to
make sure that these all line up so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to get a
grid and
get down inside of there or a little
guide I guess I should call it and if I
want to zoom in here I'll then be able
to I'm gonna hit the select tool so grab
this guy right here and I'm going to
move it up until it comes in touch with
that little guide then we'll come over
here and I'm gonna check that this also
lines up with the guide which I think
that it does okay great now what I'm
gonna do to draw a straight line down
there is I'm gonna switch over to my
rectangle tool and I'm just gonna draw a
rectangle inside of this and come down
and hopefully touch that guide there we
go and let's see how good of a job I did
or I didn't do and it looks like I did
an okay job yeah it looks pretty good
and if we zoom in here you could say
there's a slight indentation there and
there's no indentation over there okay
so I have my little cloud now what I'm
gonna do is combine everything so I'm
gonna select this ellipse hold down
shift select that then I'm gonna go to
path and Union and now they are just one
shape hold down shift get this one zoom
in path and union hold down shift zoom
in here path in Union and then finally
get the rectangle path and Union and
whenever I do that I have my cloud all
set up and it looks pretty doggone nice
now what I want to do here with this
drawing whether you can see that or not
is I wanted the drawing to be an outline
so this is gonna be black actually it's
going to end up being blue later on but
for now it's gonna be black and then
inside of here is gonna be transparent
so what I decide I want to do here is go
down and shut off the fill just by
clicking on X there we go and I have a
black stroke and then what I'm gonna do
is to open up the strokes and all that
you click on this little guy down here
and then this is gonna open up and the
stroke style let's say I take this up
the 20 I don't know and that's looking
pretty doggone close to what I was
looking for the only thing is this is
rounded off instead of coming to a point
so I'm gonna go into this I'm gonna drag
this up here drop it in and for this I'm
gonna give it a point for the join right
there and now it's a point it and it
looks perfect
all right that's exactly what I was
looking for so I'm gonna drag this down
here and one thing that I didn't talk
about is how everything's organized I
basically did this little drawing here
on
just regular old piece paper please zoom
out of this okay so I did this little
drawing right here and I used a rough
sort of like grid system that's how I
normally organize everything and then I
opened up the layers panel which of
course you can go up here to layer right
like that and then come down here and
click on layers and whatever you do the
layers little panels gonna show up over
here and there you can say and I
imported my drawing the little pen
sketch that I have right here into a
layer called drawing and then I locked
it and I'm gonna be drawing on top of it
on a new layer which of course you can
add layers just by hitting the plus sign
and I'm gonna draw on top with a little
drawing inside of there so that's what's
going on all right so now that I've
cleared up all the different things that
I think you need to know I'm going to
continue drawing my little cloud inside
of here and I personally think it's very
very very important to be able to draw
so if you're gonna do apps now what I'm
gonna do zoom in here is this is
supposed to be a representation of rain
so I'm just gonna roughly get the size
right there and then I'm going to go up
here to path and go object to path and
that's just gonna change it from being a
rectangle into being a path and all that
means is there are nodes if I switch
into the node tool see there's nodes
here so that's what's going on and I
just find it's easier to work with okay
so go back into the selection tool by
clicking s that's the selection tool if
you want to just click on that and
that's the node tool right there if you
just want to click on that now I'm going
to rotate this so select it again and
I'm just gonna rotate it without holding
down any keys and that's just gonna give
me a rough estimate of roughly what I
want that to look like now I'm gonna
hold down on this and I'm gonna click on
shift and either alt or option depending
upon what operating system you have and
I'm gonna hit the spacebar and then I
drag it over and I'ma hit spacebar again
and again and it doesn't matter that
this doesn't line up because it's a
pencil sketch so it's you know pretty
much not gonna line up again in another
space bar gonna drag this out of there
okay so I have all those drawn in there
now if I want to make sure they're all
in equal distance apart I'm just gonna
select all of them then I'm going to get
to the line and
tribute which can be found inside of
this right here so we'll just go object
align and distribute that opens up that
little panel and inside of this if I
want to make sure that they're all the
same height meaning that they all line
up on the upper edge I'm going to click
on this and if I want to make sure they
are an equal distance apart I'm gonna
click on this and there we go I didn't
have to worry about moving things around
or guides or anything else everything's
gonna work perfectly and then move those
down like that and let's just go move
the cloud out of here all together so we
can work with it without paying
attention to a little sketch underneath
now I'm kind of digging the pointedness
align this actually now this is a kind
of an accident that that happened but
just to stick with what I originally did
I'm gonna select all of them and go into
the join up here and hit the curved and
now you can see that they are all curved
ok now it comes to making this short
this one long and so forth and so on
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get the
node tool up here and I'm just gonna
select this if we zoom in and I'm just
make it go down certain number spaces
until it looks about right I do a lot of
things by eye all right so that's a
little bit better and then what I'm
gonna do something a little wacky
there's no problem if you don't like how
something starting out just delete it
I'm just gonna select this item shift
either alt or option space space space
there we go and guess what they don't
line up no problem just select them all
go over here to a line and distribute
and then I'm just gonna click onto this
to make them all line up and there we go
there's our rain cloud pretty much
exactly what we were looking for I'm
gonna zoom out of this guy I'm then also
going to grab my little cloud that I
have right here make a copy of that guy
and then drag this guy down here and now
I'm gonna make it snow so zoom in on it
what I did here was I did like a random
snow and decided and like that and so
then I made it less random so doesn't
really matter and I'm gonna come over to
the ellipse tool here and let's zoom in
a bit further so I'm sure you can see
everything all right better now what I'm
gonna do make these little circles right
here get the ellipse tool with an E hold
down shift key draw that in there like
that that looks good I'm actually going
to give this a Phil so Phil
and then we'll hold down the shift key
to get rid of the stroke shift key
stroke is going and then I'm also gonna
come up here to object or actually path
and then go object to path like that
come in here and enlarge this perfect
using a little trick with the spaces
there we go I'm gonna select both of
these same time and I'm gonna follow
this rough sort of idea here and then
correct things if I don't like the way
they turn out zoom out now I got my
little cloud select that actually it's
just select at all and drag it out here
see how this works out
there we go looking pretty good and I'm
kind of liking that it's not perfect I
could come in here and just by I changed
things a little bit and there we go
there is my snow icon so click on Z and
I'm gonna zoom out again for this guy
right here which is gonna represent a
clear night what I'm gonna do again is
use the ellipse tool and I'm going to
draw this in here perfect and then I'm
gonna go and draw another ellipse and
let's go and make this white and I think
that looks like a pretty good
representation of a moon I'm gonna
select both of them come up here to path
and I am going to say difference which
is gonna get rid of the top and there we
go have myself a moon if I really wanted
to go in here and change it so it's the
same angle I can just go and do that or
a rough representation of the same thing
like I said the thing underneath is a
sketch so it doesn't matter it doesn't
have to be precise I want to have a
little bit of fun with this alright so
there's my moon go to zoom out course if
things change I can always go in here
and change Volare along with them here
is the fog what I thought sounded like a
good way of representing fog now I'm
gonna go inside of this and draw this
circle I think that maybe it should be a
little bit thicker so I'm gonna go into
fill and Stroke and then go inside of
here and increase this let's say that I
increase it to 23 and I think that looks
a little bit better and then I'm gonna
go in here and draw these little lines
inside of here just gonna do that with
rectangle and then I'm gonna make sure
the join is curved because that's what I
have here also going to come down here
black and then hold down the shift-key
and get rid of the stroke as you can see
right there this stroke went away so out
of this throw that in there look I'm
actually gonna need the stroke so hold
down shift key gets stroke back reason
why is I want this to be curved so click
on that now it's curved and if I want it
to be curved more I can just click on
the node tool up here and then zoom in
and grab this little circle and curve it
more say it's curved more now we'll
change this back to a stroke and then
for the fill I'm gonna make it nothing
okay I'm just gonna grab this here make
a rough guess about how that should line
up and hold this down shift either alt
or option space drag this down here
space drag this down here I can select
all three of them then go over into a
line distribute if I want them to be an
equal distance apart I can click on this
guy right here for distribute there they
are they're in equal distance apart now
I'm just going to come in here and
change their size a little bit so grab
this and bring that in a little bit take
a look at that I can also come in here
drag that in there a little bit maybe
make this one a little bit shorter maybe
make this a little bit longer and there
we are sort of like this weird
approximation of fog looks interesting
and that was really the goal for
creating all these okay so I have Mamoon
done I got my fog done I got my rain
done I got all those things done
everything's looking pretty nice then we
have to go and get the little cloud with
the moon no problem let's just go and
get ourselves a cloud right here make a
copy of that bring it over here go get
this guy make copy of that again holding
down shift either alt or option and
space bring that over here I'm gonna
zoom in again and I want this to make it
look like the moon is behind the cloud
gonna shrink this down a little bit
bring it right there and I'm gonna want
to make sure that the cloud is on top so
I'm gonna click on object raise the top
right like that then I'm gonna select
both of them and then I'm gonna go path
and difference and there I got my moon
now I'm gonna zoom out of here and I can
grab this cloud up here make a copy of
it and slip it right inside of there so
I got my little effect that I was
looking for and there you go it's a
little moon coming out from behind that
cloud
and what else is there anything else you
need to do here oh yes have to do the
Sun no big deal
I'm just gonna go and steal this guy
right here drag it up here and I have
the gist for what it wants so I'm just
going to come in there like that
I'm gonna go and draw myself a rectangle
on top here
that's too much I'm gonna go over into
fill and stroke 23 fill that's way too
much let's say I make this 5 just about
perfect increase that a little bit that
looks about right and I'm a copy of it
all right here click on it once to
rotate it that looks about right we'll
make another cotwell let's move aside a
little bit hold that down make copy
there we go drag another one right there
click on it rotate it look perfect drag
that right there rotate it again and
there we go got my son done and then the
only other thing left is the Sun and the
cloud and actually you know what I'm
going to change this a little bit let's
add a little bit more of a stroke to it
changed 40 yeah that looks better to me
and then I just have to put the Sun
behind a cloud just gonna copy this go
grab himself a cloud copy that
back over the Sun make another copy and
this time I had my Sun set up so that
was on this side first I'm gonna do it
shrink it and that looks about right
let's go and change the stroke for this
change it to 20 that looks pretty good
select everything click once rotate move
this out a little bit looking pretty
good as well just go in here and delete
these mcleod I'm gonna go object and I'm
gonna say raise the top
I'm gonna go path and I'm gonna go
difference Nichkhun sees my son he'll
grab myself another cloud and there we
go I have my partly cloudy alright so
that's a rough idea of how I drew all of
these different icons now what I'm gonna
do is go and start pulling the interface
together as you can see it's right there
and I actually went and drew some of
these ahead of time just to save a
little bit of time there's a whole bunch
of these little guys just bring them
over here and then the main idea here is
to go in and lay all these pieces out
and yes in vector art here's all of them
by the way say I drew them and you can
draw all of them using exactly the same
techniques I just showed you now what I
do is in vector art I go and get all of
my icons drawn in and then I place them
into position and
then the next thing that you're gonna
want to do after you do that is you're
going to want to measure everything and
you're also gonna want to bring guides
down inside of here and you're also
gonna want to go down into preferences
and document preferences or document
properties and then go in here to guides
and make sure that snap guides while
dragging is checked and then you're just
gonna want to get all of your little
pieces move them into place after you've
drawn all of them see snapping to the
guide and there we go and of course I'm
going to let you all have all this
vector art whenever it's all done so
that everybody will be able to make the
application and of course it's free and
there we go and then you're gonna want
to go in with your text tool and type
those out get rid of the stroke of
course and if I'm gonna be using
sans-serif I'm gonna want to use a sans
serif font here and I want everything to
line up and just to make this quick I'm
just gonna put the same thing everywhere
it's just a matter of just estimating
what you want this to look like or to be
more specific I'm going to be converting
this pencil drawing into vector art
there we go rough estimate of that I can
draw in this magnifying lens later on
type in 37 and this is also by doing
this it's going to give you a rough
estimate of exactly how big your
different font should be and that's all
I'm gonna do I'm just gonna continually
go through and type out exactly what I
did with pencil inside of Inkscape and
then there is not a ruler tool inside of
Inkscape like there is inside of
illustrator but that doesn't really
matter because if you come down here way
way at the bottom let me open this up a
little bit way down here at the bottom
of the screen and there's no real way
for me to show you this but basically if
you use the gradient tool which looks
like this right here this is the
gradient tool and if I select that and
then down here what's gonna happen is
whenever I hold down the shift key and
start dragging with the gradient tool so
for example if I wanted to see how big
Pittsburgh was gonna be and how big of a
box I'm gonna have to create for it
inside of Inkscape I'm gonna hold down
my shift key and I'm gonna click at the
beginning of Pittsburgh and I'm gonna
drag drag drag drag drag and down the
bottom right hand corner under X next to
X it's gonna say 128 pixels and say
there's just no way for me to do it
you're just gonna have to play with that
on your own so then what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna do that over and over and over
again I'm gonna hold down the shift-key
with my gradient tool I'm gonna measure
out everything but we also have to think
a little bit like chance of rain well
there's going to be longer weather
descriptions than that so what I'm
thinking is it would probably make more
sense to have this be the whole way over
here to this icon well of course I would
want to use guides drag guides out like
that and then measure based off of those
guides so let's drag those two guides
out still got my gradient tool selected
and if I want to measure the distance
from here because this is gonna be a
grid it's just going to be a whole bunch
of boxes with text and pictures inside
of them I can then click here hold down
the shift key and measure out exactly
how far those different distances are
apart and then after I do that long
enough what I can end up doing is I'll
end up having exactly what the app is
supposed to look like and then I'll put
little notes as you can see right here
is 17 so I'm thinking that everywhere in
this app there's going to be a margin of
17 right here then for this little box
text box is going to allow them to enter
their city name I'm gonna say that's 256
pixels long and then the search little
button here it's gonna be 37 and then
there's gonna be a 10 pixel margin at
the end and of course I can use math to
make this work with any screen size but
I'm just using the default App Inventor
screen size right here and then I can do
that over and over and over again I'm
just going to measure again with the
gradient tool and then inside of it I'm
gonna measure the distance between this
to this and I'm gonna know that I need
to put that margin space inside of there
14 is gonna say that's how tall
Pittsburgh should be and then of course
I could get the little gradient tool and
measure out how far over it should go
actually Pittsburgh I'm going to do
width of parent so that I'll be able to
accommodate large city names and I'm
just gonna do that over and over and
over again and write down all of these
different distances in the next part of
the tutorial I'm going to take this
vector art that you see right here and
turn it into the working interface as
you saw at the beginning of the tutorial
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
