my java video tutorial series today
we're going to talk about length list
classes and a linked list is just
another collection just like the
ArrayList that you saw in the previous
tutorial if you haven't seen any of
those other tutorials you should
definitely check them out and what I'm
going to do here is just import some
libraries I need you've seen the arrays
library in the past just provides me
access to all those wonderful methods
that are available in that wonderful
class and then I'm also going to bring
in the linked list library which is
going to be needed if we're going to be
playing around with linked lists and of
course make sure you got that dot inside
of there and then this class or this
program is going to be called public
class I'm going to call it Java lesson
12 and then of lick static void main and
I'm sure you know what all those things
mean so now we can man and start working
with linked lists now a linked list in
comparison ArrayList is particularly
suited whenever you need a collection on
which you plan on adding and deleting
different objects from a lot because a
linked list is very very good at that
however it's not particularly suited
whenever you want to be providing access
to information in a collection using
indexes like we would do with an array
list not that I can't do it it just
can't do it quite as efficiently so it's
up to you to decide how you want to do
it and I'm not going to get into the
intricacies of why a linked list is
quicker than an ArrayList for doing
adding and deletion it's based off of
how the information is organized and a
linked list just doesn't really organize
things in the way that an ArrayList does
which is synchronously so if you want to
create a new linked list you just type
in linked lists and then we'll call this
linked list one and then you follow that
up with new just like you created all of
your other different objects right like
that and now like list one is going to
have access to all the methods in the
linked list class which is going to be
very very useful because there's a whole
bunch of them and just like with array
lists if you want to restrict yourself
from being able to receive certain types
of information so let's say we only want
to be able to receive strings inside of
this well you're going to label it
exactly like you did previously with ray
list by putting those brackets in there
and string or whatever other data type
you'd want to use and you just type in
linked list and then string and then
don't forget your little brackets
because this is calling the constructor
file for the
list so there we are we just created two
linked lists one that is not restricted
and the other one it is restricted in
regards to the data that are all out now
if you want to add things to it you just
call the add method and let's say I go
ahmed nani and there you are you just
added that name to the linked list and
you could also come in here call add
again of course Ali Saeed there you are
now you just added those two names to
the guy and with a linked list you can
still use the enhanced for-loop of
course so let's just go in here and go
string and then we'll go name and then
names which is the array and then we're
just going to go system.out.print line
and type name inside of there and you
can see here if I execute that exactly
what's going on and yes what it is just
put out those two names that I've
already added to it pretty simple but
there are a bunch of different types of
methods inside of this so let's say that
you want to add a name and you want it
to be the last name in your list just
type in again names which is your linked
list and then type in add last and then
let's say you want to type in Nathan
Martin I know and these names are all
round I'm just made up so that will put
it at the end of your length list and
you can see right there it did it and if
you wanted to added another object but
you wanted it to be the first in your
list well you could type in Joshua Smith
for example and you can see that it
through Joshua Smith in here in the very
very first position there's tons of
methods like this we scroll it up here
you can also define the position that
you want to place the object and we're
in this situation we're going to use the
add method again except we're going to
type in zero for an index position you
still refer to everything as indexes and
let's say you want to put Noah Peters
inside of there no problem now Noah
Peters is in the zero index position you
can also replace about value inside of
an index with another method and this
one's called set so let's say in the two
index position I want to put in Paul
Newman that is how I would do it and
there's Paul Newman and this is zero
index one two three four just like with
any of these other types of lists or
collections that we've seen everything's
a zero index and you can remove items
using the remove function there's a
couple different ways like let's say you
want to remove the
for index and if you wanted to remove
something based off of the actual value
well this is how you would do both of
those so let's just type in Ottawa Smith
and make sure you put a value in there
otherwise they ain't going to work and
you can see whenever I run this that
Nathan Martin is going to disappear as
well as Joshua Smith and that's exactly
what happened so there's the remove
function another way you can retrieve
values is you can use system.out.print
line and let's throw a new line inside
of here so everything's divided up nice
and let's say we want to get the first
index value like that and then you just
go names get and the index that you want
to be retrieved and there it is first
index is Noah Peters and there is the
first index so this is a little bit
easier to understand I'm actually gonna
get rid of that and jump down here past
our enhanced for-loop
I'm going to show you a whole bunch of
these guys do a lot of coffee and and
paste in here paste that in there and
let's say you wanted to get the last
index you just replace get with get last
however make sure you get rid of that
index value in there and there it comes
up and then if you'd want to create a
new linked list and give it all the
values that another linked list already
has that's quite simple just make sure
that you define it in exactly the same
way so let's say I want to copy the name
linked list go new linked list string
say everything's defined exactly the
same way except in the constructor
you're gonna type in names which is the
linked list that we want to copy and
then let's say you want to print that
out just to make sure that everything
showed up right well let's just go name
copy right like that and you can just
type in name copy and it's going to
automatically print that out for you
however with the weird brackets like the
ArrayList does as you see right there
st. printed out everything so you know
everything copied itself real nice
exactly the way we want you could also
do an if statement and go names contains
and see if the names linked list
actually contains let's try Noah meters
which we know it does and in the
situation where it does contain Noah
Peters you could say something like
Noah's here we make sure we put our
brackets in there if you can execute it
and you can see Noah's here pops up
because Noah Peters is inside of that
linked list and that was all brought to
you because of the wonderful method
named contains you could also do
checks to see if linked lists actually
have exactly the same values so we can
go names we can go contains all so in a
situation we're going to check if the
names linked list has all of the values
that are in name copy which we know the
answer to that's going to be positive so
let's just say something like
collections the same and of course you
know what's going to print out there
because we already did that
you could also return the index for an
object real simply so let's say we want
to find the index for ollie right here
well we'll just come in here and go Ally
index at like and then we'll just go and
use the names link list again and we're
going to go index of and then in this
situation we'll type in Ollie Sayid
right like that just make sure that you
put a lease I eat in here because if you
only put Ollie for example it's not
going to kick back positive value and
there it is Ally index app two zero one
two right there you get good with these
different libraries there's a
never-ending supply of tools that are
available too it's really cool you can
also check if a the list would be empty
or not let's just go
list empty and we'll check if names is
empty for example so you just type in is
empty like that and you can say list is
empty no that comes back as false this
kicks back a boolean value which is
either true or false you could also get
the number of items that are in one of
these guys let's say for example let's
just type in how many and we'll type in
size just like worked with the array
list that's also going to work here and
it says there's three in there and as
you can see there are indeed three in
there another thing you can do if you go
and you try to retrieve a value for
example and that nothing exists it's
going to throw an error so these linked
lists they come with a method that's
called peek so let's just do look
without error and if you do a peek what
it's going to do is it's going to check
to see if there is a value to retrieve
meaning is there a first element inside
of this and if not it's just going to
return null otherwise if you would try
to do this with get it would return an
error so that's a goofy reason why you
might want to go and use peek instead of
get if you want to avoid errors of
course we've already gone over
handling in the past you know how to do
that another thing you can do if you
wanted to actually retrieve the first
value or the first index inside of this
guy and then you wanted to delete it so
let's just say remove first element and
you're going to get more into this later
on whenever we start getting in more
advanced things in this situation let's
just say name coffee let's start messing
around with our coffee linked list come
in here you would type in poll so that's
going to take the first element it's
going to shoot it out the screen and
then it's going to delete it from the
linked list and you know our remove
first element Noah Peters no longer
exists in this guy and if I printed it
out you would see that that definitely
was true you can also pretty much do the
same thing except you're going to
retrieve say the last value that's real
simple let's type in poll last instead
and it's going to delete the last
element inside of this linked list and
it's also going to print it out to
screen for you so that you know what
you're working with it says first there
and that's just because then change this
change that and just give me a little
bit more space and do that another thing
you can do now let's just go and mainly
just manipulate name copy you can push a
new value onto the front of the list
let's just type in Noah Peters actually
I'm just going to delete these all out
if you want all this code it's available
underneath the video it's heavily
commented and I'm going to jump up here
and get this enhanced for-loop throw it
after that and I'm going to type in name
copy instead and you can see that I
pushed Noah Peters back onto the front
of here and since I didn't drop it from
before there's two of them in there now
so that makes it seem like a great time
to run named coffee pop and what that's
going to do is it's going to actually
chop off the first element see Noah
Peters is no longer there also get rid
of these guys and then again you could
also come in here and create yourself an
array like we did before save these out
as an array so let's just create an
object array let's call it name array is
equal to new and we're going to go
object again and we're going to say
we're going to put four items inside of
this wonderful new array and then we go
new array is equal to let's call the
names linked list call to array like we
did before what that's going to do is
it's going to convert the names linked
list into an array item now we do
system out here if we want to print this
out the screen we could do something
like call the arrays library and then
the to string method and call name rain
printed out the screen which is the
array that we just created for me and I
have one too many brackets inside of
there no problem got rid of it then we
can execute it and you can see it
printed out that array right there on
the screen right underneath of it then
the final thing this is pretty much
every single thing you do with a linked
list if you want to delete every single
thing that's in the linked list you call
the clear method that's pretty much
everything you're an expert on linked
lists inside of Java leave any questions
or comments below otherwise until next
