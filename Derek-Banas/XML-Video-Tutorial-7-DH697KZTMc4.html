my XML video tutorial series this is
going to be the final part so you better
believe I'm gonna be covered a lot of
things here first thing I'm going to do
is go and open up the schema file that
we created in the last part of the
tutorial however I'm gonna do in a new
way and right click on it go open with
and I'm gonna go other something that's
built inside of Eclipse is a schema
editor and it allows you to do all kinds
of really cool things and it's right
here on your screen if you can't see
this view at full screen I'm gonna hit
OK and now you can see everything here
that we've created in the last part of
the tutorial however if I come down way
down here in the bottom left-hand corner
and click on design you're gonna see
that a much more interesting window here
opens up on our screen and we can zoom
in on it you can see here's all of the
different elements that we created
previously and here are all the
different types that we created
previously and we're also going to
create some groups and some attributes a
whole bunch of other different things in
this part of the tutorial but I'm going
to first jump back into source because
one of the questions I received is is
there a way to make an element that
could accept more than one data type and
yes indeed there is and one way you
could create something like that is to
use a union I'm just going to create
here a simple type just like we've been
using before and let's say for example
we went inside of here and we were
grabbing and storing the last tweet well
let's say we also were storing the last
thing the person put on Facebook for
example so what I'm going to put inside
of here is message to fans and this is
in the XML schema file and then inside
of there we're going to create a union
and that just simply means it's going to
accept more than one type of data just
type in member types is equal to and
then inside of here you would put the
different types that you would want to
accept and like I said I didn't make a
Facebook message but you could make one
in pretty much exactly the same way that
we made the Twitter message and there
you go right there you would be able to
create those customized data types
inside of here now another thing we're
going to do is I'm going to jump over
here to source again and I'm going to
take my schema file and I'm going to
create an XML file based off of it so
I'm just going to go new and then click
other and then inside of the little
wizard it opens up click on XML file and
click on next and I'm going to call this
baseball players as well and then click
Next and then this is
the important part right here where it
says create an XML file from an XML
schema file we want to click on that
then we're going to click on next and
then we have to locate the schema file
so we're going to go in the source
directory baseball players right there
click on next and everything that pops
up is fine so click on finish and you
can see right here it automatically
created that XML file for us and I'm
just going to clean things up here a
little bit but I don't really need to
change anything one thing I am gonna do
though is I'm going to save this and
then close it and then come right back
over here again baseball players XML I'm
going to go open with come down here to
other and then in this situation I'm
going to open I it up in an XML editor
that's built into eclipse all of these
things are built into eclipse just make
sure you click on XML editor instead of
XML schema editor and then click on OK
now just like before we're going to be
able to come down here to design click
on that and automatically it's going to
allow us to put all types of different
information inside of this file and just
to do that just come in here and go add
child and then we could do batting
average for example and it's
automatically going to throw it inside
of there and then we would be able to
come in here and edit all kinds of
different information just going to have
to come over here and then create a
batting average so let's just say 0.2 4
5 doesn't matter what we do hit enter
and then if we bump back out here to
source you're going to see that it
automatically added that directly into
the XML file now of course inside of
here you can still edit the XML files
just like we did before ntt baseball
player and then type in player name and
then type in Paul Smith I don't know I'm
just making up something and you can do
it either way and then if you save that
and then bounce over into the design
section you're going to see that player
name automatically updates inside of
there and there's Paul Smith so there's
multiple different ways to add all of
this different XML information into the
XML file after you create it but I'm
going to jump back over into this editor
and show you exactly how to create all
of these different types inside of here
so we're going to jump into design again
and the next thing I want to do is I
want to make a complex type now unlike
simple types a complex type is going to
allow you to contain child elements as
well as attributes and to start off
you're going to start real simple let's
say for example you want to define an
element that only contains one data type
value exactly like a simple type element
would however it is going to allow you
to add on an attribute unlike a simple
content with what we're going to do here
to make life real simple as I'm just
going to write
click up inside of here and I'm going to
click on add complex type and it shows
up right here double click on it and
there it is now I'm going to right click
on this come down here where it says set
base type because you have to base all
of your complex types off of types that
already exist click on that and then
over here it's going to show you all the
different types that are available to
you well I'm going to base it off of an
integer and the only difference between
an int and an integer is precision just
so you know that you can use either one
I'm just going to use the integer here
and there you can see the integer popped
up right there and now if you'd like to
add an attribute as well to this guy
just right click on it and click on add
attribute and then give it an attribute
name in this situation I'm going to say
home state like that and I'm going to
allow it to remain a string bounce out
we can file save it I sort of use the
source in the design section both at the
same time and you can see way down here
or everything is going to be defined
inside of here there's the attribute the
integer that we just created however I'm
going to throw this inside of an element
itself so I'm just going to go excess
element and then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to copy this part or cut it
paste it inside of there there's the
element that's going to pop up and there
you go you just created your first
complex type that is going to be based
off of integer and it's going to have an
attribute and it also would probably
make sense to give it a good name like
you're born and that is exactly what we
got there now if you would like to also
create an element that will contain only
elements the perfect tag for you is
going to be what is called the complex
tag and you're also going to use a new
guy that's called sequence and sequence
defines the order the elements are
expected to be in whenever a user would
enter them so here I'm going to type
everything and even though it's a little
bit slower XS element and I'm going to
say the name is going to be equal to
best friend I'm in the schema file and
then remember we're going to use a
complex type and all of the code that is
here on this screen is available in a
link underneath the video you should get
it because it's heavily commented it'll
help you really learn this stuff and
then you're going to define using
sequence the exact order that all this
needs to be placed in here and then like
I said before you can throw in as many
elements as you want name first name and
then remember you have to still define
what the type is going to be which is
going to be a string and then you need
to close it off and then if we also want
to add another element inside of there
because that's the whole point of this
let's just say last
and leave that be a string so that's
exactly how you would define all that
stuff and if you don't care how the
elements are ordered it's real simple
you'd have to do inside of here is
instead of putting sequins inside of
there just put all inside of there
instead and that would allow you to not
care about the order than any of the
elements are entered and also another
thing if you don't care about the order
but you definitely want these elements
to be included just inside of here
you're going to go men occurs and then
you could throw in one inside of there
and that's going to guarantee that those
are going to be included inside of there
and then if you wanted to limit the
number of these elements that would be
listed of course in this situation there
would be only one but you let's say you
only wanted to have five last names
total entered well that's exactly how
you do that using max occurs and both of
these guys by default are one just so
you know that as well so there we are we
just created another one so let's go
create ourselves some more custom types
okay now the next one I'm going to
create is going to also be a complex
type however it's going to be what we
call a named type and the reason why you
would use a named type is whenever you
wanted to define any type of data type
you'd want to use in your XML files but
however you'd like them to be able to be
used not once but as many times as
possible see these guys are going to
only be used once in this situation
we're going to create ones that can be
used multiple times so just jump into
design and I'm just going to come in
here and go add complex type again
double click right here and then again
I'm going to extend this guy so just
right click on it come down here to set
base type and I'm going to base this one
off of a decimal just click on decimal
click okay I've got that all set up now
and I'm also going to come in here and
add an attribute to it and this is going
to be a year and then this is going to
be data type and I'm just going to like
I said before I'm just going to use aunt
Nellie difference between int and
integer is precision int is a 32-bit an
integer is supposed to be indefinite but
that's not really necessarily true and
if we bounce back over into our source
you can see here's our new complex type
we created and then I'm going to name
this percent stat and I can let
everything else here be exactly the same
and now that I have percent stat created
inside of here I can actually use it as
a data type that's exactly what it is
just like I use decimal here and in this
situation I'm just going to type it out
so excess I'm going to call this a
complex
and give it a name of batting stats and
inside of here I'm going to create a
sequence again it's just defining what
you want to use and in what order you
want them to be used and then I'm going
to throw an element inside of here and
the name is going to be batting average
right like that and then my dad at time
is going to be an TT BP percent stats
just like we had before
we're actually stat just like we've
defined right here in this customized
guy close off that element and let's say
I wanted to create another one of those
guys easy enough just do that and we'll
just go on base percentage just to keep
it short like that and then leave this
as percent stat and there you go now you
just used your customized type inside of
a complex element that you've created
here inside of your XML schema file now
if you'd also want to use batting stats
as an element but you'd also want to
jump in here and add a couple more
elements to it that's also very easy to
do we're just going to go X s complex
type name is equal to and I'm going to
call this more batting stats like that
let me go X X complex content remember
we need to extend using this guy right
here say this is an element you can use
this just like anything you can extend
it just like you've extended other
things
I'm gonna go xx extension what am I
gonna base it off of well I'm going to
base it off of this guy right here
batting stats which we just created and
then I'm going to type in a sequence
right like this and then throw another
element inside of this so this is I'm
making this about as complicated as
possible just to cover just about
everything and there's slugging
percentage and then in this situation
I'm going to type float and there's the
end of that element there's the end of
the sequence and there you are you just
created a really complicated sort of
system this guy is using a customized
data type which you've created above
percent stat and then you took that
complicated element and you added
slugging percentage to it as an
additional element so throw it in pretty
much everything imaginable now if you'd
also like to use a group of elements
throughout a document well we're
actually going to go into the design you
don't need to you can do it anywhere you
want but if you wanted to go in the
design area come down here to groups and
click Add group there's a new one double
click on it and it's already gonna have
a sequence inside of here and I'm just
going to start adding some elements to
it so add an element I'm gonna call this
at that time and it's going to be
date time type click on that come in
here again add element at that balls and
what I'm doing here is I'm actually
tracking performance based off of
pictures and things like that add
another element you can come in here you
can add an element before you've defined
another element you can do whatever you
want at that case it's also going to be
an integer and then we can go at that
result and that's going to be a string
and there you go you just created your
group jump over into source and I'm
going to call this guy at that group and
there you go you just created a group
that you can use throughout your whole
entire schema file kind of cool and then
right here I'm going to create the guy
so I'm going to go X s element and name
and in this situation I'm going to take
a picture and I'm going to put in the
performance of the batter versus that
pitcher so I'm going to call this at-bat
pitcher like this and again this is a
complex type then I'm going to take my
group that I just defined X s group and
then I need to reference the group just
by plugging in the name of the group so
ntt EP at that group and it's going to
throw all those elements inside of there
for me to use close that off like that
and then I'm going to add an attribute
to it like I said I'm pulling out all
the stops here I'm going to give it a
name of Petra name and that is going to
be of type strength and if you want to
require that this pitchers name be
entered every single time you're going
to say use required and then of course
you want to close that off and there you
go you just create another element that
is going to pull in all these elements
from this group and you can also create
a group of attributes just like you did
here with the group of elements excess
attribute I think you can tell that it's
easier to create all this stuff in the
design view but I'm creating it here
just so that it's easier for you to
understand exactly the nuts and bolts of
what's going on so here you are we're
going to create an attribute group and
you're just going to fill it up with
attributes will say player height and
it's of type string and then let's say
that we want to also track their weight
there you go and then this is going to
be of type integer and now if you want
to use this attribute group inside of an
element no problem just go access
element actually I'll create this in the
design view so you can see how that
works click on design and
I'm going to add an element here so I'm
going to right-click and I'm gonna click
on add complex type double click on it
and there it is right click on it and
then I'm going to click on add attribute
group reference and there you go
there was only one and it was smart
enough to know to throw them both in
there pretty cool jump back into the
source role way down here and there you
go
only thing I don't like about this is it
throws everything on one line but there
might be a way to fix that I just
haven't come across to yet and then if
you would like to throw this inside of
an element itself no problem just go
access elements name is equal to layer
size and then we'll just get rid of this
gone and then take this closing bracket
and throw it at the end and if we file
save this and jump over into baseball
players XML you can see here whenever we
go add child right here all the
different elements that we've just
defined inside of our XML schema file
and I trust that you'll be able to
understand exactly how to enter all
those if not or if you need any help
with that
like I said click on the link underneath
and it not only will show you the finish
XML schema file but it's also going to
show you the XML file leave any
questions or comments below
up next I'm going to do a review of
object oriented programming and then
write in the design patterns like you
guys asked till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
