my java video tutorial series today
we're going to talk about the object
class in the class class and go through
every method that any object or class
that you ever create automatically
receives by default and here I just went
in to find beginning of my class and
here's my main function you've seen that
million times so there's no reason to go
over it what you have to understand is
every object you ever create inherits
all the methods of a class known as the
object class and here we're going to
create an object this is like the
superest of super classes and if you
haven't seen the other videos you should
definitely check them out there's a link
underneath of this video that's going to
help you better understand this code now
here what I'm doing is I'm creating an
object called super car and I'm
assigning that is of type a vehicle
however the code in general the Java
interpreter is going to see supercar as
of type object inside of this now
supercar is going to inherit all the
object methods but an object of class
object can't access the vehicle methods
now we previously had gone over this but
I think it's important to do it again so
for example if I would go supercar and I
would say get speed this is not going to
be allowed even though the get speed
method is defined inside a vehicle say
right here get speed but this is not
looked upon as if it is a vehicle it is
looked upon as if it is a object now if
we wanted to be able to get at this
information could we do it yes we could
we need to cast it I know I've talked
about this previously but it's very
important that you understand it so if I
wanted to say that I want this to be
looked upon as a vehicle this is exactly
what I would do and then I put that
inside of there and then everything
would be peachy and whenever I execute
this it's going to print out the get
speed turn value which is zero point
zero there it is so that's how you would
be able to use it as an object however
cast it to being a vehicle if you ever
needed to do that so let's go in here
and actually create a vehicle and let's
call it super truck is equal to new
vehicle and make sure that I have this
uppercase otherwise it's going to get
confused now I can use a built in object
method called the equals method just
print that out there and then we can do
something like put in supercar and see
if it equals super truck this will
ways that you could come in here and
compare to see whether one object is
equal to another object and as you can
see it returns false because they are
two separate objects so there's an
equals method and there's a whole bunch
of these different things what you have
to understand is each time you create a
new object it creates an unique
identifier for that object and that
unique identifier is called a hash code
so if I wanted to find out what super
cars hash code was easily enough I just
type that there it's going to print out
a unique number and there it is and you
might think this is some arbitrary crazy
thing but once you start doing more
advanced Java programs you indeed are
going to use things like hash codes very
often there's another function it's
called finalize inside of Java and what
it does is it's actually a method that
the Java garbage collector calls
whenever you no longer need an object in
memory and it goes in and cleans it up
gets rid of that extra space in memory
you could technically call it yourself
but there's really no point in it
because there's no guarantee that it's
actually going to execute so just leave
the Java garbage collection for Java
another thing you could do is call the
get class method so if I call supercar
get class like this what it's going to
do is it's going to print out the class
for set object make sure I put super car
instead of super and you can see indeed
it does know it's a vehicle even though
I defined it as an object up here say
smart enough to figure that out well
then you have the class object and a
whole bunch of methods that are
available inside of it one of those
being a method called get name which
returns one thing which is the name of
the class so instead of printing out
class there and before vehicle it's just
going to get right to the point however
you're going to have to go super car and
you're gonna have to go get class and
then after that call get name if you
call get name directly it does not go
and execute that code and you can see it
prints out vehicle just like that you
could also come in and check if two
objects are of the same class and this
is a slightly more complicated saying
goes super car get glass like that and
then use the equal sign and then type in
super truck get class right like that
and then in the situation which they
would be the same this would print out
which indeed it would because they are
both of the same class type and you
could say that the same prints out there
these are
all kind of like things you just have to
learn because as time goes by it's going
to be very important that you understand
what methods you have available to you
so you can save yourself a lot of time
you could also call the get superclass
method now again you're going to have to
come in here and do this sort of thing
right here call get class first like
that and then it's going to be super
class and there's no reason to put a
capital C inside of this guy right like
that
and in that situation it's going to
print out crash about because that was
indeed the superclass for type vehicle
now there's another method called the
two string method now if you just call
two string on a regular object it's
going to print out information it's not
particularly useful so that's why two
string is very often overwritten anytime
that you might want to use it if you
want to overwrite it you're going to
have to go into the actual class type
for vehicle in this situation and we're
going to come in here and just go public
string because it returns a string and
call to string we're going to overwrite
this guy so let's say for example you'd
want it to return numb of wheels just as
a for instance this of wheels and that's
exactly what it is now somebody would
come in here and call super car dot to
string it's going to call that new a
written method that you put in there say
number of wheels if you wouldn't have
done that it would have printed out a
bunch of garbage and as I've shown you
in the past very common thing that
you're going to see is that primitives
are converted into strings with the to
string method and you do that by
figuring out what type of primitive
you're going to print out in this
situation it's going to be an integer
and then you call the to string method
and you pass the primitive to it right
like that and in that situation it's
going to print out a hundred let's get
in a little bit more crazy stuff like
the clone method now what clone allows
you to do is copy the current values and
everything of an object at a certain
point in time and assign it to another
however you have to understand that if
you make changes to one of the clones
after you create this brand-new clone
they are not going to affect each other
after that original clone so for
instance if you made a clone of a
certain person and then you punch the
original version in the nose that's not
in any way going to affect the other
clones exactly what it is
it's a clone now if you want to be able
to clone vehicles in this situation
there's a couple things you need to do
so
first off you need to go into vehicle
and then after implements you know put a
comma in this situation and you're going
to have to define that it should be a
cloneable method or a cloneable class so
you did that then what you're going to
have to do and this is going to be every
time you want to make something
cloneable you're going to have to define
a method called clone and public object
clone because it's going to return an
object and it's not just that simple
because you're going to have to it's a
weird thing with Java you're going to
have to catch an exception called the
clone not supported exception and this
exception has to be checked even though
it's technically never going to be
thrown because it's one of those
exceptions that is checked by the
compiler so that's just some goofiness
you need to do so if we're going to make
an object of type V equal and then we
got a call try and then you're going to
go car is equal to and you know vehicle
we're going to cast this to type vehicle
then we're going to call super clone and
then like I said you technically have to
do this you could catch all exceptions
here but this is the exception that it
wants you to collect specifically so
there's a little bit of a return to
handling errors and just to be safe
we'll just go return null and then in a
situation with that exceptions not a
problem we're gonna go return car and
that's what you're going to have to do
every single time you want to be able to
use one of these guys and we'll save
that and now we can make clones of
objects so the first thing we're going
to do is I'm going to go into super
truck and I'm going to set wheels to six
and then I'm going to go vehicle super
truck two is equal to and I'm going to
make a clone of the original then you're
going to have to put vehicle in front of
here to cast it because it's going to
return an object of type object and I'm
gonna call the clone method and just
save that for a second jump back over
here just so you know what I mean you
can see here it is returning an object
of type object so you need to always
convert it into a vehicle right here
with this casting tool if you want to
have everything set up properly then I
could do something like super truck get
wheels copy that and in this situation
want to put super truck to and you're
going to say that it's going to get the
value that I defined here for wheels and
not the default so there's proof that it
is a clone or at least to a certain
extent so let's come in here and do some
more interests
things let's say just to prove that
super truck and super truck 2 are indeed
completely different objects how can you
do that well I'm going to call hash code
on it and put super truck - and then
hash code again and whenever I call it
remember objects have a unique number
that defines them you're going to see
that both of these are completely
different and indeed they are kind of
similar but completely different just to
understand whenever you clone an object
if you like for example have an object
inside of another object so you have
object a and then inside of object a you
have a sub object B you are not going to
make a copy of sub object B that's a
thing that clone does not do by default
but this is kind of a complicated
concept we're gonna get into later C if
you don't get that don't worry about it
because most people don't but I'll cover
it later on whenever it becomes more of
an issue so those are a whole bunch of
different built in methods that come
with the object in class class leave any
questions or comments below next we're
going to go into threads and we're going
to be getting into more exciting things
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
