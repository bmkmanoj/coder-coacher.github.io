scripting tutorial today I'm going to
teach you a lot about event handlers
we're going to be using this same
webpage right here and I know it's
simple but that's because there's a
whole lot of complicated things going on
in the background to teach you a whole
bunch of things about and then handlers
like I said first off what we're going
to do here if you reload this webpage
you can see that the focus has gone into
this specific textbox
well why is that the reason why is this
code right here within the body tag I
set it on load which means on web page
load I want you to set the focus with
the function that's right here to the
text box that has the identification
name of Nahum and that's exactly what
the identification name is for this text
box also and I would never do this but
there is an event handler that allows
you to say when somebody is leaving your
webpage meaning they're going to trigger
the on unload event handler you want
your web page to open up an alert box
saying for example please don't leave
I would never do this but just for
completionists reasons I'm showing this
this event handler also what I did if I
scroll out here I set it up so that adds
the height of the webpage changes
automatically my image resizes there's a
whole bunch of different things you can
do with this so that's another event
handler on resize now I also created a
div and placed an image into it you can
see all kinds of event handlers are
being triggered I'm going to show you
which ones those are but first off I
created an image tag I gave it an
identification name logo in this example
and I said that the location of the
image I want them to load with what page
loads up is this little blue brain right
here this is where it's located
here's alt text if you know what I'm
talking about it this all looks foreign
to you which my HTML tutorial then I use
them on mouse over event handler and the
document object and the function get
element by ID and past it the name of
this
right here and said that I want to
change the image source to this new
image and you can see here if I roll my
mouse overtop of that image it
automatically changes but why does it
change back well it changes back because
I use the on Mouse out of end handler to
call back the original image and place
it right there on the screen so that's
how you use onmouseover and onmouseout
event handlers then I created another
div area and put within it a button
that's going to trigger certain actions
whatever this button is clicked in this
case it's going to open an alert box as
you can see up here so how did I do that
well I used an on click event handler
followed by in double quotes the calling
of this alert function which opens up an
alert box on my screen and then I close
to dead now is when we're going to start
checking the text that people enter in
to make sure that it's valid I need to
scroll out here let's reload this window
again now if somebody because the focus
remember is set to this box if somebody
leaves that text area you can see this
value right here pop up let's do that
again see how it popped up this is
called your helper text
well what I'm doing in this field right
here is I'm saying when somebody leaves
the text box let's do it again you can
see the help protect popped up there
when somebody leaves that text box area
I want the onblur event handler to occur
and the on blur means leaving text area
just like you saw right there and
whenever somebody leaves that text area
it's going to call this function right
here which is the is the field empty
function and it's going to pass the
identification number for this text
that's either entered or not entered and
then it's going to pass an
identification name for the helper text
using the document object followed by
the get element by ID function just like
before and then I create a span inside
of the div and I give it the name name
underscore help so that's what that div
does and that also is what all of these
other divs
except for this down here I have set an
alarm button in which when somebody
presses that alarm after a certain
period of time an alert box book and you
can see the code right here for this
event I again trigger an on click of the
button element that's there and then I
said whenever the mouse is clicked I
want you to wait a certain period of
time
in this case 3,000 milliseconds or three
seconds and I want you to open alert box
that states three seconds in it you can
see that all right there again the
function you call to trigger an event
after a certain period of time is the
set time outlet and that is basically
everything that this webpage does
however I don't have the time to go
through all of the functions that this
little guy here calls but I will in the
next tutorial and then also teach you
about a subject that's hard to
understand which is regular expressions
so see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
