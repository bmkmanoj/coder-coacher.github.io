my java video tutorial series today I'm
going to show you how to read and write
binary streams now in the previous
tutorial shows you how to write out
character streams and how it basically
differs is that when you write out a
binary stream you have to read or write
through a file using different methods
based off of the type of data you want
to write to that file so it's a
different way of manipulating data now
what I need to do here I'm going to try
and keep this very similar to what we
previously did in the last tutorial so
what are we gonna do we're going to
create an array of customers and then
we're gonna call a function called get
customers it's gonna populate this array
with these customer objects now whenever
we jump outside of main down here we're
gonna have to create private static
class customer like we did in the
previous tutorial however there's going
to be completely different types of
information in here we're gonna go
public we're gonna create a string and
it's gonna be the customers name and
then we're gonna create an integer and
it's gonna be the customer's age and
then we're gonna also create a double
and it's gonna be customers debt that
they owe us and then public gonna create
a boolean and it is gonna be true or
false do they owe us money or not and
then we're gonna create just a simple
character which is gonna represent the
sex for the customer now that we have
all those created inside of this
customer class we're gonna create our
constructor that's gonna create all of
our customer objects a whole bunch of
things gonna get printed inside of here
let's just cut this down and try to save
ourselves a little bit of time paste
that in there cut this down to that
change this into a coma and there we are
so now all that information is gonna get
passed into this constructor called
customer then we're gonna paste all that
in there again
then we're just gonna put this customer
name is equal to and then that's gonna
be customer name and this again is a
reference to the actual object that's
being created here and I'm just gonna
copy and paste these in here and then
throw semicolons at the end okay and
that is all our customer class is gonna
need to do is to define all those
different things but then what we're
gonna have to do is create get customers
because we have that guy right here so
we're gonna create that now I can go end
of customer glass just so I know what
I'm doing here scroll that up and then
I'm gonna go private static and this is
going to return an array of customer
objects and we're gonna go get customers
nothing's going to be passed to it and
then we're gonna go customer create that
array call it customers is equal to new
customer and again we're gonna define
that there's gonna be five of those so
just like we did in the previous
tutorial and then we're gonna go
customers bracket it's gonna be 0 is
equal to new customer and in here I'm
just gonna put in a bunch of random
names sage 21 say he owes us $12.25 say
that it's true that he does owe us money
obviously and then say that he's male so
then we'll take all these guys one two
we aren't created five of them just
assign these different index values like
that and then let's just go Paul sooo
finally mark and I'm just gonna leave
everything else the same cuz that
doesn't even matter then after we get
all of that information assign those
array we just need to go return
customers and then what's that gonna do
it's gonna return this nice array full
of customer objects to this array right
here and then we're gonna be able to use
it all right the next thing we need to
do there's all completely different
methods here that we're gonna be using
we need to create a data output stream
and what this allows you to do is print
primitive data types to a file whenever
you're working with binary streams the
data type is very important so that
output stream I'm gonna call it customer
output just like we did before is equal
to and then we need to go create file
and then inside of here I'm gonna paste
the location of my file and I'm giving
it the extension dat and that's
basically all that I need to do there so
now what am I gonna do I'm gonna come in
here and create an enhanced for-loop
and it's going to accept customer
objects temporary holding space is gonna
be person as we cycle through these guys
and then I'm gonna go customers which is
going to be the array that I'm gonna be
cycling through I know a lot of you guys
probably already know that but I like to
just review create customers I'm gonna
pass with the value 4 person and I'm
also going to pass a customer output so
that it's gonna be able to save this
information in a file so now what do I
need to do I need to
create customers as well as create file
create this method and also create this
one so of course I'm going to create
file first it bounced down here and I'm
gonna go private again so I don't want
anybody to be able to access this except
for the class itself
I'm gonna go data output stream which is
going to be the data type that's gonna
be returned
I'm gonna go create file and what's
being passed a string with the file name
inside of it and then I need to wrap all
this stuff inside of a try block because
what happens if I can't find the file an
exception occurs and all kinds of
problems and so so we're gonna go file
and I'm gonna say list of names is equal
to new file and then I'm gonna pass it
the name of my file that I want it to
open and like before this is just gonna
create a file object that allows me to
work with the files on the hard drive
and there's really no difference between
file for character or binary streams for
reading or writing so there's really
nothing you need to know there I'm just
accessing the file just like before and
then I'm gonna go data output stream I'm
gonna call it info to write is equal to
new in the data output stream just like
before is used to write primitive data
to the file bounced down here I'm gonna
go new buffered output stream and what
that do it just gathers the information
into a buffer or a packet so that
everything is passed all at one time
instead of individually and then I'm
gonna go new file output stream and I'm
gonna pass it list of names bounced down
at the end of there like that
now I skipped over this before but this
works every single time whenever you're
working with files of any type if we
just do what we do right here what this
is going to do is overwrite anything
that is currently existence so for
example if a file already exists it's
gonna overwrite it and that would be
exactly the same as if I would go list
of names for example like that and put
false that's going to create a new file
however if I put true inside of there
that is going to append all of this data
that I'm going to pass to this file to
the end of whatever exists there now
that's important to know and just like
before a file output streams used to
write streams of data to the file so now
what are we gonna do we're gonna go
return info to write and we're gonna be
able to pass back the ability to be able
to write to this file that we create
it's gonna throw you inside of there and
what I'm gonna do is just go system out
green line and I'm just gonna type in IO
error that and then I'm gonna go system
exit and kill the program altogether if
that occurs and I was asked before why
do I put return null down here the
reason why is this expects a return type
right here so the only way it's gonna be
able to return something is if no error
occurs and so forth and so on that's why
we need to put return all down here it's
more of a compiler issue than anything
else so info to rights been returned
everything's going wonderful and all
that is passed back to what we have here
as customer output now we need to call
create customers and it's going to shoot
all of the information about individual
people to the customer output which is
going to save it to the file so we need
to create create customers and I like to
just close off everything here I don't
know about you but I sometimes get
confused so I like to put in things like
that's a little comment so I know what
I'm doing so I'm gonna go private static
void create customers and what has it
been past it's been past customer object
that I'm gonna call customer and it's
also been a past stream that's going to
allow me to output information to the
file that's good
everything that I need the customer I
need to put there as well as the
capability to print it to the file now
again I'm gonna need to use a try block
here it's like before what's different
here instead of character streams is I
need to write using very specific
methods data to this file so if I go
customer output and I want to print a
string or I want to send a string to a
file I need to go write UTF and then
type in customer customer name and this
must be done in the exact same order as
we put all this information in here it's
very very very important because that's
how everything's gonna work so you have
to do it that way so what I'm gonna do
here I'm gonna copy that scroll back
down here again just so I have this as a
guide so I know what I want to be
working with and whenever I printed all
this out I noticed that I have customer
name and lowercase letters so let's go
correct that right now back up here type
in name and we're also gonna go up here
and do the same thing make this
capitalized when we keep everything
consistent if you scroll back down
you're gonna see that that error message
went away so we need to shoot all this
other additional
information out there in exactly the
same way so the next up we're gonna be
sending an integer which is customer age
so this is gonna change to write int say
it's not that hard to remember and we're
gonna change this to age throw in
another one this is gonna be customer
debt this is gonna be different because
we're gonna need to be passing a double
so what are you gonna put in here take a
wild guess it's gonna be double say it's
not that hard to remember one like this
then one we in passing we're gonna be
passing owe money which is a boolean and
then we're gonna come down here go oh
money because we're gonna be passing in
here the last thing is a character this
is gonna be right CH AR and then this is
gonna be customer sex and just so you
know I'll get rid of this right here
because don't need it anymore but just
so you know you could also do right bite
or right float right long or right short
so those are the other different methods
you would use for other different data
types then we're gonna close off that
trying block and that is all that I need
to do for this guy so that's all nice we
created the file we created the ability
to print to that file and here we're
going to be sending all that customer
information over to that file so I'm
gonna scroll back up here to the top
again back into the main function and
I'm going to actually close this file
because we no longer are going to need
it we've already written to it and I'm
gonna do that by going customer I don't
put clothes there you go it closes the
connection and what do we have here
we're gonna have another potential IO
exception being thrown so I'm gonna
throw that inside of there and then the
last thing that we're gonna need to do
is go and get this file information
throw this inside of here and scroll
back down and we're gonna create the
method get file info and you'll be able
to also retrieve information from data
streams okay so now we're down to our
get file info method that we have to
create I just get file info everything's
gonna all be together here in this one
method and the first thing I'm gonna
print out a system print line info
written to file and then we need to open
up our file again because we closed it
remember we're a new file just like we
did before
and then put in the location of the said
file dot file and then I'm going to have
to monitor the ending of this file so
I'm going to create this boolean
gonna do just that you're gonna see what
that those here a minute and then I'm
gonna create a new try block this time I
need to go data input stream get info
and data input stream is just an object
that has methods to read data that's all
that it is then we go new that I input
stream of course and then on the new
line we're gonna get a new offered input
stream again it's gonna collect all of
my information here so that I get it all
at one time then I'm gonna go new file
input stream and then I'm gonna put list
of names of course and then close that
off now I have a stream open up to be
able to read all this information that
I'm gonna go while I don't get an end of
file I'm going to use a couple different
things here first I'm going to create a
string of course it's gonna be a
customer's name is equal to get info and
then whenever you want to read a string
from a file and you need to do this in
exactly the same order that all this
information was honored you need to go
read UTF and then we're just gonna copy
this guy it's very very important that
all this information is read in exactly
the same order as it was put in and
we're just gonna change this to int
customer age and then this is gonna be
read int like that then we're gonna go
double cuz that's the next thing we put
in and that's customer debt then here
it's gonna be read double easy to
remember boolean is the next thing that
we put inside of here so that's the next
thing we're gonna read and then we're
gonna go read boolean and then the last
thing is a character and it is customer
sex and we're going to read character so
now we got all of our information pulled
out of that guy so now I'll probably
make some sense to print it out the
screen so that something shows up here
and then we're just gonna go customer
name I'll put that to screen and then
we're gonna print out our customer age
customer debt Omani
and customer sucks and of course these
don't have need to be printed to screen
in this order and this here is gonna be
and of try and then we need to catch
everything so we're gonna go catch a of'
exception and that is thrown whenever
the end of the file is reached and this
is where the boolean EOF comes in we're
gonna say yo f is equal to true so
what's that going to do
this is AOF up here that's gonna kick us
out of the wild loop and that's all that
we need to do with that
then we're gonna catch two other
different exceptions here file not found
exception we just leave that as e as
well and then I'm gonna actually scroll
up here copy this guy and inside of here
paste that and I'm just going to change
this to no file and then we also need to
catch IO exceptions E and we're just
gonna throw that in there and if we
execute it you can see there's all of
our information printed out the screen
customer name age money they owe us
whether there was something or not and
their sex all the code is underneath of
the video leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
