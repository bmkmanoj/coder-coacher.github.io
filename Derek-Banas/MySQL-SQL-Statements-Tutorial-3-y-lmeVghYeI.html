of my SQL statement tutorial where I'll
teach you everything there is to know
about SQL and MySQL today we're going to
go over the like regular expression in
not in and delete statements the like
statement allows you to search for parts
of text for example you can see here
started this query off with the Select
statement followed by the star which
means everything from US presidents
which is the table I'm going to be
looking for information in then we have
the where statement and what I'm doing
here is I'm looking for all first names
that begin with the two letters a and n
and then follow with any number of
additional characters that's what the
dollar sign represents here so that's
how you would use the like statement and
for example if I queried a US
president's table I would receive the
results Andrew Jackson and Andrew
Johnson the percent symbol is known as a
wildcard character it stands for any
number of characters so the last SQL
statement asks send me all of the data
on US presidents whose first name begins
with the letters a n and is followed by
any number of additional letters you can
also use the underscore wildcard it's
used to represent a single character for
example I have here the Select statement
followed by the star what I'm doing here
is looking at the present US president's
table and I'm looking for all last names
that are exactly five characters in
length for example Adams Buren Grant etc
by searching with the regular expression
statement you can perform extremely
complicated comparisons and searches
I covered regular expressions in another
tutorial in depth but here I'm going to
go through some things you can do with
regular expressions in SQL the format
for using regular expressions in SQL is
again you see here the Select statement
followed by the star and we're going to
be looking at the US presidents table
and in the where Clause you see here I'm
performing a regular expression test on
the variable last name just to briefly
go through some ray
expression sequences in SQL the carrot
symbol matches the beginning of a string
the dollar symbol matches the end of the
string the dot operator matches any
single character or newline here you can
see with these brackets surrounding the
letters A and D I'm looking to match any
character that appears in the brackets
and again here with the caret symbol in
the beginning I'm looking to match any
character that does not appear e
followed by the star symbol matches zero
or more instances of the pattern
represented by the letter e so if I was
looking for characters that began with a
and I would have a n there instead of
the letter e down below that you'll see
we're trying to match one or more
instances of the pattern represented by
the letter e we're trying to match zero
or one instance of the pattern
represented by the letter e and finally
we're trying to match either a pattern
that's represented here by the variable
X 1 or the variable X 2 here we're
looking for a number being represented
by the variable Y instances of the
pattern X and again if this is not
making any sense
go watch the regular expressions
tutorial and then you'll totally get it
again we're going to try to match Y or
more instances of the pattern X in the
second statement you see here on a third
we're going to match 0 to y instances of
the pattern X and finally we're going to
match between Y to Z instances of the
pattern X so again if it's a pattern
what what I mean is just simply a letter
a number whitespace any symbol you can
imagine being in a text file and just to
focus in on this final statement here
let's say Y was 1 and Z was 3 well what
we would be doing here is trying to find
between 1 2 3 of whatever symbols are
can are contained within the variable X
you can use the end statement to shorten
your queries in SQL when you need to
search for specific values in the past
you had to write Walt
comparison operators that were separated
by war statements here you can see an
example of that where I have multiple
war statements where I'm checking is the
first name equal to Andrew or is it
equal to James with the in statement I
can shorten that quarterly dramatically
instead I just put the end statement
here and then follow that up with all
the names I want to search for inside of
quotes and finally inside of brackets
the knot statement is the opposite of
the end statement for example here I'm
going to be searching for instances of
first-name that are not equal to Andrew
and James you can also use the knot
statement to get the opposite results
with other comparisons as you can see
here what I'm doing in the comparison on
the line that starts with we're not I am
checking for all of those US presidents
who have an age less than 50 but then by
putting the knot symbol after the where
what it is going to return instead is
all the US presidents that are over the
age of 50 you can delete records using a
similar format to how you have been
selecting and inserting them let's say
you accidentally entered Ben Franklin as
a president this is how you delete him
from your table records you'd start off
with this statement delete from then you
would list your table name where
first-name is equal to Ben and lastname
is equal to Franklin follow that off
with a semicolon and Ben Franklin's been
deleted Ben Franklin then the whole row
of data on him just so you know is going
to be deleted not just his first and
last name now there are limitations on
how you can use the delete statement you
can't delete a single or multiple
columns of information the delete
statement is used to delete rows and you
can delete multiple rows if you define
them with your where comparison well
that's all we're going to talk about in
part three of my SQL statements tutorial
hope you learned a lot catch you next
