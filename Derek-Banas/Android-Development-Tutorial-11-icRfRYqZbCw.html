my android development tutorial in this
part of the tutorial I'm going to
continue showing you how to make an
address app using Android and SQL Lite
and if you missed the previous part I
provide a link to the entire Android
development tutorial playlist in the
upper right hand corner and specifically
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
finish the interface that is going to
allow us to add new contacts and edit
contacts and then I'm going to jump into
SQLite three and show you the queries
that we are then going to have to create
in later code to make the address app
work so I have a lot to do so let's get
into it okay so here I am in Eclipse
just like before and here is my address
book app over here and I'm gonna be
going into not source this time but just
like before into the resource folder and
then I'm going to come down here inside
of layout and I'm going to create two
new layouts so I'm just going to right
click on that over to new and then come
down here and look for Android XML file
and create that and this guy I am going
to call add new contact and this is
going to be a table layout just like
before so I'm just gonna select that and
then come down here and click on finish
and here is all the code for my table
layout and I'm gonna be doing a lot of
cutting and paste in here just to save
some time alright so let's go into the
graphical layout and remember we're
basically going to store first name last
name phone number email address home
address and an ID so inside of this guy
I'm going to come down here inside of
layouts and get a table row and drag it
over here drop it in and then inside of
my table row I'm going to have a
textview first off so to get that I'm
gonna come up here into form widgets and
get a textview and just drag it over
here and drop it in there and then I'm
just going to jump into the code and
actually start writing some of this
stuff so here is the textview that i
just created and there's the table row
and like I said before I normally just
leave the table row is just a junk value
but the text views I normally give good
names that's completely up to you I'm
not saying my way is the right way I'm
just saying that's what I do so I'm
gonna call this add
to act textview I'm going to have the
width like I often do match my parent
that surrounds it which is going to be
my table row so that I fill up the whole
entire screen and then save some time
I'm going to jump back over into the
graphical layout I'm gonna make sure
that my textview is selected which it is
and then come over here and set a couple
different things down inside of here now
specifically what I want to be able to
change is the padding here is padding
right here and just like before I'm just
going to click on that and then come in
here to padding 5dp and it okay so there
we got everything lined up a little bit
better so that looks nice now because I
created the strings before in my
strings.xml file I'm going to use the
add contact guy that I have right here
so I'm just going to jump back into add
new contact and then come over here
inside of text click on this and then
I'm going to come into add contact and
now you can see add contact is there
then what I'm going to do is go over
into activity main.xml and I'm going to
copy this guy right here where it
changes the text appearance to large I'm
going to use that again just come back
inside of here I'm going to jump down
inside the XML for this guy and paste
that in there and then the final thing
I'm going to do is just go Android text
color is equal to FFF auto da da da and
there we are that's done whoops I don't
eat that okay so there we go we got our
textview all set up and for my table row
I'm going to come in here and I'm going
to go Android background is equal to
hash symbol and this is going to be
black I'll say we bounced out here you
can now see add contact is in there and
it looks really nice next thing we need
to do is what we're going to be copy and
paste in a whole bunch of times
we're going to be adding a whole bunch
of table rows so again just click on
layouts just like I did before come down
here get table row drag that table row
in there and then inside of each one of
these table rows what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna have a textview and an edit
text area so form widgets can grab a
textview drag it in there and then I'm
also going to need an editable text area
so that's going to be in text fields and
I'm just gonna grab one of these guys
drag it over here and then throw it in
here next to the textview
and there we are well now that's kind of
a mess if you can see that before if I
select this see how it's outside of this
box so I got to fix that
there's
view and everything looks messy so I'm
going to clean it up so to do that I'm
going to jump back into the XML and here
is table row and I'm just going to let
everything be well now I'm not I'm going
to change this to match parent to make
sure it stretches and let's look up here
to make sure if we're also going to have
to change this to match parent I'm just
going to copy and paste this and there
it is I didn't come back down inside of
here now with these guys I'm going to
use names that have some meaning to them
because I think they're important so
inside of here just like before I'm
going to go first name text view wrap
content ramp content perfectly fine then
I'm going to get my layout wait and
change that to one so that everything
lines up a little bit better I'm just
gonna copy and paste some stuff here so
I'm just going to jump over an activity
main and paste this inside of here also
going to want to change my padding on
this guy so I'm just gonna come up here
and copy this come back down inside of
here
throw in some information about padding
and then I want to use the first name
from the strings.xml file just like I
had before so jump out of here that's
selected come over here into text click
on that this is going to open up look
for first name there it is and there we
go now we have first name inside of
there jump back over here and now I had
to work on the editable text area and
this guy I'm just going to name it first
name like that wrap content wrap content
I'm also going to have the layout weight
be equal to one so that that straightens
out everything and gives the editable
text area exactly the same amount of
size as the textview itself and I'm also
going to come in here and give this a
little bit of padding just come in there
drop that in there and then the final
thing I want to do is actually make sure
that it looks at this as text from an
actual person's name to do that
graphical layout it's already selected
come down over here where it says input
type and all the code and everything
that type here is available in the link
in the description and then here I'm
going to look for a person's name and
there it is text person's name so select
that and hit OK and there we go now we
got that row all set up and the good
thing here well another thing I want to
do go in here and I'm also going to come
in on here and to make sure that up it
all been automatically did it for me
requests focus so the cursor whenever
they open the app or open this part of
the activity the cursor is going to
start inside of here because
Qwest focus is inside of there now the
cool thing I'm going to be able to do
now is I'm just going to copy and paste
a whole bunch of these right like that
and what do I need I need first name
I need last name I need phone number I
need email address and I need home
address so that means I need five of
these things just paste that in there so
that's three four and five so now I'm
gonna have to come in here and fix all
these but this will save me an immense
amount of time and here we are table row
this is the first one there's a table
row two that's perfectly fine and then
whenever I get into this I'm going to
change this to table row three going to
change this the table row four change
this to table row five change this to
table rows six and everything else is
fine and then I'm just gonna come in
here and leave almost all this
information exactly the same as before
just gonna change the names a little bit
so instead of first name I'm going to
have last name there we go and then
change this the last name of course and
I can also leave this as text person's
name because that makes sense come down
inside of this one and this time we're
not going to have first name but we're
going to have phone number text view and
then a copy phone number here put it
down inside of that and then here going
to get rid of that and so that it's
treated like a phone number I'm going to
change the input type to phone okay so
that's cool
for this guy we're going to call this
email text view and then this I'm going
to call it email address leave
everything else I am here I'm going to
fix these here in a second if you
thought I forgot about those and then
the input type here is going to be text
email address I'll show you in a second
where all that comes from and then for
my last one here I'm going to have my
address text view this is going to be
like a home address with that the same
change this guy down here - home address
and then for this one I'll let it be
text and if you want to use another one
also I'm going to say text postal
address so there we go that's all setup
I'm going to save that
jump over into the graphical layout
there you're gonna see these are all
first names that's perfectly fine there
right now I'm going to get rid of this
one though to do that come in to text
over here again click on that and then
look for last name that we set up before
and that's fixed come in here where it
says first name again
come over here again click on text and
then this one is going to be phone
number which is right there so got that
selected come down here this is going to
be email address so just text again and
then look for email address and there it
is now that's fixed click on this one
and jump over into text akin and this
last one is going to be home address
which is right there okay
got all those set up pretty cool then
for the final thing I'm going to have
another table row but this one is going
to contain a button and this button is
going to add the contact to our database
so come in here again we're going to
come down to layouts click on that over
here where it says table row grab table
row throw it down inside of there and
then I'm gonna come up here again form
widgets there's a Big John button grab
that I put up the thought that uh
there's after address throw it in there
hopefully because in yes you can see
it's left justified looks terrible I'm
going to make it fill out the entire
screen but before I do that I'm going to
select it click on text you know what
that is click on save data now it's
going to say save on it jump over into
the XML scroll to the bottom of the
screen and I'm going to call this guy
right here add button and there we are
in this table row that we have here I'm
gonna say match parent again
just like before I'm doing my best to
show patterns and I pretty much do that
anyway we also want to capture a click
event and if a click event occurs on
this button we want a certain method to
be called and it hasn't been created yet
but when it is it's going to be called
add new contact and there that is and
then the layout weight on this I'm going
to set that to 1 so that it completely
fills the box and there that is so there
you are created that whole thing
graphical layout and there you can see
there is the entire thing and now what
I'm going to do is basically I am going
to want to be able to edit my contacts
and I'm going to use almost exactly the
same thing that I used for the add
contact the only real difference is
going to be two new buttons so you know
pretty simple so I'm basically just
gonna copy this whole entire thing come
up here after table row and just go the
whole way through the whole entire thing
copy at all and then I'm going to go
over into layout again and right click
new
any one of these come down here Android
XML file and inside of this I'm going to
call this edit contact dot XML this is
going to be a table layout again just
table layout finish and there that guy
is jump into this one and then paste
everything in there save that guy bounce
over here again and you can see it's
exactly the same just like the old guy
but I don't want it that way this guy
for one I want to change this into edit
instead of add contact and you know what
I got to do it come over here click on
text and then this is going to be edit
contact title that's what I called it
and it says edit contact that's good
everything else looks pretty good
actually jump back into the XML because
I copy and paste that everything the
style is going to be really good I'm
going to change this into edit contact
text view everything else about this is
pretty good down inside of this I'm
actually going to leave all of this
exactly the same don't see any reason to
change it and pretty much the only thing
that will change inside of this guy is
going to be this button that we have
down here so I'm actually going to copy
the button that we have because we're
gonna have two buttons now this is going
to allow us to both delete contacts as
well as edit them you know change the
name so I'm going to call this guy edit
button and if something's changed in
regards to contact it's going to make
that change on the click I'm going to
call a method called edit contact the
next one down here is going to be
changed to delete button and whenever
this is clicked on a method called
remove contact is going to be called and
the only other thing I need to do is
change the name that shows up in the
button so I'm going to click on this
this is going to be edit click on text
come in here and you can see right there
edit button now it says edit click on
this guy click on text and this is going
to be save data and there that is back
into this layout weight is one lay out
weight is one and everything there is
all set up so I might come back to this
later on because some of you guys
request that I add things like search
bars and things like that but for now
I'm going to jump over into SQL Lite and
we're going to review here real quickly
the types of queries we're going to be
issuing all right so what types of
things are we going to have here well
the very first I'm going to do is
actually go and open up SQL
light and I'm going to call this address
book dot DB and there that is now
basically what we're gonna have inside
of this is we're going to have a first
name so we're gonna have to create that
guy actually let's just come in here
first name last name phone number email
address home address and then finally ID
which ID showed up in two separate
places so now what I got to do is
actually create that table and to do so
and I'm actually going to create these
tables and so forth in my code but I
wanted to review what it actually looks
like in SQL Lite before I did that so
this is what we're going to be creating
later on in a tutorial so I'm going to
create a table called contact and it's
going to have an ID which is going to be
an integer and if you didn't watch my
SQL Lite tutorial you might want to
check that out again it's in the Android
playlist I'm going to have this Auto
increment for me so that I don't have to
mess around with adding numbers or
knowing what numbers to add for the ID
first name we're gonna have to speak
text because like I said in the SQL Lite
tutorial SQLite really isn't very good
in regards to having complex data types
so and then we're going to have phone
number and I'm not putting not in all
and things like that I'm just going to
keep this nice and simple email address
also and home address which is also
going to be txt close that off da da and
there we go I created my table and if I
go tables you can see contact shows up
inside of there so I'm gonna clear my
scroll back now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to actually inside of a text
editor right exactly we're gonna have to
do whenever we want to insert a new
contact so insert into contact and I'm
just doing this so it'll be easier to
copy and paste or in a first name last
name phone number email address home
address like that and then we're gonna
have values and then I'm gonna throw in
a bunch of them so let's just say Sally
Smith and let's say our phone numbers
four one two five five five one two one
two and let's say she's at Sally at
aol.com and let's say she'll is it one
two three Main Street Ida Iowa and I'm
going to copy this jump over here and
SQL Lite paste that in there and there
we
that and I can jump in here and create a
couple more over them just to keep this
very simple I'm just going to change
this to Paul and I'm going to say one
two four and then I'm going to change
this to a two and select all copy paste
there's another one and then this one
I'm going to just change this his last
name too long I don't know it just
happened to be the same jump back in
here paste that in there and then if we
do like a select all from contact you
can see there's all those and if I want
to clear the scroll back on this
separator let's say I just want to have
spaces between these that's how we do
that and there you can see that a little
bit better organized even though
everybody has the same email but don't
worry about that and then what I need to
do of course I'm going to have to
provide a way to update contacts and I'm
gonna have to write this in my code as
well whenever I create it so for example
if we want to change the phone number
inside of contact for a person that
hides the ID of one I can just come in
here and let's just say four one two
five five five five five five five
that's a new number and of course I can
also come in here and change numerous
things like let's say that Sally moves
Mary somebody with last name Todd there
that is and then I'm gonna have to say
where ID is equal to one did all that
right and there you can see she's now
soundly taught so that's another query
I'm going to need another thing I'm
going to need is the ability to delete a
person because I have delete inside of
there as well so I'm just checking
basically to make sure that I know how
to use SQL right so that I don't mess up
my program because of something silly
that I could have checked ahead of time
in there Sally should now be gone and
she is and then I'm also going to have
to have a way to output the information
in the last tutorial I said that I was
going to need an ID it was gonna need a
last name and I'm gonna need a first
name and that's gonna come from contact
and I want all of them so I'm not gonna
put any constraints inside there but I
want them in order so I'm gonna say
order by last name boom and there it is
and then the final thing I might want to
do is also be able to drop the table
altogether delete it and to do
I'm going to say drop table if exists
all right
contact there we go if I type in tables
nothing shows up so there is a ton more
on our way to creating an address
application inside of Android please
leave your questions or comments below
