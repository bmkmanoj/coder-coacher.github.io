you how to make scarves as well as hats
and blankets and such and this time I'm
going to show you how to make this cute
little stuffed animal duck and I have a
lot to do so let's get into it
previously I told you how to read a
pattern and this is the pattern for the
ducks head basically we are going to
first chain two and then put six
stitches in the second chain and then
we're gonna put two stitches in each
stitch thereafter and then for the rest
of the rounds that you see here there's
going to be one stitch and then you're
gonna put two stitches in the next
stitch and you're going to repeat each
of those six times and I'm gonna show
you after this exactly how to do it so
that you can see everything by hand then
what you're gonna see here is the same
sort of stuff over and over again except
you're going to see on rounds 8 through
16 you're just gonna put one stitch
through each of the stitches available
and then I'm going to show you how to
decrease so you're basically going to
put 5 stitches one stitch in each stitch
and then you're going to decrease and
I'm going to show you how to do that as
well and then you can see the last part
of the pattern right here and you can of
course pause your screen to see this and
also in the description I'm going to
have a link to the entire pattern for
the entire duck alright so this is gonna
be the Ducks head so like I said in the
pattern we're going to chain 2 and we're
gonna do it just like you see here just
like we did it in the previous videos
and then in the second chain from the
top you can see it right there I'm gonna
insert and then I'm going to create a
stitch and for the head we're going to
actually create six total stitches and
you can see here once again we're going
to pull through and
I'm gonna go down inside once again the
same place I changed before and I'm
going to pull that through and you can
see there are is two pieces of yarn on
the hook and then I'm gonna pull that
through to complete that stitch and once
again we are going to create a total of
six of those and then after I get that
done what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go
through each of those stitches and put
two stitches behind each of the six
stitches that I have already made and
you can see I'm using exactly the same
stitch over and over again so I'm gonna
go in exactly where I went previously
and make another stitch and then do that
the whole way around until you are
finished and now I'm gonna show you what
I mean by one stitch and then two
stitches but first I'm also gonna show
you another trick to keep everything in
order we're gonna put our first stitch
in like I said we're gonna have one
stitch and then two stitches in the next
stitch but what I'm gonna do here is I'm
gonna get a safety pin and right after I
make that very first stitch I am gonna
put the safety pin in there and that
will help me keep track of where I'm
going to begin and end and then you're
gonna see in the next stitch available
that I'm going to put two stitches
underneath of that and then I'm gonna
continue the next time I go through I'm
gonna have two stitches single stitches
and then another stitch that's gonna
have two stitches just like I showed you
and the pattern at the very very
beginning of the tutorial and for the
first seven rounds I'm gonna have that
similar pattern and then on rounds 8
through 16 I'm gonna put a single stitch
underneath of each of the stitches and
that's going to allow us to create our
sphere shape that is going to be used
for our ducks head and now we're on to
round 17 and this is where we are going
to decrease but the very first thing
we're gonna do is we're going to put
five stitches in two underneath of the
first five stitches and then after we
get that completed it is now time to
decrease and how you decrease is you
stick your hook right there and just
like you always do underneath a stitch
but then you pull it on the other side
and what this is
allow the sphere to do is to come back
down and decrease in size and then you
go and get your thread and pull it
through just like you did before and now
we are going to set the Ducks head aside
for a second and focus on the beak and
to do this what we're going to do is put
two chains and then we are going to put
seven stitches through the second chain
from the hook and then we're gonna put
two stitches through each of the
stitches and then we're gonna put one
stitch inside of each of those stitches
available for the next five rows and
then we'll fasten it off and leave a
string so that we can saw everything
together so just like before what we're
going to do is we are going to create
two chains so there is one and there is
the second chain that is coming in and
then for the beak this time we are then
going to once again go into the chain at
the bottom and we are going to put in
seven stitches the whole way around and
as you can see we're using very similar
techniques to make all the different
parts of the stuffed animal and you will
be able to use these same techniques to
be able to make numerous other different
stuffed animals not only just ducks and
I want to come in and demonstrate
exactly what I mean by putting two
stitches through once again using this
orange yarn because I think it's a
little bit easier to see than the yellow
you can see there I put one stitch
through underneath of that stitch and
then once again under the exact same
stitch I'm gonna go and put an
additional stitch okay just wanted to do
that one more time using orange just to
make sure it was on and percent clear
and then after you have two stitches
under each of those stitches then on
rounds three through five you're just
gonna put one stitch underneath of each
of those stitches and then you're going
to leave a string at the end so that
you'll be able to properly so the beak
onto your duck head and this is what its
gonna look like whenever it's all done
and wrapped up okay nice the little duck
beak and what they mean by fastening off
the yarn is you just
take this string that remains after you
cut off the end and you pull it the
whole way through the loop and then
you're gonna go and fill up the beak
with some polyfill and then you're just
going to get a sewing needle blunt
sewing needle and put the string through
it and then just sew on the duck beak
wherever you think it looks best and
then finish it off and then finally tie
off the string and there you go and now
we have a beak on our duck and now we're
gonna take the back of the eye like that
and that's gonna be facing outwards
towards the yarn and then we're going to
insert the little screw that's going to
represent the eye and we're holding that
plastic in the back and then we push the
eyeball in and now we have eyes and then
to finish off the head push in some
fiberfill until it is very very stiff
and sturdy and then this is how we
decrease the row so that we can seal the
bottom of the sphere or the bottom of
the Ducks head and that is going to
occur in the last three rounds that I
covered in the pattern and then for the
very last room actually going to skip
stitches so I'm going to skip one stitch
and then I am going to stitch through
the next stitch and then I'm gonna skip
one and then I'm gonna put another
stitch through and you're gonna repeat
this six times until you are completely
finished and everything is sealed off
and now I'm gonna move on to making the
Ducks body and how we're gonna do this
is we're going to create two chains and
then we are going to be putting in five
stitches in the second chain down from
the hook so as you can see if we're
doing repeating the same steps over and
over again to make all of the different
parts of our duck so pretty cool stuff
and then just like we did before we are
going to put two stitches underneath of
each of the five stitches that we just
created for a total of ten stitches and
then once again you're going to put in
one individual stitch in the very first
stitch and then after you do that you're
going to put in two stitches in the next
stitch
and rather than recovering that
basically just like before two chains
five stitches inside of it then two
stitches in each of those stitches one
stitch and then under the next stitch
two stitches and then you're gonna
repeat that five times and then you can
see the rest of the pattern there on the
screen so pretty much doing the same
thing that we did with the head except
we are not going to be decreasing the
body we're going to be sewing it into
the head and of course we're going to
put all the polyfill inside of there and
then also notice how I have the string
hanging off the side there we are going
to put the head down on top of that and
then sew it and as you can see the
process is very simple we're just gonna
pull the blunt nose needle up through
there just like you would think and then
circle around the head until the body is
completely attached to the head and then
your duck is getting very close to
getting finished and now we're gonna
create the wings using the same
techniques once again we're going to
have two chains we're gonna put five
stitches through the second chain from
the hawk we're going to put two stitches
under each of the stitches for a total
of ten we're gonna have one stitch
followed by two stitch in the next
stitch and then you know of course one
two one two one for a total of 15 and
then we're going to put stitches a total
of 15 around the entirety of the wing
and then we're going to stitch that to
the body of course and then we have our
feet once again two chains seven
stitches through the second hole away
from your hook and then you're gonna put
two stitches under each one of those
stitches for a total fourteen and then
for the next three through seven rows
you're going to put an individual stitch
under each of those and that is how you
make the feet and after you sew on the
arms and the feet just like you sewed
the body to the head this is your
finished stuck and in the description I
have a link to how to make the Hat if
you want to try that as well and like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
