of my java video tutorial series today
I'm going to cover one of the last
components in Java swing and it is
called a tree and you can see one here
and if you can't see this view at full
screen I'm going to show you how to set
up this guy in this program and go
through all kinds of little neat things
we can do with it pop up all kinds
information about everything contained
inside of here and before we leave these
are called nodes each one of these and
this would be the root node because it
holds all the other nodes and this is
the parent node for taxes dot EXL in
this example and then docks as well as
work applications and games are all
considered siblings so hopefully that
makes sense now let's just jump right
into the code here and there's a link to
all this code underneath of the video
you should definitely check it out
because it's heavily commented we need
to get a couple things here though in
regards to libraries first thing I'm
going to be able to pull in here is
enumeration which is a library it allows
me to work with enumerations which are
just like items we need to be able to
pull in that library so we can sort
through all of those whenever they are
returned by a method later on in the
tutorial that didn't make sense don't
worry about it you'll learn more and of
course we have to bring in the tree
library so we can use that properly and
let's just scroll down here and make a
couple other different objects inside of
this guy now a tree as you saw before
contains nodes that contain other nodes
and how you create them is you just type
in J tree and I'm just going to call
this the tree and there you are I just
created a J trick now if a node holds
other nodes it is called a parent node I
want to make sure you understand that in
the nodes inside of a parent are called
children nodes and the nodes on the same
level are called siblings okay now I
don't know why most people don't ever
cover trees because it's kind of useful
but if you want to create a different
node or a whole bunch of different nodes
you would type in default mutable tree
node and that is how you create nodes
and I'm gonna type in work and I'm going
to type in games and I'm going to type
in emails so that I can show you a whole
bunch of different things in regards to
these guys so let's scroll this up and
then to create our root node I'm just
going to copy this guy right here I'm
down here type that in
I'm going to call our root node
filesystem because one of the things you
could do with a tree is to model out the
filesystem inside of a nice interface
and then just paste that inside of there
and then I have to give this root node a
name text that's going to show up on the
screen and I'm going to call it C Drive
I like that and there you are just
created our root node everything else is
going to go inside of that and then here
is public static void main there it is
you know all about that here's where
we're creating our frame here's where
we're positioning our frame in the
center of the window this is going to
handle closing whenever the close events
triggered name of my frame this creates
the J panel that goes in the frame here
we create a button here's where we add a
listener for the button that is going to
automatically fire this method called
listen for button anytime an action is
performed on the button here we add that
listener to the button and here we add
the button to the panel and now we start
messing around with trees which is why
we're here alright now we're going to
create the tree which we previously sort
of defined that we didn't actually
create it and how you create it as you
pass it the root node so filesystem and
there it is now you're ready to rock
think it's a little bit bizarre and
something you're probably going to
actually just copy and paste this guy
but if we want to make it so that the
user can only select one object in a
tree at a time we're going to type in
get selection model and of course don't
try to remember this way too much
remember set selection mode and then
tree selection model and then single
tree selection I have no idea why you
have to go through all of that just to
make a tree only have one selectable
node at a time but that's what you have
to go through again that's why the codes
provided so you can just copy and paste
that now if you would want to only show
let's say 8 nodes at a time just type in
setvisible row count and then put 8 in
there for that situation of course you
change that and show as many as you want
and now I'm going to add an item to my
tree and I'm going to add my documents
my work node and my games node but first
off we're going to add documents here
and how you add a node is to call add a
file which I'm going to show you here in
a second exactly what that method does
literally a couple seconds because I'm
going to
this guy I'm going to go file system and
what's file system that is the root node
very important to remember that because
that's going to position Docs underneath
of that guy so we have to create add a
file and that's what I'm gonna do right
down here so let's just scroll down way
down here and let's create that file I'm
doing all this in a separate method
because I want to keep this all
separated and you just type in default
mutable tree node which is the file type
for any type of tree node I know that is
extremely long and but play around with
it for a while and you'll get it and
then I'm going to pass a string that's
going to be the file name that's going
to represent the node it's going to be
the name for the node don't get all hung
up on exactly what we're doing here and
then we're just going to type this in
here and this is going I'm going to name
this parent folder because what this is
is we're passing the name of the new
node we want to create and the node that
it is going to be held in that's all
don't get too confused about that
we're just saying hey here's a new node
we want to create this is the name and
this is what the parent that we want to
stick it inside of that's all sounds way
more complicated than it really is
well then we're just going to come down
here again and we're going to create a
new node and you just type that in there
and I'm going to call it new file
temporarily equals new and in that and
then what we're going to do is type in
file name which is going to be the name
for our node and then we're going to go
parent folder which is the node here and
then go add new file and what we're
doing here again is saying okay parent
folder which is going to be the parent
node that's going to contain our new
node we're going to create we're going
to call that parent node called parent
folder we're going to call the method
called add and we're going to add this
new node into it that doesn't make
Connor percent sense just leave a
question below okay so we've created our
new node and we've told Java in which
parent node it should be held and then
we need to return it so that's all this
dead created all that stuff it's rule
backup here
and this is where we call to add a file
which we just created there so let's add
a couple other different things to the
documents node or Documents folder if
you want to consider it that in this
situation what are we going to do we're
going to add a file and we're going to
make additional calls to that guy to
create additional
who notes and the only reason why we had
to create the documents part up here is
because it will become a parent node
otherwise if we're just going to throw
regular files in there like let's say we
want to create a new node called taxes
dottie Excel and we want to throw it
into the parent node named documents and
that's all we need to do in this
situation let's say we want to add a
couple more to this let's say we want to
add story dot text for example story dot
txt now let's say we want to add a child
node inside a documents but we expect it
to hold additional information what are
we going to do in that situation well in
that situation we get a go emails and go
add a file just like that and then we're
going to give it the name emails to make
it look like it's a file but we're still
going to stick it into the documents
parent node and then just to throw
another different guy in here down
inside of there we'll add a file and
let's say schedule text and we're adding
at the documents what you might say to
yourself well how do I go and add child
elements to my new emails node that I
created when it's same exact thing
except you're gonna change this to
emails right like that and then let's
just say that this is called I don't
know call Bob is the name of this email
you saved and then we can come in here
and create all kinds of other different
things so let's just select this right
here really easy to create additional
ones of these guys just paste that in
there like I said before let's say we
have one called work and if you can't
quite grasp this scroll back to the
beginning of the video and look at
exactly what this looks like when it's
done and I'm going to name this node
work applications and it's part of the
file system so we're going to leave it
that way and then I'm going to grab this
right here copy and paste that inside of
there and paste that inside of there
because these are going to be child
elements and then let's say we want this
to be spreadsheet dot exe and then let's
say we want this one to be a word
processor dot exe and then of course we
could also create our games node that's
going to also have child elements inside
of it yeah we just go like this and then
in this situation we're going to go
games is a name for this and then we're
going to give it a title games and it's
going to go with
the parent file system no problem and
then let's say we got space invaders and
this one is going to be pac-man idle
alright so we created all these
different guys so what would be kind of
nice well if you remember up here we
said well we only want to show eight of
these at a time with this guy right here
set visible row count so we better go
and throw this whole entire tree into a
scroll box or a J scroll pane so that's
what I'm going to do and we just go J
scroll pane scroll box is equal to new
no reason to type that out again paste
that there and then what's it going to
do we're going to put our tree inside of
there the only problem is like we use
the scroll box before the dimensions are
going to be all messed up well that's
why we have our dimension library right
here because that's going to allow us to
come in here and size this scroll box
that is going to contain my tree we'll
just go dimension I'm going to say D is
equal to scroll box and I'm going to say
get preferred size and that's going to
get me my height and width for that
scroll box right there and we got to
make some changes to it I'm going to say
that I want my width for my scroll box
to be 200 because that works I'm going
to say scroll box dot set 3/4 size is
equal to my new D that I just created
here and then what do I need to do well
I need to go the panel got add scroll
box and that adds the scroll box to this
guy and if we execute this you can see
that everything popped up inside here we
can go and click on all these different
things but if we hit the button nothing
is going to happen so I'm going to show
you a couple other different ways to
access this different information inside
of this tree we're just going to use
this listener down here and execute
different things based off of what we're
able to pull back so let's say for
example we want it to be able to get
whatever node was selected that's kind
of useful so let's just go object tree
object temporary holding so and I'm
going to say the tree thought get last
selected and I'm just going to click on
this here to save myself and typing it
in path component and then put that down
there so this is going to return an
object but it is going to need to be
cast into a default mutable tree node
and that
just the long name for what every node
let's just scroll up here to this guy
right here copy it and we're going to
cast this basic object into what
something we can actually use I'm going
to call this the file is equal to and
this is how we cast of course covered
that previously a bunch of times
then we just say tree object which
doesn't even realize it's that just
thinks it's an object so then what we
want to do well we want to take that
node and we want to cast it into a
string so that we can shoot it on the
screen and it makes sense so we're going
to go to the file get user object like
that and then we're going to take output
string and we're going to throw the
information we get from that we're going
to shorthand add to what was originally
added when this string was set up and in
this situation we're gonna go the
selected old and then we're just like
this tree node which is this guy right
here it's just a string that represents
the node name of the node anyway I know
like this throw a newline in there so it
looks pretty I'm going to be doing a lot
of the same sort of stuff here let's say
that we also wanted to add the number of
children and I'll put that onto the
screen so let's just say number of
children for the selected node the
situation we're going to go the file and
go get child count it's going to return
the number of children that are stored
in it that guy right there we could also
find out the number of siblings it's
almost identical to this guy because it
would make sense for today so it's like
this number of and then we're typing
siblings and we're going to go get
sibling count instead of child count
it's going to return that bounced down
here let's say we wanted to get the
parent of the node parent like that then
go the file which is the node we're
playing with here and we're just going
to say get parent and that's going to
output that to screen we could also say
get the next node and there's tons of
these methods but I'm sort of like going
through every one of them so I'll say
next node and here it's just gonna be
get next node and of course get previous
you probably guessed it is almost
identical previous get previous node
there's a whole bunch of different
methods to play around with that
let's say we want to go and get all of
the children of whatever the selected
node is now we're going to go paste
inside of here and in this situation
we're going to give our social space
I call this children of node like that
throw in another new line keep this a
little bit more simple than normal and
this is a little bit harder and this is
also where we're going to be using
what's called the enumeration what we're
going to do here is going to go for a
new moderation and we add a new value is
equal to the file and we're going to
call a method called
children of course but that period
inside of there and what children does
why we're doing all this enumeration
stuff is children returns an enumeration
that contains all of the children and
what we're setting up here is going to
continue pulling these two children
values out until no children values any
longer exist it's kind of a goofy thing
here probably something would be good to
play around with just copy and paste in
the code when a call has more elements
and this guy is going to decide if the
for loop continues to execute it's all
it's going to do and then we're going to
put a little curly brackets here and
then we're going to add to our output
string again and in this situation we're
going to go enumeration value dot next a
long lens and what next element does is
it returns the next element in the list
for this for loop so it's going to
continue to spit out these enumerations
until none of them exist or until they
you reach the limit so that guy's going
to spit out all the children the other
thing I can think of I mean there's a
whole bunch of methods but it's going to
depend upon what you actually would want
to use let's say that you wanted the
path meaning all the parents that lead
up to the actual node itself let's say
when a new line and say path from root
for example cut that off there and if
you want to get all these guys well I
got a method for you and it's going to
return an array of tree nodes and I'm
going to call it path nodes and how you
get it as you call the file you go get
path is the method you call and this guy
returns an array of tree notes so then
what you want to do is be able to cycle
through all of these tree nodes and
output them to screen so we're going to
go for and we're going a tree know
do give it a temporary name of
individual nodes and then we're going to
throw a path nodes in there and it's
going to allow us to cycle through all
those different guys and then come up
here and grab this guy copy paste and
then we're gonna go copy this guy right
here paste that inside of there go to
that yeast we don't have a confusion and
that's going to output all of those
different guys and then we have
everything else here basically is
alright and there it is you can see
everything's showing up here if I select
Docs for example and hit get answer
you're going to see all the different
information pop out here that we
expected to show on the screen leave any
questions or comments below the last
