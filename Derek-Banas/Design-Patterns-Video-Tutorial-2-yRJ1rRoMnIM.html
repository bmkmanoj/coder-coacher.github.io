two of my design patterns video tutorial
today I'm going to finish up reviewing a
whole bunch of basic Opie concepts by
talking about polymorphism abstract
classes abstract methods and interfaces
which are basically just abstract
classes with nothing but abstract
methods don't worry you'll get it and
also I get into a whole bunch of other
different things about static methods
and fields and a whole bunch of other
things so let's just dive into it like
last time I'm going to start off with a
presentation and jump into the code so I
figure either way you're going to
completely get this concept what is
polymorphism polymorphism simply allows
you to write methods that don't need to
change if new sub classes are created so
for example dog can add a new method
right here dig hole without changing
animal in any way also if dog wants to
override a method it can do so like it
did here with eat also without affecting
animal in any way on top of that you're
going to be able to refer to subclasses
by their superclass type so in this
situation you have doggy which is really
a dog but we're gonna think of it as an
animal and Kitty which is really a cat
but we're also going to look at it like
it's an animal in doing so we're going
to be able to create arrays that are
going to have a bunch of animal objects
however if you go and call Kitty get
sound because of polymorphism it's
automatically going to execute the cat
method instead of trying to execute the
get sound method for animal don't worry
if you don't get it you will get it just
remember always that you can't access
methods this way if they are only in the
subclass and that is where abstract
classes and abstract methods and
interfaces come in so let's jump into
the code so here we are again in work
with animals Java and I'm going to
create a dog and cat object with the
superclass so just like I showed you
before we're going to go animal and I'm
gonna call this doggy is equal to new
and then I gotta call the dog
constructor that's very important and
I'm also going to create Kitty
just like you saw before and in this
situation I'm going to call a cat
constructor so they are both animals but
they are also individually a dog and a
cat object and
we're just going to go system.out.print
line and I can say doggy says and then
call doggy get sound right like that and
then equally I can do the same exact
thing with our cat object cept I'm going
to go kitty and then call kitty and then
if we execute that you're going to see
that even though they are both animal
objects they automatically call the
right method that is defined inside of
their individual classes doggy being the
dog class and Kitty being the cat class
all right so let's demonstrate all the
other things I was talking about let's
also go animal create an animal right
here and go animals is equal to new and
if you saw my Java tutorial I did this a
lot so we're going to create ourselves
an animal array and we're going to say
animals the zero index is going to be
equal to doggie and the one index is
going to be equal to kitty so we're just
going to pass those objects inside of
there and equally now we could cycle
through these using up for each block
but either way I'm going to do it this
way we can just go animal and call the
individual index and also do exactly the
same thing for kitty and the one index
and if we execute it the same exact
things going to happen right underneath
here and here you can say see
automatically calls the right method you
could also send animal objects for
processing inside of a method which is
very useful so let's crew and call a
method that doesn't even exist now
called speak animal and then let's jump
down here and create it so we're going
to go public static void speak animal
and I'm going to explain in a second
here exactly why I'm using a static
method as that seems to be a ongoing
question then I'm just going to go
system.out.print line and in this
situation on the go animal says R and
animal get sound so it's going to spit
that out on the screen and if I execute
it there you go
animal says bark so I can pass any
object to this guy that's automatically
going to call the right method there's a
whole bunch of different ways of working
with that sort of stuff but like I said
before and this is very important you
can't reference methods or fields that
aren't inside of animal so lift dog here
for example see I went and created or
extended the dog class with dig hole now
if I come in here and I try to call dig
hole you would think it would work
it does because the animal class only
knows about methods that are in the
animal class see this doesn't work and
if we zoom in here you can see right
here the method dig hole is undefined
for the type animal now you can still
use it you're just going to have to come
in and cast and cast it to be a dog
object and there you go now you see the
error went away if we execute it you can
see dug a hole does work another thing
that's important is let's scroll way up
to the top here and let's create an
integer and let's call it just a num and
just give it a value of 10 and then if
we scroll back down inside of here and
remember we're inside of main right here
public static void main it's a static
method and I'm going to demonstrate that
you can't use non static variables or
methods in a static function print line
and call just a number and if we scroll
inside of here it's gonna say cannot
make a static reference to a non-static
field just a non st. you can't do that
that's the other thing that comes up all
the time so I'm just going to delete
that just wanted to review it because it
comes up and then I'm going to scroll
down here again and I'm going to create
a non static method to demonstrate that
you can't call a non static method
inside of a static method these are just
things you just have to remember I'm
going to call it say hello it's not
really going to do much anything except
print out the word hello but it's not
going to do that because whenever I call
this just like before you're going to
get an error message scroll in here
cannot make a static reference to a
non-static method and that is also
something that you must remember and all
the time whenever I get questions like
why are you using static why are you not
using static there is your answer and
another thing to remember is you cannot
call a private method even if you define
it inside of a subclass so let's jump
over into dog Java I'm going to create a
private method private void be private
there it is and then this guy is just
going to go in here and just print some
stuff again in a private method and then
I'm going to show you
however if you create a public method
this is in the dog Java file it can
access information however in private
methods and that's a way around it
probably not a good idea because what's
the point but either way if you call
this private
method from inside of here you are going
to be able to access it let's jump back
over into here again let's delete say
hello because it doesn't work and then
we're first going to go fight it up
which is a dog object and we're going to
try to call be private and once again
you can see here not gonna be able to do
it the method be private from the type
dog is not visible that means you cannot
access it however you can execute
private method using that public method
that we created right like that execute
and there you go in a private method
that's another thing comes up all the
time now what we're going to do is we're
going to create a giraffe from an
abstract class but first we're going to
review exactly what I mean by abstract
classes and abstract methods now if you
want the power of polymorphism without
all the work what you use is either an
abstract class or an interface and quite
simply to create an abstract class all
you would do is go abstract public class
and whatever you want your class to be
called and then to create an abstract
method likewise you'd go and put
abstract inside of here before you would
put in the return type for your method
and then you end it with a semicolon
that's how you make an abstract method
there are no abstract fields or
variables or instance variables whatever
you want to refer to them and all
methods don't have to be abstract inside
of an abstract class in an interface as
you're going to see in a minute
everything has to be an abstract method
so much so that you don't even have to
put abstract in for an interface because
it forces you to do so and another thing
to remember is inside of abstract
classes yes indeed you can have static
methods so we're going to jump into
creature Java insider here creature Java
and we're going to create ourselves an
abstract class so I'm gonna go abstract
public class I'm gonna call it creature
another thing that's important to
remember I don't know if I said this or
not you cannot create objects from a
class that is marked as abstract that's
very important this can never be an
object just in case you want to block
people from being able to turn a
specific class of an object that's how
you do it
but of course subclasses can still
extend it otherwise it would be
completely worthless another thing to
remember is protected fields are like
private fields except subclasses can in
herre
from them so if I wanted to put inside
of here because remember there's no such
thing as an abstract field if I wanted
to come in here and put in some fields I
can just go protected in two wait
protected strings sound and so forth and
so on and now every method that you're
going to make inside of this guy that
you mark is abstract must be overridden
however like I said before not all
methods inside of an abstract class have
to be abstract so let's just come in
here abstract void name string new name
and there you go you just made yourself
an abstract method pretty simple and
this is all about being able to use the
power of polymorphism to create
subclasses from all of these classes
that you may that's what you do and this
is going to force your users of your
class here to do things the way that you
want to basically we're just doing the
same thing we did before except we're
not defining anything because that is
our goal we don't have a goal to do
anything except provide the power of
polymorphism so that all of this stuff
can be extended and then I could
continue on and on and on and there's
code underneath the video that does
continue on and on and on so let's jump
back over here save this guy and now
that we have the abstract class all
created here as much as we're going to
create it I'm going to use it over here
to create the giraffe dot Java file
again this is still a class so to create
this we're going to go public class
giraffe extends creature put this inside
of here and we're going to get some
error messages because we need to add
all the unimplemented methods so I'm
just going to click on that and it's
going to automatically throw inside of
there all the different methods that I
want to use so that's cool and then what
I'm going to do is create private string
name right like that and then down
through here set name well I'm going to
get new name inside of there and
automatically threw that in there and
I'm just going to go string is equal to
new name this is name of course if I'll
save that and then get name is just
going to return name in this situation
I'm just going to do that real quick and
then jump back over into work with
animals and we can see that we can make
a giraffe object and call giraffe is
equal to new
giraffe like that then I can go draft
set name and let's just give him the
name of Frank and then system.out.print
giraffe get now make a call to that and
if we execute it you're going to see the
Frank pops up and there's Frank right
there so that's an abstract class and
that just leaves us to cover interfaces
now an interface is a class with only
abstract methods like said for you can
add as many interfaces to a class using
implements as you want which is
absolutely fabulous so now you're no
longer limited to just have extending
one class however you're only going to
be able to use public static and final
fields if you choose to use them at all
and interfaces provide the ultimate and
flexibility because your classes can
come from completely different
inheritance trees and still be able to
use a common interface to communicate
and this is such an important concept
that we're going to get into later on in
future tutorials so back to the code
alright so we're going to create our
interface inside of living Java which is
just the name I just picked up here and
just to cut to the chase it's real
simple to create an interface you're
going to go public and an interface and
whatever you want the interface to be
called and you're going to define all of
your methods in exactly the same way as
you did with abstract classes except
there's one thing missing there is no
word abstract the reason why is all of
these methods inside of here are
abstract by default so that's it I mean
that's all you do so I didn't see any
reason to retype all that so there is an
interface and then if you would want to
come in here and actually use this
interface we could come in to monkey and
you would just type in public class
monkey implements and living there is
your interface right there and then of
course you're going to be able to click
on it and all the methods that you're
going to be forced to implement side of
this class are automatically going to
populate it so there is a whole bunch of
stuff about object oriented programming
coming up I'm going to cover a ton of
design patterns that tunnel on UML feel
