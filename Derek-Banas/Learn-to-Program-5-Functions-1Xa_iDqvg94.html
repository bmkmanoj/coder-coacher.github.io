5 of my learn to program series in this
part of the tutorial we're going to
cover pretty much everything you'd want
to know about functions and using
functions and I'll clear up a whole
bunch of things with them if you haven't
watched the previous part of the
tutorial you pretty much have to and I
provide a link in the description just
so you can understand everything that's
going on because these tutorials are
going to build upon each other and of
course the goal here is to learn Python
but also to learn how to solve problems
and as well all of the code as well as a
transcript of the video is available in
the description and I have a lot to do
so let's get into it okay so here we are
inside a PI charm once again and i
decide to keep the dark background
because you guys told me you liked it
alright so functions are going to allow
us to reuse codes so that we don't have
to type out everything and write a bunch
of duplicate code like we did in the
last part of the tutorial and as you're
going to see writing or creating
functions is also going to make your
code easier to understand and that is a
major goal whenever you're programming
so to create a function you're going to
type in D EF or D fine and then you're
going to follow that with a function
name so let's just call this ad numbers
then you're going to have parentheses
and you're going to have a comma
separated list of values to pass into
this function or that are expected to be
passed into this function and I'm just
going to call them num1 and num2 then
you're going to have a colon then you're
going to have a return value you don't
have to have a return value but just
understand if you don't have a return
value and you try to print the results
of a function you're always going to get
the answer of none as we'll get a little
bit more into here in a little bit now
what we're going to do is we are just
going to return these two numbers added
together so there's num1 and num2 and
now we can call our function so we could
do something like print 5 plus 4 is
equal to and then follow that up by
calling for our function to go and add
these values for us and then 5 and 4
separated with a comma and if we run it
you're going to see 5 plus 4 is equal to
9 so that's a pretty simple function now
we're going to get into something that
confuses people about functions and that
is what it referred to as local
variables now any variable defined
inside of a function is of
only in that function and I'm going to
show you a whole bunch of examples here
so that you will get it so let's create
another function and let's call this a
sign name
so we'll go a sign name like this and
this is going to create an error and
then we'll explain the error and you'll
understand what's going on so what this
function is just simply going to do is
it didn't receive any attributes and
what it's going to do is create a local
variable that's what it is it's inside
of the function and then we're going to
assign a value of dugg to our local
variable now we can go outside of here
and call for a sign name to run and you
would think that it was signed the value
of dugg to name but as you're going to
see if I go in here and try to run it
you are going to get a name error and if
we look specifically at it you're going
to see that name is not defined that
means that name is not defined outside
of the function that's what the error
means okay so it's very well aware that
anything created inside the function is
not available outside of the function at
least in this form another thing that's
important to know is that a global
variable even if it is passed into a
function is not necessarily going to
change the value outside of it now a
global variable is a variable that is
created outside of any function so what
we're going to do here just to
demonstrate this is we'll create another
function and we will call it change name
and inside here let's say we pass in
name and then we try to change the value
of name we then come out of the function
and we are going to create name this is
a global variable it's outside of any
function so that makes it global and
we're going to assign the value of Tom
to it what we're going to do now is we
are going to call change name and we are
going to pass a name inside of it and
you would think that that would change
the name for it well we'll find out if
it does and if we run this you're going
to see that tom comes back see we
created here name and gave it the value
of Tom and even though inside of our
function we tried to change the name to
mark
did not work so we're going to get into
ways we can solve this one way that you
can change the value is to simply pass
the value back so let's just leave this
be change name once again and we can
come in here and this time say return
mark and then have name be equal to Tom
write like this and then we could come
down inside of it and go name is equal
to change name and then try to run it
and now you can see that the name was
actually changed to mark okay so there's
one way to do it there's other ways as
well let's go and let's create a global
let's call this global name so that we
know that it is a global variable and
let's give it the value of Sally now
inside of change name let's not even
have it receive anything so doesn't even
receive and nothing's passed inside of
it and then we want to refer to the
global version of global name we can do
that just by putting global in front of
it like that and then we can come in and
go global name is equal to Sammy and
then come down inside of here delete all
this stuff and call for change name to
execute and then down in the print area
we will call global name and if we run
that you can now see that Sammy is there
and if we also you see here that we're
saying inside of our function we want to
use the global version of GBL name
inside of our function and that gives us
permission to go in and be able to
change it I talked about previously if
we went and created a function and we
didn't have a return value that it would
return none let's come in and
demonstrate that as well so we'll create
a function here called get some and we
will have it pass number1 and number2
inside of it we will then create some
num1 plus num2 inside of that function
and then we will come down here and try
to print the results so we'll just say
get some and then inside of it we'll
pass five and four and if we run it you
can see right here that we get a value
of none passed inside of it
so just some things to be aware of when
we're working
functions and now we come to our very
first problem what I want you to do here
is solve for X and by that I mean that
we want to make a function that's going
to receive an algebraic equation
something like X plus 4 is equal to 9
and to be able to solve this problem
you're going to have to watch the
previous parts of the tutorial because
I'm going to be using some tools that I
covered back then now some rules that
we're going to have for our little
problem here is that X will always be
the first value receive and you only
will deal with addition so basically we
know that we're always going to get
input based off of this it's going to
have this exact format and we could deal
with solving algebraic equations in
which they didn't have this strict
format but I'm going to do it this way
just to keep everything simple and keep
this problem a little bit simpler so you
could jump in there and try to create
that otherwise I'm going to give you a
couple hints here so basically what I
want you to do is I want you to create a
function and it is going to receive the
string string meaning this algebraic
equation right here and split the string
into variables and I showed you how to
do that in previous parts of the
tutorial then inside of our function
we're going to have to convert the
strings into n just the numbers that is
and then we're going to convert the
result into a string and join or
concatenate it to the string it's going
to say something like X is equal to and
then whatever the value of X is and then
outside of our function we're going to
have a print statement that's going to
call for our function to execute all
right so pause the video try to solve
this problem otherwise I'm going to show
you how to solve it right now ok so
basically what we're going to do is we
are going to come inside of here and we
are going to create a function and I'm
going to
all this solve equation and it is going
to receive the equation inside of it we
are then going to break this out or
split out the string into these multiple
different variables that we have here
and talked about this in previous parts
of the tutorial now what we're going to
do is we're going to take the equation
which is a string and we're going to
split it out into all of these different
variables that we have inside of here a
shortcut way that we can come in and
convert or cast multiple strings into
the integers is to go like this and I'm
one and on two so that's something
that's a little bit new and I'm kind of
guessing you didn't do that that's okay
just want to use this as an excuse to
come in here and show you different ways
of doing things then we want to convert
our result into a string and join it
with X is equal to so make sure we have
our white space here corrected let's go
and tab that in there like that well
let's get rid of it all together it's a
little bit long so we're going to
convert this and we're going to return
our value and it's just going to be X is
equal to and then after that we'll put
plus we're going to have to convert our
result back in with string and then
we'll go number two - number one then
outside of our function down here we can
just simply go print and solve equation
and then we will pass our equation
inside of it so we'll go X plus four is
equal to nine and if we run that you'll
see our result comes back as X is equal
to five okay so if you want some
additional homework you can come in here
and figure out how to make this work if
it is in this format or if it is maybe a
subtraction multiplication division you
have all the knowledge already from the
previous parts of the tutorial to be
able to handle that and also come in
here and figure out how to make it work
where you have 4 plus X is equal to 9 I
think those all would be really good
homework problems once again if you
didn't get it right don't worry about it
the whole goal here is just to introduce
you to a bunch of problems and out
all of them and after a while you'll be
able to do it alright so now what I want
to do is talk about how do we return
multiple values well let's go and create
a function here so we'll say something
like multiple divide is the name of our
function and I'm going to have num1 and
num2 inside of here and if I want to
return multiple different values all I
have to do is put those values inside of
return separated with a comma so we
could just go num1 and then multiply
that times num2 and then separate that
with comma make sure you have multiply
they're not 1/8 and then inside here
we'll also go numb 1 divided by num2
alright now you're after watch out here
that this isn't a zero because that'll
throw an error but we're not going to
worry about that right now so what this
function is going to do is it's going to
return both the multiplication of these
two values and the division of those two
values so we could then receive multiple
values here by just coming in and
putting commas between those two guys
and then call for our function to run on
itself and then pass in our two values
and then we could of course come down
here and print out our results as well
and then just throw a mult inside of
there and then do exactly the same thing
here thereafter with divide so divide
and divide and if we run it you'll see
that indeed that did work for us as well
so that's how we return multiple
different values maybe it also like to
know how to return a list and in this
situation when we do something a little
bit neater I'm going to come in here and
return a list of primes but first before
I do that let's think about how we would
come in and solve that so that we can
return a list of primes now of course we
know that a prime can only be divided by
1 and itself so for example if you have
5 which is a prime the reason why it is
a prime is because whenever you divide
it by 1 and 5 those are the only
situations in which you receive a
positive factor and that just means that
there is no remainder from the division
6 is not prime of course and the reason
why is you can divide 6 by 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 as
well as itself so it's knowing that
knowledge let's think about how we'll
solve this
basically what we want to do here is
we're going to receive a request for
primes up to an input value so we're
going to ask the user to type in the
maximum prime we you know that we want
to search for and then what we're going
to do so we'll just say input max prime
that we're going to search up to then
what we're going to do is use a for loop
and check if modulus is equal to 0 if
there is a situation in which we are
searching for anything other than 1 or
the value itself and we come back with a
true statement whenever we use modulus
on that function remember modulus
returns the remainder of a division if
it comes back at 0 that means the
division worked so what we're going to
do is check for that and that's
basically all the information that I
need so what I want to do is I want to
break this down into parts because it's
always better to have more functions or
it's almost always better to have more
small functions rather than great big
giant long functions so I'm going to
create a function here called is prime
and it's going to receive a number and
it's just going to find out even though
what we're doing here is searching for a
list of primes I want to break this down
so I check each individual number by
itself and that's what is Prime's going
to do and you can make this uppercase if
you'd like or you could come in here and
put a space inside of here or do
whatever you want okay so I'm going to
go in there and do that so the very
first thing we may have to do is create
a for loop that's going to cycle through
Prime's from 2 to the value that we want
to check so I'll just say for I in range
and then the range we know that we don't
have to check for 1 because that's going
to come back positive for everything
because everything is divisible by one
so we're going to put 2 inside of there
instead and I'm not going to make this
the greatest prime number calculator
because actually we don't need to
calculate the whole way up to the max
value I'm just going to keep it simple
here right now though that could be
homework if you wanted to optimize this
to find Prime's quicker go for it but I
just want to keep it simple so then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to check if
any division has no remainder if that
comes back as positive then we know that
this number isn't a prime so what we
have to do is just come in and say if
num and modulus I is equal to zero in
any situation well then we are going to
return false as an answer if however we
cycle through our entire for loop and we
never get an answer for false actually
false as in throw us out of the program
altogether well then we know that it's
true that we do have a prime number all
right so I got this this guy is going to
handle checking each of the Prime's now
what I need to do is create a function
that is going to deal with getting a
prime number list so I'm going to go get
call let's get Prime's like this and
it's going to receive a maximum number
up to which we are going to check for
prime numbers I am then going to create
a list which once again is just an
indexed number of pieces of data so it's
going to start off just like strings
it's going to 0 1 2 3 4 and then each
one of those boxes is going to contain
something in this situation that
something is going to be a prime number
so we'll call this list of primes in the
next part of the tutorial I'll get more
into lists and how we create a list is
by saying hey we want a box of stuff and
that's how we create a list now what I'm
going to do is create a for loop that's
going to cycle through all the of the
primes from 2 to the maximum value
requested so I'm going to go for and
I'll call this number 1 in range and
we'll cycle from 2 through the max
number that we want to deal with inside
of here and then it's going to be real
easy to check if this is a prime number
or not so we're just going to go is
prime like that and we will pass in
number 1 that we're going to be checking
for and then if that comes back
as true then we're going to say list of
primes and if you want to add an
additional item into our boxes of boxes
which are lists you just call append and
then pass in whatever you want to be
passed inside of there all right so now
that we have all of that all set up we
can come in and we cycled through every
single item over Prime and we created
our list of primes and then we can come
in and pass back our list of primes so
now what we're going to do outside of
any of our different functions we are
going to ask the user to enter the
maximum it's a kind of a wordy function
but whatever I'm going to come in here
and ask them what is the maximum Prime
you want us to search for and I'm going
to use input for this and I'll just say
something like search for Prime's up to
and we'll get that and then I can come
in and go list of primes and then we can
call our function get Prime's and pass
inside of it the maximum number that we
want to check for and after we do that
if I want to print out every single
prime number from a list I can go for
prime in and then what I want to search
for which is the list of primes that is
the list we're dealing with and then I
can come in and print out each
individual prime number and run it all
right so let's test this see if it works
search for Prime's up two and we can try
100 and there you can see automatically
went in there and shot out all the prime
numbers and we can come in and do even
more 1000 and you can see how quickly it
went through and calculated all that so
it's quite quite neat alright so there
you go that is how we can deal with
primes and just dealing with some
functions in Python in general another
thing that is great to know is how do we
deal in a situation of which we have a
unknown number of arguments being passed
into our functions so what we're going
to be able to do is we're going to be
able to receive an unknown number of
arguments using what is called the splat
operator so let's create a function and
we'll call it sum all and since we don't
know how
any items we're going to get we're going
to put the splat inside a hair that's
what this is flat and it's going to be
able to deal with it for us so let's say
when I add an unknown number of
arguments together we'll create some
which is going to you know have our
final amount and then we can cycle
through all of those different items
inside of there by just putting args you
don't put the splat in front of there
just put args like that and then we can
come in and increment the value based
off of I and again make sure outside of
the for loop we then command echo
returns sum and then we can come in and
print all of this so we can say sum and
then call sum all and then passing as
many values as you'd like it doesn't
matter and it's automatically going to
work for us as you can see right there
so that is the basics of functions now
what I'm going to do is go and create a
much larger little program and
demonstrate more in which we can do with
functions inside of Python okay for our
next example we're going to use the math
function what I want to do here is
create a program that's going to allow
us to go and calculate area for multiple
different shapes and I'm going to use
the math function for this something
else you may if you're acquainted at all
with Python you might be wondering why
if I not use the main function well you
don't technically need to use main
function but very often we place our
main programming logic in a function
called main and it's going to be created
exactly like this we just go define and
main like that and then you're going to
put your colon and there you go there's
your main function if you want to run
this main function automatically when
the program is executed you then type
main at the very bottom here and main is
going to run and the reason why is
everything else is going to be in
functions and this is going to be and
they're going to be ignored the
functions are going to be ignored unless
they're called of course and here this
is going to be the only thing that is
going to be able to execute for us so
what we're going to do here like I said
is we're going to calculate area using
multiple different functions and
specifically I am going to go and
calculate area for both
rectangles as well as circles and if you
wanted to do this without functions
you'd have to create a giant lists of
ifs and L lifts and things like that
which are just terrible in this
situation our goal here is to have main
only have this code inside of it
basically we're going to ask the user
what type of shape they want to use so
I'm going to go input and I'm gonna say
get area for what shape then I want to
call a function that will route to our
correct function that's going to handle
actually calculate in the area and I'll
call this one get area and we're going
to pass shape type into that guy and I
think that's enough so what's better to
have a whole bunch of ifs and elfs L
lifts and things like that or to have
two very easy to understand pieces of
code here that are going to go and
calculate the area my problem is I have
to go and create get area so let's go up
here and outside of main and let's
create those functions now basically get
area is just going to act as a router to
another function that is actually going
to generate the areas for different
types of shapes so we'll just go and
we'll call this get area and of course
it is going to get a shape passed into
it and you can think about exactly
what's going to happen here you could go
ahead and try to calculate this on your
own pause the screen or whatever
otherwise I'm going to show you exactly
what I'm going to do here very first
thing I want to do is I want to switch
shape to lowercase so that I don't have
to check for Oh lower case and upper
case versions of whatever this string is
that they passed inside here so I'll
just call it lower now I'm going to come
in and I'm going to say if shape is
equal to rectangle well in that
situation I am going to call a function
that is going to be called rectangle
area and otherwise make sure that I have
my white space here right now I don't
say make sure that's all set up correct
there we are let's go and type that in
to have that in otherwise I'm going to
go LF and check
shape is equal to circle and if it is
then I'm going to call function that I
haven't created yet called circle area
and then you should always come in there
and have a default in the situation in
which they don't enter rectangle or
circle and I'm going to handle that
situation by just typing in please enter
rectangle or circle alright so that's
all that functions going to do again
it's very easy to understand what's
going on because everything is just a
couple lines of code and it's nice and
neat that's another benefit of functions
keep these these code blocks as small as
humanly possible now what I need to do
is create a function is going to
calculate my rectangular area and we
already know what it's going to be
called it's going to be called rectangle
area and it doesn't receive anything put
a colon inside of there now what's it
going to need to do what's they need to
use or ask the user what is the length
of this and I'm going to convert this
into a float because I don't know what
I'm going to be dealing with integers or
floats and I'm going to ask for input
here and I'll just say enter the link
and then I'm also going to have to get
the width so I'll come in here and
change this the width and we'll say
enter the width
I'm sure why it went and did that silly
stuff and then of course it's going to
have to print out a result well why
don't we keep everything all nice and
neat all on separate lines sometimes it
makes more sense to go and have multiple
different lines if it makes the code
easier to understand and here I'm just
going to length times width to calculate
that area and then we will come in and
print out this information so we'll say
the area of the rectangle is and then we
will print out whatever the area is now
we're going to use a very similar type
of test here whenever we are calculating
the circle so we're going to go define
and what are we going to use we're going
to use circle area here in this
situation so let's copy that create that
function same sort of format except with
the circle we're going to need the
radius and we want to be able to accept
floating-point values we'll put it in
there like that and we'll go
input and we'll say enter what make sure
it's in quotes inside here enter the
radius calculate the area in this
situation this is the reason why I
imported math and cider here is so I
could go math PI and then I'm going to
multiply that times and then I'll call
and use the power function and pass
inside of it radius and two and then we
will just output our information in
regards to the area for our circle the
area of the circle is and then we can
come in here and decide that we only
want to use two decimal places we'll put
a colon and a dot and a two followed by
an F for float and we're going to use
format here of course and then we'll
just pass the area inside of it like
that
all right so everything's in its place
all the code blocks are nice and short
and it's very easy to understand exactly
what's going on and what's even better
is it's extensible we could come in and
calculate multiple different shapes just
by coming in here and putting more
elif's inside of here and then creating
more functions to go and be able to
calculate areas for even more functions
and if we come in and run it whoops I'll
lift the shape that I you know what I
did wrong here LF up here if I've got to
put my colon inside here so if you get
that invalid syntax you know what that
is
oops and what I do here up enter the
length I was being silly and I forgot to
put my quotes inside of here so let's go
and do that times when I'm talking and
coding I'm not thinking too good
everything else looks like it's good so
let's run it get area for what shape and
I can come in here and type in circle
and enter the radius and I'll just type
in 30 and you can see that it comes back
and it's also formatted to only two
decimal places because I said that's
what I wanted it to do down here with
format and of course we can come in
and what shape and we could do rectangle
and enter the length and I could say
something like three and then I could
enter four and twelve comes back as a
result so there you go guys that is
rundown of some things you can do with
functions and using Python and for your
homework I'd like you to all go in there
and add the ability to calculate the
area for parallelograms rhombuses
triangles and trapezoids just to give
you a little bit more practice all right
so just like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
