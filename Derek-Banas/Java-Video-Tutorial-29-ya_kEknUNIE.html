29 of my Java video tutorial series
today I'm going to talk about the grit
bag layout as well as the grid layout I
need to get myself some libraries of
course and everything that's on here
you've already seen a million times so
I'm just gonna skip over parts of it the
first thing we're going to need is the
grid bag constraints library and what
you do with this is you're going to
define rules for how your components are
displayed whenever you're using the grid
bag layout and then of course I need to
go and get the grid bag layout library
and there that is and then I also need
to get the grid layout library because
we're also going to review that and a
grid layout is similar to a grid bag
layout the only thing is it's a lot more
constrained it's just going to lay
everything out in a grid hence the name
you're gonna see what's going on and
then I also need to bring in Java are in
sets and this is going to allow me to
define padding in regards to my
components alright so got all that here
I create a whole bunch of different
buttons here I create a text field here
we're calling all this here we're
displaying the frame and all the other
things you've seen a million times
before so let's just jump right in here
and create our grid layout and we're
just going to go the panel we're going
to go set layout and inside of here
we're going to go new grid layout and
then what you need to define is the
number of rows now if you leave this as
zero that's just telling the layout tool
to use as many rows as needed then we're
going to say we want to have three
columns that's going to help it be able
to figure out how many rows to put in
there and then we're going to define we
want a two pixel horizontal gap and a
two pixel vertical gap between all of
the different components so pretty
simple then we have to create all of our
different buttons inside of here so I'm
going to go but one is equal to nu J
button and then give it some default
text of course put a space inside of
there then we're going to create one of
these for all the different buttons that
we're going to need and there we go and
I just have to correct all the different
text inside of these and putting
together a layout that is going to be
very similar to what you would do if
you're trying to create a calculator and
there you go so we got all of our
different buttons to find inside of this
guy so now what I need to do is add all
these different buttons to microd layout
grid
layout is very very very basic so I just
go the panel like that and then I'm
going to go ad and then I just have to
put all these buttons that I defined up
here into my grid layout and then just
change the names there you can see
through all those different buttons
inside of there and that is all I need
to do if I execute this you can see
there is a very very basic calculator so
basic that it doesn't actually add
anything together but there is a layout
and as you could see I defined that I
wanted three columns and I said figure
out how many rows we need based off the
components that I add and it
automatically figured all that out now
you normally would never do this you
would have a panel and you'd have a
whole bunch of different panels inside
of the main panel but I'm just trying to
show you exactly how all these different
tools specifically work and that's the
reason why I'm not going into utmost
detail in regards to those couple things
so now let's go in here and create a
grid bag layout which is going to be a
little bit more complicated one thing
we're going to need here is jtextfield
which we didn't previously use and then
of course this is no longer going to be
a grid layout it's going to be a grid
bag layout and in this situation we're
not going to pass anything along however
we do need to come in here and create
what is called the grid bag constraints
so to do that you just go grid bag
constraints and here you're going to
find some rules for all of your
different components going to give it a
name grid constraints is equal to new
and then call the constructor for this
file now I'm going to walk you through
all the different ways you can constrain
or define the way your components are
going to work and again remember this is
just me experimenting and for you to
really get this stuff you're going to
need to do a lot of experimenting on
your own in regards to how to use this
but also once again you're going to be
using panels inside of panels which is
something that I haven't really been
doing that much of but I will get into
in later tutorials one thing you can
define is the exposition by default for
every single component remember these
are defaults that's what they are and
you're going to override them as you are
adding two additional components you can
also come in here and define the Y
position for the components grid width
is going to define by default how many
columns the component is going to take a
grid height is going to define by
default how many rows the component is
going to take out and then you come to
kind of a weird one this is weight x
and wait why what these guys do is they
give the layout manager a hint on how to
adjust component width so that
everything sorta fits into place and if
you give it a default value of zero that
means that it's going to be fixed this
is definitely something going to be
something that you're going to want to
play around with and remember all the
bit code is underneath the video so you
can download it so I'm just going to
throw 50 inside of here and then for my
Y I'm going to throw in 100 getting
something to play with then I need to
come in here remember we have in sets
set above and what this is going to do
is handle padding around my components
and I just call in sets and I'm going to
say that I want five pixels of padding
around all of the additional components
that I throw on the screen by default
and you need to define where to place
components if they do not completely
fill a space and how you do that is by
calling anchor there's a whole bunch of
different values you can give for this
I'm going to say grid bag constraints
and then I'm going to say Center
everything and instead of Center you
could also put north south east west or
north east north west data die that all
those different things are all
possibility for you there then you have
to define how a component can be
stretched to fill in additional spaces
and for this guy you're going to call
fill and in this situation I'm going to
say grid bag constraints and I'm going
to say both and other values that you
could use inside of this guy would be
none horizontal or vertical or of course
both and if you put none in there
obviously nothing is going to be
stretched and then I almost forgot I
need to go to text result is equal to nu
J text field and I'm going to give it a
default value of zero and I'm going to
give it a default size of 20 another
thing that I haven't shown you before is
if you want to change the font for your
text field that's pretty easy to do you
just go font and equals to new and then
you say font and I'm going to say
Helvetica and then after that I'm going
to say font plain means that it's not
going to be bold and of course bold
would be another option you can have
here I'm going to get more into fonts in
a later tutorial and default size of 18
and then you just need to come in here
and go text result which is the name of
your text field and go set
to the font that you just defined inside
of there so that's a way that you can
play around with those different guys
and it looks like I forgot to import the
font library and since I have a clips
here I can just click on import font and
it's automatically going to pull that
library in for me if you want to see
there it is right here
there it is okay now let's scroll back
down inside of here and use the grid bag
you're going to pretty much use the same
things same sort of buttons inside of
here however I'm also going to come in
here and go clear all and to find a new
a button that I want to use inside of
here and I'm going to give it a value of
C and then I can start adding all of my
buttons and text panels and everything
else so basically what we're going to
use is we're going to use these
constraints that we defined way up here
for everything by default and whenever
we decide we need to change one of these
components we just change it down here
and then continue adding components and
you normally would have this all done
and an outside method but again since
this is a tutorial I'm just trying to
keep everything all in one area so the
first thing I want to do is I want to
bring in my clear all button and
actually just save myself time I'm going
to get rid of that copy and right here
I'm going to type in clear all and then
what do I need to do well I need to get
grid constraints I have to tell it how I
want to use this so I go grid
constraints right here copy that scroll
back down and paste that inside of there
well then what I want to do is change my
grid width because the next thing I'm
going to do is throw in a text field so
in this situation what I need to do if I
want to change one of my constraints is
I just go create constraints and then I
just go grid with like this and I'm
going to change it to 20 and this is
something that you really need to play
around with whenever you're getting
involved with this grid bag layout tool
and then I'm also going to come in here
and I'm gonna define that I want my grid
X position to change and I'm just going
to throw five inside of there and that
just means that I want everything to be
moved to the right obviously I want my
clear all button in the upper left-hand
corner and then I want a little bit of
space so I need to move my text field
over some and that's exactly what that
provides me with and what am I gonna do
let me go copy/paste that inside of
there and then I need to throw my text
field inside of here that's just text
result angered constraints of course is
going to stay there just like it has
been and I'm gonna copy grid constraints
again and I'm going to set my grid width
- one like that and then I'm also going
to change my grid exposition back to one
and I'm going to change my grid Y
position equal to two because I want
everything to go downwards and then it's
just a matter of coming in here and add
just a couple little things so let's
just copy this they have all my other
different buttons here I'm going to
paste that side of there then all I need
to do is come in here and make changes
to the grid constraints so that
everything lines up properly basically
I'm just going to be changing the x
position pretty much every single time
to throw everything inside of here and
I'm just going to set this to five again
this is just something I was
experimenting with so then I'm going to
throw nine inside of there and then
after every three components since we're
laying this out like a calculator I'm
also going to have to change the value
of y and X is going to go back to one
and then the value of y I'm just going
to throw in three inside of there and
then we're basically going to do the
same thing again this is gonna be five
it's just the next y-coordinate it's
nothing all that fancy I'm gonna change
that to nine as you can see I'm doing
the same thing see one two and I'm just
moving everything down one here and then
I'm changing the x position as we go
along so in this situation going to come
in here and copy this go right after six
paste that inside of there and then in
this situation I change this to 4 and
then I'm guessing you can probably guess
I'm just going to come in here again and
throw in 5 and then down here I'm going
to throw in 9 so I've changed this to 9
and we're just going to copy this again
and after this guy paste that inside of
there and change this to 5 and then
we're going to copy this again paste a 5
inside of there and here paste a 9 and
because this is the end of all the
components that I want to be able to add
I don't need to do anything else and
based off of those changes they can
execute it you can see exactly how the
calculator is working and their nests
you can see there is the Clear button 1
2 3 4 these are all the different little
components there's my text field laid
out right there and that is an example
of what you can do with grids and grid
bag layouts and you guys are always
asking me for homework so I know you
have the knowledge to do this turn this
into a working calculator leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
