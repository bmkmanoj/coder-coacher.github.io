6 of my flash tutorial today I'm
actually gonna answer four questions
that I received the model different
people but I'm gonna actually attribute
the question to ever ask it first
cariann sent me in a question and asked
me how to make a waving flag inside of
flag well the first thing I'm gonna do
is come in here make yourself a new
symbol I'm gonna call it flag and it's
okay to leave the type is graphic then
what we're gonna do is come over here
select the rectangle tool draw a basic
rectangle on the screen I am going to
make it a less irritating color make it
blue and I'm gonna grab it with the
selection tool pull it down here roughly
in the middle roughly in the middle
again we're gonna pull it down here a
little bit more I want to come in here
and copy and paste and then we're going
to flip vertical drag it over and we'll
line it up with the previous base paste
and we're gonna continue to make these
guys until your shape looks roughly like
this now you're gonna come in create a
new layer over top of that we're gonna
come down here to say frame 40 hit f6
create a new keyframe come in here to
the first frame on your new layer create
a rectangle to make sure that it is big
enough I'm a drag roller down here and
then drag another roller down now I know
that the square that I'm gonna draw
right now is gonna be big enough to
encapsulate the whole flag area I'm
gonna make it a different color like
calm and irritating green and then we
come down here create another keyframe
and then we're going to actually animate
the blue in the background here so come
down to frame 40 grab this and drag it
just until it hits the end of the ugly
green square we have then we're going to
click anywhere inside here create
classic tween click up here and turn
this into a mask and now there's your
flag of course you can monitor the scene
create a frame on your main scene area
and you can drag as many flags as you
would like here make sure you create at
least enough frames to encapsulate the
total animation for the flag and there
you go animated Flags simple not
now just gonna come in here remove these
frames but I just created and matt39 for
requesting an animated card okay long
guess you mean a playing card here is
actually I drew this this is just a
graphic symbol inside of flash bye click
on properties and you can see this is
very very important this must be of type
movie clip okay and I have that already
all set up now if I jump back over to
scene 1 and I'm actually gonna zoom out
here a little bit and I'm gonna take my
plane
movie clip graphic but it's just a
simple drawing again I gotta come down
here and create a new frame drag my car
down here I'm gonna stick it up here on
top and to make this thing look like
it's flipping and rotating like Matt
once it to I'm then gonna come down here
and right-click and click on create
motion tween then if I come down to the
25th frame outside here and I'm just
gonna drag this guy down this card
automatically is gonna create my
animation for me saying now if I want it
to flip all I need to do is find the
card here in a certain position and
because it's a movie clip it's safe
there's a symbol movie clip I can use
this 3d rotation tool I don't want to
grab the orange circle that lies on the
outside of it let's rotate it this way
then click in here a little bit more
rotate it a little bit more and then
rotate it a little bit more and then
rotate it a little bit more and a little
more you can see how really easy it is
to play around this little guy
and there's a rotating card and if I hit
enter you can see there's your card
rotating very very simple to do that
what's really neat I'm actually gonna
have to create a new layer to do this
you could actually draw with a pen tool
the path that you want the card to
actually take no I'm just gonna come in
here select this whole line cut jump in
here and I can actually go grab this
motion line and paste in my own motion
now if I hit return good see not only is
the card flipping but it's also
following along on that line you could
also do crazier things again just
cooking anywhere in here where the
animation is going on you could click on
come over here to rotate and click on
one time and not only is it going to
flip but it's also going to rotate at
the same time you can create all kinds
of really crazy animations inside of
Flash really really really really simple
and you could change the angle on it and
like I showed you in a previous movie of
course you can change or easing so that
it will animate in a more realistic way
of course we're having it do something
completely insane so but there your mat
that is how you animate a card inside of
flash the next thing I'm going to do is
quell Nick asked me to make something
instantly appear I think this is what
you want again this over here this is
just a simple graphic and if I click on
properties you can see that I saved it
as a movie clip this is very important
movie clip it must be a symbol movie
clip I'm gonna jump back over in the
scene 1 and I'm gonna apply a filter to
this guy I have to create a flame first
step 6
drag my movie clips symbol graphic onto
the screen let's come out to frame 45
create another keyframe I'm gonna jump
back to the original version and click
on the movie symbol you can see over
here something called filters well
there's a whole bunch of different
filters available to you as you can see
here drop shows blurs all kinds of
different things you just definitely
play around with them because it's
really neat well here I'm just going to
click on blur and I'm going to come in
here and blur it a whole bunch 2 or 55
is the
maximum and I think I'm in here click
inside of here great classic tween you
can see that this image will go from
blurry to 100% clear if you want it to
totally disappear altogether not a
problem at all click here remember click
on frame or click on the image and you
can add multiple filters let's try
adjust color and let's turn the
brightness the whole way up to 100 and
the contrast up the whole way to 100 now
if you do that you're going to see that
it sort of instantly appears out of
nowhere and if you were asking me how to
do this in regards to a mask because
sometimes I don't know exactly what you
guys are looking for I'll show you how
to do that as well
again create a new frame and then come
in here gonna make a great big giant
circle I just hit the shortcut for the
selection tool I try to use the toolbar
as much as possible but sometimes I slip
up I mean down here create another
keyframe jump back to the original
circle and here I'm actually going to
use this transform area right here I
find it's much easier to use and make a
circle teeny teeny teeny tiny and I'm
gonna shrink it even more so it's fairly
even there and then I'm gonna come in
here and do a shape tween and now and
then of course I've turned this into a
mask which I do just like that and now
you can see that it instantly appears
and at the same time the mask is being
applied and of course I don't have to
have the blur effect in there but
there's two different ways to do kind of
what you asked for so hopefully answer
your question I was also to ask to
simulate a spotlight so how you gonna do
this is first I want to make sure that
this is no longer a mask so I want to
shut masking off and get the rectangle
tool and when I get black as a fill
create a frame hitting f5 or f6 f6 is
keyframe and at five's just regular
frame and I'm gonna come in here and go
change my color let's say I changed my
color to a darkish blue and just type in
zone II since I'm doing this for you if
you leave a comment below I might
actually type your name into a
presentation as well and leave a
question of course now what I'm gonna do
is I'm actually going to copy this whole
entire thing just copy it jump up here
and hit edit paste in place except I'm
gonna change the color on this
background and I'm gonna make it more
precise clicking here raise this just a
little bit click okay then I'm gonna
click on the Ronzoni click in here and
let's just choose that and then I'm
gonna create another layer right here
except this time go to the Oval tool
right like that and I'm gonna give this
a different color so I don't get
confused say like this and I'm also
going to come in here get rid of that
stroke no I'm gonna come out to frame 50
f6 f6 f6 get this guy go to frame 20 5
f6 drag my circle over here and leave
that circle where it is and now come in
here and create a classic tween create a
classic tween right like that and then
guess what I'm gonna do that's right I'm
gonna convert it into a mask and now you
can see and I'm a zoom in so you can see
this better this is how you would create
or simulate a spotlight inside of flash
I'm not certain that you can see that
really really really really well I could
come in here unlock this good this guy
in here and actually get this blue and
make it define it a little bit better
and come in here and maybe bring the
dark up a little bit more like that
so masking and area it's a little bit
easier to see so there are four
different tricks inside of flash if you
have anything you want me to cover leave
it in the comment section below and next
week I will be doing cartoon animation
inside of flash will be making real
cartoons so next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
