brought to you because I received a
question from def by kazillion and he
asked specifically for more illustrator
tutorials so what I'm going to do for
you today is show you how to do a very
common thing in Illustrator and along
the way you're going to learn how to do
a lot of additional things in
illustrator what we're going to do is
I'm going to show you the quick and
dirty way to change a JPEG that it's all
sloppy and nasty looking into any nice
eps file whenever you place your object
inside being this nasty jpg you do that
by clicking file and then clicking place
and finding your graphic and then
clicking on place I already did that
though your may before you can proceed
to the next step have to rasterize this
image how you do that don't worry about
what it means just if you try to go to
trace and paint and you don't see make
as an option yes you're going to have to
rasterize it so click on restaurant
click OK ok now you're going to be able
to go into object and live trace and
then click on tracing options now what
we're going to do is convert this guy
down so a whole entire thing is
basically one color so what we're going
to do here is choose black and white
click on preview and you can see down
here it's already started to make some
changes well you can play around with
the threshold area on the screen and
it's going to automatically help you
pick out the image that you have in here
that you want to recreate whatever you
get to a bit to a point in which you
like it if you want to cut out all the
white and the part in the background
click on ignore white and then click on
trace what it did was it converted
everything but we're gonna have to zoom
out here again go in the object go down
the Live Paint and then click on make
click OK alright now we're going to be
able to edit this guy we want to delete
this this binding box that goes around
it we're gonna have to do is come up
here and click on the direct selection
tool committing in here and we're going
to want to delete that surrounding box
like I did right there client wants all
of these buildings basically client
wants it to look like this so what we're
going to have to do is come in here and
delete all these individual elements
that we're going to come in and clean up
for the client so I'm just using again
the selection tool coming in here and
believe in the one all the parks we
don't want and then we can zoom in
here take a look at this guy we're also
going to want to retype in this text
here so I'm going to delete this out
here and look to even sloppier in the
JPEG so this will look nice and sharp
this guy right here we're not going to
be able to delete it without deleting
everything so it's just drag it down you
could of course also come in here to
this pen tool and click on the delete
Anchor Point tool and delete the anchor
points based off of that it's going to
shape up everything real nice for you
additionally we want to come in here and
click on this and you can see I'm just
deleting all these points all these
straight points anything that touches
like we have here we're not going to
want to play with that we want to use
the pen tool that will delete the paths
for us again click on that and delete
all those three points but it's not
going to mess anything else up do the
same thing down here with a stray I and
then if you look in here you can see
there's a little a little blip right
here well if we zoom in even further use
the magnifying lens real quickly you can
change the arrow tool by holding down
the command or ctrl key getting one a
few have windows or a Mac then come up
here to the vert anchor cool if i click
on these individual points it's going to
flatten them it's going to take the ark
out of them now if you wanted to put the
arc back in all you have to do is click
on it with that same exact tool you can
see here that i'm able to edit those
points i'm going to ctrl z to make go
back to the way that it was because i
don't want it to be like that back to my
selection tool to lead out the rest of
the little pieces that I don't want ok
everything is all nice and cleaned up
now let's go back in here and put health
back in here how exactly do you do that
go back to your pen tool now if we
wanted to select everything on here and
lock this guy down so we could draw on
top of it get our angles right just
select everything hit object come up the
lock lock selection come in here with a
pen tool we're going to do is we're
going to copy the arc that we have right
there now we come over to this type tool
click and hold down on the left button
come to type on path tool and we're
going to type on the path
type in health a little bit big now
everything's shaping up and everything
lines up I'm going to come in here and
do the same thing with chiropractor go
back to your pen tool click here back
over to the text tool click on that path
select it increase the number of points
in the font boom just a whole bunch of
things act okay will then come in here
and clean this up come in here lead some
points real nice and easy to do got
everything all cleaned up drag
chiropractor over all right now we want
to get the building in here how do you
do that with the gradient tool I've
already messed up my image I'm going to
go in here and click on file place jump
over here grab this guy bring them in
object lock selection I want to redraw
these buildings right here how am I
going to do that well I'm going to go
over here again to my pen tool and if i
zoom in i'll be able to select and
redraw these buildings now if I'm with
the line to be straight up hold down
shift key while I'm doing this and you
can see how nice and easy everything
falls right in place now you're just
going to have to trust that I drew all
these buildings okay so i got the
buildings all drawn in here so i want to
add the gradient effect like you can see
right here in the logo above so i just
click on this jump over here on the
right click on gradient and you can see
that everything is grading from left to
right i want to change that by the way
if you would want to change the gradient
you could put an um they're just by
clicking on this line and then you could
increase like let's say when black
highlight in the center what have you
how many controls eating get rid of that
and I've grabbed this little nub just
drag it off of that leads right for you
I'm going to go over here to the
gradient tool change the angle of the
gradient so it's going from top to
bottom so got this guy all set up what
I'm going to do now is hit control C
them and a copy it and then a control f
to paste another version of it in the
front why am i doing that you can see
there's a stroke here on the top there's
no stroke across the bottom so I want to
emulate that so I'm going to come in
here first come over here to the left
side and click
no to eliminate that gradient but then I
want to click on the stroke itself on
the left side double clicked on it
brought up this page I'm going to choose
a darker gray dark gray and click OK
boom strokes on there already problem is
I have a stroke down here as well just a
quick tip if you want to get rid of your
highlights I'm going to hit ctrl H or
command H and that's going to make i'm
just still selecting it but it's not
showing the paths so i want to get rid
of this guy down here how do i do that
come over here where you see the eraser
tool and I'm going to click on that and
I'm going to go to the knife tool going
to hold down command or control to bring
up my little selection tool going to
select that item and I'm just going to
cut it open with a knife and this time
I'm going to do the individual direct
selection tool click delete click delete
click delete and now i got my buildings
all done exactly the way that I want
them I got all of the strokes where
they're supposed to be about the
gradient where it's supposed to be and
everything so I select that I'm gonna
drag it over here client decided they
wanted it it's set up this way so I left
it the way that it is now the only thing
we got to do is change this from black
to a dark gray so I'm going to select
this guy come over here click on edit
edit colors click on a just color
balance preview convert and i'm going to
change this to a light gray instead of
dark black click OK you can see now it's
a light gray instead of that dark black
now i'm going to create the text down
here I'm cool new here click on type
tool click now if i select this text I
can enlarge it by using this box right
here and just drag it or i can come in
here select this text with my text tool
and I'm going to increase the font
that's just about right now if I select
everything I can change the orientation
of the text I'm going to Center it in
this case and now i have my text in the
right position but as you can see on
this previous version that i created up
here it's really easy to see the text
down here it's running in a little bit
so what we're going to do is we're going
to actually come in select this tax move
it around a little bit then we're going
to create an outline behind here so i
want to copy that and then I want to
paste it back by hitting either command
or control bait they don't add a stroke
to it with color white and I did that by
just clicking over here clicking all
white then I click on this story
tool over here and I'm going to increase
the stroke so that's a real quick and
dirty and easy and nice way to create a
JPEG into an eps file that looks pretty
doggone nice and it's going to print
really really nice if you don't know
this about eps files i could enlarge
this guy's big as I want to and
everything's still going to stay crisp
and clean on like a JPEG if you have any
questions leave them in the comment
