6 of my UML 2 video tutorial today we're
going to talk about timing diagrams and
here is a timing diagram just for you to
look at and don't worry I'm gonna zoom
in and show you all the different parts
of them the first thing I'm going to do
is go into the analysis and how to
figure out things like States and the
different participants that you're going
to be working with and the events and
when they are going to be triggered so
let's get back into that and then we'll
come back to this now whenever you're
trying to make a timing diagram the very
first thing at least that I do is try to
figure out all the different states for
all the different participants if you
haven't seen the previous parts of this
tutorial there's a link in the bottom
right-hand corner and you can definitely
check those out because that's where I
got this step-by-step list of
requirements for our computer program
we'll put together basically this is an
ATM machine for getting money from banks
and what I'm listing here are all of the
things that our ATM machine needs to do
customers going to insert card cards
either invalid or valid the cards going
to be a ejected card is valid customer
enters pin pin is valid bla bla bla bla
bla these are going to be all of the
different states for all of the
different participants in our timing
diagram and I also found that using
timing diagrams really flush together
and made the whole entire process of
creating the program very easy for me so
now that we have our states we want to
figure out what exactly are the
participants we're going to use well in
this situation I kind of dumb this down
a good bit we're going to have the
customer the card reader and the bank
system that's going to have all the
information for our customer then I'm
going to take my customer and I'm going
to look at all of the different states
for my customer so I'm going to have
card in hand they insert card enter pin
select account and select amount say I'm
breaking down everything into all the
possible states for this customer object
which in the future is going to make it
very easy to create all the methods for
this customer object then I have my card
reader which is going to have the
different states of no card receives
card card valid card in valid invalid
amount and other different things my
card reader is also to a certain extent
acting as the ATM machine itself and
then finally we have our bank system
which is going to have no card valid pin
in
I'd pay an account valid amount valid
amount invalid and account invalid so
then from this point it's just a matter
of me taking these participants and
putting all these states in the right
order and if you didn't notice here they
are pretty much in the right order right
now when the bank system first starts
out of course it's going to have no card
just like with the card reader no card
and just like the customer card in hand
so we want to put all these states in
order so that it's very easy to transfer
them over to the timing diagram and
doing this also really helps out with
sequence diagrams as well and this list
came from my use case diagram which like
again is in part one of the UML tutorial
so now let's jump over and take a look
at a real life timing diagram and here
we have our real life timing diagram and
I used UML let to create this guy which
is free and I'll provide a link
underneath the video with both a cheat
sheet all the stuff you see on the
screen is there as well as a link to
that free software and you can see here
I have my steps of execution right here
on the screen I just transferred over
all of the different states for all of
the different objects in my program or
in my computer system and now it's just
a matter of transferring this list over
to this timing diagram and you can see
here I have my user and there's a list
of all the different states for it to be
and cross the bottom I have seconds it's
a timing diagram and has something to do
with time so you should definitely put
that in there and I have this marked off
a second so ever you could just have
this be an unknown time sequence and
then just use T across the board and
it's very important to know that timing
diagrams are going to be used to detail
interactions based off of time and with
these timing diagrams you're just
basically going to describe win events
occur how long they take for other
participants to react and how long it'll
take to complete each individual
interaction and like I said before a
timing diagram is going to be made up of
multiple different participants events
and changing states of course and
whenever you're creating these diagrams
you need to display your participants
and just like we did before we're going
to have the participants name followed
by a colon and the name of the class for
this user object in this situation and
we did the same for all of the other
different participants up above and it's
very important especially with timing
diagrams that if a participant doesn't
add anything to a
IMing diagram that you should not
include it if it doesn't have major
interactions there's no reason for it to
exist on a timing diagram and then as we
float across here you're going to see
how participants are going to change
state based off of certain events being
triggered we can come up through here
and we can see here on our screen now
this is the card reader or the ATM
machine itself and this is the user so
the user starts off with card in hand
and then we're just going to draw a line
up to insert card and this event is
going to trigger the ATM machine to
change states from no card to receive
card and then what we're going to do is
use what are called timing constraints
to try to figure out roughly how long
it's going to take it to change from one
state to another so from the time that
the ATM machine receives a card to the
point where it marks my card as valid
we're going to say that that takes
roughly three seconds like I said before
time measuring it's going to either be
measured as exact times or on a relative
basis if you're using a relative basis
you would just use a lowercase T and
then also you're going to see here that
as the participants change state in
response to these many different events
you're going to show those events and
how they are affecting other
participants by drawing arrows so we
have an arrow starting here with insert
card up to receive card in the ATM
machine itself and you're basically
going to know when to trigger these
events by comparing those events to the
events in sequence diagrams which we
went over sequence diagrams in the past
and that brings us to timing constraints
as we zoom out you can see there's just
a whole bunch of arrows going all over
the different places and this is the
lifeline as you can see here with this
little note that I have here so this is
the lifeline in comparison to the other
guys so let's take a look at the
different timing constraints that are
available to us if we push just simply
put in a lowercase T which is the normal
way to document time on a relative basis
this is just saying that it's going to
take the same value as T to be able to
complete this interaction then you can
put 3t which is going to be 3 of
whatever the time unit is you can also
use less than 3 greater than 3 or less
than 6 that's how you would document
that
or here you could show up to three times
T or you could get rid of the times of
course and just put in a 3t or whatever
you want and then this is another way or
the final way to show a time constraint
which would be three to six
whatever the relative time unit is but
another situation we are using seconds
as we showed way down here and you're
basically just going to block out
everything on your screen and just show
the changing states as the different
events affect all of the different
events that we have here on our screen
so it's pretty straightforward and
whenever you are arranging your
participants it normally makes sense to
arrange them in the exact same order as
they appear in your sequence diagrams
and you normally would create your
sequence diagrams at a time and there's
really nothing else to it you just want
to pick your participants and you want
to of course arrange your participants
in an order that makes sense from the
first interaction which would be the
customer inserting a card and then the
ATM machine or the card reader reading
the card and then the bank system being
called and then you want to do the same
thing with your events which is list
them from their basic state which would
be no card valid a pin invalid pin
account valid amount valid bla bla bla
bla bla and when I'm creating these
different guys I like to create a couple
different timing diagrams or a show best
case scenario like we have here where we
just say okay they entered a valid card
they entered a valid PIN the amount that
they chose is valid and the account they
chose is valid and then we could also go
through the process of how things are
going to change when things are not in
their optimal state so basically if you
just look at these guys you're going to
see exactly how to lay them out and this
is all that is really tool but now I'm
going to show you the alternative timing
diagram which I actually prefer to this
guy and here it is on your screen in
this situation what we're doing is to
conserve space and I think to actually
keep things a lot more tight and neat
what we're going to do here is just draw
these little diamond shape polygons
shaped little guys inside of here and
you can draw arrows just like you did
previously if you'd like to do that and
then you're doing use your time
constraints in exactly the same way as
well as your time units are all going to
be defined in exactly the same way so I
just like this because I just feel that
it looks a lot neater and also I think
it's kind of easy
to see exactly when different events are
going to be triggered and it's very easy
to zero in on different timing
constraints so there is a pretty verbose
overview of how to create timing
diagrams like I said before there's a
link under the video you can get all the
stuff you see here on the screen on one
nice little cheat sheet pretty easy to
learn these guys especially if you go
over all the other different diagrams
that I've shown previously leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
