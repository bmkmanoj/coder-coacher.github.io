7 of my wordpress theme tutorial where
I'll teach you everything you need to
know about making themes inside of
WordPress if you didn't watch part 6 of
this tutorial definitely watch that
otherwise you will be confused like I
say all the time well after the last
tutorial I left you with this hot mess
over here what's on the right side of
the screen in this part of the tutorial
I'm actually gonna clean up everything
you can see everything looks like
garbage so I'm gonna come in and I'm
gonna show you how to work with the CSS
code that we created in the HTML or the
CSS version of this tutorial which I
think was part 5 I'll put a link on the
screen to it and that's exactly what I
have here on the screen right now I have
style dot CSS that we created in that
part of the tutorial and by the end of
this tutorial everything on the right
side of the screen is gonna be nice and
neat like you see right here it's
beautiful with the nurse and the old
lady and it's great so I just got to
jump in here the first thing I'm gonna
correct is right here this is the blog
name and then I'm gonna move on to the
little search tool so I'm going to go
into style dot CSS and I'm gonna come
down to the blog title which is the
current thing that's messed up well I
can't really edit anything here because
it's a to the link so if I try to make
it change to blog title it's not gonna
take so what I need to do is come in
here and do a blog title and put an A
inside of there and then if I want to
get rid of the underline that is there I
just go text decoration and and it's
gone and then I go color and I go ffffff
which is white and if I file save that
reload it you can watch Oh okay keep
your changed so that's beautiful as per
the blog slogan everything's fine right
there I don't need to change anything
with it and however I do need to change
the little search tool here because it's
all messed up and I gave it the ID of
search box whenever I created it I'm
gonna go in here and edit that so what
I'm gonna do I'm gonna position it
absolutely and all that means is I'm
gonna tell it exactly where to be placed
on the screen based off the pixels so I
wanted 675 pixels from the left and I
want it 65 pixels from the top and I
wanted to have a color that's text color
of white and I want it to have a font of
bold and I want that to be 15 pixels
with a line height of 1.4 and I want it
to be Georgia and if Georgia isn't
available I want it to be a regular
font and then I want to throw a text
shadow on it that is black and I want it
to be two pixels down and two pixels to
the right and I want a blur of one pixel
and if I file save that reload it you
can see the little search box is exactly
where I want it to be it's beautiful
okay so now what are we gonna move on to
well I'm gonna have to make some changes
here to the sidebar because it looks
like a total mess and the very first
thing I'm gonna do is copy this isn't
lazy and I'll paste that in there and I
want to change the links in the sidebar
to something that looks a little bit
nicer so I'm gonna tab in here and I'm
gonna say I want my color to be that
burgundy that I use and one of you guys
out there is very good at designing
websites and you want me to make you a
wordpress theme based off of that
send me a Photoshop of what you want it
to look like and I will pick the best
one for whoever sends it to me and
whatever cuz I'd like to make a couple
themes as long as you're willing to then
give it away for free if you're not
willing to give it away for free don't
send me anything okay so I went and did
that and I'm gonna do the same exact
thing for the second sidebar so I just
go second step first and we file save
that and we watch over here reload it
you can see now this is what I changed
right here I changed all these links in
here so that they are sans-serif and
then I got to come in here to the first
sidebar make a couple little changes
inside of here
like for example I want to put a border
left on this sidebar right here so I'm
just gonna put it in wherever so if I
want a border left I type in border left
and then I say I want it to be two
pixels I want it to be solid you could
have it be dotted if you prefer have it
be whatever you'd like and then that
burgundy color and then I'm gonna change
my width because I've decided I don't
like the width to this I want to be a
little bit wider so I'm gonna put 75
pixels in here and I'll fix this later
on and also I don't want dots all over
everything because these are lists so
I'm gonna say list style type and I'm
gonna say and then because I don't want
them dots in there and then file save it
reload and you can see now there's a
little border in there and everything
looks pretty and if you want to watch
this full screen this is an HD movie so
you can definitely watch it full screen
it'll be like I'm right there with you
so I change the other
sideboard 175 so I'm gonna change this
one to 175 and then I want to get my
list-style-type copy that from up there
paste that in so that none of those
bullets show up and I also want to move
over all of this stuff to the left so
you doing the list-style-type and get
rid of that that's not gonna make this
go over I have to actually tell it I
want it to go over and how you do that
using CSS is by typing in list style
position and inside as an option and
we're gonna have to change some of these
other little guys around here sidebar
title we're not going to need at all
anymore so goodbye sidebar title and
instead we're gonna need first sidebar
h2 because each one of those is an h2
tag and I'm gonna have to go in area
individually and get rid of all these
other little bullets and make a couple
other little changes so I'm gonna say
font and I'm gonna say bold 15 pixels
line height of 1.0 point though and I'm
gonna say I want this to be arial
sans-serif and then I want my text color
to be that burgundy again and I want to
do the same thing for the second sidebar
so copy and paste it and then change
this to second yeah you know that's all
working and I also want to give myself
some room down here so I can actually
move around a little bit and I'm gonna
have to come and make a couple of little
changes to the list items because the
other thing that I just did didn't work
or it didn't working perfectly anyway so
I'm gonna go sidebar I'm gonna go ul Li
and I go margin left and I'm gonna
change that to negative 30 pixels so
that'll move it over and I'm gonna say
this style
none all right so that'll do it I don't
get rid of that extra space and the
bullets and then I'm gonna say I want
this to be a second or so and file save
that and reload it yeah you know
everything's fixed here but I gotta fix
this stuff if I want to see a say it
looks prettier everything's still
indented but not indented dramatically
so now I got to fix this stuff but the
first thing I'm gonna do whew way down
here I'm gonna fix the footer so that
these links aren't ugly so I'm gonna
come in here again if I want to edit
links in the footer I have to target the
footer however I'm gonna have to say eh
yeah like that and I'm going to say a
text
and I'm gonna leave it Center and I'm
gonna say color I want it to be white
why but you can put three FS in there
six I don't know why I always put in as
many as it did and then I'm gonna say
padding is 20 pixels file safe reload
link and now you can see that it's white
and it's readable and you can take off
those underlines but I choose to keep
them in there and the next thing that
I'm gonna do before I get into this is
I'm gonna fix the menu this is what will
show up on the screen if the person's
not using a newer version of WordPress
so I'm gonna have to come in here and
show you how to create a menu system
inside of WordPress so I'm gonna scroll
up first thing you're gonna do is to
find this guy here this is navigation
this is what the container that is gonna
surround the whole entire drop-down menu
and we talked about it in the past
tutorial where we define container I'll
show it to you jump into header see
right here navigation container ID
navigation so that's where that went
alright well you have to actually decide
or define some things so I'm gonna say
float left and at least for me this is
always the same sort of information find
my width is 100% that way it'll fill up
all the space here on the screen for it
I'm gonna change my background color
again to that burgundy color and my font
it won't be bold 14 pixels with 0.5 line
height and I'm gonna make this arial
sans-serif and then I'm gonna give it a
border top of one pixel so there's just
gonna be a border on this menu I'm gonna
say I want solid FFF FFF white suppose
you know that whoops don't need another
top I need a bottom five pixels solid
FFF FFF okay got that in there all right
so that's the container that's gonna
define everything that's inside of that
guy well now what I got to do is
actually come in here remember here
where I had dropped down and I said
remember that well of course I'm
reviewing but now I have to actually
define some things so this is the menu
bar in the list so this is where you put
drop-down unless you've decided to
change the name there in the navigation
which I have no idea why you would do it
but if you did it that's how you fix it
style I'm gonna say noon and that's
gonna get rid of my bullets and I'm
gonna say float:left go make it position
left
make my width on a percent got that and
animal we'll give it some padding there
are pixels and then I'm gonna say five
pixels and we won't continue to fine
list items inside of there because as
you can see where as you can't see as
you can see now see everything has
bulleted these are all list items that's
how WordPress puts everything out for
the menu system so I just got target
those list items and set them straight
so I want to say alright I'm gonna do
some styling on the list items now what
do I want to do when I float them left
and then I want to position them
relative and that just means to
basically flow with in the container and
everything else that's there well as
we've done in the past with all links
drop down a you gotta find them
separately I gotta give them padding as
well color ffffff text decoration and
I'm gonna say no and again that gets rid
of the bullets and I'm gonna say I want
to text shadow one pixel one pixel I'm
not gonna give it any blur because it's
smaller and then make that black
okay now that'll work scrolled is it
well now what I got to do is define
what's going to happen if somebody
hovers over the button so that's what
this part is someone's go ul drop down
and you get all this code in a link in
the underbar and then you define hover a
and I'm gonna go in here and go on with
my background color whenever they hover
to change to 666 idle gray which I might
ultimately end up changing and then my
text color is obviously gonna change to
a white and then I'm gonna give it a
shadow just to make sure that it
actually shows up and also so that I can
show off a little bit and make this
black whoops
alright so that handles if you hover
over all length and I'm gonna have to
just to make everything line up straight
list items and any unordered list that
are links you know I really need to
worry that much about this like I said
this gonna be the same almost every
single time you create one of these guys
the only real difference is gonna be if
you've do any jQuery or crazy css3 type
stuff on any of these guys that any of
this is going to change you're gonna
change your colors and things like that
maybe text shadow but in general
everything else is identical so just
copy the code save yourself some time
well now I got a deal with editing the
submenus so I'm gonna jump in here do
that what do I want to do again it's
gonna be the same sort of stuff I want
to get rid of the bullets that gets rid
of that and I'm gonna define my margin
as zero and my padding also is zero and
I'm gonna define the width of the little
drop-down box at 200 pixels something
else you might want to change and then
position some new and then down below
I'm actually gonna come in here in
position these guys individually so what
this is gonna say is whenever the
drop-down box comes down it's an li UL
ever it pops down onto the screen since
I'm positioning absolutely I'm gonna say
I want my top to be 24 pixels down and
that's all I need to do with that and
then I'm gonna say drop down any
unordered lists that would fall
underneath that I want their top to be
zero pixels down and left 100% which
means it's just gonna line up right next
to the secondary drop down like that so
that would be for a drop down of a drop
down okay so this would actually allow
for multiple different dropdowns then
there are any lists after that this is
just something you have to do with
WordPress I'm just gonna eliminate any
floating and then we're almost done with
the menu no it seems like it's taking
forever I need to hide the drop-down so
I'm gonna go in here go ul let's put
this on a separate line so it's easier
to read drop-down li : over and then
handle unordered lists then UL up down
unordered lists list items covering ul
ul and just say display none so I'll get
rid of that on the screen then I have to
define how to define sub menus again if
you're finding yourself getting confused
don't worry most the time you will just
copy and paste this and then put in your
special colors that you want so don't
get upset
up down you wanted to find ul Li and
then hover you will drop down UL li UL
li hover these are all just
technicalities this is just getting rid
of these dropdowns whenever you're no
longer on them and then the very last
thing that I'm going to do is change the
color of the links whenever I'm hovered
so drop down Li a colon hover
and I've decided that I want my
background to be burgundy in my text
color
we've white in my text shadow to be one
pixel one pixel my blur to be zero and
then black when I keep doing that so now
the menu system is perfect and if a file
save that and then what I got to do to
make this guy work is to actually go on
to the website right here where it says
menus and click on that it's under
appearance and then right here which
says main navigation I got to click on
that and click on sample menu and I've
already defined this by moving these
guys around if you understand WordPress
you understand how that works then I hit
file save on that guy and jump back and
you can see now we have a working menu
system right there on the screen and I
probably should change these colors but
either way everything else looks great
except for the fact let's jump back over
into blog this is over running into this
well all of that information is saved in
what's called home CSS so I'm gonna make
some changes to the home CSS file for
there all this to work so I'm gonna
change my padding on main content which
is what surrounds all this to 10 pixels
and then this is all gonna be exactly
the same I'm gonna change my margin
right to 380 two pixels remember I
widened the sidebar so I have to
accommodate that and then on top of that
I want to whenever this is really really
tiny meaning like if there's one little
tiny post this sidebar actually runs
into the bottom so I want to make the
main content area always have a minimum
height of 1000 pixels so that the
sidebar doesn't run into the bottom at
any time and how you define that you
want a minimum height is men height and
then I'm gonna say 1000 pixels and then
you go in and say hi
Auto and put important in here and then
define your height as a thousand pixels
so that's how you make sure that your
height always works out for you now if
I'll save that but no point showing it
to you because I don't have anything
that really doesn't anything on-screen
and then I want to change my intro title
this guy right here see the spacing
isn't perfect that's not lined up really
nice so I want to change my intro title
to have a padding
of 18 pixels instead of 2 remember this
is top right bottom left okay so how
those are defined don't leave everything
else at the same until we come down to
post lists and what I'm gonna do here is
actually get rid of list style because
we don't need to worry about that
because those aren't lists anymore and
instead I'm gonna say margin left is
equal to zero pixels if I'll save that
reload it that makes everything line up
a little bit better then we have post
title which is this thing right here see
it's purple again I don't like that so
how did we change these in the past
gonna take post title and remember it's
a link so we're gonna have to define a
link version of it by putting an A
inside of there
I'm sorry if you hear dogs barking in
the background I have a very irritating
neighbor so we just copied post title
information right there and then pasted
it down here so I'll save that and you
will see this magically change into
white boy it has an underline there
which you can either see or you can't
see so text-decoration:none and it's
gone and there you are that is the whole
entire thing err everything's beautiful
everything works out exactly like I
promised and here is the actual website
in its final layout looking nice exactly
like I told you it would you can see
down here the footer is also fixed up
and everything is pretty much fixed up
and beautiful so now you know how to
make WordPress themes and there's gonna
be more wordpress tutorials but just for
fun I thought at the end of this
tutorial because people send me requests
all the time asking who my favorite
people on YouTube are I provided links
to julian smith who you probably know
because he's a massive superstar on
youtube but yeah if you don't check him
out and i thought i'd also post the most
recent absolutely strange bizarre video
i've seen on youtube it's not offensive
it's just really funny and weird and
then thirdly i thought i'd post a video
to somebody that actually no in the real
world if you want me to continue doing
this just tell me and i will and if I
don't receive any requests to continue
doing it I will not if you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below otherwise until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
