my java algorithms and data structures
tutorial this is going to be the third
and final part on hash tables and if you
haven't watched the previous parts
definitely watch them otherwise you will
definitely be confused because I'm going
to use many things that we've already
learned in the java algorithms tutorial
to do the following things which are
showing you how to hash strings and I'm
then going to show you what separate
chaining is now by hashing strings I
basically mean that we're going to take
a string and we're going to hash it into
a number and basically what we're going
to do here is if we know that the
character code for a is 97 we're going
to subtract 96 from all letters that are
entered meaning the day is going to have
a value of 1 then we're going to cycle
through the rest of the letters in the
string and then we're going to run this
algorithm to hash them so we're going to
take a Chevalier which is actually going
to start out as 0 multiply it times 27
which is going to represent every
character available as well as a space
plus the character code like you said
before a has a character code of 1 in my
situation and then we're going to take
the modulus and array size just like
we've done in all the other hash table
tutorials then we're just going to add
all the results to each other and hash
until we're complete and this is
actually what it's going to look like
we're going to start off with a hash
value of 0 multiply it times 27 plus
character code of 1 this is going to
represent an a modulus or array size is
going to be 11 we're going to get a 1
we're going to then take that 1 down put
it here multiply it times 27
da-da-da-da-da until we have a hash
value for every string that we want to
enter in then the second part I'm going
to cover in this tutorial is what is
called separate chaining now previously
if we wanted to enter a number or a key
in index 0 and there was one already in
it we would just jump to the next index
in try to put it in there and if there
was one in there we would try to jump to
the next index in the next index until
we got down here to index 4 and we had
an opening we stuck it in there was
separate chaining instead what you're
going to do is store a list in each
index of the array so if there's already
something in
index zero for this array it's then
going to put that number in the next
space in the list so all these guys
instead of holding singular values are
going to hold less so let's get into the
code and I'll show you exactly how all
this stuff works
okay so here's all the code and of
course there's a link underneath the
video and you can get it and look at it
it's heavily commented so you will
understand this so what I'm in essence
going to do here is create a mini
dictionary that's going to hold all
common English words that are three
letters in length and begin with the
letter A so I'm going to store an array
inside of here just like before however
this is going to be a word list array
just like I said before and we're going
to also store array size in here right
like that now of course like I showed
you before we're going to go in here and
hash these strings into values then I'm
going to call this string hash function
and it's just going to receive a string
that's going to be three letters long
and begin with a but it'll work with
anything you couldn't make a full scale
dictionary with this guy if you actually
would want to it's actually going to be
pretty simple so we're going to start
off exactly like I just showed you hash
key value is going to begin with zero
and then we're going to start cycling
through this so I is equal to zero we're
going to cycle through all the different
letters in our string that is passed
over so we need to go word to hash and
get the length of this guy and then
increment I and then like I said before
the character code for lowercase a is 97
so we're going to subtract 96 from it so
that our letters start out with the
value of one so character code is going
to be equal to word two hash and I'm
going to go character at I and I'm going
to subtract 96 from it and then I'm
going to get a hash key value temp and
I'm going to store hash key value inside
of that and then I just need to make the
little calculation and make this
uppercase H and to do that I'm just
going to go exactly like I showed you
hash key value is equal to and I'm going
to have hash key value times 27 to
represent all the letters and a space
and then we'll say plus character
code modulus and resize just like we've
done with all of our other hash
algorithms that we've used and then
let's say that I want to pronounce some
information on the screen that's going
to help you understand what's going on
here so I can say something like hash
key value and that's going to be hash
key value temp plus and then I'll
actually put in here exactly what
calculations being done so 27 plus and
I'm going to say character code and
again this is just here so that you can
run this code on your own and watch
everything work because like I've said
before this is what I do in the real
world very often especially whenever
things are going wrong to see how
they're operating and then we can put
our hash key value here at the end and
that's going to print out a nice little
note that's going to show us exactly how
this algorithm is working and then after
that is all done let's say we want to
throw a newline in here and then after
we're all done we want to take whatever
hash key value is and return it and that
is turning what was on that slide into
an actual function right there so pretty
simple but you may ask yourself well how
are we going to store these words and
definitions and all that inside of here
well I'm going to create a second class
and soon to represent all the words and
just so I don't have to use getters and
setters and make this more complicated
I'm going to make this public and it's
just going to have a word definition and
a key which is going to be the same as
that key that was just generated in the
last function we were working with and
here because I'm going to make a list
for these guys I'm going to go word next
which if you watch my list tutorials you
know that that's just the reference to
the next word in the list it's going to
be all stored inside of there and this
guy is going to receive the word that we
want to enter into our word object and a
definition which we want to enter into
there as well
and then we're just going to assign that
the word and the definition and
basically we don't need this to really
do anything else except hold those three
fields but one thing that might be nice
is to be able to print them out on the
screen in a nice easy way it's basically
the way I'm going to set this up is
you're going to be able to enter in a
word and it's just going to shoot out a
definition so it has real world uses I'm
going to say the word
plus a I want to put a little colon in
there or something and definition so
it's going to shoot that on the screen
sorry our that's all we need for our
word and our definition for every single
thing we're going to be using so that
leaves us with our word list because
there's going to be a whole bunch of
lists inside of this array so the very
first thing we're going to do here in
our word list is to create a reference
to the first word in our list and of
course this is going to be the last word
that was added to our linked list or
whatever you want to refer to this as
this is a linked list what I'm creating
here so first word is going to be the
last one that was entered and I'm just
gonna give that a value of null then
what do I need to do well I need to
create a way to enter these words in so
it's going to receive a word that is
going to be created and I'm also going
to pass in a hash key and whenever that
is entered I'm going to go previous is
equal to null because we're going to
change that here in a second I'm also
going to create another word which is
going to be the current which is going
to be equal to the first word and then
I'm going to go a new word key and
assign the value for the key and then
I'm going to go and I'm actually going
to insert these in order in the list so
as long as it's not equal to null and
new word key is greater than my current
key which all I'm doing here is just
entering all the new words in here in
order inside of our word list
I'm going to go previous is equal to
current and then current is going to be
equal to current next and of course that
next comes from this one right like that
okay
so let's come back down here and then
I'm just going to perform some checks if
previous is equal to null well in that
situation first word in our list is
going to be equal to new word because it
is the first ordered in our list else
previous next is equal to new word that
means it's getting stuck in there on our
list somewhere deep in the list and then
I'm going to go new word next and sign
current to it okay so that's how our
lists are working and end the insert
method there and also bounce up here I'm
not returning anything so I'm just gonna
put void there okay what are some other
things I might want the list to do well
just to help me out here I'm going
and also create a method that is going
to display the word list so that we're
going to be able to look at exactly how
everything structured in these lists and
to do that I'm just going to go current
is equal to first word I want to get the
first word that is in our list and then
I want to say a while current is not
equal to null meaning while there's some
more stuff for me to display on the
screen I want to print current out which
is actually going to print out the
information that two-string gets with
the word because current is a word
object and then I want to set current to
whatever the next word item is in the
list and that's all I need to do so
that's the end of displaying those guys
another thing that I might want to do is
provide a way to search for a word also
pretty simple in this situation I'm
going to say that I want passed a hash
key
I'm going to go word turn is equal to
first word again and then I want to
search for the key but stop searching
this is the reason why we put everything
in order inside of insert that's the
reason why we did all this to make sure
that we had all of our different words
in order because that's going to speed
up the process of finding words inside
of Lists so we're going to stop
searching if the hash key is ever less
than what we're searching for and we're
able to do that of course because
everything's in order
so we're going to go while the current
word we're working with does not equal
to null again pretty much the same thing
and current key is less than or equal to
hash key so we're going to keep
searching until we know that there's no
way of finding it in that list and then
we're going to move on to another one
and then we're going to say if current
key is equal to my hash key that I'm
searching for well great that means I
found a match and I need to return it
and then otherwise I need to switch to
the next word in the list by calling
next and there we go and then if none of
that works I didn't get a match and I'm
just going to return it all in that
situation and that is all we're going to
need for the word and the
so that's kind of a review of how lists
work so now let's come back up here and
just to get it out of the way let's
create our constructor and I just called
this hash function three and here you're
gonna define how big you want the array
to be and here I'm gonna say array size
is equal to whatever that size is that
you want your array to be this is
basically arrays inside of arrays new
wordlist you know what a word list is
because we just made it and then I'm
gonna need to fill my array with word
lists and just to keep this really
simple I'm gonna go like this and as
long as I is less than array size and
increment I and then just go the array I
is equal to new word list there we go
now we got everything in there then
after we do that I'd like to be able to
add an array of elements to this
elements to add this is just gonna be an
array which I'm actually gonna copy and
paste because I don't want to type it
all out okay so we're going to put this
guy about right here bunk there you are
this is the most common English two
letter three-letter words that begin
with a so I just paste that and they're
just big array multi-dimensional array
and this guy right here is going to add
that after I create it first thing I
want to do here is provide a way to
insert words and to do that I'm going to
create an insert method it's gonna
receive words just gonna call them new
words and the very first thing I'm going
to do is get the word to hash I'm just
going to go new word and get whatever is
in the word field for that and then I'm
going to have to calculate the hash key
from a word so I'm going to go in hash
key is equal to string hash function
which we just created here a second ago
and we go word to hash patch that in
there so that it gets set up then I need
to add the newer to the array and set
the key for the word so I'm just going
to go the array and go hash key insert
and this is going to receive new word
which is our new word and a hash key
so pretty simple right there and that's
all that's going to need to do now if I
want to come in here
and actually add the array like this guy
get this out of the way because it's
sitting here with an underline that's
irritating me good like this I can go
public void it's just gonna add all
those words and definitions to this guy
and that's a multi-dimensional right so
there we are got that happy and then I
just need to cycle through all the
elements in that array and assign them
pretty simple stuff so while I is less
than elements to add to keep adding them
until there's no elements left so I got
to go to length and I'm going to
increment I and then from that I'm going
to get the word and to get the word I'll
just go elements to add and get I and
index 0 that gets me the word and then
from that I need to also get the
definition and I just need index 1 from
that of course now that have that set up
I can just create the word with the word
name and the definition so I'm gonna go
word new word is equal to new word of
course and it's going to want first the
word pass to it and then the definition
pass to it that's going to create a word
object and then I just need now that I
have that all set up I just need to
insert my new word in my array and then
that just means that I need to provide a
way to search or find words stored
inside of here so I'm going to go public
word I'm just going to name it find and
it's going to receive a string because
we're gonna enter strings in here it's
gonna find them and print out
definitions just like any other
dictionary will do very useful actually
so I need to calculate the hash key for
the word to be able to do that and to do
that I'm just going to copy this because
I'm performing exactly the same thing we
performed whenever we inserted here it's
going to be word to find instead of word
to hash and then I'm going to go word
just call this the word is equal to the
array hash key and do a find for the
word list which we created before and to
do that I need to pass it a hash key and
if we get a positive result I need to go
the word and because to string is
defined it's going to print out the word
the definition so pretty cool now the
only other thing you think of that we
might need here is the ability to
display this information in these arrays
and that's not really for anything other
than to look at to see how these arrays
are structured and then to display the
arrays and just
throw for loop inside of here very
simple and while I is less than whatever
the array size is I'm going to continue
to increment because that means there's
something else in there and then let's
say I want to go the array index print
the array index out so that it helps
explain what's going on and then I can
just go the array I can call display
word list which is gonna print out all
the words in the list and now that I
have all that set up let's just come
down here somewhere anywhere really
public static void main I start
executing some of this stuff so yeah
just some sloppy I'm just gonna go
scanner input is equal to new scanner
and let's say I want to do like system n
to keep reading words in as long as
possible and I need a library so go get
it
there we are and then I'm gonna go hash
function I have to create the guy that's
gonna hold the array and this is just
going to be a word hash table new hash
function 3 and let's say I want it to be
11 and then weird lookup I'm just gonna
set this to a just for the heck of it
and then we can do like a while loop
inside of this and say something like
we're gonna keep looking for accepting
inputs from the user as long as they
don't enter a letter X for example you
can have to speed whatever I'm just
pulling this out of my head and we can
do something like print that out not a
very elaborate interface I know and then
we'll just go word lookup and we can
just go input next line because it's
going to be a string we're getting here
and then we could do something like look
for the word requested and print it and
the definition out the screen so I'm
just gonna go word hash table we go word
lookup for this guy here we are and
we're ready to go so let's execute and
everything executes and you can see here
all of the different words being added
to the word list and then down here at
the very bottom we can try typing in
some words and we can see we got a
little bit of an error here which is no
problem sometimes happens whenever I
mainly code things out of my head so
let's see if we can figure out well ask
works but ape did not let's see about
eight eight also works so maybe it's
just the first thing try armed no
ASP okay so based off of that let's see
if we can figure out exactly what's
going on so let's scroll up here and
let's look at our words we have and
nothing's really jumping out at me so
what I want to do is I want to actually
print out everything it analyzed exactly
what's going on well thankfully I went
and already did that
gonna go word hash-table and here I'm
gonna do display the array and this I
hope is going to tell us everything we
need to know so let's file save it and
execute again and here we are let's type
in a p-- and we got arc let's type in
arc I think I know what happened
not a big deal all I'm gonna do here is
exit out of this hit X and then let's
look at exactly what we did so we typed
in arc and that work but we typed in a
pan that didn't what I'm guessing I did
was I tried searching for a key rather
than a word which is no big deal and if
we look down through here we can see
yeah that's more than likely what I did
there's arc and there is eight so we
know that the error more than likely is
in the fine somewhere so here is fine
forward hash table let's scroll up here
and see what's going on and here we go
we're creating our hash key then we're
doing a search for find here all right
nothing looks wrong there so let's go
down and see what find looks like down
here and now we can see our problem here
I'm actually doing a comparison to see
if the key for the current or the very
first part in the index for each word
list is equal to the hash key which of
course there are numerous words with the
same hash key so what we need to do is
change that so instead of this guy I'm
going to change it up a little bit and
I'm going to go the word and see if it
equals word to find of course that
throws an error because it doesn't know
what word to find is what I'm going to
have to do here is actually password to
find in there so now that's okay but
we're going to have an error up here in
this guy and here
quite simply we're going to take word to
find and pass it along inside of there
now we'll be able to search for not only
the key but also the war
that we're looking for and as far as I
know that should fix everything so let's
file save it next cute and here we are
let's try ape ape works let's try arc
arc works let's try ask-ask works let's
try eight eight works so there you go
covered a ton of things and also got to
fix an error in a nice fun way please
leave any questions or comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
