Eclipse shortcuts video today I'm going
to show you all of the Eclipse shortcuts
that I use all of the time and the
reason why I'm doing this is you guys
have requested that I do this for quite
some time so today I'm going to do it
and I'm going to cover both the
autocomplete shortcuts as well as the
keystroke shortcuts and I'm also going
to cover what exactly you do with both
Mac as well as Windows the Mac shortcut
will be across the top and the window
shortcut will be across the bottom and
in the description below I'm going to
provide a cheat sheet of sorts so that
you can see everything all on one page
if you're at all interested in that now
the very first thing I want to do is go
over the weird Mac symbols now remember
I'm going to cover the windows part of
how to do this will eclipse but I need
to cover this for the Mac people out
there a lot of Mac people do not know
what these weird symbols are and they
show up all of the time firstly this
flower symbol that is exactly the same
as command or sometimes the Apple key
depending upon how old your keyboard is
this carrot here is control this weird
frowny face strange looking thing here
means either option or Alt + this arrow
pointing up means the shift key so
that's just a quick review and I have a
lot to do so let's get into it okay here
I am in Eclipse and what I'm going to do
here first is cover something that I do
all of the time let's say that we have a
couple fields inside of here and they
are going to be name and address and I
want to generate getters and setters
with this guy I do this all the time so
if I'd cover it first just quickly go
into source come down here and go
generate getters and setters and hit
enter then this little window is going
to pop up it right here you can select
which ones you want to use can then come
down here and pick the insertion point
after address works for me can also
define whether you want the setters
first to the getters first and also
define the access modifier for those and
then hit OK and there you can see easy
enough you just generated that and save
yourself a whole bunch of time well
another thing you might want to do is go
into source again then come down here to
generate constructor using fields and
you're going to be able to initialize
all of your different fields in a
constructor very very quickly you can
define where you want to show up I'm
going to put it
to the set address method to find the
access modifier and hit okay and there
you can see right down here we just
generated our constructor so that saves
an immense amount of time and you could
also save that as a keystroke little
shortcut if you'd like to and I'm going
to show you how to do that here in a
second
the other thing I could think you might
want to do up here that is related to
this is go source come down here and
also you can generate a two string
method and this of course is going to
allow us to define exactly what prints
out if somebody tries to print the
object and here's just the fields in a
nice little organized manner you can
define exactly where you want that to
show up after the constructor a whole
bunch of other different things I'm
going to hit OK and then you can see
down here exactly what that two string
method would look like if you would come
in here and create it so that's pretty
useful now let's jump in and look at
some different shortcuts we can use to
show the shortcuts that we have
available to us on the screen now if
you're on a Mac you would just hold down
command or the little flower looking
thing Shift NL and on the right side of
your screen you're going to see a whole
bunch of shortcuts if you're on Windows
hit ctrl shift I'll get exactly the same
thing and there you can see all of those
different key shortcuts right there
available to you on our screen which is
very nice and useful another thing you
can do is if you want to change these
different shortcuts available to you
there's actually two different ways
since we're on a Mac I'm going to go to
eclipse and preferences
if you're on Windows you're going to
click on Windows and preferences and
then inside of this guy you're going to
be able to find what are known as the
autocomplete shortcuts one you guys all
seem to know about is sis out which is
right there which automatically is going
to generate the print line command on
the screen and to get to it you're just
going to go into Java then you're going
to go into editor and then you're going
to go into templates and this is going
to allow you to come in here and
actually create your own little
shortcuts which I'm actually going to do
here in a minute so that is how to
create or generate or make your own
autocomplete shortcuts and the next
thing is all the keystroke shortcuts
we're going to go into preferences just
like before and in this situation we're
going to go general and then come down
here and click on keys and this is going
to be all of the
key shortcuts that are going to be
available to you and also how to make
your own and I'm going to show you here
in a minute exactly how to do that well
one shortcut everyone seems to know
about her a lot anyway is if we want to
create a main function we're just going
to type in main then we're going to hit
control space and then hit enter and
there we go we just created that guy and
if you're on Windows exactly the same
control space enter now if I want to
come in here and create a method that is
public I can just type in public control
space and then enter and there we go we
just created that then I really easily I
can just keep on typing I can type in my
return type hit tab and then give it a
random name right like that so pretty
easy nice and quick if I want that
method to be private I just type in
private control space again we could
also come in here and define if it's a
private static method there's a couple
other different options are available
there for us but I'm just going to hit
enter and again I'm going to type in
void and then a tab and I'm going to
type in random name too so real easy
quick ways to generate methods another
thing if you wanted to actually go in
here and use a name for your method you
can type most anything I'm going to type
in do stuff hit control space and you're
gonna see down here if you can't see
that says do stuff and it's going to
return type of void and then print out
the rest of the method stub again
control space and then hit enter and
there we just created ourselves a
private method called do stuff that's
kind of cool I'm actually going to be
doing a lot of the stuff in the do stuff
method here I'm going to clear these
guys out of here because I don't think
we need that right now and then inside
of main I'm just gonna go do stuff and
call this guy but and I'm also going to
come in here and actually make this
static alright now that we have all of
that defined this out which a lot of
people seem to know about again control
space system.out.print line pretty easy
to generate a print line statement that
way it's also possible to generate for
different types of for loops by just
typing in for control space right like
that and then you can generate a for
loop that iterates over in an array
iterate over an array with a temporary
variable iterate over a collection and
also you could jump to for each which
actually has its own little shortcut
which we're going
look at here in second any other things
really neat is it actually shows you the
code that is going to be generated if
you pick all any of these different
little guys here so that's kind of cool
I'm just gonna stick with this one and
there we go we just created all of those
different pieces and another thing
that's neat is everything is Taba below
again so I can jump like if I type in J
and you saw everything updated there
which is kind of cool I can type in tab
and I can actually give my array a name
just by clicking on tab of course I
don't have the array defined array type
again array element and that is really
cool so that's a neat way to generate
for loops
whole bunch of different for loops
actually and like I said before you can
also generate a for each just like that
control space I mean it's just so easy
like look how easy that is
and everything's generated there for you
as well while loop I'm sure you can
guess is just while control space and
then there's a whole bunch of different
options that are available to you if you
want to use different types of while
loops and there's just the generic one
and again you can see that it
automatically highlights the condition
which means you're going to be able to
jump in there and type that condition
immediately which is very very very
useful want to generate a try-catch
block just I've been try base there we
go
automatically jumped in there and you're
going to be able to automatically start
typing in your exception again speeds up
and makes things very very easy and if
you want to create a comment this is
sort of a silly sort of thing you can
hit command like that it's automatically
going to generate those little comments
and if you're on a Windows PC it's going
to be control forward-slash if you want
things to be properly indented like this
currently is not but this is going to
work for all selectable code so let's
just say let's just mess all this up on
purpose
okay so we went and messed all that up
we're gonna select all of it now what
I'm going to do is hit command I and you
can see it automatically went back into
place and if you're on a Windows PC
control I so anytime I say command I
means control normally if you're on
Windows you could also what's like undo
that you can also come in here and fix
sorting and how that is different is you
know I'm just going
in a random comment and let's come in
here and actually select that and then
hit command-i well you're going to see
that everything sorted out there but
there's this weird area here where
there's all this extra space well if you
want to actually not only indent
everything properly but also format it
in a nice-looking way I'm just going to
do a select all and a command shift F
and that is going to format everything
and if you're on Windows it's ctrl shift
F of course if you want to find or
replace or do either one it's going to
be command F or ctrl F and that's going
to make it very easy for you to come in
here and find and replace anything
inside of your code which is useful and
let's say that I also want to come in
here I'm actually going to get this
system out print line and I'm going to
say I inside of here let's say that I
wanted to surround this print line
statement with a while loop how would I
do that it's actually very easy just
highlight all the code that you want
surrounded with a while loop for example
and then you're going to hold down alt
command + Z and it's going to give you
all of these different options for
things that you can surround this code
with and one of those options is a while
loop and I hit that and we're going to
be able to come in here and say while I
is less than 10 just like that and then
we can come in in and go int I I like
that and then at the end here increment
this guy right like that and give it a
dummy value right like that
actually let's go in here and actually
not do that and let the error come up
you're going to see these little marks
over here and if we put our hand over it
it says cannot be resolved to a variable
if we click on that you're going to see
create local variable I and boom
automatically created that for me but
it's going to give me another error
message here say and now we're going to
initialize the variable and now it's set
for zero and it automatically fixed
itself I mean I'm sure everybody knows
that to use the clips for any period of
time but just thought I would go over it
just because it was right in front of my
face now another thing it's really
useful now that we have all this
generated is if we want to extract the
method into its own method
and we would do this anytime that we
would have code that we're going to be
using over and over and over again now
to extract it to its own method it's
going to be really easy works we're just
going to highlight all the code that we
want to be extracted and then we're
going to go alt command and M for
extract method give it a name I'm just
going to call it print stuff right like
that I'm going to let it be set as
private all fine and hit OK and now it
called for this method and automatically
generated all that code out into an
outside method again extremely extremely
useful and if you want to extract
methods on a Windows PC it's alt shift M
now that we have all of this code lined
up here let's say you wanted to take
this method and move it up inside of the
class for some reason another thing you
do real easy just select all the code
that you want to be moving around hold
down your Alt key and then you can
either press up and you can see how it's
moving around inside of there or you can
press down to move it inside of the
class area and everything is going to
automatically adjust inside of there
which is kind of cool again if you want
to delete the current line of course
command D or ctrl D if you're on Windows
and undo is going to be command Z we can
also display all references all day
selection so let's say that we want to
show all references every line of code
that contains I well that's actually
going to show up down here pull this up
inside of there we're going to hit
command shift you and you can see down
inside of here that is going to show all
of the different lines of code that have
that variable inside of it so that's
really neat and if you're on Windows
that is going to be control shift you
instead of command shift U and let's say
we came in here and let's just change
the value that the one and then let's go
up here to something else that's not
really important if we wanted to go back
we're like whoops I made a mistake when
I made that edit I want to go back to
that edit real easy we're just going to
hit ctrl Q and there we are right back
where we start at and if you're on
Windows you're going to hit alt left
another thing that a lot of people never
think about our breadcrumbs let's come
up here and click on this guy if you do
it's going to now in this situation it
doesn't really matter but in some
situations where a lot of methods you
want to bounce from one method
to the other well it's going to be
really easy we can just come in here and
jump to the print stuff like this or we
can jump to do stuff and it's going to
bounce all over the place and take us
very quickly throughout our entire class
so that's bread crumbs and you get that
with this little C here with the little
triangle next to it
another thing let's say that I am
writing some code and I don't finish it
and I want to make a note to myself that
it's something I need to fix well one
thing you're going to want to do is open
up tasks which is down here and to get
to tasks you can go window show view and
then this is going to show you a whole
bunch of different panels you can put it
on your Eclipse console one of them is
tasks you just select that and what's
cool is if you make a comment inside of
here
and start it off with to do and then
write yourself a message I need to fix
this and save it automatically I need to
fix this shows up down inside of this
little task panel and of course you can
write more detailed message than that
now if you want to create your own a
clip shortcut we talked about this
previously again we're just going to
come up to eclipse and we're going to go
preferences and then we're going to go
general and keys which is exactly where
I am right now now let's say that I want
to come in here and change the way that
run works which is a shortcut that
actually doesn't work by default inside
of a Mac well I'm just going to cycle
through here until I find run and here
we are right where it says inside of
Windows well now that I have that
selected I'm going to be able to change
it which is really neat you can see
right here it has shift and a flower or
command + f11 well if I want to change
this guy I'm gonna go shift command + f6
I like that and there's a whole bunch of
other different things you can put like
a description of what it's doing and
other different things like that and if
there's a conflict of some sort it's
going to show up inside of here meaning
that by making this new shortcut you're
messing up another shortcut and then hit
OK and that is going to allow you to go
in there and actually change or
create your own type of keystroke
shortcut another thing I use all of the
time just thought of it let's say that I
decided I don't like the name of this
variable I write here I don't actually
have this shortcut set up but I use this
all the time I just select the variable
that i's name that I want to change go
to refactor and then go into rename and
select that and the neat thing is I can
actually come in here and change the
name for multiple different variables
all at one time I'm just going to type
in integer one and you can see all those
changed all at once and then the final
thing I'm going to show you how to do
which is really kind of neat is let's
say that I wanted to automatically
generate code now whenever you're
creating Android apps you're going to do
things like create the oncreate method
oncreate options menu and things like
that all of the time wouldn't it be cool
if I could actually come in here and
just type in on create options menu hit
control space and it would automatically
print that well I'm gonna do it so I'm
just going to select and copy that code
that I want to automatically show up and
create for myself an autocomplete
shortcut that's going to be personal for
my own tastes so I'm going to go into
preferences close the general little
area and instead go into Java I'm down
inside of here to editor and templates
and here we are now we can create our
own autocomplete shortcuts and to do so
we're just gonna go new pretty easy and
I'm gonna give it a name I'm just gonna
call it on create menu for now I can
type in a description here just going to
type in generates menu code I'm going to
delete this in a second so automatically
insert means that I won't have to hit
enter after I hit control in space I'm
just gonna leave it that way I'm going
to paste inside of here all of the code
I went generated and in a minute okay
now I can come in here just create a my
own little guy on create and yeah like
that control space on grey menu and
there it went and created all that so
those are all of the shortcuts that I
use all of the time inside of Eclipse I
hope that helps you guys if you have any
questions or comments please leave them
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
