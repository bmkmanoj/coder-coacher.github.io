9 of my C video tutorial today based off
of all the questions I've been receiving
I'm going to focus in on struct linked
lists and I'm going to show you how to
create them how to print them out how to
delete them how to search through them
how to do all sorts of things with them
the first thing I want to do however is
take a closer look did exactly what a
struct linked list is okay so we're
going to be working with products and
each one of these guys right here is
going to represent a struct product that
we're going to be creating and each
struct is going to have a name for our
product and a price for our product and
then it's going to have a next value
which is going to contain a pointer to
the next struct this is going to
continue on and on and on as long as we
have Struck's
in our linked list until we get to the
point that we have nothing in here no
reference to a new product and then of
course we're going to put a null
character in there so basically in this
tutorial we have to figure out a way to
allow input of all these trucks and then
later on in the next tutorial I'm going
to cover how to search through these
linked lists pullouts trucks and also
delete them and do all sorts of other
things so I have a lot to do so let's
get into it okay have my same basic
setup text editor over here and terminal
over here and the very first thing that
I'm going to do is create my struct and
here we go and I've been told this is
something that's asked in interviewing
questions all the time like I've been
overwhelmed with the number of questions
about this concept here okay so we have
a float price and we're also going to
have product name and I'm going to say
it's 30 characters max and then of
course we're going to have struct
product and this is going to be a
reference to the next struct in the
linked list all right so I could do this
in a whole bunch of different ways but
what I've decided to do is to traverse
my struct length list what I'm going to
do is I'm going to store two of these
globally just to keep everything very
very simple and this is going to be the
first node and I'm actually going to
give it a value of null and that's going
to be the first node or the first struct
product in my linked list and then
create another one and this is going to
be the last node or product and I'm also
gonna give it a value of null okay so
the very first thing we want to do I'm
going to have to create a whole bunch of
these different guys but the very first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a way to input data into a struct
and let's just go through this step by
step and all the code of course is
available in a link in the description
now I got to think about here what am I
gonna do in regards to entering
information well I'm going to bounce
around here a little bit as we think our
way through this process I'm gonna have
to create a new struct of course so
let's just go P new struct just give it
that name it doesn't matter what its
name is and again I've said multiple
times this isn't necessarily needed in C
but it is needed in C++ so what the heck
now what I need to do is I need to set
some space aside inside of memory and I
just pass inside of this size of and I
have no way of knowing how many structs
there's gonna be or anything so I'm just
going to create a new struct product in
memory every single time I create a new
one and there that is if you want to see
the whole entire thing there on the
screen at one time there you go
actually let's just keep that open well
then let's say that I want to print a
message out on the screen that says
something like enter product name and
then after that I want to go scan of and
get myself a string just keeping
everything as simple as possible here
and I'm gonna have to put an ampersand
here and this is needed here just
because scanf requires it just like
always is nothing to worry about it's
nothing particularly specific about this
struct then what I need to do is
actually reference product name and
that's going to store that inside of
there I'm going to do pretty much
exactly the same thing for the price
let's just divide that up a little bit
inner product and I'm going to say price
here and then here this is going to be
all the same even though this is a float
and it isn't a character array I can
just type in price okay so that's where
that's coming from
product name and price there you go
doesn't matter if it's a float doesn't
matter if it's a string this is the way
it's always going to be that stuff's
causing a little bit of confusion well
then what I need to do
is come in here and think about what I'm
doing now if the first and last struct
are going to be equal to each other we
know in this situation that this is
going to be the second struct that we
are going to be adding to our list so
something to think about and I'm just
referencing the fact that we have stored
here null in the first one and in the
last one we also have null so if those
are both equal we know either that we
are going to be putting our very first
value here on our screen or we are going
to be putting the second one on the
screen now we can think about multiple
different ways to solve this problem one
way that makes a lot of sense to me
actually is to check up here right at
the very beginning if P first node is
equal to null well that tells me if
that's true that tells me there are no
other structs in this linked list yet
and I am going to be creating a brand
new list so if I'm creating a brand new
list well I'm not really inputting data
now am I and it probably makes sense to
instead have all of that worked out in a
totally separate function and just keep
this function as clean as possible
constantly playing sort of like a
juggling act here where I'm trying to
keep things simple and at the same time
trying to write good code and sometimes
that's not always possible so what I'm
going to do is if this is the very first
item that's going to go on my linked
list I'm actually going to create the
linked list else what I'm going to do is
all the things that I just did however
I'm going to come down here and I'm
going to say well if first node is equal
to P last node well then I know I am
working with the second item in the list
because we already passed this
conditional up here so that's what's
going on there so we're going to do
something a little bit different I'm
going to come in here and go first node
next and make it equal to P new struct
that I'm creating right now so let's
take a look at this let's just assume in
this situation that this is the first
node in the list ignore tomato for now
and I'm adding
lemon to our length list what I'm going
to do is I'm going to take this guy
right here whatever this points to I'm
going to save it in necks down here this
is going to remain null however because
it's going to be the last item so that's
what's going on there okay so now that
we have that fixed that's exactly what
we're doing right here with this piece
of code I got to do a little bit more
now since this is the second struct we
know that the last struct is equal to
this new one because there are no other
ones if you have first and last well the
second one has to be last if there isn't
a third hopefully that makes sense so
we're going to go last node is equal to
P new struct and there we go now we know
that's true
another thing we know about our new
struct here is since it is equal to the
last node well we also know that its
next value is going to be equal to null
because it's the last one there's no
more to go else we get in this situation
well then we know that we're going to be
adding not the first not the second node
but the third and every other node that
comes thereafter so at the bare minimum
we know that this is at least the third
struct in our list so we're not going to
have to worry about the first node at
all instead what we're going to do is
change the last node value for next from
null to whatever our new struct is that
we're going to be adding so to do that
we just go P last node which is
currently set to null and instead we're
going to set it to point to our new
struct that we just created then what
we're going to do so I don't have to
keep printing this out is go P new
struct next since it's the last item in
the list well we know that it's equal to
null and there we go and then finally P
last node is going to be equal to make
sure we spell that right P new struct
and we do that so that this value up
here these guys this guy specifically is
set properly okay so that's what we were
doing with that and that is all we're
going to need to do to add values or add
structs to our linked list but that
brings us to this problem create new
list we have to actually create a new
one I'm actually going to do it up here
I'm gonna save would create new list and
then I need to set aside enough memory
I'm actually
copy this right here set aside enough
memory so that we will be able to fit
our struct in here I'm going to leave
this named pea new struck just like
before all this is going to say the same
all this is going to stay the same the
whole entire thing is going to stay the
same okay so now that we have that set
up what we're going to have to do now
with our new struct is specifically go
into is specifically assign the value of
null for next because we know this is
the first item in the list so obviously
that's the way that's set and then I
know I could optimize this by moving all
this stuff into a different function but
for now just to keep it simple I'm just
going to copy this code it's not going
to hurt anything it's not optimized but
I am more worried about you
understanding what's going on here and
not so much worried about whether it's
often masked or not just want to point
out this is exactly the same whether
it's the first node in the list or the
second node in the list of the tenth
node in the list we're always going to
enter the data in exactly the same way
then what we have to do is have all of
our saved nodes so our first node make
sure that it is set to the same location
as my last node which of course is the
same as my new struct that I just
created and that is all I'm going to
have to do with the create new list
that's it it's just basically just to
set up the very first struct and make it
work right well now that I know I can
input data create new lists and do all
that different stuff the only other
thing left to do is to output the data
at least for now in the next part of the
tutorial
I'm going to show you how to search
through a linked list and also how to
delete items from a linked list so just
didn't want to cover too many things
here I'm going to call this output data
okay so I'm going to have to create a
new struct product and this is going to
be a temporary location for all the
Struck's in the linked list and they're
going to be assigned each value by
jumping through the different next
pointers to the next struct over and
over and over again until we get null
just like before so I'm going to call
this products and since I want to print
out the whole entire list I need to get
the value of first node first and there
it is and then we can just do something
like
products entered scroll this up a little
bit and what I need to do is go while P
products is not equal to null searching
for that null value that null value is
going to tell me I'm at the end of
printing out information on the screen
and inside of this while loop I'm going
to go printf and it's a string I'm going
to say whatever the product is 0.2 F
plus new lines in there and then to
reference those I'm just going to go P
products like this and get the product
name and then I'm also going to do the
same thing pre products and get the
product price so that's how we reference
these trucks then after I'm done with
that all I need to do is change the
location for P products and make it
equal to whatever P products next is the
next item in the linked list and if it
comes up here and P products is equal to
null we're all done so let's file save
that and see if I did this the right way
okay so we have input data that's our
method that is going to that we created
up here going to be called and it's
going to ask us for information and if
no nodes exist or no products exist in a
list it's going to create a new list
okay come back down again let's have it
in put a couple of these three of them
and then after it does that
I'll put data will print all of them out
and I made the same little silly error
that I made last time let's go up here
and correct it and hold the same exact
error I made in the last tutorial up
here where I am allowing the price to be
entered let's change this to F sorry
about that and then let's also change
this guide F that's the sort of stuff
that happens when I program out of my
head all right and everything else
should be fine so let's file save file
enter product name
let's go tomato let's say two dollars
let's say shrimp and let's say $11 and
then let's just say fish it doesn't
matter and let's say $10 all that
information was entered in and then
tomato shrimp and fish were printed out
so that's how to enter information into
a linked list and how to pull it out now
since you guys asked me for homework all
time for homework I'm going to try to
put the next part of this tutorial up
almost immediately definitely on put it
up tomorrow what I want you to do is
figure out how to search for products
inside of a linked list and also how to
remove products from a linked list and
then what the heck also figure out how
to free the memory like we talked about
in the last part of the tutorial in the
linked list please leave your questions
or comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
