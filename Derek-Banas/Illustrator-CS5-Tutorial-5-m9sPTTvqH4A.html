5 of my adobe illustrator tutorial
series definitely my most popular series
period today what I'm going to do is
answer a whole bunch of your questions
mainly through one big giant tutorial in
which I'm going to show you how to make
a snowflake inside of Illustrator it
actually will allow me to use a lot of
tools that you guys seem to be
interested in well the first thing that
I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna draw
a basic rectangle shape right here on
the screen and then with it selected
still I'm gonna come over here to object
I'm gonna come down to path and I'm
gonna come down here to add anchor
points what that's gonna do is add an
anchor points in a bunch of different
locations pretty much in the middle of
all of your current anchor points that
you have on your screen oh not allow
this someone down here to be flat and
I'm gonna grab this guy just drag him up
an arbitrary level then I can come in
here and individually delete any of
these anchor points just by coming over
to the pen tool and getting the delete
Anchor Point tool clicking on that
clicking on that and clicking on that
but first what I'm gonna do is I'm
actually gonna get a copy of this guy
and as I drag again I'm gonna hold down
the Alt key so I can make a copy of it
and then just to make everything here
real quick also you can delete anchor
points of course by just selecting them
with this direct selection tool that's
over here which shortcut for it is a and
then a shortcut for this main selection
tool which selects all your paths at
once is V and I'm gonna be using that
throughout the rest of the tutorials
speed everything up here a little bit
pen tool also the shortcut for that is P
and I'm gonna come in here and I'm going
to join these paths right like that so
now this is one complete path I'm also
gonna come in here grab this path direct
selection tool this is gonna be the
basis of what I'm gonna use to create a
snowflake type design this is kind of a
quick and dirty snowflake but what its
gonna do is it's gonna teach a whole
bunch of different things so then I'm
gonna come in here this direct selection
tool and I shrink this one down right
like that and then I'm gonna take this
guy copy/paste shrink this guy down and
at the same time I'm gonna click on R
and then I'm going to actually twist
this guy a 45 degree angle come in here
and right like that
yeah I'm gonna scale this out take it
move it down a little bit
and just to make it simple I'm gonna
bring this guy in here flatten this out
a little bit right like that and then
again gonna hold it hold down my Alt key
and drag this up here I'm gonna hit my e
on my keyboard and shrink this down with
the free transform tool okay so now what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this
gigantic snowflake type little guy here
I'm gonna shrank him way way way down
and I'm gonna turn him at a 45 degree
angle so again hit easy for free
transform and I'm gonna drag this guy up
here right like that now what I'd like
to do here and of course I can do it I'm
not just gonna like to do it I'd like
this to follow down the path of this
snowflake we're creating right here this
black snowflake and at the same time
shrink as it's going along how exactly
would I do that well it's a tool that a
lot of people do not use and it's
available up here in effect and if you
scroll down to distort and transform and
come to the transform tool right there
but before we do that I'm gonna make a
copy of this and paste it okay so we're
gonna select it hit a fact transform and
then we're gonna click on transform
right here and what this guy allows you
to do is exactly what I want it to do if
I want to create multiple different
versions and then shrink them as they
grow well let's first come in here to
move and just click inside here and also
click preview first off and then just
increase it and it's going to move it
down the snowflake for you to a certain
point and then I'm gonna click on
vertical I'm gonna press down on the
arrow key so that it also will come up
and then you can sort of tweak these
little guys back and forth until you get
them to a good distance for you again
this is art alright super so we got this
moving away and there's a space in
between there it's gonna help me with my
creation of my snowflake well I also
want to scale it so let's say that we
want to take it down to 80% horizontally
and 80% vertically okay you can see that
that's going on but this is whenever it
gets really fun I'm gonna come in here
to copy and we can increase these guys
as they go down the length of our
snowflake and as we're doing this we
might decide you know that we want this
guy to go down a little bit notice to go
up a little bit and then we could also
make sure that it connects to the
baseline and this other snowflake
instead of
drifting off into nowhere by clicking
here when a zoomin so you can see it on
this little matrix II sort of thing and
that way it'll stay locked in place real
nice-like and then we can continue
making additional copies of the
snowflake as we like maybe we decide we
own I want to take this down to ninety
percent okay and then you just hit OK
and you can see there that it was went
in there and it drew in my snowflake
exactly like I wanted it to now let's go
and take this guy copy paste and put him
across the bottom then we come into that
fact distort and transform right like
that we can try out 90 again it's time
we went on line to the top with the
little matrix east sort of thing right
there and then we'll we'll come in here
and make some additional copies but all
I'm doing is hitting up and down on my
arrow keys to change these guys right on
the fly and I'm gonna come up here and
make additional coffee just by hitting
up on the arrow keys ok now we're
starting to get why super so let's say
we want to transpose this up to here
well we just click on it hold down alt
and drag little guy up here and put him
in place and we can do the same thing
hold on to here hold down alt and move
it up and if we want to change this
affect this is another tool that a lot
of people do not use for some reason
click on window and appearance you can
actually see over here on the side your
transformation that you made and make
individual changes and we're gonna be
using this and playing around with this
later on in the tutorial as well but
let's say I want to change that
transform to decrease the number of
copies easy enough just come in here
preview and take away any additional
ones that you don't want hit OK click on
this guy click on transform let's do the
same thing again
first hit preview and take away all
those extra little nasties that we don't
want inside of that ok so that's a first
part of our snowflake type design of
course you can make this a lot more
complicated I'm making this pretty
simple okay so well now let's say we
want to create the other side of the
snowflake how do we do that we're gonna
select everything we hit object we're
gonna hit group then we're gonna come
into our effect aren't your ants form
again click on this guy and then hit
preview we're gonna click on reflect X
and we're gonna click on this little
matrix e thing right there and these two
guys are gonna line themselves up real
nicely and if we come in here and click
one copy there we create
our first storm of our snowflake well
now we got to create a whole bunch more
of these guys come in here and we're
gonna come in and of course and go
effect distort and transform click on
the transform and it's gonna give you a
warning saying do you really want to do
this just say yes apply a new effect and
then what we're gonna do is click on
preview of course we're gonna change the
angle on this 30 I'm gonna come down
there put the guy right there and we can
come in and make additional little
blocks just by clicking up on our arrow
key and you can see just like that we
made a pretty interesting completely
crazy looking stuff like design okay so
you say but snowflakes are not black not
a problem
so let's come in here and we'll select
this guy and we're gonna change it let's
have it be a little over a light bluish
color
all right that's kind of pretty looking
and we'll scroll or throw this little
snowflake out over the way now we can
also delete this one and delete this one
now that we have our snowflake all
nicely drawn and then we'll come in here
and say I want to make this like a
bluish type shape right like this I'm
gonna click on my gradient tool and I
have over here and a lot of you guys
seem to have some trouble with gradients
I'm gonna get more into them later on
let's say we want to take this guy and
rotate him and also grab this end point
drag this out here and just do some
random randomness now we'll just do that
right like this this is a radial blur by
the way and then we can come in grab mr.
snowflake drag him over here object to
arrange bring to front right like that
click on e and then we could scroll
mister snowflake down so let's say I
want to go and I want to actually create
a different outline first let's make
this guy white just to simplify the
whole thing okay so we want to create a
stroke outline for this well I can come
in here to this part and let's say I
want to make it a cyan and a little bit
darker and you can see here on the
screen it's getting all mangled but
don't worry about that and I'm making
this a blue or blueish color let's take
the cyan the whole way to the top it's
kind of an interesting looking pattern
that we created here but what I want to
do is actually make this stroke go on
the outside one thing I can do to keep
this stroke from looking all mangled up
is to actually copy it and then I'm
actually gonna paste that in back and
then I'm gonna come back out here grab
this guy and then
that stroke away and I can also come in
here let's say I select that and I
select this guy right here
and I can come in here and enlarge the
stroke here on the screen right like
that then we could increase the stroke
on the version of the snowflake that
lies underneath and another thing that
might look interesting here on the
screen is if we come into effect again
and go to style eyes and drop shadow and
of course you might want to preview this
and you can see that we threw a nice
little drop shadow behind our snowflake
which makes it look even nicer yet of
course you have to wait for that edit to
go through so there's some neat little
tricks you can do inside of Adobe
Illustrator to make up pretty pretty
looking snowflakes shape okay so I
showed you how to make something kind of
pretty and cute so now to offset that
overall cuteness I'm going to show you
how to make something kind of grungy and
nasty and I'll make all of these files
available on the website if you want to
download this cute little snowflake
let's grab this little snowflake and get
rid of it and now I'm gonna show you how
to do something really really cool with
text that you guys probably don't know
about okay so let's come in here and
let's type a word like grunge and I'm
using myriad Pro which isn't a very
grungy sort of font but it's gonna get
grungy really really fast all right so
let's choose a color that's more drawn G
so I'm thinkin like a greenish nasty
brownish alright I kind of like that
color so we got our green grunge now how
are we gonna grunge it up well you're
gonna see over here in your brushes
panel you're gonna see some brushes here
you've probably never seen before
and by the way you can access all these
brushes by clicking right here and then
go into open brush library and there is
actually something called grunge and you
can see it and I transported some of
those guys over here already
and as well there's some other
interesting looking things and if you
want to take any of these and save them
for another time maybe just drag them
over here and drop them into your brush
library that you have right here and
close that up now for the neat part okay
so I got my text selected and let's say
I want to add a stroke to it that is
going to be editable that is going to
allow me to add these brush strokes to
the outside of it to make this look
really cool how do I do that again come
over to
appearance tool I'm gonna zoom in here
and come down here to this button and
that will create a new stroke for you
and let's choose a grungy type of color
or this new guy pink it's not grungy you
like this orange II sort of color right
here sort of just going by here now
since I have this stroke created here I
can come in and click on this brush and
automatically it's going to throw this
new brushstroke over top of it it's
going to outline it with this grungy
sort of thing and you can also use this
to create pretty fangs of course and
let's say that you want to continue to
make this look grungy all you do is come
in and create another stroke and then
this time let's say we make this a
greenish type of color for our new
stroke and there you go and then you
could become more extreme with it maybe
click on this guy right here which is
maybe a little bit too much for you if
it is no problem just come in here to
the opacity area over here and
appearance and click on that and let's
say we want to drag our opacity down to
save 45% now you can get your grungy
type text right here and what is really
really cool about this is this is
editable text so let's say I wanted to
type in psycho instead I can't and I did
not have to outline this text it is
totally editable text so there is
another really cool thing you can do
inside of illustrator and the final
thing I'm just going to show you this
also is a neat trick you can do with the
appearance tool let's say you want to
create automatically editable fills
behind text that automatically resize
themselves based off the text that you
input ok no problem so we're gonna click
on here that's like this a light and
let's make this instead of black like a
light bluish color well you can also add
fills inside of the appearance tool and
we're gonna do that right like that I
just added a fill inside of there and
then you can come in here the effect
area and then if you click on convert to
shape and choose rounded rectangle and
click OK on it right like that you have
text that is surrounded by a rounded
rectangle and this text is going to also
be completely editable
and it will automatically just to make
sure you can see it I'm gonna change
this to white it'll automatically resize
as you type so there are a bunch of neat
little things you can do with Adobe
Illustrator if you have any questions or
comments leave them below till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
