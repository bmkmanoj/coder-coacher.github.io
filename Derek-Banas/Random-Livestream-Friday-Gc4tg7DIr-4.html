for joining me let me see here you got
to get some technical things out of the
way all right this is the next-to-last
level of the Talos principle which is
like the most in my opinion most
complicated puzzle game there is so
next-to-last so will I potentially fail
and not be able to complete this yes it
is very possible so let me see here I
can hear myself well thank you for all
the nice compliments I am doing awesome
like always and I could see your
messages
sorry about the this right OOP there I
can't get rid of that that's why there
was a delay in the stream because I was
trying to fix my green screen but I
didn't do it so I did the best I could
do and now I'm playing with my webcam
very professionally okay so you guys
asked me to do this and so I will do it
like I said the probability of failing
is very good because this is the Mixel
to the last level of the artists puzzle
game that I have ever played anyway and
I have played the witness and what is
this over here we're trying to build the
future out of old video game code and
half-finished Research Projects we
should have had years maybe
if I stop and think about how crazy this
is I will have a nervous breakdown
this is the talus principal hello
everybody okay so what I did to prepare
so I didn't completely fail all I did
this is all of it I know about these
levels is what you see right here I went
and drew little maps because they helped
me a little bit in figuring out these
puzzles because you know I want to try
and beat this whole thing in 40 minutes
or less and without that there is no
chance and be here all night so though I
didn't develop this game so let's go and
take a look here what do we got okay so
basically the problem with this puzzle
is you cannot cross the stream so the
blue and the red cannot cross each other
so this guy back here if you don't know
anything about the Talos principle is
this allows me to record my actions and
then play them back and then I sort of
like play within the world as I play it
you'll see how it works so from looking
at this what I think I have to do is
there's this blue stream here and
there's a blue stream there so I'm going
to have to record a version using these
prism things here to go around from
there and then over to here and then
connect to that and so that it'll go to
the red that is what I want to try to do
yes don't cross the streams okay so and
feel free to ask me questions about
anything while I'm doing this because I
very well will foul up all sorts of
things as I'm doing this I'm watching
your coments
I don't know what I'm starting three to
unity games my goal is to
teach how to make enough 2d games so
that anybody who watches my video games
tutorials will be able to make any game
they can imagine because I want to cover
every 2d game mechanic within reason so
I expect to be making a lot more games
there will not be a video uploaded
tomorrow I've had an extremely busy week
I couldn't make another one the next
game I will make will be pac-man so
latex is on the on the docket but I
don't know when it all be coming if you
want to get good at programming just
write lots of programs that's how it
works
all right so what am I gonna do here I
have to figure out how to get this to
work alright so I'm gonna try
this is fine it's just the real work is
gonna be done after this I'm not gonna
need the blue right now okay
so now what I want to do is I want to
what capture device am i using I'm using
I'm using a mage well capture HDMI which
Elgato on I'm using a Mac to do all this
stuff and algata sucks on Mac can it
work
maybe I don't know but there's too many
technical difficulties without God oh so
I just gave up on them so what do I want
to do I'm going to record and then I
want to come back here and take p2 which
is that guy right there prism to move it
back here and then I'm going to connect
from this to this to that prism back
there which is going to be the recorded
version of the prism and then that will
open it and then I'll connect another
prism to this guy to the blue and that
should work so let's try that somebody
go in here for Court
go in here grab this one going to it
shouldn't matter actually I don't want
to connect to the other one I just want
to connect this prism to that that's it
and that's going to be the recorded
version of that prism and am I going -
there's no way from you and do this
hmm okay so now we're on it huh is
get this one and connect it to that and
then the blue here and then the idea is
going to be to circle around this blue
line that's right here so now I'm gonna
give myself a little bit of it wait here
so that I know I can do this
hmm am I drunk no I'm not drunk why does
somebody why would anybody think I'm
drunk no I'm not drinking I know that's
something that other people do actually
I recently for the first I know I'm
probably like the only person started
watching the Joe Rogan podcast yeah that
was he is a ridiculously interesting
style doesn't make hey I won't ever do
that and if you don't know what I'm
talking about go watch it - Rogan Fogg
podcast
he's a comedian all right so this guy's
gonna take this and then I'm gonna take
this woops was i stupid
I should have had my tea I might need to
restart this
yeah yeah yeah whatever
restart checkpoint I told you this would
not be easy okay so my original idea I
believe is is fine though so let's go
all right so what I say I said I wanted
to do well let's go get this I believe
my idea is sound and that's fine that's
fine all right so we're gonna hit record
whoops record come over here and we're
going to grab this one and it is going
to I have to give space so that I'll be
able to find it from right here and I'm
gonna put it right here okay all right
and then I'm going to grab
yeah this one and I'm gonna connect the
blue to the blue which is there and put
that there and then I'm gonna wait for a
second
yeah a lot of people subscribed to my
channel and because they see if in one
video they like you know like oh I
should subscribe that and watch these
videos and then they never watch any
videos again so yeah so you're in good
company there's lots of people that do
that that's why I have so many
subscribers but I only get like 5,000
views of video people like the idea of
my channel they don't necessarily like
my channel though
alright so let's grab this guy
and I went to these in committee grab
that oh he is actually me and then I'm
gonna grab this and put that there and
put this
I'm gonna put it down ah
is it right in the position where I
can't get it am I gonna have to restart
this again I am so stupid sometimes I'm
very dumb hey whatever let's do it again
okay
I believe my premise is sound and I will
try again this one move it far enough
back so that I'll be able to actually
see that put this here alright
grab this and blue and blue I'm glad you
like my channel I'd like the idea of
doing all kinds of different videos it's
fun for me Pacman's next and then
probably Zelda you guys can tell me
other games you want to say and this
live stream will be delisted as soon as
it's over so it won't exist after I did
that's I do that just because people
complain about me doing live streams for
some reason
football manager I'll look at it
now let's see if I can be smart just
time and solve this okay I think I'll
look at that smart enough and put it in
the right place good
all right did it and then this is
hopefully gonna go to blue ah
grab that ah do this and that should
work right I think so I think so I think
so yeah okay I solved one all right so
one down and three to go
sorry it took me so long but like I said
I don't prepare for this the size from
drawing a little tiny map and then you
know that's basically just so I don't
get lost
what's my favorite programming languages
I guess I'd have to say XI sharp PHP
makes me the most money though so now
what I want to do here what's this one
Prison Break yeah that's the biggest one
I'm gonna wait and do that last I'm
gonna try and solve these all in one
night but I cannot guarantee I'll be
able to do it
okay carrier pigeons I think this one
this one looks like it's gonna be a
little bit easier basically what's going
on here is this is where I want to go
and there's a fan there blowing so what
I have to do is I have to stop this
laser from powering the fan run in there
get rid of the fan and that is where my
symbol is I want to use
Exodus nice to see you again
yes I use boring PHP all the time and
laravel alright so what I'm gonna need
to do is put this on top of these robots
heads and move around and then like make
a staircase to go up there alright
whoops that's what I'm thinkin anyway
alright we'll see if that works okay got
that there and then what I need to do is
move these boxes over to that other
pedestal or whatever so come up here how
many you guys out there are watching
Ozark right now on Netflix Netflix is
hitting home runs like left and right
anymore for a while there I was not the
biggest I've never really got into the
house of cards or oranges new black or a
lot of their other things but then they
put out like 13 reasons why well
stranger things for thirteen reasons why
which you should never watch if you're
at all depressed and uh what else did
they put out Ozark I think is
ridiculously awesome
they've been just doing awesome yeah
it's called Ozark it is about I don't
want to ruin it but I think I can tell
you basically a little bit without
ruining at all basically it's about a
guy that is a money launderer
whoops and I can just jump down right
he's a money launderer and he has to
travel to a part of the United States
called the Ozarks to try to launder
money
it doesn't that didn't ruin anything
you're gonna find out in the first 10
minutes of the show and it is so good it
was just like a amazing amazing maze
amazing thing all right so definitely
check it out if you have Netflix it's
like one of those things that's hidden
Netflix just like hides things all the
time
Breaking Bad I've watched Breaking Bad
forever ago I've watched Breaking Bad
when was on TV Breaking Bad I think is
the best show there has ever been on
television
all right so I need to somehow see how
this dude like flies out here there he
goes OOP I need to like catch him with
this other box and then sort of like
jump but I have to figure out where he
doesn't where he jumps to just take a
second here to look at
and so something like this let's see the
worst thing students do is zap you
alright so I'm gonna be able to jump up
here and then jump up here and then can
I reach that no I can't
oh I grab this faint I grab this box now
maybe I can reach it can I reach it okay
so I gotta put this back on here cuz
this activates the fan I think my
premise is is good I just didn't quite
do it get him out there Bart
yeah I love doing live streams I'd do
them for a while
obviously when live streams like four
times a week but I had like 60 people
that loved them and like a lot of other
people just complained so I stopped
doing them but I'm gonna try to do one
live stream a week
but who knows awesome
somebody just said season two whoops of
Ozark was announced I will definitely be
watching it this show keeps up as
awesome as it is right now I'm watching
that it's not gonna work I think it was
awesome - down - down in 20 minutes I
will cover machine learning at some
point but you have to understand I'm
teaching game design right now which
it's like one of the most complicated
things you could possibly teach and
pretty much the only thing that is more
complicated than that is machine
learning are you guys seriously what my
brain to melt cuz that's how you get my
brain to melt okay now basically what's
going on with this if you're joining
late well all that I did to prepare for
this this is the next last level of The
Talisman sources like the hardest wasn't
game ever all I did to prepare for this
was I made a little map by coming in
here and looking at as much as I could
say now let's see where's the map at for
you know what I came to remember this
one this is the map for that just to
save a little bit of time because this
game is so ridiculously complicated so
that's what I got going for me alright
so what I think I need to do
hmm yes the math behind
machine learning is ridiculously
complicated basically I need to get this
blue from there to here all right and
there's a window there so I think that
might have something to do with it
there's a box over here and a fan and I
think hmm I need to get that box and use
it on this I'm guessing there's a start
but I'm not really worried about Stars
bringing you don't want to help you up
my brain my brain is quite crazy all
right so let's see what's going on here
so the very first thing I need to do is
I need to get this other prism inside of
here so what I'm gonna try to do is wrap
around this world and see if I can get
the other one
hey Gert I'm always good
lucky guy it's so cool because I
especially when I did live streams all
the time I would see the same people
like all the time I was like so cool
it was like same 50 people all right and
there's another person here somewhere
oops sorry about that yeah okay so now I
have to figure out how to get
is it possible because we know that
standing on that makes that go down so
it is it possible to connect this to
this and then get stand on this aha and
that blows the Box down all right cool
so let's get the box and put the Box on
here and then I think I can get rid of
some of these guys I'm doing awesome
this is the third of four of the the
next the last part of the Taos triple
seriously you like the Taos principles
the livestreams better than anything huh
let's go my favorite one was the
resident evil
I loved resident evil all right so that
means I should be able to get this other
prism which I can so there's the other
prism oops that's gonna kill that so
okay that's shut down
can I too late maybe a connection
between this this and this is that what
I want to do okay so that keeps out over
that should mean that I should be able
to get the other prisms now right
so can I get the B one now get this and
wrap it around the same way is this
required I think I need you anymore so
can I now go B and that's not going to
connect to anything no I don't want to
yeah II love him
you know what how about going from here
I might once instead go from here to the
blue put this here and then connect
through the window I don't believe I
need this anymore do I
I don't think so let's get it
sorry I don't have any Samarin tutorials
you just haven't gotten to it I wish I
could promise for forever that I was
gonna make games so I'm just trying to
fulfill that I mean I'm literally four
years I've been promising I was gonna
make games there's maybe somebody out
there this is watching it's watching my
videos since I first said yes I will
cover games and I just kept not doing it
and so I went to fulfill that promise
all right I think this order
or maybe not I think I got the red one
here that now let's hope all right
all right three out of four the last
one's gonna be so hard I'm doing alright
okay
no I'm not lying little nightmares don't
like it
hello GTA Fighter there's a lot of
people in that have jobs and programming
that are 100% self-taught it's not
uncommon in this profession alright so
this one is ridiculously complicated of
course it's easier to get a job if you
have a college degree but but is it
possible yes what's the flanker alright
sorry I gotta focus this is one of those
things that is ridiculous alright
solidity yeah seen it I haven't really
used it I can learn any language pretty
quickly though all right I'll make it
tutorial on anything if I get enough
requests for it
so yes solidity yeah I've seen that let
me look for a second trying to see if I
did something with it or not the police
doesn't mess up my whole stream
it's just the language that I played
with no no I never did anything with
that sorry
that doesn't mean I can't I'm just means
that I haven't done anything with it yet
yes crystal I have use all right so I
gotta focus here because this is a
ridiculously complex puzzle there are so
many rooms like look there's all this
there's a window over here there's rooms
over there there's a prism inside of
there there's a box here there's this
there's all these see another gate
another gate another gate
another gate another prism I know
therefore ISM oh look at that I probably
want that grab that right now and
another gate and then if you look
through there's another gate here and
then another gate after that so it is
highly likely that I will not be able to
suffice puzzle tonight this is the last
puzzle in the next-to-last level so all
right let me try to focus here
well the whole idea here is I'm gonna
try to just get things out of gates so
I'm going to go here I'm going to go
here
yes I I agree with you Gert hundred
percent I don't I don't make videos for
views I think it's pretty obvious that I
took my videos but at the same time you
know if somebody asked me to do a
tutorial that I think is like I'm sure a
lot of you guys know there's a lot of
programming language out there that are
just joke languages they're not real
languages like white space for example
it's a programming language it's nothing
but white space okay it's a joke
language it's not a real language it's
made to be funny
I get asked to make white space
tutorials all the time and I'm if I ever
do make one and I'll be an April Fool's
Day joke so that's what I mean by I need
enough requests before I'll cover
something so yeah and I knew my games
tutorial would be would not be a success
because once people see how complicated
it is to make a game yeah people go yeah
I don't want to do that
hmm
we go
all right so I got this box this
literally makes my my brain hurt trying
to figure out how to solve this alright
it's alright if I have to pause because
this is ridiculous
well well
alright well I'd like to get this prism
over here and I don't believe there's
any way in there is there nope this is
blocked
this is blocked but if you play this
game enough you every time you see one
of these things that means you need a
fan and you need to shoot yourself over
this thing so I'm gonna try that so I'm
going to take this any other No let me
go back here
nothing in here except that right now
hidden prism no take this fan because I
need a fan and put the box there do I
need I don't think I need I need this
open
I think I'm gonna need I know I need
this so take that fan and put that over
here I'm gonna be proud of myself I can
solve this all right say it blows I'm
gonna shoot me over this wall up and see
you can see a ladder right there so even
if this doesn't work out I'm thinking
wrong I can always walk that way I
already did a collision detection game
using wreck without a framework look in
my Java video tutorials near the end
like around 51
I made asteroids using just straight
Java okay that needs to stay there
thank you for the compliment Exodus but
I doubt in reality I doubt I am the best
programmer on YouTube there's some
people that have big time jobs let's say
yes okay so let's try to connect blue
and put this here I would say the only
thing I got going for me is I enjoy
making programming videos more than most
people on YouTube I think and I say that
only because most people that make
tutorials on YouTube don't make as many
as I do that's the only reason I would
say that
okay is there another prism in there
sort of guessing my way through this
based off of how puzzles have worked
previously in this game is there another
prisoner here or something else I need
there's another blue thing
oh look at that I can get in here
without that benefit okay I have to
think back here cuz I don't want to have
to restart this level
it depends I somebody keeps asking me if
they can reach professional success
without a college degree being a hundred
percent himself taught it depends
life is life is weird I can't answer
that question life just works you don't
know what's coming I can't say yes or no
to that question it is a it is a depends
upon life question so sorry but there is
no answer to that question I wish I
could tell you yes that's the way the
world is gonna work but yeah so that's
the best I can do for you alright so I'm
trying to catch up the world was
sorry but I'm just trying to figure out
where I need to go from here
hey there's my ladder there's this
I think what I want to do is I don't
think I need that fan anymore where's
that fan at it's enough it's quicker to
go this way or this way okay so if I get
this fan and I can use that alternate
source see I know what I need to do um I
I didn't explain this way okay so what I
need to do is these guys you can put the
prisms on top of boxes and fans here and
then charge this up and that will shoot
the prism up in the air and then what
I'll be able to do is take all the other
prisms and connect to the prism that's
flying up here in the sky and you know
do that alright so that's what I'm
trying to do and I'm just trying to work
out how to do that because that's that's
the hard part like I can literally I
don't think I'm gonna need this again so
I'm gonna to literally take this off of
here and I'm gonna take it in here and
put it here because I I think that's
where the eventually I'm gonna want that
to be so I'm gonna get this yeah let's
see if I want to put that there and then
use that as my alternative source of
energy
see these guys shoot if you don't play
the Talos principle or or you haven't
seen me do a stream report this shoots
energy out that's a that provides a
source of energy and these guys accept
the source of the energy to open gates
so what I have to do is figure out you
know how to keep these gates open
and I think this opens up everything so
does that mean I can get rid of these
blues
hmm
if we could figure out how to do this
I can just I think I'm gonna be able to
do this and this I don't think I'm gonna
be required to do anything else
and then that means this one is it
required
it's impossible for me to hit this
hmm
yeah my chat normally gets a little
crazy every time I do a live stream
that's cool I like that alright so that
is their have to figure out how to get
that out of there maybe work these guys
oh no I have a hard time wrapping my
head around how to solve this I
basically have those trapped inside of
there and I don't know if that was a
mistake there's no other prisms oops
is there a prism oh there's a prism
there
I can normally play this game for about
40 minutes and my brain just melts
you
glad you like the the recipe videos
I haven't done one a long time mainly
because I just I ran out ideas I
literally made a video for almost every
single thing that I eat and I was just I
was gonna get into there's some things
that I make
maybe mainly like Indian food what's we
call Indian food in America I guess
anyway explain that
anyway I you know like there's the
Americanized versions of food and it's
not necessarily good I don't know I just
decided not to do those types of videos
because I'm I don't know I don't know
why I did I just was like and there's
probably people that are better at doing
this than I am
so all Earthlings you watched earthlings
oh I couldn't last through Earthlings I
went vegan for health reasons not for
not because I watched thirst things
Earthlings is a very powerful
documentary I agree
okay
sorry I'm not doing more guys I'm just
really confused by this puzzle it is
wicked hard
you
there is another there another prison
somewhere that I missed no I got this
one
think the ideas I'm gonna have to find a
way of getting these prisms back through
these holes he so keep it that way
okay so there's one prism two prisms
three prisms is there a fourth somewhere
that I'm missing out on here
I think c-sharp and Python are both
fantastic languages I prefer c-sharp
only because it just works for what I
did
you guys see anything ah there it is
okay there is another prism okay so I
have to figure out how to get that guy
out of there how can I do it I'm just
wondering if I should have had a prism
here prism here and a prism there to get
that one out of there maybe that's the
idea
this is gonna take that back through
there that's gonna take that to there
that means this doesn't need to exist
anymore
aha see it's just stupid things like
that
you're like forever trying to figure it
out and then meanwhile it's it's a
pretty simple solution actually so now I
can go through here that's not where it
is is it it's here yes so can I get to
that blue and this yes so revelation
here wow that's funny oh yeah okay I
thought somebody was saying they would
they first started programming at the
age of 10 on a trs-80 that's I was like
that's the same as me somebody was
saying that about me okay
is there any benefit to going back there
is there any way of getting back there
yes there is let's go see what's back
there
okay there's the pad there's a symbol I
feel like I'm making progress even
though this is ridiculously hard to wrap
your head around or at least it's hard
for me to wrap my head around
hmm
okay
so now I don't
ok so I think now might be the time do I
need any of it
I don't need this prism here that's just
there just to look in there no other
reason so let's bring this back here I
think now is gonna be the time that I'm
going to be able to put my prism on top
of the fan so let's put that there
let's put this here is there anything
else
any other prisons yeah this one there's
nothing in here right hope thirst
sticking so long but I am really
struggling with this
I don't think I can get any other prisms
so I'm gonna put that there and am I
gonna be able to keep this open with
this prism and also power that with this
see watch this is going to make the
prism go up in here so I'm gonna go like
this this alright and now it should be
self-sustaining alright oops
no it's not self-sustaining because I

aiming right yes okay I will unless the
stream just like I did with my previous
so for programming I prefer you know
what back in the day I would have said I
would have said Mac but now that was
only because you had to have a Mac for
iOS now I don't think it matters I
really don't I mean I use parallels and
I run Windows on my computer it's just
like whatever you want anything will
work
so yeah just the matter
Ilyn if you want to you know what type
of computer you want okay
major major major major movement here
I'm certain to feel like I can actually
solve this puzzle so and then I opened
this and then I opened I just do this
wow did I just solve it and didn't even
realize I solve it that would be
ridiculous okay so I need a box or
something to put on that and then I win
and then I think Elohim might start
yelling at me because
Brazil irfan oh it's here ah crap I need
something to put on that is our box or
something random laying around
so that was another box what I do go and
leave in our room or something something
say I need something to put on here so I
can get the see there's a shape
mm-hmm ah there it is Oh beat it beat it
Gaza be Toby Toby Toby did I beat it I
think I beat it
Oh No oh yes I didn't did it look let's
go get this going
and get that awesome
we can't believe this all right cool I
beat it just run it here I'm in here put
that right there
Oh dawn beat the next-to-last level of
the towels principal trophy urn did it
trophy earned hedging my bets whatever
that means
all right did it I don't know I expected
healing him to start getting mad and
start screaming at me but no he didn't
so hmm that's weird let's come out here
and just it is done you have overcome
each trial that I set before you
you have shown faith and perseverance
therefore i judge you worthy and I say
unto you come to the gates of eternity
where you shall be granted everlasting
life where are the gates of eternity I
have to look at that oh there's my ax
can I hit this
boom alright trophy art and break down
barriers what's this do
is this a puzzle world those who have
discovered the holiest mysteries of my
garden may come to serve me as blessed
messengers in walk now in their abode be
respectful for their service is born
from the love the transcends death and
their love is for you I don't know
I kind of see I don't know I got out of
this world am I stuck here
oh no I can go right here I kind of
think this is not a puzzle we're on if
this is like this is the talus principle
jump off
would you jump off a bridge if somebody
told you yes I would
there you go say I fell off I know you
come back oh yeah so there is proof that
I would jump off a hill or a cliff if
somebody told me
I don't know if this is actually other
something over here what is this looks
like crib
okay
well guys I think that I'm probably
going to call it quits because I've been
going here for over an hour so what I
think is I'm gonna try to do a live
stream like this next Friday and finish
up the catalyst principle if at all
possible and you know just see what
happens because I like doing these and
how many people there fifty seven people
are watching me so that's normally what
it is about say yeah if I get like sixty
people that enjoy watching these videos
what the heck I'll do I'll do a random
live stream Friday I don't know but
either way I think I'm gonna stop for
now because my brain is melted and I'm
not ready for any more puzzles because I
would going crazy if I tried to solve
any more puzzles so did you well my
child you have overcome every trial in
this land and gathered all the seals
yeah okay he's basically saying that I
solved everything the only thing I
haven't solved is where's the tower at I
don't know where that is this a tower
come forward child eternity awaits
yeah should I go through tell me you
guys tell me in the chat should I go
through this because this might end
again him prematurely
tell me should I go through it should I
go through it tell me in the chat I am
still here
yes yes yes yes okay I'll go through oh
my what is this
ah
all right so should I not do it I have
some people telling me to do it and
other people telling me not to do it do
the top you mean if I go this way I'm
not allowed to do the tower
I will oh geez I have everybody's
telling me different things
okay so hmm okay everybody's telling me
I think people that know what is coming
thank you
han Solo but no I don't need a book on
on AI but thank you I appreciate it the
offer I think this will prematurely end
the game all right I'm doing it but if
this is the end of the game I'm not
gonna start it over from the beginning
so to do anything else so I'm gonna do
it
okay I don't know what to do I have
people that are literally flipping out
in my chat telling me not to do it so
I'm gonna trust I'm gonna trust that
they know and that I'm not gonna flip a
coin all right I'm gonna I'm gonna go
back I'm gonna trust so where's the
tower at where's that tower at I forget
where the tower is there's all the
things I've beaten this stuff
it's not III have not played this game
before I like to this you know I played
obviously at this point but that was it
is this where the Tyrus whatever do that
oh this I haven't played this in like a
month but I forget where the towers
well this is taking me up so maybe this
is a guitar and then the next part I
will try to conquer the tower which is
the end of the game I've spent so many
so much time playing this there it is
there's the tower I want to see what ela
him does if I climb the tower if he's
gonna flipping out
just making sure there's not anything
out here nope just a bunch of nothing
jeez I feel like I'm gonna endless a
loop there all right and there's six
levels to the tower I just want to come
up here and see what's going on cannot
detect location of primary subject query
clearly clearly
hmmm there's a puzzle thing over here
what's this
is there anything that we associate more
closely with intelligence and curiosity
every intelligent species on earth is
attracted by the unknown our mythologies
are full of riddles and mysteries and
divine knowledge even the word
apocalypse it seems like all right guys
so this is the tower I'm expecting him
to start flipping out and in the next
video I'll try to beat the whole tower
in one video if I can and that will be
