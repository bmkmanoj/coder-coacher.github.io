JavaScript scripting tutorial this is
part 4 in the series in which I explain
every capability JavaScript brings you
from the last tutorial I was unable to
completely cover all the comparison
operators so here they are for you first
off we have the greater than symbol but
less than symbol the greater than or
equal the less than or equal the equals
and the not equal comparison operators
and here we have all the logical
operators logical operators if you watch
the last video are often used in
combination with comparison operators
that are a little bit more complicated
when it comes to logical operators you
have the and logical operator the or
logical operator and the logical not the
logical not provides the opposite of the
result of the comparison so in this
example we are testing the C of 5 is
greater than 2 obviously that answer is
true but by putting the logical not
operator which is the exclamation point
you can see here it actually returns to
the opposite value being false instead
of true also you're going to see within
JavaScript that there are model
different operators available for you to
edit data there's the addition operator
the subtraction operator the
multiplication and division then you
have the modulo operator which returns
the remainder of a division so if you
divided 5 by 2 the modulo operator would
return the result of 1 which would be
the remainder of that division then you
have the shorthand increment operator
which is the double plus sign what this
does is it will automatically add one to
a variable just by putting those two
additional plus signs behind that
variable followed by a semicolon the
decrement does the opposite its instead
subtracts the value of one then you have
another additional shorthand way to do
additions here we are going to want to
use the variable which is called samp
var to add 2 to itself and then reassign
it back to the
if you wanted to do that you would just
simply follow that variable with the
plus sign then the equal sign and
whatever you would want to add to it and
also you can do the same thing with this
decrement operator that's provided here
now I'm going to continue going on
explaining exactly how will this draw
the script script operates we're going
to talk about the switch statement you
can remember since the last tutorial I
have event handlers set up so that
whenever I click on these spans that are
right here and if you don't understand
what I'm saying watch the previous
tutorial when I click on these spans it
automatically makes calculations for me
and changes the line of text so I'm
going to explain exactly how all of this
is working whenever you click on this
span right here it sends the value of 2
to this function right here which is the
testing switch value here I'm defining a
variable name value passed and the item
sent in this case 2 is going to be
assigned to the value passed variable
now here is the switch statement here
we're going to do a bunch of tests to
see if this value passed is equal to
either 0 1 2 or 3 and if it's not equal
to any of them we're going to perform
this default action right here so 2
comes through obviously it's not equal
to 0 so we are going to skip this
statement altogether it is not equal to
1 so we're gonna skip all of these
statements here and it is going to be
equal to 2 so what we are going to do is
to assign a distrain to value to return
2 which is name of this variable we're
gonna sign the 2 or 3 sent
string to this value right here and what
the break statement does is it throws
you completely out of the switch
statement then what it would do is it
will continue to process with this
function right here which provides you
with the capability to change this line
of text which is on your screen
there actually is another way to compare
values which I have not talked about and
this is the conditional operator which
you see right here what this does is it
does comparisons all on one line can
only be used to do an either-or
comparison so in this case what's going
on is it's testing to see if X is
greater than Y if so then you would put
a question mark
it would perform this calculation which
is multiplied Y by 2 if not you can see
here's a colon it would multiply x times
2 so that is the conditional operator
now you know about every operator that's
available to you in JavaScript now I'm
gonna cover looping again just like
before when you click on this it sends
an event handler that calls this
function in this case testing for loop
and it passes in this case the numbers 2
and 20 which go into these areas right
here and then operations are performed
on them gonna skip this because I've
already explained how to add values to
variables jump right in here to the for
statement what this for loop does is it
provides you with the ability to perform
the same action over and over again
until a certain condition is met in this
case that condition is going to be that
I is less than or equal to whatever the
end value variable is equal to how you
set up before a loop as you first start
off with the keyword 4 followed by this
bracket then you're going to define a
variable that is going to iterate you
through the loop you're going to assign
a value to that iterator we're gonna
continue to run this loop and all the
actions that are contained between this
opening curly brace in this closing
curly brace until this comparison
operator returns the value of false and
then down here after the semicolon
you're going to iterate through these I
values that are associated here so
basically what we're gonna do in this
case if you look over here is continue
to add a blank space followed by
whatever the value of I is to the
variable value to return
until I is greater than or equal to n
value which in this case is the number
20 as we see over here after it performs
all these actions it's going to send the
result to the Edit netted text function
just like before now I'll go over the
while loop here again we're defining
function testing while loop passing
variables in and creating new variables
this is what the wanna loop does it has
only a comparison operator within these
brackets right here followed by the
keyword while and just like the for loop
it iterates through everything that is
between the opening and curly brackets
until this value returns a value of
false since we don't have an iterator
within this body of the while loop we
have to put that down here so this is
going to iterate just like the I value
was iterated before and then we're going
to perform a similar action which is to
assign a variable to a blank space
between two double quotes
followed by another variable and then
assign it to the variable value to
return and then send that information to
that at node text and finally we have to
do while loop again two variables are
passed in a whole bunch of variables
sort of decided upon and then the
do-while loop guarantees that all of
these actions will be performed at least
one time so what we're gonna do is again
assign value to return to a blank space
and so forth and so on here we're using
a shortcut this is going to multiply two
times
the starting value variable and then
reassign whatever that value is back to
the start value variable and it here is
an if statement that checks to make sure
that start value never goes over the
value of 40 now I own purpose set this
up to actually continue running
indefinitely just so I can find a reason
to talk about the breaks date what the
break statement does is it throws you
out of a loop and it's a way to keep
your looping from becoming what they
call an infinite loop so it's just a
short little tip way to protect
yourselves from having your looping
system fall into an infinite loop
powder blushes and then you can see here
to finish off the do-while loop you
actually have a while followed by a
conditional down here and then here is
another operator and there is another
conditional and if either one of these
values since we're using the or operator
here returned the value of true it will
continue to loop indefinitely and you
can see here my JavaScript coding is all
completely done so I'm going to end my
hiding of my JavaScript code with two
forward slashes two negative signs in
this bracket right here I'm gonna close
my script with the closing scripting tag
and then here is all the regular HTML
which I explained you in the last
presentation so I hope you enjoyed this
