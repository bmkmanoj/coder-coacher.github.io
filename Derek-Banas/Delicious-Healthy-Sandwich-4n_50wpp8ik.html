meant to show you how to make an
extremely delicious sandwich but also an
extremely healthy sandwich we're gonna
make a meatless meatloaf or meatball
sandwich it's also extremely easy to
make basically what you need to do is
you need to get yourself what it's
called high protein or TVP textured
vegetable protein
now don't let that scare you that's
gonna make this dish taste like meat we
want to take that 2 cups of TVP and
you're gonna throw that into a bowl and
then to that you're gonna add 1/2 cup of
ketchup I just used regular old Heinz
ketchup but you can use whatever you
like if you don't like that and then to
that you're gonna add 2 tablespoons of
liquid aminos or you could use tamari or
you could use soy sauce I just use
Liquid aminos because I'm allergic to
MSG and then on top of that we're gonna
add in 2 cups of vegetable broth and you
could also use chicken broth or beef
broth but that kind of eliminates the
whole point of this tutorial and if you
want to know how I make vegetable broth
I provide a link to that above now after
I dump all that into a pan I'm going to
just stir this up and then after it's
all thoroughly stirred so that it looks
like the consistency of what you see
right there you're gonna let this sit
for about 10 to 15 minutes and now I'm
gonna move into making the tomato sauce
for it okay so now I have my pan on high
and to that I'm going to add about 1
tablespoon of olive oil and then I'm
gonna get those sodium added tomatoes
diced right out of a can throw that in
here own another and if you don't wanna
go through the whole process of making
this tomato sauce you could also go in
and just dumps also on top of that
tastes just as good then I'm just gonna
take my tomatoes and I'm just gonna mash
them and of course if you don't want to
use the olive oil you don't have to just
with a regular old masher on high on top
of the stove now I'm basically just
going to let this sit and boil until
most of the water is out of the tomatoes
and it'll move my pan over and then
we're gonna continue making our meatless
meatloaf alright so here we got
everything in our bowl and we've let
this soak here for right around 12
minutes and to this I'm gonna add
one cup of quick oats right to the pan
then I'm going to add a third of a cup
of really finely chopped onion and then
I'm gonna add another third of a cup of
really finely chopped carrots now to
bind everything together I'm gonna use
egg beaters here and I'm gonna put a
half a cup of egg beaters you could use
any type of egg alternative that you
prefer and then I'm gonna get myself one
tablespoon of what is called nutritional
yeast
stooop that up throw that in a pan there
you go most of the hard work is done so
now we're gonna mix this concoction up
inside of here very thoroughly and you
have your oven set at 375 degrees and
this is going to cook for about 45
minutes at 375 after it's all really
mixed in here but you don't see any big
clumps of onion or carrot or anything
like that and there you go that's
looking really really really good then
I'm gonna get myself a 9 by 5 pan and
I'm gonna scoop all the ingredients here
into this 9 by 5 pan you could make this
into meatballs what I would do instead
is to put this in your refrigerator
maybe overnight just to let everything
sort of settle and get easier to form
into balls but then you'd have to fry it
in a pan or play around with Pam and try
and bake it and things like that so I
decided and I actually prefer it better
as a meatloaf it just is better because
it fills up the sandwich there you go
now that I got that all set up inside of
my pan I'm just gonna throw that in the
oven for 40 minutes and now we're back
to the tomato sauce stirring out here
and there you can see a lot of the water
has been burned out of the tomatoes you
could let it go even further and further
and further if you'd like to but that
basically just cooked pretty much on
just disturbed for about three minutes
you see there's a lot less water in it
so now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
just get some regular old tomato sauce
so just use this for thickening and dump
that in and then on top of that let me
get about an A
the cup of pesto and toss that into the
pan as well you could just use basil and
you're pretty much gonna get the same
sort of flavor
underneath the video I have a little
brief recipe for pesto
basically he just put pine nuts and
basil and olive oil with a little bit of
parmesan and that's it there you go
there's your basic tomato sauce and of
course you can put pepper or anything
else that you'd like inside of that
sound basically just gonna wait a couple
more minutes or your meatloaf to cook
and then you'll be ready to eat okay so
I got my half of a baguette bread out of
the oven and I'm gonna cut it in half
what's really great about this and
what's good about it is since I only
cooked half of it this part right here
is hard so if I want to cut down on any
calories inside of this I'm just going
to rip out the inside and it's still
gonna have a nice little well in which I
can throw my meatless meatloaf into and
here is the meatless meatloaf directly
right out of the oven and I cooked it
for 45 minutes I actually probably
should have kept it in there a little
bit longer but I'm hungry so I'm just
gonna get it out of here you also should
probably let it sit for a little bit so
it firms up a little bit but I'm not so
worried about that also going to tear
out this dough right here now we can
just go into our meatloaf concoction we
have here and pile it inside of our
bread it's crusty on the top not so much
inside and there you go
it's a big water meatless meatloaf and
then on top of that I'm gonna take made
a sauce and dump it on top of that and
then take my lid and put it down on top
of it
so there it is about a 300 calorie or
less meatless meatloaf sandwich that
tastes absolutely amazing
