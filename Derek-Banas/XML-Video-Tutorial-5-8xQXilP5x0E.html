5 of my XML video tutorial today I'm
going to talk about entities and also
review a lot of what we've done already
now if you didn't see the previous
tutorials definitely check those out and
I provide a link above to those and this
is where we are left off from our last
time this is the document type
definition that we created previously
and then we went and created an XML file
and it went automatically populated it
with all this information so now what
I'm going to do is I'm going to jump
back into my document type definition
here and make couple changes and explain
what an entity is you can basically use
an entity to create shortcuts in your
DTD files and just like we had
previously whenever we would type in
this is an entity right here this is
less than now whenever I would type in
less than on a computer it's going to
replace it with the less than sign just
like we did previously
now you can come in here and make a
whole bunch of your own personal
entities that are quite useful and you
can pull data in and replace those codes
either directly inside of the document
type definition or from an outside file
and the first thing I'm going to show
you is what is called a parameter and to
take let's just jump right here now
throughout this document type definition
we are constantly typing in PC data so
I'm going to do here instead is create a
parameter entity that's going to make it
very easy to replace that with a simple
code and to do so you're just going to
type in entity right like that and then
you're going to put in a percent sign
and then I'm going to put in PD and then
inside of the quotes you want to put in
whatever you want
PD to replace and we're just going to do
that and like this and close it off with
a bracket and now anywhere we want to
have PC data show up we can just simply
come in here put a % PD and a semicolon
it's going to automatically throw that
in and I could do that over and over
again within this whole entire document
type definition PD and a semicolon now
I'm not going to go through and do that
over and over and over again we're just
going to move on here let's come down to
the poster area now let's say that I
would like to have all of this
information right here actually
contained in a separate file well I'm
going to do that first we're going to go
over here to source in my little folder
that I got here I'm going to select that
and then I'm going to go new come down
here to other now by default inside of
Eclipse inside of the XML folder there
is no entity file so if you want to
create
one you have to come up here under
general and then just click on file and
then I'm going to call this TV shows
five dot int and then click finish
alright now that we have that file open
inside of there we're going to select
this guy and copy it and then jump over
into this entity file and I'm just going
to paste it down inside of there now
another way you can assign attributes
instead of typing all of this out is to
do it all inside of one tag so to do
that I'm just going to come inside here
I'm going to get rid of these closing
brackets then just to make it nice and
easy to say instead I'm going to put its
reference like that I'm going to do the
same thing with width and height and
then finally show ID now that I have
that all set up I'm going to save it and
I'm going to jump back into my DTD file
and I can actually get rid of this all
together right like that then I'm going
to type in entity and a % again and I'm
going to save poster then I'm going to
say system and I'm going to grab that
entity file so TV shows five dot int and
there you go and there is my entity file
and it's going to pull it in there just
like it was already in there previously
and that is also known as a parameter
entity remember anytime you see a %
that's what it means it's a parameter
entity and then to get everything to
actually show up here inside of this DTD
file we're going to put a % poster and
then a semicolon and now it
automatically is going to go in there
now you can also define what is called a
general entity and a DTD file and those
can be used in the XML file rather than
just in the document type definition
remember parameter entities are going to
be used in the DTD file Wow
general entities are going to be defined
inside of the DTD file but they are
going to be used inside of the XML files
let's just scroll down here and create
one now let's say that I wanted to
create shortcuts so that whenever I
would type out for example great that a
sentence would show up rather than just
the word great well I'm just going to go
in here and say great and I could define
this for all my different shows as a
rating system or something like that I
could say this show was great with an
exclamation mark in there and close that
off now anytime that I would inside of
the XML file put an ampersand inside of
there followed by the word great and a
semicolon instead this sentence right
here is going to show up inside the XML
file and I'm going to show you exactly
how that works here in a second and I
can also go and
create external entities that are
general entities and how I'm going to do
that is again type in entity let's say I
wanted to do like a disclaimer or
something like that
I call it TV disclaimer and then I'm
going to say this is a system file and
let's say it's called TV shows
disclaimer
dottie intake now I'm going to copy this
guy so I have it and I'm going to go
create it Oh jump back over in the
source click on that file new go ahead
and click on other in this situation I'm
gonna leave it just as file and click on
next paste that inside of there and then
click finish now in this situation I'm
going to type in TV disclaimer right
like that get a closing tag in there and
inside of here I could say something
like all characters fictitious think I
spelled fictitious right alright now if
I save that I'm automatically going to
be able to use that entity inside of my
XML file let's get rid of all this extra
whitespace because we're not going to
need this anymore and all the code and
everything you see your on your screen
is available in a link underneath the
video so let's file save that and I'll
jump back in the TV shows XML now we
already have the document type
definition already set up here but I'm
also going to hook into an excel file
that is going to parse all this
information and display it on the screen
I'm going to come in here and link to
that guy I'm going to type in XML style
sheet type is equal to text XSL each
reference is going to be equal to and I
get a tell it which XSL file I'm going
to be using it's going to be called TV
shows five dot XSL and then close that
guy offer like that then I'm going to
come in here and start plugging in all
my information so I'm going to give this
an identification number and I'm going
to type in mores
release date 2008 country it's going to
be US networks going to be ABC then I'm
going to change this to million and I'm
going to bounce out into another file
and pull this other information in and
there you go I populated it with all of
the information that we previously went
over in the past tutorials now I'm going
to jump in here and actually use the
entities that I defined inside of this
DTD file meaning these guys right here
being great and TV disclaimer I'm going
to come in here and throw them in the
XML file I'm just going to throw them at
the end of the description so let's say
I wanted to say that I thought this show
was great well I'm just going to type in
great like that semicolon right like
that that's all I need to do and then if
I also wanted to throw in the disclaimer
inside of the X
I'll file I'm just going to type in and
purse and again TV disclaimer like that
and then end that with a semicolon and
there you go that's how you pull in all
those different entities so we're going
to file save that and then I'm going to
create my XSL file that's going to allow
me to display all this information on
the screen so we're just going to go
into source again click on that new
other and then in this situation we do
have the capability of using an excel
file so click on that and then next and
then down here we're going to actually
create it I'm going to call it TV shows
five again XS up click finish
and there you go it automatically
through all that information inside of
there again I'm going to come in here
and tell it to translate this into HTML
so xso output method is equal to and
this is going to be HTML close that off
and I'm going to get rid of this all
together and then I'm going to start
defining my HTML file HTML file I mean
and there's the head section and then
inside of the body section I'm going to
want to cycle through everything and
display a whole bunch of different
things on the screen so we're going to
use for each again just like we did
before and I'm going to say select is
equal to TV show for its last show and
then I'm going to sort everything out
select is equal to I'm gonna sort
everything based off of the name of the
show order I'm going to put in a send
and like I said before that is the
default and data type is going to define
what this name is which is going to be
text so that knows how to properly sort
everything I'm going to put everything
inside of paragraph tags and then just
start throwing some information out so
number XSL you're going to be using
value of a whole bunch times value of
select is going to be equal to the name
for our television show and I'm going to
be copying this because I'm using it
over and over and over again was
released in jump to the next drop that
in there type in release by drop that in
there changes the network throw in a
period and then in this guy this is
going to be description which it's also
going to throw in all of my entities on
the screen and then I'm going to end my
paragraph tag like that and create
another paragraph tag that I'm going to
type in viewers million people and the
year in which it was cancelled and then
if I wanted to also throw in an image
again very easy to do let's go image is
is just going to prove that the poster
entity that I created is actually going
to work here remember you're just going
to get a whole
of the attribute that is called source
in this situation and then I'm just
going to say that I want source to have
the value of whatever poster has as a
value and then the attribute closes
itself off and then let's say after the
image I want to throw a break statement
in there there you go in a everything
else is exactly the same and there you
can see if I go in here and actually
execute this guy that everything shows
up exactly like we went and typed in
here on the screen with all the images
and all of the different entities that
we went and threw in there even any
questions or comments below of the last
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
