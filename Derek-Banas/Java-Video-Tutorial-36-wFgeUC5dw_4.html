36 of my java video tutorial series
today we're going to do something really
cool a lot of you guys have asked me
numerous questions about J tables and a
whole bunch of other people asked me
questions about how to pull information
from a database into a J table now
understand to properly set up this
database first off you need to watch and
setup the database using part 1 of my
sabermetrics tutorial it is a link up
above then once you're able to do that
let's say a major league baseball team
came to you and said I want you to go
through and find the 200 best players
and be able to calculate out for me the
minimum cost per run for every single
player in this tutorial you're going to
learn how to create this whole entire
thing here it's all 100% sortable and
its really neat and all this information
is pulled from a database so let's get
into the code alright so first off we
can we put a whole bunch of different
libraries in here you've seen before
this is for SQL there's all kinds of
information
in regards to setting up the frames
since this is going to be a GUI app like
you just saw this default table cell
renderer that's going to allow me to
very specifically render out information
inside of each cell of the table that
you just saw and then default table
model allows you to define exactly
methods and so forth inside of your J
table and then we can also make specific
changes to columns and things like that
so here you see the same things you've
always seen less than 36 and here's all
that and all the code is available
underneath of this video you should get
it it'll make it very easy for you to
understand because it's heavily comment
right the first thing we need to do is
create a multi-dimensional object array
and it's going to hold all of my column
data for each player so all that
information that's assigned to each
player so I'm going to actually create
that outside of main and this tutorial
is like perfect for a model view
controller design pattern but I found I
actually designed it that way and I
found that it was so hard to follow so
what I'm going to do is have most of the
information be in the method main I know
that is not the way to do it but so that
you can understand what I'm doing that
is the way that I'm going to do it
instead of breaking everything up into a
bunch of different methods so create a
multi-dimensional array that's going to
hold a bunch of objects and I'm going to
call this tail YouTube
info then I'm also going to need another
one of these guys but it doesn't have to
be a multi-dimensional rank because it
is going to hold all of my column titles
and then how I assign all those this is
a great review for everything I've
covered in the past I'm going to say
year I'm going to say player ID name t
TRC which is stands for theoretical team
runs created which is a sabermetric
formula and sabermetrics is used to
analyze baseball players if I didn't say
that for salary cost per run which is
going to be how much do we pay them in
salary versus how many runs they create
and position and then to close off this
object we're just going to put a little
curly brace there and a semicolon now
create another one and this is a result
set and a result set contains a table of
data filled with all the results of a
query that's what it is so it has all of
your query results in it that's all then
we're going to also create a result set
meta data type its meta not meat and I'm
going to call it meta data and what this
guy does is it's going to contain
information on the data returned from
the quarry so for example the number of
columns and a whole bunch of other
different things now I'm going to come
in here and go static default table
model and this is going to allow me to
very specifically edit my j table I'm
just going to call it D table and I'm
going to say new I'm going to copy this
guy right here paste it in there and I'm
going to pass it database info which is
going to be all of the rows of
information just so you're on term
percent clear it's going to be all of
this information right here that's
what's in that multi-dimensional wreck
and then I'm also going to pass it
columns which is going to be the title
for everything now what I want to do is
I want to override a method inside of
default table model and a shortcut way
to do that is to just do it this way
we're just going to go public class get
column class I want to override this
method and what this method is passed is
a column number and what it does in
exchange is passes back what type of
data type that column is very important
so we're going to define a basic class
we're going to call it return value now
what I need to do is whenever
calm is past I need to verify that it is
actually a column that exists so I'm
going to say column number needs to be
greater than or equal to zero because
there is no such thing as a negative
column number inside of a J table and
I'm also going to go call them want to
make sure that it's less than I'm going
to say get all them count which is a
method that's going to return the number
of columns and then if that is indeed
true I'm going to assign the value for
the return value which is going to
return the class type for this column at
this is 0 call them if anything is not
making sense get the code it's heavily
commented it'll explain every single
line get class and get class is going to
return the value for my column and the
reason why we're doing this is so that
in this guy right here see how the
salaries and all this all are right
justified well by default if you don't
do what I'm doing right here which is
overriding the method name get column
class it treats everything that you pull
from the database as a string we don't
want it to do that that's the reason why
we need to override it and say hey wait
a minute there aren't just strings here
there is also numeric data and that is
why we were going to override this and
that's what this guy's going to do it's
going to say no this is not a string
this is a double for example and treat
it as such which means right justify it
and whenever we need to sort this column
treat everything's as doubles instead of
strings and we're going to come down
here and go else which means there
they're looking for a column that
doesn't exist we're going to go return
value is equal to object when you say
class which is what it returns by
default we come down here and go return
return value and that is all that we
need to do for that guy so I put a
semicolon right there so that is how you
override a method in a real neat way
instead of going and totally extending
it and doing all that other nonsense now
we can get into the main function like I
said before I would never put all this
into this one main function but I'm
doing it because I think it makes more
sense whenever you see everything and
we're not constantly jumping out to
different functions the real world it
doesn't make as much sense but in this
tutorial I think it does so we're
creating the jframe
which is going to hold all of our
different components and we need to go
frame set default close
operation and all this is going to do is
make sure that our jframe and if the
application itself is completely shut
down whenever somebody says that they
want to exit our program that's all that
does then we're going to go connection
because we are going to connect to the
database and pull all these information
from the database is equal to null and
then we have to wrap all this stuff in a
try block and catch any exceptions that
are being thrown and we want to get a
driver that's going to allow us to query
the database I do that as go class for
name comm this is MySQL JDBC driver then
we have to go with our connection we
need to call the Reviver manager and get
connection what driver manager is is
it's used to handle a set of JDBC
drivers it just allows you to handle and
work with different drivers so you can
connect to the database and then get
connection what it's going to do for you
is it's going to establish a connection
with whichever database you tell it you
want to connect it so you're going to go
JDBC : - ql : and then on this situation
mine is localhost because it's on my
computer laymen 591 which is the name of
the database that holds all my baseball
data I ask QL this is my user ID and
Turtledove is the password I'm going to
use and now I don't use this password
anywhere except in these tutorials
so now we'll we go we have to create a
statement object and it's going to be
used to execute an SQL query and just go
connection create statement a create
statement returns a statement object and
then what we needed to do is actually
create a string and I'm going to call it
select stuff and this query was actually
created in my sabermetrics tutorial I'm
going to actually jump over there and
get it right now because I didn't want
to type all this out all this is is
basic SQL so like I said get the code if
you want to be able to see how this
works I'm just going to paste that in
there make sure I put an equal sign this
is all just a big giant SQL query just
like that I'm not going to go through it
because I went through it previously so
after you issue this query need to go
rows this is going to be the result set
so like I said up here
say results set right up here rose this
is going to contain all of the
information that comes back whenever
right query the database so I need to go
SQL state execute query list doesn't go
there and then I need to pass it select
stuff which is the query itself which is
right here see select soft and like I
said before rows being known as a
results that contains a table of data
that represents all of the results of
the query that you issue and one thing
it's important is it cannot be changed
and you can only read one row of
returned information at a time and only
in one direction you can't bounce around
with this guy now in regards to the
metadata let's say that you wanted to
retrieve different numbers and types and
properties of these query results that
are right here well you would use that
metadata tag that I talked about before
so let's just say I'm not going to do
this in this tutorial but I just want to
show you this real quick you don't get
this don't worry about all right so
let's say you wanted to go rows and get
meta data like that what this is going
to allow you to do now is let's say you
want to say number of columns you want
to get the number of total columns in
the database well you could just go
metadata now and get column count and
that's exactly what that would return is
the number of columns of course this
would have to be an integer and you
could also get all of the different
titles like up here whenever I created
the column titles like the titles for
all of the different columns in my J
table well if you wanted to actually
pull those in yourself instead of
defining them hard inside of this guy
could also come in here and say columns
is equal to new and create a string and
say num of columns which is this guy
because we have to define how big our
array is going to be and then you could
just go with a for loop I is equal to 1
well I is less than or equal to num of
ohms and then you could cycle through
all those different results like let's
say when you go columns I is equal to
you could use the meta data again it
column name which is what we're trying
to get and then you could do whatever
you would want with that information
store it in a database or whatever so
that's just a little bit of information
but like I said I'm not going to get a
whole lot into that let's just get rid
of this then all together now what I
need to do is I am pulling in all of the
row and
Meishan dynamically so what I have to do
is create another object array and I'm
going to call it temper oh and then I'm
going to use next to iterate through all
the results of my query so I asked my
database hey I want this information and
it says fine
here is Row 1 Row 2 Row 3 Row 4 and so
forth and so on it contains the
information that you asked for well you
can only get those rows of information
one at a time and use it doing rows next
which just means give me the next row
and now what I'm going to do is because
I've laid everything in here differently
so for example this is an integer this
is a string this is a string this is a
double this is a string you get the
point there well I want all that
information pulled out using it's very
specific to how to type I don't want to
pull everything out like everything's a
string which is the default I'm going to
go 10 Pro and I'm going to go new object
and I'm going to go Rose get int and I'm
going to say what that in essence says
is I want the very first column in the
row of data and I know it's an integer
so I want to get that integer and then
the very next thing is a string so I'm
going to say get string and this is
going to be column 2 whenever you are
creating anything inside of a j table
the index always starts with one and not
zero like you might be used to then the
next very next thing that's going to get
printed out here is also another string
so I got to change this to get string
and then this is going to be column
three that I want and if I want to go on
to the next row I just want to make sure
I have that comma there and then go down
to the next row and in this situation
column four let's pull this over here so
you can see it so this is one two three
four what's this this is doubles so we
want to go get double because we know
we're going to be pulling a double in in
that situation and then the next thing
is a string again and this is going to
represent column five and this is going
to be column six and column six is an
integer and the very next thing is going
to be what column seven and column seven
if we look at it again one two three
four five six seven is what a double
we're going to say get double and then
call them eight I'm just going to put it
right here on this line is a string so
we're just going to call it string
notice how we're pulling all that
information together
their yarn that's how you define a
object array just like that now what do
we need to do well after we get all of
this information inside of here
Before we jump to the next row of
information we want to go D table model
and we're going to add row and we're
going to add all of the results we got
that are stored in temp row we want to
add that to our model which is going to
then be shot into our J table and of
course this is going to be D table model
like that so now that we got all that
sorted we need to catch all of our
exceptions so I'm going to go catch one
of the things we need to catch his SQL
exception
X we are and I'm just going to go
system.out.print line and to keep this
really simple I'm going to go e^x get
message point like that and then I'm
going to bounce down here and catch
another exception I went over this in
previous database tutorials let's say
it's a class on found exception and this
is called if the driver can't be found
which is going to allow you to connect
to the database and those are the only
exceptions that we need to worry about
that situation now we need to create the
star of the show which is the J table
you just go J table and I'm going to
call it table is equal to nu J table
they go D table model kind of passing
its own specific type of model of a
table which does what if you missed it
it just comes in here and make sure that
whenever class values are passed from
the database over into our table that we
check to see what data type they are but
it allows us to do what kinds of sorting
and other neat things now let's say you
wanted to change the font for your
columns in your table or for the cells
in your table we'll simply just go table
set row height and table get row height
which is its current height and then on
this situation I'm just going to say I
want to add 10 pixels to it so yarn
that's a simple way to change the height
of it let's say that you wanted to
change the cell font just go table set
font and I'm just going to go new font
and I'm gonna say Sarah and I'm going to
go font plain you could also go font
bold and let's say I want it to be 20
points there you are that's how you do
that real simple I see these
complicated ways of changing fonts
online it's like it doesn't have to be
that complicated let's say that you
wanted the person to be able to sort
through your information in your table
it's real simple just automatically just
go set Auto create row sorter and set
that to true and that will automatically
set up the table and allow people to
sort through the information which is
awesome also let's say that you'd want
to come in here and resize the column
widths how do you do that well the very
first thing you need to do is go to
table set Auto resize mode which means
it's going to automatically resize all
of your columns to way that Java thinks
looks best which is sometimes good and
sometimes not so you're going to have to
shut that off first off otherwise it
won't allow you to manually go in and
define the size of your columns or the
width then if you want to actually set
that width you go table column and I'm
going to go call them one if I want to
change just the width for column one
then I go table get column model like
that and then I go get column this is
how you're able to select column zero so
if you ever wanted to actually get
column zero that is how you would do it
and then we're going to come in here and
actually change the width on column zero
and I'm going to say set preferred width
and let's say I want it to be a hundred
pixels well there you are hundred pixels
and that's how you would set all those
different column widths up and if you
want to change any of the other
different columns it's easy enough to do
let's say that I want to change column
two this situation I'm going to go call
this one and change this to two and
let's say you wanted it to be a hundred
and ninety pixels well there you are you
just change that you can do this all for
all these other different columns as far
as I know there's no way to set a
default for a bunch of different columns
all at one time I don't think you can do
that somebody out there figures out how
to do it please tell me because if you
need now let's say you wanted to also
justify let's say you wanted to justify
to the center all of the information
contained in a column well if you want
to do that you go to table column and
I'm just going to call this TC is equal
to table I'm going to say get column
that is named that has the title team
there's another way to get access to
column information by the actual title
for the column and then if I want to
Center it I go to Center table
so renderer I'm gonna call center
renderer is equal to the new and I'm
just going to copy this like that and
then I go TC set cell renderer I'm going
to say Center renderer I like that now
let's say that I want to Center a couple
of these different guys I'm actually
going to show you this this method is
stored outside of main so I'm gonna
Center not only team but I also want to
center position so I'm just going to go
POS which is the title for it and then
in this situation I'll need that so get
rid of that and I also don't need this
so I'm going to reuse those methods
because it's simple to do that and it's
just leave it at that you could also do
write centered and all this other stuff
I go over that on the article for this
guy alright so now I'm going to go J
scroll pane scroll pane is equal to nu J
scroll pane and I'm going to take my
table and I'm going to assign it to this
guy so that users of it will be able to
scroll through the data that is in the
table I'm gonna go frame at pane and I'm
going to use border learning out Center
and I went over all this stuff in my
java swing tutorial which is part of
this tutorial series then I'm gonna set
my frame that size 800 by 500 all stuff
you've seen a whole bunch of times
I'm gonna go frame dot set visible to
true so that the frame shows up on the
screen and that is pretty much all I
need to do with that now outside of this
class Java less than 36 I need to create
the method that is going to handle all
this centering that's right here and
what is this called it is called center
table cell renderer just like that this
is a class that's going to be stored
inside of here so center table cell
renderer and I'm going to put in extends
default table cell renderer so I just
need to extend that guy and then inside
of it I'm going to go public center
table cell renderer it's going to
receive nothing and what it's going to
do is set or sano alignment and I just
need to go J label Center and that's
going to have center whatever I tell it
whatever column I want centered and then
like I said whenever you execute all
this stuff you have to wait for a while
because this is an insane amount of
information you're pulling out here but
like I said before this table
is going to show up and you're going to
be able to sort through all of this
different information it's really kind
of cool leave any questions or comments
blue otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
