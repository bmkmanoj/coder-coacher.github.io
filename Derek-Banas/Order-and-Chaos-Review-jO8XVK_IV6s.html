of fun video game tutorial I'm going to
show you today order and chaos on the
iPad if you ever wished that world
warcraft or wished world warcraft didn't
exist on the iPad well you are in luck
you can basically choose from four
different character classes which are
humans elves orcs or the undead as of
now they are all identical in regards to
skill set so let's just choose org male
or female then the different character
classes are warrior which is just like
World of Warcraft mage very similar then
you have the monk which is kind of a
paladin sort of priests and you have the
Ranger which is sort of a hunter / road
warlocks do not exist and I played all
four of these races not a ton I'm
because I have a life and other things
to do and by far the most impressive
best is the range or everything else is
kind of boring but i'm going to pick the
warrior just for the heck of it and
there's just basic stylings you can do
in regards to hair hair color and so
forth and there's just basic facial
structures you can pick from I'm sure
this is going to change in the future
and then you have to try to find a name
that hasn't been taken there you go and
then you pick where you want your guys
located and then there is there's your
basic warrior and then with the left
button you run around and then over here
will be skills whenever you acquire them
and I'm going to shift out to another
character that actually has something
here just to get this over with auctions
or working exactly like they were very
similar anyway to the way they work in
World of Warcraft if I want to create an
auction like for example I want to sell
this ordinary fur I just come in here
and I type in how much I want to sell it
for and so forth and so on because
there's a lot of confusion in regards to
how to access the auction that's just
how simple it is and then auction list
will hold all your auction items you
have out there there's all your bids and
then if you want to specifically search
for something like a one-handed weapon
dagger its search there you go there's
tons and tons and tons of weapons that
are
available for you to buy so that's how
the auction system works and just one
here this is the map system you hit this
little I down here it will actually show
you the names and one of the
auctioneer's is in Bell shoal and then
you can hit these different arrows and
see all the other different parts in the
maps all over the place so that's how
the mapping system works and green Mont
is probably one of your biggest cities
that's available currently and to
control everything down here is your
skills in the bottom right hand corner
and then over here I'm sorry I'm not
used to doing this one crouched down
looks almost identical to world of
warcraft just to show you you move
through your skill keys right here I can
become invisible let's say I want to
shoot him with an arrow that's just how
simple it is and you loot in exactly the
same way as you do world warcraft click
on your little guy up here will show you
everything you have in your bag you can
buy more slots with gold here's a
character and all the different armor
that he currently has on them there's
quests if you click on that going to pop
up a little arrow that's going to show
you where to go to complete that quest
your spell's all the different spells
that are available to you there's your
talent tree I mean everything's pretty
much identical social I have nobody on
my friend test which isn't strange that
was in a guild I could do that and I
could also ignore different people that
way team if I was currently in a team
that's how you wouldn't handle all that
and then died the bottom if you want to
chat with people or let's say you wanted
to come in here and do something with
anymote that's just how you do it get
that get rid of it you jump by hitting
over bottom right hand corner run around
another of the neat things I'm going to
take you to green mont with another
character and here i am in your moment
right here you can also buy pets but
they are simply pets like for example
the animals are not available for the
hunter so let's say i want to buy this
young wolf and spend all my money and i
just did and then you'll actually see if
i click on this and click on the wolf
and click you
news now whenever I run around I had a
little wolf trailing behind me if people
weren't talking you'd see that see
there's a little wolf running around
behind me you can see the interface is
extremely easy to use I mean it's
absolutely amazing really and then again
there's a auction house over here this
is in green Mont the main city I think
the only big city you just click on that
and you could auction try different
things with that basically the only
thing it doesn't have it what whorecraft
does have and this is order and chaos by
the way is it doesn't have gigantic
dungeons it doesn't have as many
character classes it costs currently
three dollars for a six-month
subscription and then 99 cents every
month thereafter so if you were looking
for Walter Warcraft on an iPad as
absolutely amazing as it is that it
actually exists and it's such an amazing
price point ordering chaos is for you
