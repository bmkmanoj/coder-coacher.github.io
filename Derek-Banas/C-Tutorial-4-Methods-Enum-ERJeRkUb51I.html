4 of my c-sharp video tutorial in this
part of the tutorial we're going to
focus completely in on methods or
functions or whatever the cool kids are
calling them we're going to talk about
pass by value versus pass by reference
we're going to talk about out params
named parameters method overloading enum
and a whole bunch more and like always
all of the code as well as a transcript
of this video is available in the
description underneath this video and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so here we are in Visual Studio or
if you are on a Macintosh you were using
as Maron okay the very first thing I'm
going to talk about here is well the
difference between pass by value versus
pass by reference now by default values
are going to be passed into a method or
function same type thing and not a
reference to the variable itself that is
the default way of dealing with passing
values and two methods and the change of
what that means is the changes made to
those values inside of the methods are
not going to affect variables outside of
the method so let's come in here and
look at an example because that will
make a lot more sense I'm going to
create a method here and it is going to
return a double and it is going to be
called get sum and it is going to be
receiving a double which I'm going to
call X it's also important to note here
that you can put in and where a sign of
value to a parameter directly inside of
there so that if nothing is passed
everything will be okay and I'm just
going to put one inside of both of those
guys and then what is going to do I'm
going to do a little bit of some crazy
stuff here I'm going to create a
temporary variable and assign its value
of whatever X is I am then going to get
X and assign the value of Y to it and
then I'm going to take Y and assign the
value of temp so what I did was I switch
the values of x and y passed inside of
there now the only reason I'm going to
do that is because I want to show that
the values of x and y are not going to
change even though I tried to change
them in the method here and then
amen and just go return X plus y all
right so now we're going to come up here
inside of Maine and use this method so
we're going to create a double up inside
of here of course and I'm going to give
it exactly the same name not that that's
going to matter but I'm going to give it
that name and I'm also going to go Y is
equal to four and then I'm going to come
in here and I am going to output the
information on the screen that I get
from my method so I'm going to go five
four is equal to and go and get that
value so I'll call get sum and then I am
going to pass in x and y like that now
to show that the values indeed did not
change I am then going to come in here
and once again go to console and write
the new values for X and y or whatever
the current values of x and y to show
that by default everything is pass by
value and then I can just put X to the
side up here and if we run this you're
going to see that it went in there and
it added those together came back with
the value of nine however the value for
x is still five and why is that well
it's quite simple everything by default
is passed by value I'm going to show you
the difference in regards to pass by
value and pass by reference but first I
want to talk about the out parameter now
you are going to be able to pass a
variable as an output variable even
without assigning a value to it so let's
say we have something like solution all
right so there's no value assigned to
that and what is going to make this an
out parameter is the fact that we will
be able to pass a parameter using out
and it is going to actually have its
value assigned inside of the method
without throwing an error so we're going
to say let's say we want to create a
method called doublet and we're going to
pass in the value that we want to double
and then we are going to store this
value inside of this variable this int
right here called solution and then of
course we can come in here
and output the new value for this so we
will say 15 times 2 is equal to and then
throw a solution inside here and as you
can see there's errors popping up
because it doesn't know what's going on
so now what we're going to do is come
down here and utilize this out parameter
and whenever you're defining your method
just make sure that you use out inside
of the parameter area so here is double
its and like you saw it's go and receive
an integer and then it is going to
assign a value to solution which is back
inside of there so this would be an
example of how we can manipulate a
variable outside of a method and if we
run this guy you're going to see that
indeed 15 times 2 is equal to 30 of
course but more importantly all of the
errors went away so that is one way that
we can come in here and actually work
with values that are outside of the
method itself and also define the value
for a variable inside of a method itself
but now what I want to do is actually
show you pass by reference and how we
can change values inside the method and
have them affect the local variable that
is outside of that method now if you
want to come in here and receive a
variable by reference create in another
method here what I'm going to do is go
and create something called swap it's
going to receive you can see right there
I'm saying that I'm expecting a
reference to the actual variable right
there and once again reference in num2
and then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to do exactly what I did before
I'm going to go and create a temp it's
going to hold the value of num1 I'm then
going to go and get num1 and assign it
the value of num - and then num2 is
going to receive the value that was
originally stored in temp
so it's in essence just switching those
around ok pretty simple stuff now inside
of main I'm going to call this guy so
I'm going to go and create num1 and give
it a value of 10 just
for the heck of it and num2 is equal to
let's say 20 and then come in here and
call this for it to run and I'm going to
say B for swap and I'll get num1 and i'm
going to put the value inside of there
and then I'll also go num2 and put its
value inside of there and num1 and num2
and then I'm going to actually call the
function that is going to perform the
swap and this will just be swap and here
I'm defining I'm passing by reference so
I can expect to change the values for
those guys and num2 and then after the
swap function is called
I am going to say I'm just going to go
after swap and if we run that you're
going to see before swap was called the
value for num1 was 10 and afterwards it
was 20 and likewise for num2 so you
could see that we were able to pass by
reference there adjust by going in and
saying the reference right here for that
variable as well as reference right
there so pretty simple stuff and that is
an example of pass by reference versus
pass by value and now I want to talk
about params now you're going to be able
to pass a variable a variable a variable
meaning numerous different types or
different amounts of data of the same
data type into a method using params
and also you'd be able to pass in an
array itself so what I'm going to do
here is I want to well let's come down
here and actually create the function
first because that makes sense so we'll
go static and it's going to receive a or
return a double and I'm going to call
this get some more Animus a put params
inside of here you'd actually be able to
receive the params array but also
receive other parameters but the params
parts or params parameter must come last
all right so that's just important to
know because otherwise it wouldn't know
when the list ended and you can go in on
your own and do that and see how that
works so what we're going to do here is
I'm going to create a double called sum
and give it a value of 0
then I'm going to use my for each
function in I in norms and then I'm
going to come in here and just add in
each value from the parameters array
that was passed inside of here and once
again this is exactly the same as if we
would go sum is equal to sum plus I all
right same exact thing just a shortcut
function and after that is all done of
course we're going to come in and go and
return these sum so what this is going
to do is receive a variable number of
parameters and add them up and return it
okay simple stuff and we will come in
here and we will go and pass in a
variable number all variables and so we
go two and three is equal to and get the
return value from that and then go get
some more and of course that's in one
two and three inside of that guy and if
we run it you're going to see that it
indeed works one plus two plus three is
equal to six last time I checked that
was true and indeed we were able to pass
in a variable number of values and work
with them in our method and moving right
along now I'm going to talk about named
parameters so let's say that we have a
function or main method and it is called
print info and it receives a string and
it receives a name and it also receives
a zip code
all right so pretty boring so far now
what it does is it comes in here and it
prints out all of this information on
our screen so we'll say something like
blank which is going to be the name
lives in the zip code and then go and
get the zip code and of course it name
and we will get zip code and we will put
those inside of there now let's say that
up here inside of main you for some
reason want to pass in zip code and then
name can you do that yes you can if you
use name parameters so how that's going
to work is we will go print info and we
will go zip code like this and actually
put in the variable name followed by
five one four seven and then put the
name inside of here and then inside of
there we will put a random name and
you're going to see that yes indeed
you're able to do that so let's run that
as long as you define as the name and
the other different variable types
inside of there you're able to send them
in in any different order okay so just a
brief explanation of name parameters and
how they work now let's look at
something a little bit more interesting
which is method overloading alright so
again I'm going to use get some here and
it's going to receive two doubles and
it's in return the sum of those you can
pause the screen if you want to type
that in and what I'm going to do here is
jump up inside of here and actually go
and call this so I'm going to go and do
right line and we're going to save five
plus four is equal to and put in
whatever the value is well actually
let's go 5.0 and 4.5 like that alright
and then we're going to pass in those
values in to get some and get a result
from it so we'll go 5.0 and 4.5 and if
we run this you're going to see it has
no problem adding those ideas together
so let's come in here and let's change
this a little bit let's go and copy this
and let's change this to five and change
this to four five and four and run it
again and you can see indeed no problem
there either
what however would occur if instead of
passing in either doubles or integers we
instead passed in a string
representation for five and four well as
you can see right here is going to say
that you cannot convert from string to
double well that's a problem
the nice thing however is that we will
be able to come down here and actually
recreate this using the same exact name
so we're going to keep this get some but
we are going to change this into string
and we're going to change this industry
and what that's going to allow us to do
is then here just use convert again I'm
going to go and define a double call it
double X is equal to I'm going to call
convert two
double and throw X inside of there and
then likewise I'm going to do exactly
the same thing for y changes to Y and
change this to Y and we can go and
change these default values right here
to strings as well and then just change
this to double X and then change this to
double Y and even though the name of the
function is exactly the same because of
method overloading we are going to have
no problem calling the right method and
as you can see we run it you can see
five plus four is equal to nine comes
back perfectly fun and the only thing to
pay attention to here is that if you are
going to overload a method that the
parameters must change in one way or
another so if see here we have double
double and here we have string string
that's perfectly fine we could have one
of these be a double and one of them be
a string and it would still be allowed
so the parameter values must change in
some way and no just changing the return
value is not going to allow for method
overloading so there's an example of
method overloading which is extremely
valuable and now finally I'm going to
take a look at in ohms because I have a
little bit more time now an enum is
going to act as a custom data type with
key value pairs and they are going to
allow you to use symbolic names to
represent data rather than just using
numbers and things like that they don't
that fun so let's say we want to create
something that is going to represent a
car color which is going to be a custom
data type we would like to use and let's
say that we want to define this is a
byte that is how the index or the key
for each piece of this custom data type
is going to be represented if you do not
put this here it is going to use an int
but since we know we're using a very
limited number of values we're going to
make it a bite just to save some memory
then what we can do is we can define all
our colors and we could by default this
is going to assign a value of zero to
this but let's say we want it to be one
we are then going to find blue and blue
is going to get the index value of two
and so forth and so on and we'll throw
green inside of here and we will read
inside of here and we will throw yellow
in all right so those are going to make
up our custom car color data type what
we are then also going to do is we're
going to create a method that is going
to work with this enum and I'm going to
call it pink car it is going to receive
our car color data type I'm going to
call it CC and then it is going to write
out some information about our cars so
it's going to get passed this and then
it's going to come in and say the car
was painted and it's going to output
with the code I'm going to output both
the color of the car was painted as well
as the code or in this situation the
index for that guy so then we can come
down here and just get CC and then we
can also go and cast this into an
integer so that we can see what that is
all right so there's that now let's jump
up into main and it's very important
that the enum is defined in the class
not inside of main otherwise you'll get
an error now what we'll do is we will
define car color and let's just call
this car one equal to and how we would
assign this value is to go car color
blue and then you will see that if we
call paint car and pass in car one that
it is automatically going to go in there
and paint our car using our custom data
type and you can see right there the car
was painted blue with the code - all
right so I'm going to get more into
enums later on in some real-world
examples but that was a lot of
information on methods as well as enum
and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
