15 of my java algorithms and data
structures tutorial today I'm going to
do something that I think is extremely
important I'm going to show you how to
solve programming problems and these are
going to be your programming problems
this isn't going to be a programming
problem that's already been solved this
is going to be something that's custom
something that you need and I'm very
specifically going to be answering a
question in this tutorial that I've
received many times over the past couple
weeks and that question was how to print
a tree structure on a console so in
essence if we have an array and we want
to print out a tree structure like you
see here not with the lines and so forth
but just dashes and in a number and then
dashes and another number and another
number and so forth and so on how
exactly do we do this in solving this
problem in this tutorial I'm going to
act like I don't know that much about
programming I'm going to go out of my
way to try to approach this as a person
that has a limited understanding of
programming so that we can teach a
subject that I think is extremely
important which is to teach how to solve
any problem not just how to solve one
specific problem so let's get into it
okay so if we want to actually come in
here and figure out how we're going to
draw a tree on the screen let's say we
want to go through an example here of a
four row tree now how exactly are we
going to print this tree out well
there's going to be a certain number of
spaces so what we're going to do just to
keep everything simple here is to figure
out exactly how many indexes we're going
to have so we know that a tree structure
is going to have one at the top and then
it's going to have two afterwards and
then it's going to have four after that
and finally it's going to have eight so
let's go out here and actually model
that structure so I'm just going to act
like we have one digit I'm actually
going to present this in a couple
different ways and I have nothing
planned so see where this takes us but I
guarantee I won't upload this and as it
works okay so here we go we have eight
that has been structured and now we know
we need to structure for four and we
also know that the last row only has one
space or at least that's what we think
so then we want to continue building our
tree here and we're going to have to put
the number of spaces here and that's
going to be three one two three and
another
one one two three and another one and
everything looks like it's coming out
the way that we want it to then we need
to come in here and throw in our row
that's going to represent the two that
we know is going to go inside of there
and then finally we're gonna have a
whole bunch of spaces and we're gonna
try to put that right there
okay so now that we have that built and
we know that this looks like a tree and
this is pretty much what we want to do
we can get rid of that now let's sit
here and let's actually look at what we
need to build well we know from looking
at this that the first row is going to
have an indent and that indent is going
to be seven spaces long because that's
what that is if you can't see this you
can view it fullscreen it is a 1080p
video well then spaces well we know that
the indent here is going to be different
from the spaces however the spaces look
like they are all going to be equal to
each other so that makes sense that we
have both an indent as well as a spaces
that we're going to be tracking when the
first row we know that there's zero
spaces because there's only one number
so now let's move on to our second row
and what does that tell us well in this
situation we see in debt again and there
is going to be three for an indent and
then we look at spaces and we see that
there are spaces and there are going to
be seven spaces based off of what we're
looking so there we go
then we go on to our third row and again
we're going to have an indent and that
of course is going to be one because
that's the money we got and then we're
going to have spaces and that's going to
be equal to three because that's what we
have there and that brings us to our
final fourth row which is going to have
an indent of 0 and spaces are going to
be equal to 1 all right so we know that
this is what we want a model but exactly
how are we going to model it that is the
problem well if we think about this
let's just come in here and move that up
we know that we want to calculate indent
but we don't necessarily know what it is
and in this situation I'm going to act
like I have no idea how to do math so we
need to figure out a way to calculate 7
then 3 then 1 then 0 how do we do that
well in this situation I'm actually
going to cheat let's come into Wolfram
Alpha and there it is Wolfram Alpha
right there and there we go we just
pumped in our numbers 7 3 1 and 0 we're
going to hit equals and this is going to
provide us with our algorithm that we
need to solve all right and we scroll
down
here and we can see that here it is this
is our answer this is the guy that's
going to provide us with all the numbers
we need for our indent that's going to
be negative two to the power of negative
n negative 16 plus two to the power of n
that is the guy we need so now let's
jump back over and let's calculate that
out so it's going to be negative two
through the power of n multiplied times
negative 16 plus 2 to the power of n and
from looking at this and in this
situation is going to be represented by
one as we are generating these in dents
so that tells us also we are going to
need an iterator to pump out all the
different versions of indent and it's
going to start at 1 and it also is going
to go for as long as there are rows so
I'm just going to type in go till no
more rows and there we go
so now we know we have indent in our
code we're going to need it we know how
to calculate it as well and we also know
that we're going to need an iterator of
some sort that's going to start at 1 and
it's going to go as long as there are
rows to keep generating indents for so
that leads us to spaces how are we going
to calculate that well the cool thing
about generating trees is what was once
the indent then becomes the space and so
forth and so on
so that means for our spaces they're
going to start off as 0 and then
whatever indent was the previous time
that we cycle through and generated this
tree so now we have three things that we
know we have to create here so now let's
go on here and start thinking about some
of the other things well we're also
going to need to know what index to
print so this is going to be 0 this is
going to be 1 this is going to be 2 3 4
5 6 &amp;amp; 7
those are the indexes that are going to
start off this guy so to figure out
first index per row let's just go
through and think about that for a
second it's going to be 0 and then it's
going to be 1 2 3 4 5 &amp;amp; 6 7 8 9
10 11 12 13 and 14 and those are going
to be all our indexes and then look at
this what's so cool 0 1 3 7 and if we
come up here you're going to see 0 1 3 &amp;amp;
7 is right there then if we bounce over
into Wolfram Alpha again in this
situation we're going to go 0 1 3 &amp;amp; 7 &amp;amp;
calculate that and generate ourselves
another algorithm we're going to be able
to use to generate whatever the first
index is and this guy is the algorithm
that we want so it's going to be 1/2
times negative 2 plus 2 to the nth power
let's jump back over here and put 0.5 or
1/2 times negative 2 plus and just to
keep our head straight we're going to
type in the Java code for generating the
power of this number and we'll type in 2
and in this situation we're also going
to use the iterator the iterator is this
guy up here need an iterator this is
actually going to be iterator and right
here as well okay so now we got a whole
bunch more of these guys so what is
going to be our number of items per Oh
something else we're going to need to
calculate well if we look at this again
you're gonna see 1 2 4 &amp;amp; 8
so number of items per row and that's
gonna be one two four and eight doubles
every single time well I'm gonna be lazy
again I'm just gonna copy this jump over
into Wolfram Alpha I know this isn't an
advertisement for Wolfram Alpha just
using it to do quick math alright so now
we type that in there rather than
thinking too much scroll down here and
it's two to the N minus one that is how
we're going to calculate that so we're
just going to go math power of two
iterator again minus one and we're able
to figure that one out as well and the
only other thing I can think of that
we're going to need is the maximum index
per row that we're going to print max
index per row and that's going to be a
very easy calculation that's just going
to be index to print first plus items
per row and as you can see this is
slowly starting to look like code but in
general that's all that I'm doing so
that's how we're going to generate that
well now that we have
our numbers together let's think about
what we're going to do well let's
actually come up here right inside of
here
when essence we're going to go indent
and then we're going to go number this
is going to be the process of printing
all this stuff out again we're going to
go indent and number and then we're
going to have a space and we're going to
have another number just copy this so I
don't have to type it out again and then
on the third row we're going to go
indent number space number space number
space number so that's one two three
four numbers and there's one two three
spaces so what this tells me is I need
one indent followed by multiple numbers
and spaces every single time that I
create this now based off of all the
things that we just did here I pretty
much have everything I need to actually
write this code so let's just copy it
and let's jump over and let's write some
okay this is actually going to be the
last part of the algorithms tutorial I
just decided to do this on a whim so I
have some of this stuff here but in
essence all this is doing is it's
generating an array that I am then going
to print out on the screen as a tree
that's all we're going to do so that
brings us to this point right here so
this is print tree please bear with me
I'm doing a lot of this out of my head
so there we go I put in everything that
we're gonna need here actually I don't
need all this now I'll leave that there
and this is going to help me write all
my code so what's some of the things
that I'm going to need in regards to
print in this tree well I can only
really think of anything the only thing
is going to change is the number of rows
that are going to need to be printed out
so let's continue on alright so
something that I'm going to need first
off that's not going to change at least
in the very beginning is spaces so I
want to create spaces and give it the
value of zero and we know that the value
of spaces is going to be equal to
whatever indent was from that day
forward so we can just leave it the way
that it is then I also know that I'm
going to need an iterator and it's going
to have to start out with the value of
one and why do I know that because need
an iterator that starts at one and
that's going to be used in the place of
n here and then to calculate multiple
other different things like here and so
forth and so on so there's my iterator
then what do I need to do well I
to keep printing things out as long as I
have rose so that tells me that I need a
while loop see I used while in defining
what I was trying to do and this is
iterate or not iteration and I'm going
to continue printing stuff out on the
screen as long as my iterator is less
than my number of rows now inside of my
while loop what do I need to do well one
thing I need to do is calculate what
indent is going to be equal to so put
that in there and I can get rid of some
of this stuff well here is the
calculation for indent right there so to
calculate on my own
I know that I'm going to need to convert
this into an integer and I'm also going
to put absolute value in this situation
then I'm going to go math power negative
- I'm actually going to do a negative
iterator actually I prefer calling this
iteration it just makes more sense to me
so I'm going to change it this way
so negative iteration multiplied times
negative 16 plus and all this stuff I'm
doing here is coming from right there of
course then I'm going to go math ^ -
iteration get rid of that and a
semicolon
and there you go did it right so now
we're calculating our indent every time
well then the next thing we need to do
is index to print first and to get that
guy that is actually going to be this
guy right here so let's just cut it and
throw it up here so that we can work off
of it convert this into an integer and
then we're going to do 1/2 times
negative 2 + power of 2 iteration and
there we go now I know what the first
index to print is going to be then I
have my items per row and I can get rid
of this number of items per row that's
gonna be this guy right here int just
call this items per row which is exactly
what it is throw that right in there if
they call this an int and I'm gonna call
this iteration again so as you can see
I'm basically just turning the words
into code here then I need to calculate
my maximum index to print and if we come
down here you can see indexed print
items for rows bring it back up here
it's kind of what I did is that right
items for row and there we go maximum
index to print per row well then what do
I need to do well I need to print indent
once every single row and then print a
whole bunch of numbers and spaces so
that tells me I need
to create a for loop and I'm just going
to call this int J is equal to zero J
less than whatever the indent is J plus
plus and I'm just going to use this to
print a whole bunch of spaces all right
well now that I have that in there I
also know that I have to print different
numbers of numbers and spaces depending
upon how many rows or how many different
things I want to do so how am I going to
describe this well I want to go from my
index to print first that's going to be
the first index per row and then I'm
going to continue printing as long as L
is less than max index to print or the
maximum index to print per row and then
I'm going to increment that now from
this point I want to then print a number
out on the screen heap l and that is
going to be the key that's that's what's
going to get printed out on the screen
and then after that I need to print a
certain number of spaces on the screen
so throw that in there and I'm just
going to change this to K and this decay
and this decay and this is going to be
spaces that I want to print out on the
screen and then what do we know from
looking at all this stuff well space is
is going to start off at zero and then
it's going to become whatever indent was
so after I'm all done printing out a
whole entire row I want to say hey
spaces you're now equal to whatever
indent was equal to previously and
iteration I'm going to increment you and
then because it's the end of the row I
want to put a new line so there we go
that is basically turning all those
words into actual code
so I'd optimize but we'll get to that in
a second so if we file save that let's
come in here and give it a test drive so
here we are down in main and don't worry
too much about what he means at this
point like I said I'm gonna do it cover
it in the last part of the tutorial
series just an array that's gonna get
printed out on the screen as a tree
that's all you need to know all right so
let's say we want this to be 15 spaces
and I can just go new he generate filled
array it's just gonna fill my array up
with numbers don't worry about all that
cover it in the next part of the
tutorial and that there is gonna just
generate everything and throw it in door
door not that necessarily needs to be
okay so now that we have all that setup
let's go and actually print this guy out
so I'm gonna go new
dot and will come in here and test out
print our tree and we know that we have
four rows inside of it let's file save
it see what happens and there you can
see is our tree and it's all printed out
nice and beautiful exactly like we want
it now there's only one problem with
this what happens if we change this to
number of rows three file save and
execute well that prints out all nice
and dandy but what if we go in here and
try to change it to five or something
the I guarantee there's there we go all
kinds of errors so what would we do if
we wanted to generate the ability to be
able to print out both two-digit numbers
and not be stuck with just one digit
number but also we wanted to be able to
print pretty much any type of tree we
could possibly imagine well tune into
the next part of the video tutorial and
you'll get your answer please leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
