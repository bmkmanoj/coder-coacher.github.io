random live stream Friday uh as you can
tell the you guys asked me to eat this
stuff and I thought what the heck this
is a completely random thing believe me
I'm not going to start eating things all
the time this is the beyond burger this
is a I guess they're calling it
lab-grown meat um it is plant-based and
it is as you can see no soy know
whatever um this is what it looks like
whenever it's out of the package or
whatever not cooked there it is it sorta
looks like like dog food or my wife said
cat food my wife said actually when she
cooked at it she thought it tasted it
smelled like cat food I haven't eaten
this before um it is made of P protein
isolate expeller pressed canola oil
refined coconut oil water yeast extra
maltodextrin natural flavorings a whole
bunch of random chemicals and and you
know that's what we got here I'm gonna
eat this there's a me what that is I
just fell out of the package something
Korean fell into the package so my wife
is cooking it and I thought I'd show you
let's see here this is from their
website so they're comparing it from to
regular beef so you got it on the left
you got the beyond burger which is this
thing and you got the regular beef on
the right and there's more protein
there's more iron there is a little less
saturated fat there is no cholesterol
there's about the same amount of fat
there's more calories and they're saying
that positives plant-based
antibiotic-free hormone-free GMO free
soy free gluten free and we're gonna
find out if its taste free
and so it's not particularly healthy
it's just not beef so it's you know
that's just I'm looking when I look this
way I'm looking at your comments this is
a live stream and I do live streams
every monday tuesday thursday and friday
so so basically they're saying that the
reason you should eat it is it's going
to improve your health i guess the
reason why they're saying it's going to
reprove your hook i'm gonna turn that
off whoops you know what i've been
talking look at it there it is there
will be technical difficulties okay so
this is all the stuff that I was saying
that it's plant-based antibiotic-free
hormone free all that stuff so that's
the burger beyond burger versus regular
beef burger and here is the other stuff
I was talking about basically they're
saying it will improve your health has a
positive impact on the climate and you
know they talk about how cows they
haven't you know methane and they eat
all kinds of things and and there's a
lot of other information so there's just
a bunch of random reasons why people
would want to eat this so and I'm gonna
eat it and I'm gonna tell you if I think
it's any good or not so let's go back
over to this and I thought something
else it would be fun while it my wife's
actually I my wife normally doesn't cook
so but she's making it I thought
something would be fun to do would be to
do a live recipe this is me just totally
goofing off just doing crazy stuff so I
thought what would we go better with a
burger like burger stuff uh then a
McDonald's secret sauce so I found a
recipe for it what I have in here this
is like this is like me going crazy
basically I have in here um 1 teaspoon
of sugar one eighth of a teaspoon of
salt and I have a tablespoon of minced
white onion and into that this is
actually the first time I've ever eaten
this vegan mega I got vegan Mayo
I'm going to try this also for the first
time as you can see I sort of tasted it
just like mayonnaise as far as I can
tell I don't know tasted fine so I
thought what the heck let's make that so
let's go and get a half a cup of vegan
Mayo so this is supposedly the the
secret sauce recipe for McDonald's and I
think they officially gave it away they
don't care it McDonald's they just say
here here's our proprietary stuff
there's that so it's throw half a cup of
mayonnaise in there I'm sure vegan meal
tastes exactly the same as any other
mayonnaise and what do we add to that we
had two tablespoons of French dressing
oops i get rid of that like i said this
i'm using multiple cameras multiple
lighting like this is insane um two
tablespoons of french dressing let's
just get that throw that in there
there's another one throw that and
they're doing this on my desk is really
kind of insane and what else can we do
um its weight onion oh 4 tablespoons of
relish so I got relish here there's
relish and it has to be sweet relish so
that seems like had an excessive amount
of relish doesn't it I mean that's a lot
of relish 4 tablespoons I got the recipe
right I'm positive I checked it multiple
times so there's that I haven't looked
good yeah the structure of the vegan
mayonnaise is a little bit weird yes
this is the big mac sauce so I don't
need that anymore so just put that to
the side I have to actually work on his
desk that's a good thing I was going to
actually cook the burger in his but I
decided against that mmm and 1 teaspoon
of white vinegar let's just regular old
white vinegar
so let's put that in there this is
really an amalgamation of crazy stuff so
there's that in there okay so we got
that and then we mix it I guess and this
is how this is the sauce that made
McDonald's famous I guess I haven't
eaten I can tell you this Oreo when I
ate at McDonalds last time I'd never
really liked me so I'm really wondering
with this stuff suddenly taste like
there you go McDonald secret sauce I
never really liked me I grew up on a
farm and eaten the animals sort of
seemed weird to me what's it taste like
actually tastes kind of good I've never
eaten French dressing I've never had
vegan Mayo this is a first in many ways
for me this is a sus invented cancer
somebody ruined No ok so basically i got
my secret sauce here I'm ready for my
burger um let's go and whoops let's get
rid of that there's Coke Zero so you
know I'm really holding out for a
coca-cola sponsorship I don't know when
they're gonna get on board so I figured
since I'm eating absolute garbage i
might as well just well I'm not saying
the coke zero is not garbage that's the
only good thing i'm eating here cook
cereal is fantastic wow I just nectar of
the gods right there last time I ate a
McDonald's hamburger on my 21st birthday
people there it is there it is thank you
look it's here I got french fries I got
ketchup I am eating like a king tonight
whoa because my mom if I just spell pop
everywhere so so this won't be tainted
in any way I normally always i love
veggie burgers but this is not a veggie
burger at least I've been told
well I mean technically is it's a veggie
burger but ok so i got my cook zero and
I got there's this I got french fries
look at that I don't ever eat like this
and there is the burger after it's been
cooked so man my wife says smells like
cat food I don't really smell cafe that
much though I don't know it's sort of
distaste sort of smells all right I
don't know let's see what it tastes like
I'm just pulling up its very own if you
can see the texture of it the camera is
actually pretty good see there's the
texture I don't know hmm I don't eat me
so I don't know that it tastes like meat
it doesn't really quite tastes like a
veggie burger though there's like more
to it like the texture i think i'm
guessing taste more like the texture of
ground beef I mean you saw oops let me
get this out of here so you know that's
why it looks like that's what the burger
looks like whenever it's not cooked so
it looks sort of like ground beef um but
and I think it's sort of tastes like
ground beef so I sorry about that
technical difficulties so I'm going to
get my special sauce put that on air
smooth at around and im gonna taste it
and see what this tastes like and they
already taste it without the special
sauce let's just put that to the side
and putting it on white bread so you
know there's no nutritional value at all
in anything a meeting here um my guess
this is a tomatoes and potatoes good
stuff okay
what's there I'm gonna eat it I think
it's gonna taste fun hmm if I'd my
option between this and a regular veggie
burger I think it's um I think it's
pretty good it's like I said I keep
smelling it as it pulls off when it's
cooking it smells a little bit weird it
smells there's like I'm almost like a
little bit of a chemical he smell to it
when it's cooking in the pan you don't
need oil for this thing it has a fat up
in it so you just stick it in there you
cook it three minutes on one side flip
it three minutes on the other side done
but I think technically yeah it's pretty
good I don't know I'd give it a thumbs
up I mean I didn't expect it to be good
but I think it doesn't quite tastes like
a veggie burger like veggie burger you
know you're eating something I think
that this is probably very close to
ground beef if people have said that eat
ground beef all the time let it tastes
just like it obviously I'm not sponsored
by this anybody here except coca-cola
totally game with that ah so I don't
know you guys asked me to do to eat this
and I tried it the mcdonald specials
it's overpowering the mcdonald special
sauce the taste of this which is kind of
weird which is I didn't expect that but
I think it's pretty good hum that that
that that so this is random lime street
friday it's just random crazy things
that i just thought i would too just for
the heck of it ah i give the beyond
burger a thumbs up and I'm gonna
continue just doing crazy things on
Friday on live streams just I think it's
fun some mix it up by channel do
something yes people did ask me to eat
this I'm reading the comments
and I'm gonna do things like random
games and other just completely random
crazy things on Friday just thought
would be a fun way to mix things up and
do different things with my channel and
interact with people and so forth and so
on Ben either way I thought it was fun
so just like always guys please leave
your questions and your comments below
and otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
