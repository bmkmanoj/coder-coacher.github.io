one of my co-op video tutorial you guys
told me you wanted to see a c-sharp
Samarin and game tutorial series and
this is where it's going to begin in
this part of the tutorial will provide
an introduction so that you will know
how to install c-sharp on windows of
course as well as on Mac OS and I'll
also cover a lot of basics like
input/output data type strings functions
looping and a whole bunch more like
always all the code is available in a
description underneath of the video and
I have a lot to do so let's get into it
alright so I'm mainly going to be
developing on Windows but I didn't want
to leave the Macintosh people behind so
if you want to do absolutely everything
I'm doing here instead of the
downloading Visual Studio which is what
we're going to do on windows instead
you're going to download as a Maron at
Samarin comm download and all you do is
type in your name and your email address
and a company agree to the terms click
on download it installs and everything's
great once you install it this is what
you're going to see and if you want to
create a new project just go up here to
file click on new solution this is on
Mac OS but like I said I'm going to be
developing almost everything in these
tutorials using Windows doesn't matter
everything's exactly the same then
you're going to click on dotnet and for
now console project and then click on
next I'm going to call this sample app
and I'm going to click on create and
just to show you that everything is
going to work here is everything right
here and if you want to run this guy
just come up here click on that guy
right there for the play and you can see
that the console opens and runs alright
so there you go Mac users that's what
you're going to do now onto the windows
users now on windows I am going to be
using visual studio comm and I'm
specifically going to use Visual Studio
2017 which is the release candidate and
I trust you'll be able to download this
just click on free download install it
and it will be ready to go and now I'm
going to jump over and start writing a
whole bunch of code alright so here we
are in Windows specifically Windows 10
and if you want to create a new project
just so you know you're going to come
over here click on file you're going to
say new project like that and it's going
to open up once again to start off
we are going to have visual c-sharp
right here like that and we are going to
click on console application and you're
going to give it a name and I'm going to
call this guy c-sharp
Tut like that that is going to be the
name for it and I'm going to click on OK
and create everything alright so after
you do that this is what you're going to
be presented with a whole bunch of
different things these are going to be a
whole bunch of different libraries that
are going to provide objects and
different functions with it we will be
able to use they're very useful and this
is what will open up by whenever you
create a new project now up here where
we see a name space you're going to use
name spaces to define globally unique
objects so that way if you combine your
code with other people's code and the
names are exactly the same you're going
to be able to use this as a way of
making your code unique class program is
the default name that we have here for
this guy and like always a class is just
going to define the variables and
methods used by objects and I'm going to
get much more into classes and objects
in a later part of the tutorial series
right here you see the main function
which is going to be where all the
execution begins whatever code is inside
of these two curly brackets is where
everything is going to start off
executing specifically static right here
means that this function is going to
belong to the class and can be executed
without needing to create an object
don't worry if you don't know anything
about objects I'm going to get into them
heavily void just means that this
function doesn't return a value after it
executes but it is very common to
instead of having void here have int
inside of there and in that situation it
would return an integer whenever this
function is done executing that integer
value would normally be a zero whenever
the function successfully execute or
negative one whenever then error of some
sort of curs but we're going to keep
this as void and once again just means
doesn't return anything and the main
function here also as you're going to
see is able to receive multiple values
that will be stored in a string array
and an array is just a whole bunch of
boxes that contain values what we're
going to do here
first is just a standard whole hello
world just to make sure that everything
is working so I am going to go
console.writeline and if we would use
right it would not put a new line at the
end if we put a right line it will put a
new line at the end so let's just come
in here and we'll demonstrate exactly
how that works right like that
and you save it and you click on starts
and it executes and like I said Mac OS
users are going to be able to
automatically do all the same things but
what did we see there it opened up but
then it closed
well a trick to keep the console open
after whatever code we have inside here
execute is to come in here and ask for
input of some types and the input we're
going to ask for is just whatever it's
just going to be a return key and to do
that we're going to put read line inside
of there and save it and start it and
now whenever the console opens it will
not close until I hit return and you can
see right there it says hello world all
right so we can hit return it received
input right here into this guy right
here and it closed the application we're
going to actually get real input here in
a moment though so that you'll get to
see how we can input information and
then work with it now like I said right
here
the main function is going to be able to
receive a certain number of arguments
that are going to be passed to it and if
you want to simulate passing
command-line arguments into Visual
Studio what you're going to want to do
is over here in the solution Explorer
that is what this guy is called what
we're going to do is we're going to
right click on this and then we're going
to come down here and select properties
this guy's going to open up right here
and right here where we have debug we're
going to put a couple values so I just
put one with a space two with a space
three with the space and four all right
so that's all we're going to need to do
and we can keep that open we can save it
do whatever jump back over inside of
here and if you're wondering how to pass
those properties in twos Merricks
also what you're going to do is go over
here and right click on this come down
here to options and then inside up here
click on default and then type in these
same arguments right there and click on
OK and just a test that that works we
can go in here create a for loop that's
going to run through every single one of
those passed in and print them out click
on this guy and you can see it printed
one two three all right back over into
Windows demonstrate some more stuff
alright so I'm going to go in here and
do exactly the same thing and what we're
going to do is we're going to loop
through those arguments and I'm going to
explain what's going on so I'm going to
first off create a variable that is
going to increase in value each time and
incremented value and it's going to be
an integer and I'm going to continue
incrementing as long as the value of I
is less than the total number of
arguments that are in our array and
that's how we get that we use the length
field to get that information and then
remember we have to increment now I plus
plus is exactly the same as if I would
go I is equal to I plus 1 all right it's
just a shortcut way to do exactly the
same thing once again we're going to
come in here and we're going to go
console.writeline and remember right
would not have a new line and let's go
and do something a little bit better
here what we're going to do is we want
to actually print out the specific what
it's called index for the array item and
we're going to go and print those out as
we print out the values stored inside of
them now arrays are going to assign
values that are called indexes and that
is how we're going to be able to get the
value stored inside of each of the boxes
inside of our array and the very first
index or address for the value in our
array is by default NC sharp is going to
start at 0 so what I want to do is I
want to come in here and not only get
that value but I also want to go and
print out the value associated with that
index this is going to be the first
value that's going to be transported
into this final string and a string is
just a series of characters so if I want
to get the value of I I get I right
there and if I want to get whatever is
stored inside of the arguments array I
just go like that
then what I'm going to do is whenever
this runs it's going to take I right
here and put it right there inside the
string and where it has one it's going
to take this and put that right there so
if we save this and run it you're going
to see it does exactly that
see argument one two and three and it
prints out the values that are going to
be stored inside of that guy but it's
missing one of those values and that's
because I had this sign 2 1 instead of 0
so let's run again and you're going to
see how the indexes work out and how the
values associated with those indexes in
the array work out and print our
information all right so there we are
now we know how to use a for loop inside
of c-sharp if you are wondering if
there's other ways to get the array
front in regards to the command-line
arguments that are passed in we can
actually create our own string array and
we just do it like that and the little
brackets that I mean it's an array
instead of just a simple one string so
I'm going to call this my args and
you're probably never going to do this
but I thought I'd cover it just to be
covering everything and what you're
going to do is go command line org and
this is a capital G band line args and
this is a method that will actually pass
those values back to us now let's say I
wanted to print out all of those
arguments onto the screen as just one
big giant string I could go right on and
I'm going to use a function called joint
string dot join and I'm going to join
every single value inside of that array
together and I want each of them to be
separated with a comma and a space and
then the array that I want to use here
to output this information is my
arguments which is this guy right here
and we can run that to see if that
worked out for us and you can see that
yes indeed it did however what it also
does is it prints out the location for
your actual executable file and the
benefit of that is now you know on your
specific computer where the executable
is for your application that you are
making inside of c-sharp so kind of
useful information nonetheless so now
what I'd like to do is cover functions
and functions just allow us
to take our code and break it up into
smaller and smaller pieces because you
don't want a hundred lines of code that
you can't read you want to try to keep
it to about ten lines of code per
function and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a function that is going
to be called say hello and it's going to
receive input and then send a message to
the user so I'm going to get outside of
my main function and create a new
function and I'm going to have this be
private and I want this to be void it's
not going to return anything static of
course means that it belongs to our
class it's not going to receive any
arguments as you can see there's nothing
inside of there and then inside of it
what we're going to do is well it's good
first off go and create a string and
let's have this be name and let's give
it a default value of nothing and then
we're going to output some information
on our screen so we'll go console and
here I'm going to use write because I do
not want any new line after this gets
put on our screen I'm going to say what
is your name put it like that and
another space so that it looks nice and
neat then I'm going to ask the user from
information and I'm going to store that
in the string that I created above so
how we can do that is go console and
read line and whatever they enter is
going to be stored inside of this name
string variable and then what I'll be
able to do is go console and now I'm
going to use write line and then we go
create a little bit more of a fancy type
of hello world thing and we'll go hello
and then I want whatever the value of
name is to be transposed directly inside
of there and put it on the screen now
however if I want to call this from my
main function because remember all the
execution starts in the main function
I'm just going to go say hello and put
that there and run it now as you can see
prints out all that other information I
can type in Derrick hit enter and it now
says a little Derrick okay so that's how
to get information as well as how to
print it out we don't need all this
right now so let's just delete that okay
so now I'm going to talk about data
types and data types are very important
because you want to use as little space
in memory as humanly possible so that
you don't use up a ton of memory and all
so that your application can run as fast
as possible now to start off probably
the most basic type of data type or what
are called boolean 's and they only
store values of either true or false so
I'm going to have a boolean here and
it's going to be can I vote and I'm
going to mark that as true there you go
you just created a boolean and of course
you could have false in there instead
but nothing else and then we have
integers and they are probably going to
be the variable data type that you use
more than anything else and what they
represent are 32-bit assigned integers
and you may ask yourself well what
exactly does that mean well let's go and
I'm going to print out the largest type
of integer that you can possibly have so
let's go biggest integer these are just
going to be values that don't have
decimal places in them and to get the
maximum value an integer can store you
go int and Max value and why not go and
also find out the smallest value you can
have remember these are going to be
signed so we will go smallest like that
and to get the smallest we change this
to min and if we save that and we
execute it you are going to find out
exactly the biggest integer you can
store and the smallest integer of course
you can't store anything smaller or
anything bigger than those guys if
however you would like to store
something bigger there are also things
called Long's and Long's are 64-bit
signed integers and they are just going
to have a long there instead of an int
so let's say we wanted to find the
biggest long like that and you define
integers of course by typing in int okay
so that's exactly like we did with the
Boleyn's there we're going to do more
with variables as we continue and let's
go and get the largest long we can have
and let's go and get the smallest long
we can have and now with a click of a
mouse you can see the biggest long and
the smallest long alright so very very
very big numbers that brings us to
decimals
now decimals are going to store one
twenty-eight bit precise decimal values
and they are going to be accurate to 28
digits and I'm going to show you an
example here of how those guys are going
to work for us so let's go and create a
decimal and to do so you just go decimal
and I'm going to go decimal pi value is
equal to and let's throw pie inside of
there and I want to make sure you see
the M here you're going to have to put
the M inside of there whenever you
define decimals so there we have a
decimal pi value then what I'm going to
do to show you how accurate these are
I'm going to go decimal and decimal big
num is equal to and I'm going to throw
in this number right here so let's put
that at the end of it and then let's try
to add those together and see what it
looks like see how accurate they are so
I'm going to go to console and write
line and I'm going to say just make sure
that you can see that this is a decimal
then I'm going to go PI plus big num is
going to be equal to and 0 inside of
there and then you can also do addition
inside here you don't just have values
inside of there so we can go decimal pi
val plus and then decimal big num and
close that off and why don't we come in
here and also print out the biggest
decimal value we have so a decimal like
that and to get the maximum decimal
we're going to say decimal in uppercase
letters and smallest decimal as well and
decimal again got all those save we're
going to learn all kinds of things here
and here you can see now we added three
points 0 0 0 0 0 and a whole bunch of
ones you can see right here the value is
3/2 and we added one one at the end of
it you're going to see that the one got
on there but the next one is going to be
the next one over and it's just
completely disregarded if you count all
these numbers up you're going to see
that there are 28 digits so you will
know that the maximum precision in
regards to working with decimal values
for a decimal datatype
is going to be 28 digits and you can
also see the biggest decimal and the
smallest decimal now we're going to come
in and work with another data type that
is called doubles and to create a double
just go double like that and this is a
64-bit floating type and that just means
that it has decimal values inside of it
and let's come in here and let's change
this up a little bit because they're not
as precise as decimals so basically this
this is where we're going to end this
and let's get rid of the M right there
and let's go and shorten this guy down
as well and let's go and change this to
doubles so that we will be able to see
that we're working with doubles on this
so dbl and let's change this to dbl and
this to dbl as well just so we don't
cause confusion and that means this has
to be dbl and this has to be dbl once
again all the code is available in the
description with a transcript and change
this to double we're also going to print
out the max value for our doubles so I'm
going to change this to biggest double
and I'm just going to disregard this so
I don't have to you can go and do that
if you'd like and here to print this out
as a string value what we're going to do
is we're going to change this to double
and max value and then if we want to
change this to a string we're going to
go to string like that and inside of
here put a hash symbol and that's going
to allow us to print that out make sure
you have that last parenthesis there and
let's run that and see what we get and
you can see the doubles are quite large
as you can see but they're also not
precise so we can see right here
whenever we add these together nine
eight one you can see right here seventy
nine and we added two to it that time
you can see that that's going to work
but if you increase this by just one
digit whoops I went and tried to do
something I shouldn't do all right let's
close this off if you would go and
increase this by just one value you're
going to see that those values are going
to be disregarded all right so the whole
point of this is to just introduce you
to the biggest and largest numbers you
can store in these different data types
and also to show you how precise they
are and how they can cause you problems
if you don't pay attention to that
precision
now talk about floats and we'll get the
biggest float a float is a 32-bit
floating-point number and it is not as
accurate as a double it's half as
accurate actually and we'll go floats at
max value but normally you're not
working with gigantic values so you
normally don't have to worry about that
and this is a lowercase float like that
and that's going to print out the
biggest float that we have we're then
going to change this from double to
floats and we're going to change this to
float and let's go and change this to
float once again and this to float and
then we're going to have to shrink this
down because we can only work with six
digits see it's much much smaller so
let's get rid of that oops
put the two back inside of there then
we're going to have five zeros and get
rid of this and then we can come in and
add these up so this is going to be
float and this is going to be float as
well
got all that saved and we can execute it
look have an error that the depth at all
the reason why is I forgot to put the F
there say it's good I made the error and
that's going to point out the fact that
you could make that error it's common
error and if we run it you can see right
here if we move this up that it was able
to add two to that value right there
however if you tried to add one more
decimal place it's going to foul up and
you can also see the biggest float you
can work with but again it's not precise
if you work with that gigantic number
and there are also a whole bunch of
other different types of data types you
can work with and here they are you can
also work with bytes and you can see how
big those numbers are you can see here
you have characters those are going to
be one individual character s byte and
how big those are and so forth and so on
so those are all of the other different
data types aside from strings a couple
other I'm going to introduce but those
are the main number types that you're
going to work with it's also important
to understand that you can convert from
strings to other types with a function
called parse so let's say that I create
a boolean I'm going to call this boolean
from string is equal to so normally
you're going to be receiving input and
it's going to be received as a string
and if you want to change it to
to an actual other datatype this is how
you do it you go bull parse and then
let's say this is true and you can put
that in there and that's going to
convert that for us and you're also
going to be able to go int int from
string is equal to int parse and in that
situation let's say it's 100 and of
course that also means you're going to
be able to do this with doubles and with
decimals and all these other different
data types but I can get a double from
string just to give you an example and
to do that you would go double and parse
and in this situation one point two
three four alright so that is how we can
convert from strings to other different
data types which is also a very useful
thing to be able to do so let's up about
some other additional data types you
might want to work with let's say you
want to work with dates and times well
if you want to work with a date use a
type called date/time and let's say we
go awesome dates and we want to define a
date inside here so what we're going to
do is go equal to new date time and this
is a date time object 1974 12 and 21
probably the most important day ever in
history and we can go and print that
information out onto the screen and we
can print out additional information so
let's say that we wanted to get what it
was the day of the week whenever that
date occurred and we can go and we can
find out and how we can find out is just
by going awesome date like this and day
of week and close that off of the
semicolon you're also going to be able
to come in here and change these values
to maybe not so awesome of a date but
what the heck we have to come in here
and do something so to do so we would go
awesome date and we wanted to add say
four days to that awesome dates we could
do so like this we could also in a very
similar fashion come in
and add in months and just change this
to months and what's today that we want
this to just be one and we could also go
and add another year to it just by going
years like that and let's just add one
to that and then we want to come in here
and print out that information so we can
go and print the entire date out by
going console and right line of course
and this new date and we'll throw that
inside of there and to get the entire
date we go awesome date followed by date
and run it and you can see the day of
the most awesome date in history was on
a Saturday and the new date based off
all the changes I made or what you can
see right there all right it's a cool
stuff let's get rid of that we're also
going to be able to work with x in a
similar way using what are called
timespan objects so to create one you go
time span and let's say we want to
define lunch time equal to new time span
and let's say that it is at 12:30 and 0
seconds there we go we just created a
time span object we're then going to be
able to come in and go lunch time and
let's say that we need to change our
lunch time we can do so let's say we
want to subtract 15 minutes from our
lunch time so we can go in there and go
subtract and new timespan for actually
creating another object to subtract from
it there's the 15 minutes and there is
the seconds we're also going to be able
to add time so it's that we want to we
had a problem with our time to get our
lunch we can go add and let's say it's
an hour later and the minutes are going
to be zero and that's that and then if
we want to go and print out or into our
new lunch time we can go write line and
new time and get the actual lunch time
and to do so we go to string and to
string is a function remember up
here we were talking about how to parse
values to change them from strings to
other numbers well we often use another
function called two string to convert
other values into strings close that off
with a semicolon and if we run it you're
going to see the changes of time all
right so there we are that is date/time
as well as timespan another thing we can
work with our what are called big
integers and they are used to store very
very large numbers but to use them what
you're going to have to do is come up
here to project and click on that come
down here and go and click on add
reference under assemblies inside of
frameworks you're going to want to come
in through here and look for system
numerix see that right there and you're
going to want to make sure there's a
check mark inside of there and then
click on OK then scroll back up to the
top of all of your code and then come in
here and type in using system numerix
exactly like that and then you'll be
able to make big integers likewise even
if you were on a Mac you're going to be
able to do the same thing just come up
here click on project edit references
click on that and just leave all
selected and then look for system
numerix and that's right there put a
check mark inside of there click on OK
and the world's awesome alright back
into the windows world so what we're
going to do here is I'm going to show
you some things we can do with big
integers now to define a big integer
what we're going to have to do is to
define the value using what are called
text literals and you don't need to
memorize all of these different things
I'm saying right now just after I do
them a whole bunch of times you're going
to remember them and to do that you're
going to go parse like this and then we
can throw a big value inside of here I'm
not going to do much with this just
wanted to introduce you to it you can go
ahead and play with it as much as you
like afterwards there we are so we just
created one and then we're going to be
able to work with them just like any
other data types so we'll be able to go
right line and go something like big
number times 2 is equal to and throw a
value inside of there and then we'll be
able to come in and say big num times 2
just to demonstrate that they are used
just like any other value and if you see
it there they are alright so there we go
that's a big integer now very often you
are going to want to format your output
in specific ways and there's a whole
bunch of different formatting options
that are available to you so we will say
console and right line and for one thing
you can output information as if it is
currency and to do so inside of those
brackets you're going to put your normal
zero like you have there but you're
going to say hey this is currency
alright so that's how easy that is come
in here and let's say you get to three
point four five five which is in
currency or normal currency and I'm
going to show you a whole bunch of
different formatting options here all at
one time so we don't have to keep doing
that so let's say we want to also pad
the values with zeros we can do that as
well and how you do that is come in here
and put d4 and let's just change this to
23 what else can we do we can have it
only show three decimals like that and
then change this to f3 and throw another
5 on there it's only going to show 3 and
why don't we do one more let's say we
want to add commas and decimals we can
just change this to comas and then come
and get rid of this and say N and 4 and
for this guy we're going to say 2300 and
if we execute that you're going to see
how all those work out for us
the 4 with the N for that you see right
here that is going to make sure we have
4 spaces in the decimal places it also
puts commas inside of that 3 decimals is
going to cut off whatever is over here
and round it up you're going to see that
this guy right here d4 is going to make
sure that we get 4 values whether we
have known or not and this is currency
alright so there's some formatting
options that are available to you and
now I'd like to take a look at strings
now stir
things are going to allow us to store a
series of characters and you've seen
them before to define a string just go
string then we'll say random string and
let's go and give this a value this is a
string just to keep it simple now you're
going to be able to come in here and get
the number of characters that are inside
of the string or the string length as
it's often called just by going random
string and then following that up with
length that's also a way you could cycle
through a string and output that
information on the screen
let's go copy this and let's see some
other string functions that are
available to us we are also going to be
able to come in and see if a value is
contained inside of a string so we will
say something like string contains the
word is inside of it you can also go
like this after the comma and move that
down there so that you can see things a
little bit easier and find out if it
does contain something you just go
contains and whatever you are searching
for and it will then jump back and tell
you if it contains it or not let's go
and do some more look make sure you put
that last parenthesis in there all right
let's see some more string functions
that are available to us and let's go
and put this down here as well so you'll
be able to see all those at one time
you're also going to be able to find the
index of the beginning of the match of a
string so we will say something like
let's go put a space there index of is
and we'll just change contains into
index of and that's going to give us
that go get some more let's say you want
to remove the number of characters
starting at an index I'm just going to
call this remove string and to do that
we can say remove and we want to start
at the zero index and we want to remove
six characters after that zero index
inside of that let's go and do some more
let's say you want to insert a string
well let's just go and call this insert
string and to insert you're just going
to say insert like that and we're going
to say at the 10th index we want to
import the
the name of short and put a space inside
of there we can also come in and replace
a string and it's going to find whatever
we are searching for and it's going to
change it into whatever we tell it to
change it into so we'll just call this
replace string and replace it of course
we're going to use replace and what we
are specifically looking for is the word
string and where it finds it it's going
to change it into sentence we're also
going to be able to compare strings and
what this guy's going to do is if the
value that is returned from this
function is less than 0 that means that
string 1 is going to proceed string 2 if
they're equal it's going to return a
value of 0 and if it returns a value
that is greater than 0 that means that
string to proceed string 1 and let me
show you an example here that will make
more sense let's go compare a to B and
here what we're going to do is change
this into a string this is a string
object and string object function or
method or whatever you want to call it
and what we do here is we pass in the
two strings that we want to compare I'm
just putting single characters in there
but that doesn't mean you have to and if
I want to compare these strings and
ignore case what I can do is go
comparison dot original ignore case well
we run these just to see what they look
like
there you can see string lengths it went
and counted all those characters did it
contain the word is yes index of is the
very first index anyway is to remove
string you can see here it remove the
very beginning of our string insert a
string you can see it puts short inside
of there replace string you can see it
changed string of the sentence and here
it returns a negative value and what
does that mean that means that string a
or the letter A and here precedes the
letter B whenever we compare those two
strings alphabetically let's now come in
and let's see if two strings are equal
to each other so what I'm going to do is
go a is equal to lowercase a and this is
why you'd like to connect compare values
with and ignore case and
do this we are going to come in use the
string object again and use a function
called equals and then inside of it we
will pass what we want to compare us
will say a to a how that get in their
hands get rid of that and then we will
follow that up with our string
comparison that got right there and then
original ignore case once again do a
couple more here we can add padding to
the left side of the screen so let's say
our left side of strings so we'll say
something like pad left and what this is
going to do is add padding to the string
as a whole it's not going to add to like
if you put a 5 inside here it's not
going to add 5 to it it's going to add
whatever is over the total size that you
define so what we're going to do to do
that is go pad left and let's say that
we want it to be 20 total spaces in size
and everywhere to pad we want to put
periods we can put spaces of course and
let's go copy that and we can also do
padding on the right side of whatever
gets printed out again let's leave this
be 20 and that like that and we just
change this to pad right go and do a
couple more to finish off the strings
we're also going to be able to trim
whitespace so let's just change this to
trim there is no white space but
whatever it'll work if there is here
random string and just put trim inside
of there and nothing and it will get rid
of all the white space on the left and
right side of our string and we're also
going to be able to make this uppercase
which is sometimes a good way to compare
strings so uppercase and for that you
just changed this to upper and guess
what you're going to do pretty much
exactly the same thing if you want to
convert every value in the string to
lowercase just change this to low and
change this to low as well and also
you're going to be able to use the
format function and to go and create
strings so we can say something like
string
new string we want to creates is equal
to and let's say you want to do
something like Mad Libs I don't know if
anybody out there even knows of Mad Libs
are and but whatever we're just going to
be placing values inside here so let's
say we have something like this
saw a and then we're going to throw in
something else inside of there and the
next one is two in da and three like
this exactly and then after that we
could say something like Paul is going
to be the first value and then rabbit
and then eating and then filled not
exactly the most uproarious funny Madlib
you ever saw in your life but we have
that another thing that's important to
understand with strings is let's say you
wanted to have a string and it had a
double quote inside of it inside of the
double quote well if you have the double
quote here it's not going to know where
these the definition the string begins
or ends so if you want to put a double
quote ins out of there you put a
backslash like that and your double
quote likewise you can also do a
backslash let's backslash and double
quote like that not double double quote
and likewise you can do a regular quote
inside of there your also if you want to
do a backslash inside of your string do
double backslashes can also do a tab and
you can also do an alert and alert
inside of a string whatever it runs is
going to go and play a beep noise and
you can play around with that on your
own and also there are things here to
finish off called a verbatim strings and
if you go and do something on a console
right and then put an @ sign inside of
there exactly what I typed and then you
can put something like a single quote
inside of there and a backslash like
that it's not going to matter because
it's going to print out exactly what you
typed and you can see right there we
didn't have to use back slashes to use
those guys and there is all the outputs
from all the other string functions that
I defined in my code and there you go
guys that is a great introduction to
c-sharp or at least I think it's pretty
good don't want to overwhelm you and I'm
going to fairly quickly whip
through the c-sharp language over the
next couple videos but I'm going to
provide an immense amount of detail in
comparison to my learning 1 videos and
then we'll move on to the Sumerian and
making games and unity and a whole bunch
of other different things so just like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
