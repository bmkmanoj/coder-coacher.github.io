my jQuery and Ajax tutorial today
because I received a bunch of email
requests I'm going to show you most
every other way to select elements using
jQuery and I'm also at the end going to
provide an example that both introduces
animation then handling and how to
change values in elements you can see
right here just basic line of code that
I use here that I introduced in the last
tutorial if you didn't watch it
definitely watch it first or this will
be confusing this is where we're getting
our library right here this is the line
of code that's going to be called and
this is when everything is going to
start executing in regards to our jQuery
statements just as soon as the document
says that it is ready and functioning
and ready for that the rest of this is
all straight HTML code it's a whole
bunch of divs with an h4 tag couple
paragraphs a span and then a closing div
and at the end here we have another span
and we have an input button so I'm going
to come in here and show you pretty much
every single other way to select
different things inside of jQuery so how
do we call jQuery with a dollar sign and
let's say I want to be able to get
access to the first h4 tag on the screen
how exactly do I do that when I'm going
to change its CSS styling and I also
received a request or a comment asking
how to change multiple CSS styling at
one time I'm going to actually show you
that
but here I'm going to grab the first h4
tag and I'm going to color the
background color yellow and you can see
it just did that that's what it did so
that's how you use first and you can
also come in here and type in the last
and let's say I want to color the last
paragraph and like I said before I'm
going to show you how to change multiple
CSS styles you just want to come in here
put a curly brace inside of there and
then put a colon and just so this makes
a little bit more sense I'm going to
color this purple and this by the way is
the paragraph we're aiming for so I put
a colon in instead of a comma now I put
a comma now I'm going to change the text
color put a colon inside of there to
white and then close that off with a
curly brace and that allows us to change
multiple different styles at one time
and there did copy that went change the
text color and change the background
color and of course I showed you in the
last tutorial how to add and remove
classes and stylings and so forth and of
course
you could do that instead that's a
little less messy let's scroll this up
okay that's a little bit more room for
us to work so let's say that I want to
target the first span child element of a
paragraph tag let's come in here and
every time that I change my quotes being
I have single quotes here and double
quotes there if I don't say anything
about it that means it doesn't really
matter just sometimes I just randomly
type in things in a different way
I'm going to come up here I'll grab this
guy save themselves for time I want to
make sure I come in here and change that
to a comma and let's change this to
orange and this will allow me to target
the first child span inside of a
paragraph doink and as you can see it
grabbed all of the first spans inside of
all of the paragraphs this is a
paragraph this is a paragraph this is a
paragraph this is a paragraph and this
is a span you can see that all the text
that lies inside here describes exactly
what's inside of those boxes and I could
also go and get the last child and let's
just copy this and I promised these
tutorials I'm going to get a lot more
complicated and a lot more fun it's just
going to take me a while to get to that
point because I'm just teaching you the
basics right now so let's say I want to
target the last paragraph in divs and
let's change this color just so it
stands on it the cyan that's how I would
do it and that's exactly what it did it
targeted the very last paragraph in the
div and the div surrounds all of this
stuff right here so that's a div I can
also target the enth child meaning I can
define exactly the child that I want to
be able to grab just copy that again
let's say div here let's get rid of this
guy and let's say n n th child and let's
just say one so this is going to be the
first child of the div and let's just
change this to pink and you can see it
gotta grab these children elements and
change them to pink you can see here
that I change this to two and it grabbed
the second one on the screen and if I
change this to three I think you can
guess it grabbed this guy right down
here let's just change this back to one
just a way to show you some different
things and how they change as you change
the numbers I'm going to copy and paste
that again
now these are zero-based what I'm going
to show you next that means the first
element is actually going to be referred
to as zero the second element is going
to be referred to as one sec the third
element is going to be referred to as
two if you know anything about
programming languages that should make
sense so let's say we want to get a spam
type an e q and let's just change this
to two and let's give this a color of
purple so that stands out and you can
see that it did indeed target the second
span if this is the zero and then this
is the one and this is the second
remember there's a zero-based so that in
essence grabs for you the third span on
the screen and it allows you to edit it
you can also target in this situation
I'm going to target all h4 tags after
the first index so how do i do that i
type in h4 that's the tag I wanna zero
in on GT greater than you can think of
that one and then let's change this to
green and it grabbed this guy right here
now what would happen if I change this
to zero it grabs them both see this is
pretty much every single way you can
grab different things you just need to
think about it a little bit and figure
out exactly what you want to target
whenever you're using these rules but
when it comes down to it you can pretty
much grab anything you could want I'm
going to change this to two and then I'm
going to change this to an ugly color
let's make it olive and now this is all
of them this is all of and of course as
these CSS stylings change the last one
overrides any of the ones that precede
it now what I'm going to do is down here
you can see it says click to hide me I'm
going to add an event handler to this
guy that's going to trigger it to hide
whenever it is clicked on and you can
add event handlers to pretty much
anything so the ID for this is click to
hide me so how do we target IDs with a
hash symbol click to hide and then put
my quotes inside of there this is how
we're going to add a click event handler
to that and what we're going to do with
it was we're going to call a function an
anonymous function it's anonymous why
talked about this last time because it
doesn't have a name that's all not that
complicated and what we're going to say
is that we want this guy with the ID
click to hide to hide itself when it's
clicked so I'm
we do that we call the hide function and
of course we want to use the same types
of quotes and this is the hide function
come in here curly braces and close off
that anonymous function and if we save
that and reload it if you click this
it's going to hide itself well we can
click on the bring me back button but
that doesn't mean it's all it's going to
automatically work without us creating
some functions and events that we're
going to hook into that here I'm going
to show you some neat animations as well
we're going to go and just so you know
what I mean when I say I D C button
i D bring it back here i D click to hide
that's what I'm talking about when you
want to reference one of those you have
to start it off with a hash symbol real
simple bring it back so that's the name
of the button the ID for the button and
I'm just going to add another click
event handler to it put another
anonymous function inside of here I'm
just doing it because I'm not going to
call this function or anything else so
why I give it a name and that's kind of
meaning and then here I'm referencing
the text called click to hide here I'm
showing a couple other things I'm asking
is inside of this if statement it is
visible and then if it is what we want
to do is come down it's out of here and
saying okay click to hide we want to
hide it this guy's actually going to do
double duty for us else if it is
invisible we want to run another
function on it and just so you know the
opposite of is is not okay but we don't
want to do that so if you wanted to
check if it was not visible you would do
that all right
let's scroll this up so we can actually
see it so if it's not visible what we
want to do is make it visible and how do
we make something visible it isn't we
call the show function say jQuery has
very easy to understand functions and we
want to close that off and then we want
to not forget to close off our anonymous
function and that is exactly how that's
done I'll save it now if I click on this
text that's down here let me zoom in
just you can say C went away bring it
back hide bring it back but wait a
minute this doesn't make any sense
because this button says bring it back
whenever it's already there well that's
stupid okay well now I'm going to show
you how to change the value of this
button let's just jump right back up
inside of here
and let's change this now the button
click caused us to get here so we
refer to the button now as this this is
a reference to whatever element called
this function so to have this function
called the only way to do that is to
click on a button hence you can refer to
the button thereafter as this so
whatever triggered this event to occur
you can refer to as this it's just
shorthand but it is something nice to
know and here we're going to use the
valve function to say bring back on the
button and that's all we need to do we
can actually copy this jump down here
leave this leave Val except that's going
to be delete text and we file save that
reload it and then you can see if I
click make it delete says bring back but
now it says delete text say back and
forth and you're thinking oh that's not
very impressive okay so now what I'm
going to show you how to do is to show
you some neat little animations that are
extremely easy to use with jQuery now
instead of just quickly hiding or
deleting these guys instead of hide I'm
gonna say fade out and let's say I want
to put two thousand in there and then
instead of show I'm gonna type in fade
in just those little tiny little little
changes provide with a nice animation
jump over reload and here it is we click
on it and I'll bring back oh look at
that
see came back really really really nice
delete text and it actually fades away
really really nice comes back and forth
pretty sharp neat little thing we can do
and I'm going to show you a whole bunch
of other animations that are available
to you so they'll be really neat thing
to look forward to you can also type in
slow you could also type in fast you
could also type in normal instead of
type in mm in here so there is a couple
neat little things and a couple things
you can look forward to in regards to
adding events which I'm going to cover
in the next tutorial and adding
animations and all kinds of other things
and believe me the other animations are
much more impressive than what you just
saw right there
have any questions or comments leave
them in the comment section below all
the code is it new think tank calm and
otherwise til next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
