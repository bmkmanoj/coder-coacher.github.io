9 of my UML 2 video tutorial today we're
going to talk about deployment diagrams
so you use deployment diagrams to show
how software and hardware work together
and these are kind of weird guys because
very often you're gonna see deployment
diagrams that only show nodes or
Hardware nodes like you see right here
what you're going to do is just put
inside a brackets device and then
whatever you want to name your hardware
deployment diagrams are like many of the
other diagrams I've shown you in this
tutorial they fluctuate based off of who
is using them and how people think
diagrams help them create systems now
hardware nodes which are just little
boxes like this and all of the images
you see here are available under a link
you can use this as a cheat sheet or
whatever you want these Hardware nodes
can be a computer itself a server a
harddrive any type of Hardware operating
systems server software routers switches
firewalls pretty much anything you would
consider a hardware piece or an
executable environment and now to get
into that more specifically in
situations in which nodes are actually
software you may want to label it
something like execution environment and
then put something like JSP server and
in tomcat seven underneath of it you can
also just as easily label it JSP server
and then put Tomcat 7 under that as you
can see things fluctuate databases can
also be looked at as nodes even though
sometimes they are not as you're going
to see below and with a database you
might list it as a database system as a
stereotype that's what we these guys are
if you don't remember then you can put
something like MySQL inside of here
or you could put it inside of this
little cylinder shape also very common
or this cylinder shape and then list the
OS the vendor and the version number
underneath of it so as you can see
there's many different ways to label
things whenever you're creating
deployment diagrams you may also choose
to name your nodes as we have right here
we're having one device which is going
to verify cards like an ATM system and
it is a server which we're going to call
the card verify server and then
we're going to have the funds verify
server because it might make sense to
verify cards on a separate server then
we would verify available funds now
communication between nodes is going to
be documented like this where you're
going to lift protocol and draw a line
between one node to another node in this
situation we have a server that contains
a database and inside of that we have a
schema that is sometimes documented with
a symbol over here and that is going to
contain product information and here we
are going to document the communication
type across the line so that we know how
this information is going to be
transferred from the PC over to this
database and backwards and forwards and
it's very important to remember that the
point of these paths here is to
demonstrate how the nodes are going to
communicate and it shouldn't describe
specific messages or anything like that
between these different nodes inside of
your deployment diagram now software is
going to be modeled as an artifact and
if you would actually want to model
software inside of a piece of hardware
this is exactly how you would do that
now artifacts can be text files
executable files jars XML drivers source
files classifiers configuration files
pretty much any type of file and it is
very important whenever you're laying
out artifacts or files that you need to
model all the different parts of your
system that are important to you as the
designer remember these diagrams are
meant to help you quickly and easily
communicate to a team how you want the
system designed as well as keep the
system design fresh in your mind so you
know where you're going to go from here
to there and you're also going to be
able to tie your artifacts to a node
using dependency arrows as you can see
here artifact the name of the file and
this dependency arrow with deploy
written upon it you can see these are
different ways to linked artifacts over
to your nodes you can either list them
inside of the node you can draw an arrow
to the node or you can just simply list
all of the different artifacts inside of
the device node just like that so
there's many different ways to do this
depending upon whatever works for you
now you're going to show relationships
between software
and components like this IRA's artifact
which is your software then you're going
to type in manifest and draw a
dependency arrow over this and manifest
means to implement a component and the
whole idea for having components is the
components are going to define the
requirements for the software that you
are going to be deploying to actually
work with your hardware like I said
before the deployment diagram is going
to diagram how your software and your
hardware are going to work together and
that is how all of these different
pieces are going to come together and
that brings us to deployment
specifications deployment specifications
are artifacts that describe how another
artifact is associated with a node and
you're either going to show the
deployment spec linked to the artifact
inside of this device node which is an
execution environment or you can also
show it linked outside of the execution
environment again which ever makes most
sense to you what this is going to do is
you're going to hand the software over
to the deployment spec and that is going
to have the duty of deploying it into
your execution environment so these are
basically just little guys that are
going to stand between your code and the
ultimate destination which is going to
be execution environments or in the
situation with components the components
are going to stand between your software
and the hardware just to make sure that
everything lines up and works together
and that brings us to a whole entire
thing called a specification deployment
diagram and this guy is pretty big
hopefully you can see everything here
view at full screen if you can't
basically what we're going to have here
is I'm just going to say that this is an
ATM system that I'm going to be working
with I'm going to put that up in the
upper left hand corner then here inside
of the device that's going to represent
my ATM machine I'm going to list all the
different devices that my ATM machine is
going to have such as a keypad a printer
a card reader cash drawer in an ATM
screen then down here I'm going to have
my actual execution environment we
scroll out here you're going to see that
the execution environment is going to be
held inside of the device again
you can draw arrows to show dependency
between the execution environment and
the device if that works out better for
you then the component here is going to
make sure that your software that you
want to bring into the ATM machine is
going to fit the requirements that are
needed to work with the ATM machine and
then outside of the execution
environment altogether we're going to
use the deployment spec to deploy our
software or the installation or whatever
you want to refer to it as to deploy
that installation software into the
execution environment for ATM machine
like I said you can look at this there's
a link under the video then on top of
this we're going to also link our ATM
machine over to a bank system so I just
label this as Bank server and then
inside of it I have a database which is
an Oracle database and then we're going
to have different schema documented here
that are going to both validate the card
validate to pin and account funds and
then we're going to also document the
transfer protocol that we're going to
use between the ATM machine over to the
database which is stored on the bank's
server so there is a ton of information
on deployment diagrams later on in this
tutorial I'm going to show you some more
real-world examples leave any questions
or comments below otherwise till next
