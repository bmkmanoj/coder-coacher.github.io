you how you can overcome an issue that
normally faces most people want to try
to put a website together and that is
how to generate content or where to get
content from it's actually very easy and
I'm also going to show you a couple
examples of websites that were put
together in this case website up on
right now in an hour using a series of
videos that i put together that are all
youtube all one hundred percent free you
can make a website that looks like this
in and out and just to prove that
anybody can do it here are some other
people who provided me with their
websites that they put together based
off my videos in a little over an hour
but still completely put together
completely functional you can see right
here they all look pretty sharp but back
to get in contact with one really easy
way if you have a wordpress website set
up and how you do that is you install
something called press this you go to
your WordPress dashboard and click on
tools it's going to show up right here
and it's so easy to use all you have to
do is go to this link right here right
click on it and click on bookmark this
link just that simple it automatically
will work for you now where do you get
this free content well if you go to this
web address that i have right up here DM
0 0 or business publishing printing that
about it and it continues up with a link
down below scenery it a little bit
easier you go here it's going to show
you a gigantic list of all free article
websites these websites will provide you
with tons of information that you can
use on your website for free you would
just type in let's just try something
like safety
to make it harder safety equipment click
on search getting yourself the right
fire safety equipment click on it now
using press this you would just simply
go in here go into your bookmark area in
my case it's here click on press this it
pops up and it would provide a link and
you can type in your own information in
regards like an excerpt on the actual
app on the actual article or you can
come down here make a slight selection
of some of the content go up the popular
click on press this automatically
populates to the information right in
there for you and you could add it into
any number of different categories or
click add new category create a new
category just for the safety equipment
and down here in the post tags area you
would enter in a list of keywords click
on add to automatically set set into
your website and then click on publish
and that's all let's do it and then all
this information goes and then
aggravates right into your WordPress
website it's that simple I can do the
same thing with any website if it was
something for example in The Daily Beast
normally these websites are more than
happy for you to provide links to their
articles collisional copy the entire
article and you provide a link to so I
copy just a brief amount of information
click on popular just so you see it
press this automatically hide your gates
put it in a category type in some
keywords boom that's it so that's your
tip for the day it's called press this
if you have a wordpress website you
should get it yeah if you like check out
my website and do think tank calm
everything is on there hundred percent
free no subscriptions thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
