months I've kept the weight off and
actually continued to lose weight and I
approve this video hey I heard about
this great diet all you do is eat fat
and meat and you don't worry about your
cholesterol intake or sodium or anything
yeah I wasn't that invented by a guy
that died of a heart attack at the age
of 49 and weighed 258 pounds upon his
death no those are all false rumors this
diet is really going to work but doesn't
that sort of throw the food pyramid on
its head and go against everything the
FDA and every nutritionist textbook says
nah this diet is really gonna work they
don't anybody else out there from what I
saw you eat you're on the Atkins diet
and I'm sorry to tell you no you cannot
eat eggs and bacon or ham fried in
butter and lose weight and keep it off
I've actually never seen anyone go on
Atkins and not gain weight within a
six-month period today I'm going to show
you how to absolutely gorgeous elf and
lose weight the right way based off the
FDA and nutritional textbooks here I
broke down what you ate for breakfast I
would love to have seen what you ate for
lunch and dinner you can see here all
that matters is calories really fat
definitely is bad and you consumed an
immense amount of it but either way when
you add up your breakfast which you said
you didn't even like that comes to a
total of 388 calories if you would have
actually instead aight exactly what you
wanted to eat except in a different
format which was a sausage egg and
cheese muffin that woody go out to only
375 calories and look at the difference
in fact here's how you do that too
healthy wet here's your egg egg beaters
much better than regular eggs don't eat
regular eggs no matter what anybody
tells you then you have Ezekiel 49
sprouted grain muffins awesome and
loaded with fiber smart beat cheddar
cheese which actually tastes like real
cheese and morningstar original sausage
patties these are vegan sausage patties
that tastes exactly like regular sausage
and for the salsa I dropped it on my
foot so I can't show it to you it's luck
on stay Nia home style salsa it's the
healthiest also you can possibly eat
unless you make it yourself so there's
your sausage egg and cheese month what I
instead would have
and came in at a lower amount of
calories is this list right here which
is absolutely massive and overloaded
with foods that make you feel full and
have natural fiber in them and a heck of
a lot less fat and none of the bad
things that you consumed in your regular
breakfast but you wouldn't know this
because you're probably not monitoring
your calories and to succeed in a diet
you have to obsess about calories I'm
personally a big believer in gorging
yourself while on a diet and I am not
kidding spray of canola oil and you take
all these veggies which includes a cup
of mushrooms a cup of spinach a half cup
of how thin is a half cup of onions and
a half cup of asparagus throw them in a
pan after everything's fried up add
three fourths of a cup of egg beaters
then add your luck on stina salsa the
healthy salsa you can get here's a real
breakfast I have waffles you say waffles
can't be healthy welcome to the world of
eggo nutrigrain low-fat waffle is that
syrup on those waffles yes it is Vermont
sugar-free Sarah and that can't be catch
it uh-huh Heinz no salt added tomato
ketchup all this comes in at 382
calories and it's overloaded with food
that will make you feel full most of the
time I can't eat all of this but I hope
this video helps you out if you have any
questions leave comments below but
whatever you do do not go on yeah
actions die</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
