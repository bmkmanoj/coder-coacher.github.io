5 of my C video tutorial today this
tutorial is going to be all about strux
and a struck is used when you need more
than one piece of data to describe one
thing and you may say to yourself well
why not use an array well very often a
right would work however remember an
array can only hold one data type inside
of it
so whenever that doesn't work that's
whenever a struck will work if you
haven't seen it the previous parts this
tutorial I refer to them in the upper
right hand corner and you should
probably check them out and of course
all the code is available in the
description underneath this video so I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
ok basic setup text editor over here and
here is my terminal and I'm just gonna
start going into it so let's just create
ourselves with struck specifically let's
say we want to properly define a dog
well what are some things that we will
need to define our dog well I'm going to
first create a constants here that's
what Co NS T stands for and it's going
to represent the dog's name we don't
plan on that change in and that's
something that we'd like to have stored
inside of here another thing we don't
plan on changing is the breed of the dog
so let's put that in there well then
what are some other ways or things we
can describe in regards to our dog well
let's say average height and there we
are in let's say I want that to be in
centimeters C officially now it you no
longer be an array unless those are
strings of course and then we're gonna
say average weight in pounds and then
don't forget this very very important
put a semicolon down there ok so there
we are we just created a struct so let's
go down into main now and try to use it
now to define a new dog what we're just
gonna simply do is type in struct dog
and then we're going to say give it a
name like Cujo for example and there's
Cujo and Cujo is a st. Bernard and let's
say that Cujo is 90 centimeters and 264
pounds there we go and basically we're
going to create this kind of like and
erase created in essence what we're
doing here is we're just going to
our new dog and pass all the values
specific to this dog and then of course
we have to use struct for now and we
have to give it a variable name just
like any other variable and now it's
going to be very easy to pass all this
information to say just one individual
function all we need to do is go Cujo
now in the past what we'd have to do if
we wanted to pass all this in semi colon
of course is we'd have to take all this
information and pass it to the method or
the function that's not good so now we
just have that so that's one of the
reasons where ice trucks even exist then
we can come up here and actually start
creating this method let's say we don't
want it to return anything and it's
called get dog info and whenever you
accept the struck you would do struct
and then dog and then you have to give
that variable a name and I'm just going
to call it the dog and let's just throw
up for an F inside of here and let's
start working with this
now since the struct is actually created
in a way that's very similar to an array
you might think that what you would do
if you wanted to say get the dog's name
down here is that you would come in and
type in the dog and then an index value
but that's wrong that doesn't work so
sorry about that what we're going to do
instead to get all this information is
use a dot operator so what I'm going to
do is just go printf throw that in there
and let's say I want to get the dog's
name
well the dog's name is a string up here
say so we're going to just treat it like
a string run another new line and then
to actually get the name we're just
gonna go the dog followed by name that's
it and if we want to get any of the
other values pretty much gonna do the
same thing so if we want to get breed
they've been breed that's a string and
then we're just going to type in breed
down here we don't need the Stars and
then if we want to get average height
there that is and then we're just going
to take the average height copy that
paste that in there and of course there
it is and of course since it is an
integer change that to D and then we can
put it in centimeters and then
could go and get average weight just
like that change this to D maybe throw
in pounds after that and then go average
weight pounds over there and file save
that and then this guy is going to
execute it for me so let's execute it
and there you can see named Cujo st.
Bernard da da da da da da so that's how
you pass the information over and how
you print it out
well now you might be thinking yourself
well exactly how is this information or
this data stored in memory well
basically the struct is just going to
define a template for all of your data
then a struct variable when that is
created is going to define the memory
needed to fit said data and in a second
we're going to see how the memory is
laid out it's quite fixed by the way
so in essence these are going to be
pointers to strings as you see right
there while this data is just going to
be regular integers so they obviously
are just going to point directly at the
data itself while these are pointers
that then point to the strings
themselves okay
so that's how a struct is basically set
up inside a memory so let's go back into
the code and actually look at the memory
addresses where this data is being
stored so let's say for example that we
create another dog struct and let's call
it - Joe - and let's actually give it
the data that is currently in Cujo how
exactly is that going to work well let's
create ourselves another function and
what it is going to do is receive Cujo
and Cujo - and print out the memory
addresses to show how they differ or
don't differ and let's change that to
uppercase MS and copy it and we can come
up here
Lloyd doesn't return anything and then
once again struct dog the dog I'm just
going to copy this and then here I'm
going to go name location in memory and
if I want to print out that location
since this is a string it is going to
act as a pointer so I can just change
this to D and it's going to get the
memory address for me and do exactly the
same thing for the breed read location
and now for the height and weight that's
going to be a little bit different come
in here and just say height and we
location leave these as DS and of course
we're going to go average height copy
that paste it down here an average
weight paste it down here and since
these aren't pointers we're going to go
in here and put the ampersand sign in
front of them and now we can save that
next cute it and here we can see name
location 9 1 400 202 8 well what is
happening with the other Cujo because
remember we created two cujo's well
actually it's pointing to the same space
in memory and you can also see exactly
the difference in between the name and
the breed and the amount of bytes 28 and
33 so there's some information on how
this information is stored in memory so
now I'm going to create another one so
you may be asking yourself well can you
put a struct inside of another struct
yes you can
so let's say that I decide that I want
to store some favorite items for my dog
how do I do that with my semicolon in
there like this let's say that I want to
store favorite food and let's say that I
also want to store best friend well got
that there then what I'm going to do
also so we don't have to keep typing out
struct over and over again there's
something called type def and what type
def allows you to do is shorten struct
dog this whole thing that we've been
typing over and over again to just dog
it's real simple to use all you need to
do is go type def like that and then
take dog the name you want to refer to
and put it at the very end there you go
now you can type in that and it saves a
ton of time you're going to see that in
a second and then to get this guy right
here to be used down inside of here very
easy indeed we're just gonna go struct
dogs faves and then I'm gonna say
favorite things and there we go now you
got a struct inside of a struct now we
can go down inside of main and create
another dog struct remember we don't
have previously we're typing in struct
dog we don't need that anymore because
of type def now we can just type in dog
and let's get a new dog called Benji and
there he is
it's Benji and let's say that he's a
silky Terrier and let's say he is 25
centimeters tall 9 pounds and then how
are we going to put the
inside of there we're gonna put curly
braces inside of there and let's say
that Benji likes to eat meat and Joe
camp is Benji's friend and then put on
both of the curly braces and there you
go
that's how you would create a struct
inside of a struct then you may ask
yourself how are we gonna get access to
that data
now I'm gonna create a method called get
dogs favorites and I'm gonna pass Benji
inside of it
copy that come up here get dogs
favorites void don't need do anything
different just go now well now I can go
dog remember I was typing struck dog
before and there we got dog throwing a
new line and then to get my daddy in my
struct what I'm gonna have to do is
chain my daughter operators so let's say
I got a printf here throw that in there
let's say I want to get a string and
this is gonna be the dog's name and I'm
gonna say loves and meat is gonna be
returned there and his friend is and
I'll throw another new line in there and
then to actually get the dog's name I'm
gonna say the dog dot name just like
before and then to get the dog's
favorite food what I'm gonna do is type
in the dog followed by another dot
favorite things which is in the struct
say favorite things is the variable name
in the struct you wouldn't type in dogs
faves
type in that and then go through all the
favorite things so food and then finally
the doll favorite things and friend and
that's how you would do that execute
Benji loves meat and his friend is but
oh forgot to put in my little s there we
go
Benji loves meat and his friend is Joe
Camp see there it is pretty easy so now
you may ask yourself how do you pass
information to a function I'm going to
create a function and it's going to be
called set dog weight and it's gonna get
passed dog the dog and it's going to get
passed new weight so we want to monitor
Benji's weight I'm going to go in here
and I'm going to
the dog average I'm going to mess up on
purpose here just to show you this is
equal to new weight and then I'm going
to go printf print out that way
weight was changed to D and I'm going to
go the dog average weight pounds and
that looks like that would work right
well we're going to find out we can come
down here and we're going to go to set
dog weight Pass Benji in just like you'd
think we would and let's say Benji shot
up to 11 pounds well then we're gonna do
is go the weight in main and then go
Benji average weight pounds it looks
like I got everything right execute the
weight was changed to 11 so whenever we
are up here see the weight was changed
to 11 and so it was changed the way it
was supposed to be changed right Benji
was passed in and then 11 there you go
however weight in Maine is still 9
remember Benji originally was 9 so what
exactly happened here well basically
it's going to print the old weight
because when a struct is passed to a
function a new struct none of the ones
that is currently created a new struct
is going to actually be created stored
in memory and then the values stored
inside a Benji are going to get put
there then they're going to go up into
this guy that's why it's going to seem
like it worked like it showed right here
but in essence it's a new struct not the
old struct so how are we going to fix
that well the way we fixed it in the
past we're gonna use pointers so let's
come back down and I'm just gonna get
rid of this guy right here so that
doesn't print out on the screen I'm not
going to change this much at all I'm
gonna go into set dog weight and instead
I'm going to change that into set dog
weight PTR which is a reference to
pointer and then because I want a
pointer and % there you go
didn't have to change much then I'm
gonna leave this exactly the same and
not change a single thing so of course
that means I need to come up here and
change our other older weight method
that didn't work come in here
bonk that inside of there now anytime
like I talked about in the previous
tutorial you're going to be receiving a
pointer you have to put in a star to be
able to access the actual data that's
being thrown in there leaving this
exactly the same going to do the same
thing with
the dog down here however when you were
dealing with Struck's you have to
surround them with parentheses just a
rule is actually another way to do this
which I'm going to show you in a second
but that's what you do and then whenever
you want to refer to this information
and print it out remember again
parentheses parentheses you can just
think of these parentheses saying yes
this is a struct or whatever works for
you go like that
save that bounce over here execute it
and you can see both places the weight
was changed to 11 and the weight was
changed inside of a main to 11 as well
so that's how you do it with pointers
now remember what I said there's another
way to do this stuff and that way is we
could actually replace this and get rid
of it and specifically when you're using
data in size of a struct you can go and
draw like a little arrow inside of it
sort of like in essence what this means
is the variable name to average weight
pounds in the struct the dog so we can
do that as well we don't need to change
anything else execute and you can see
the weight was changed to 11 and the way
it was changed all 11 there's a whole
bunch of things about Struck's up next
the think I'm going to cover unions of
course all the codes available in the
description please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
