C++ video tutorial series and finally
we're gonna cover object-oriented
programming in this tutorial as well as
private-public constructors inheritance
and I'm also gonna teach you how to
create two fighters and have them fight
to the death
like always all the code is in the
description underneath this video as
well as a transcript of the things that
I say and I have a lot to do so let's
get into it alright so here we are and
you can see the different libraries I
have included now basically it's very
simple a class is a blueprint that is
going in in which you are going to
describe whatever type of real world
object you want to create okay so a
animal for example is going to have two
things it is going to have attributes
it's going to have things like names and
Heights and weights and it's also going
to have capabilities it's going to have
the ability to eat and run and make
sounds and every real-world object has
those two things and with
object-oriented programming we are going
to describe those real-world objects so
sometimes you want to keep things
private whenever you are and this is our
blueprint right here class is a
blueprint for creating objects so
sometimes you want to keep some of your
variables or fields as they are very
often called private and private just
means that these things will only be
accessible inside of our class so we are
going to say that we want to have a
string and that is going to represent
the name that is an attribute that our
animal will have we are also going to
say that we want to have a height
another thing and we're also going to
say we have a weight so there you go
those are some attributes that are
animal objects all are going to have
also inside of here I'm going to have a
static variable now a static variable is
going to share the same value for all
objects of an animal class every single
object is going to have the same value
the value changes it changes for every
single animal it is a shared value
between all objects of the animal class
so what we're doing here is we are
saying that we want to every single time
a new animal object is created we want
to keep a tally
now often static variables either are
going to have a utility value which
means it's a it's something that the
object itself doesn't do as a real world
object it doesn't keep track animals
can't count and also you can see in that
another reason why things are often
static it is because the real world
object wouldn't have the capability to
do it
animals can't count so that's a good tip
that this is probably something that
should be static now public fields on
the other hand or public methods are
going to be accessible anywhere that the
object itself
is accessible so these are things that
are going to be accessible outside of
our blueprint or our class so if we want
to be able to get the name we are going
to have to have a way for the user to
call for it so we are going to create a
function that goes and gets our name and
returns it so this provides the option
to get the name but at the same time it
protects the data all right what else
can we do well because we don't know
what an object's name is because our
class is going to be created before the
object itself we can refer to all
objects using the this keyword so what
I'm going to do here is I'm going to
allow the user to set the name and I
might want to in the real world protect
the data that is being sent here but in
this situation I'm just gonna let it be
freeform
so if I want to refer to the object by
name but I have no idea what the
object's name is because the class is
created before the object I go this
which refers to this object so I'm going
to say this object's name needs to be
changed to whatever the name was
that was passed into our object and you
could see over here on the right side of
the screen how advanced things are going
to get we are actually going to create
this code that's going to allow for two
attack and yep Hulk died in this
situation so that's something that's
coming up all right so here we go so
this provide us a way for us to get a
value that was passed to our function
set name which is going to be the name
variable and assign it to the object's
name and this guy right here this little
arrow we have here is known as the
pointer operator and it is used to
access and objects fields okay so what
are some other things we're going to
need to do well we're going to need to
provide the option to get the height for
our animal and once again we were just
going to come in here and go return and
height like that we don't need to use
this in this situation the reason why we
use this here is because name say name
is the same there as it is here alright
so what else are we going to do well
we're also going to provide the option
for them to set our height so set height
and this in this situation is going to
be a double that's passed inside of here
and let's just go and give it the same
name once again and then we're gonna say
the height for our object is going to be
equal to whatever height was passed into
this function and then we're gonna do
almost exactly the same thing for our
weight so let's just copy that and let's
change this weight and change this to
wait and wait and wait and wait and wait
and wait and wait so there we go now we
have capability to get those values as
well as to do other things with them
okay we're also going to declare another
function here that is going to allow the
user to set all the values or reset them
because our constructor is going to be
used and as someone pointed out you do
not need to provide a name here with
your prototypes I almost always do it
mainly just because I think it makes the
code more readable but I just wanted to
show you that option because somebody
brought it up in the comments on an
part of my tutorial also we are going to
have a constructor and a constructor is
going to be called each time an object
is created and it is called animal
there's a tip that that is a constructor
it has the same name as the class itself
and you're gonna receive a string and a
double and another double with your
constructor and once again these are
prototypes and the real methods are
gonna be created after the class another
thing I can also create an overloaded
constructor to handle those situations
in which no information is passed no
attributes are passed and that's all you
have to do to have that set you're also
going to have a thing called ad
constructor which is gonna be called
automatically when an object is deleted
or is no longer being used and to create
that you just go tilde and animal this
is kind of pointless because this really
doesn't do anything you know the default
in this situation works just as well as
basically creating a Deconstructor that
doesn't do anything but you could and
very often should create custom
deconstructors anytime in which you
would want to release memory or
different system resources but for right
now we're just gonna keep it like that
also I'm gonna create a static method
and it is going to get the total number
of animals that are created and it's
important to understand that static
methods can only access static fields so
I'm gonna call this get number of
animals and it is just going to return
the NAM of animals whenever it is called
and there you go and this guy right here
is only gonna be able to access this
static right here alright it's not gonna
be able to access anything else because
it belongs to the class and not to the
object and I'm also going to create
another one and this is going to be a
a method that I or function when I say
method I didn't function same thing
field variables same thing
all right I'm creating a function here
or a method here called two string and
I'm specifically creating it so that I
can overwrite it which means that I'm
going to override it later on so I am
going to come in here and go animal and
number of animals and you're going to be
able to refer to your class fields and
methods by going in here with these two
colons you have right here and I'm gonna
set this to zero and that is a static
field that we have inside of there I'm
also going to define our method for set
all and this is just going to be void
and animal and you again you're gonna
use your colons inside of here and set
all and then I'm going to define what is
gonna go inside of here so it's going to
receive a string and that's gonna have
the value of name or then the variable
is going to be called name and I'm also
gonna get height and that's go down to
the next line and we're gonna go to a
double and we're gonna get weight and
then I can come in and set all these
values once again we're gonna use that
pointer operator so we're going to go
this name is going to be equal to name
and this weight is well let's go whoops
like this is gonna be equal to weight
and then we're gonna do the same thing
for height and I own purpose did this in
the wrong order just to show you really
I did I know it's not like a clump out
but I'm specifically gonna cover weight
see it came in as height and weight
doesn't matter in what order you assign
them and then I'm also going to call our
static field inside a hair gnome of
animals and I'm going to increment that
so you can see how we can do all of
those different things now I'm also
going to come in here and create our
constructor so we go animal and animal
and this is going to receive a string of
course and that's going to be name
and a double which is gonna be Heights
and another double which is gonna be
weight and there we go and there's no
reason to type all this out it's going
to basically get all of these things
it's gonna do exactly the same things
what this is so there we go threw that
in there and got all that in order duh
is everything cool yes it's fine oh I
say I put a comma in there by accident
okay so there's our constructor what
else we need a need to create inside of
here I am going to also create another
constructor that's gonna handle the
default which is what's gonna happen if
they don't pass in any attributes and
I'm just gonna copy this guy right here
and paste that down inside of there and
then for the name I'm just going to put
this and I'm just gonna give some
default values so this is gonna handle
if the user creates an animal and
doesn't do anything with it all right so
what else we got well we have our D
constructor I'm just gonna move this up
here and you can pause the video of
course I'm going a little bit too quick
for you to type it in or you can get the
code that's in the description so for
the Deconstructor you're just gonna put
a tilde inside of there right like this
and the D constructor like I said you
could release system resources and
things but I am just going to come in
and I'm gonna print out a message so I'm
gonna say animal and let's maybe we want
to put our it the name of the animal
inside here so we can go this and you
can put a space between that pointer
operator if you'd like Eames what else
could we do let's just say destroyed so
destroyed and there we go
and just throw a new line inside of
there and that's perfectly fine and I'll
get into more advanced things with
deconstructors later on I also created
to string up inside of here and I said
that I specifically wanted to string to
be overwritten by other methods so I'm
gonna throw this inside of here or
actually it's gonna be overwritten by by
a dog class that's gonna come here later
on when we talk about inheritance but
for now this is just gonna come in and
it's going to print out this and I can
throw a space in there and just again
just show that that's possible whoops
there we go
and is and what else can we do let's go
and print out all the information about
our animal here so height and then I'm
gonna go centimeters tall and get the
weight as well this once again weight
and if you have any questions leave them
in the description below and I will
definitely answer them I answer every
question that I get but understand that
YouTube only sends me new comments if
you reply to a comment I will not see
that for some unknown reason okay so
there we go we have to string working
now if we would actually want to use
this we have to go down into main and to
create a new animal object let's call it
Fred just go like that that's it pretty
simple and straightforward and you can
see here that we did not set any of the
values so it's gonna use this default
right here you can you know what the
values for Fred are gonna be because you
can see them right there but we could
come in and we could say something like
Fred dot - string and that's gonna print
out all the information we have on Fred
and you can see it doesn't have a name
it doesn't have a height and so forth
but it prints out whatever we've got
right there and now let's go and give
Fred a name and all this other stuff so
if we want to set all those things we
just go set and height you can see we're
using the dot operator and not that
pointer operator and let's say he is
third has a height of 33 centimeters and
Fred has a weight that is going to be
equal to 10 kilograms and Fred obviously
has a name
wild guess what that name is it's Fred
hands let's go and output the
information again just to show that yes
indeed we went and change those values
and you can see it first off it does
nothing and then it goes and goes fred
is 33 centimeters tall 10 kilograms and
weight and you can also see the
Deconstructor was created and fred was
sadly destroyed all right so we got all
of that set up let's go and do another
demonstration let's say that you would
want to use the constructor how would
you do that well you could go animal and
Tom and then you just go and call the
constructor so Tom and let's say 36 and
15 and let's go and print out this
information yeah let's just go Tom to
string there we go and run it and you
can see that Thomas started all that
stuff prints out and then Tom was
destroyed and then fred was destroyed
okay so cool stuff now what I'm going to
do is I am going to create a new class
and it is going to be called dog and dog
is going to inherit everything that is
an animal in the dog class so it's going
to get all of the fields as well as all
the methods that are defined in animal
now we can of course go and create new
ones so we're gonna create a string for
example that's gonna be a sound and we
can come in here and give it a default
value of wolf we're also going to be
able to have our public fields and
methods as well and so let's go and
create something called make sound and
put that inside of there and you're
gonna be able to get access to the name
for your animal just by referring to it
so let's say we go standard C outs and
we can just go the dog comes and then to
get the name we can go this and gets
name and
we can go and also reference says
reference the sound in exactly the same
way so just it's almost as if it just
exists right inside of the dog anything
that's inside of the animal because
that's the way that it does exist all
right so then we'll go and throw our new
line inside of there so we have a public
function we're also going to be able to
create let's just move this up we're
gonna be able to create a constructor
that is specific to our dog so we're
gonna be able to get a string and a
double another double all the things
that animal has and then we're gonna get
an additional thing which is gonna be
the sound that our animal or our dog is
gonna make we can also create a default
constructor and let's also have our
default constructor whenever it is
created let's go and call the animal
default constructor and have it go and
initialize everything that was done in
the animal so that's this guy right here
it's gonna call this function and
automatically even if our dog default
constructor is called all of this stuff
is gonna be done okay and it is very
easy to do that all you need to do is to
come in and just go and put the colon
here one colon followed by animal and
that will take care of that and what
else can we do well we want to overwrite
two strings so that it does dog specific
things so I'm gonna go void and to
string I'm not gonna create ad
constructor this time I'm just gonna let
the default work because it works
perfectly fine and what else we gonna do
I think that's it so now outside of that
class definition we are going to create
our constructor so dog and colon dog and
I'm gonna go standard and string and
name
and then we'll get our height as well
and let's go next line and double and
weight and then we're also going to our
dog makes sounds so we're gonna go and
create a sound for it now if you want to
have the constructor in animal go ahead
and handle initializing that stuff
you're gonna put a colon here after that
and then you're gonna follow that up
with animal and then you're gonna pass
in all of the things that animal can
initialize for us so it can initialize
name height and weight and it will so
let's go and get this and then that
leaves you with the thing that it cannot
initialize which is going to be our
sound so we're gonna a sound is equal to
whatever the sound was that was passed
inside of here alright so we got our dog
constructor going here everything's
looking pretty good we're also gonna
overwrite to string so we're gonna go
void dog and to string and we're going
to print out all kind of stuff so what
are we gonna gonna copy the to string
that's up here sona that type all that
out i think i can do a lot of stuff
let's just go and copy that come back
down here and paste that inside of here
so we're gonna go and get the name or
actually you know what I'm going I'm not
gonna be able to access that so be the
reason why is because name is private
height is private and weight is private
now if this was set as protected I would
be able to get that so let's just save
that and remember whenever it was giving
me all these errors down here inside of
here well now it's not and the reason
why is anything that inherits I'm gonna
keep this as private though just to make
life a little bit more complicated and
now we come down here you're gonna see
see there's errors well you might not be
able to say but these are all underlined
and it specifically is saying let's
click on the error message unable to
resolve identifier name it's private so
the inherited class which is dog cannot
access it so what are we gonna need to
do we're gonna have to call get name
so let's come in and let's
and call gets name and there we go that
problem was resolved pretty easily
actually and then we'll go and get
height and then we'll also go and get
weight and there we go
so we were able to access them even
though we couldn't access them directly
then we'll come down here and we will
get rid of that and we'll say and says
and put a space inside of there and then
we can go and get our sound that our dog
makes so sound and then we can follow
that up with a new line and there we are
so we wrote that and everything looks
good now let's save that and come down
here and test everything in our main
function
so let's go and let's create a new dog
object so I'm gonna call my dog spot I'm
gonna pass spot inside of here
and 38 and 16 and we'll change the wolf
so that we can say that it was indeed
changed and what else do you want to do
well let's go and call to string cuz
that's the easiest way to get some
things going here so whoops we are got
that saved then let's run it OOP got an
error here why did I do forgot to put in
up get height right there that's what
the error message is soon and run it
again and here you can see spot is 38
centimeters tall 16 kilograms and weight
and then you can see that spot was
destroyed them and if we whoops let's
move this over here a little bit and you
could say and says wolf and you can see
that spot was destroyed Thomas destroyed
and Fred was destroyed
all right so cool stuff last thing we
want to do here before we move on to our
extremely complicated problem is I want
to call my static method that is going
to tell us how many different animal
objects were created ultimately see if
you can guess what that is so I'm gonna
go number of animals and come out of
this and then to access the number of
animals you just go animal and gets Nam
of animals and throw that in there
and there we go
and run it and look at a number of
animals is equal to three and the three
includes not only dog spawn you know the
dog object name spot but also the two
objects that were created and the reason
why is because we were calling the
constructor for animal all right so good
stuff and up next we are going to cover
a pretty complex problem that should be
a lot of fun to make and is specifically
how to create two warriors and then have
them fight to the death I'm gonna give
you a little bit of a hint don't know if
you remember this from before but
basically this is the output that I want
I want you to have two warriors and in
this situations one named Thor ones
named Hulk it's much better to allow the
user to input information and this is
exactly what's gonna print out on the
screen I'm going to come in here though
and actually do the main part for you so
that you can see the basic what your
gonna do now anytime we're doing
something like this in which a bunch of
random things are gonna be happening
it's probably going to be a good idea to
use random number generators and here I
want to seed my random number generator
then what we're gonna do is we're going
to have a warrior object and it's going
to be something like Thor and four is
going to be receiving the name for he's
going to receive a health amount he is
going to receive an attack amount and he
is going to receive a block amount and
then we're going to do the same thing
for our Hulk
so Hulk there we are throw Hulk inside
of there and Hulk there's there and then
let's say Hulk has more health but maybe
um Hulk doesn't have as much powers Thor
and maybe not as great of an ability to
block all right then after you create
those two things what you're gonna do is
you're gonna have another class that's
going to represent your battle and
there's going to be a function inside of
it called start fight and you are going
to pass in Thor and you're gonna pass in
Hulk and it's just going to work and
that is the entire main part say all
nice and neat
it is it's fantastic so what I want you
to do you can either I'm gonna give you
another tip if you're really confused
about this which is just I'm gonna do a
little basic walkthrough without any
code to give you a little bit of a hint
otherwise you can pause your screen now
and try to create this or get just one
more simple hint okay so the hint is
that you are going to have a class that
is gonna called order of course that's
not much of a hint though and inside of
it you are going to have two functions
and they are going to be public
obviously so you're gonna have a public
function and it is going to be known as
attack I'm not gonna tell you what the
code is inside of it you're just gonna
have to know that it's going to be
called attack and you're also going to
have another function inside of it's
called block and there you go and I
think it's all I'm gonna give you a hint
wise in regards to what your warrior
class is gonna look like you guys have
been asking me for a more complicated
problem well I'm giving it to you then
you're also going to have a class called
battle obviously because you know I just
hold it right there it's not much of a
hint and inside of it you're going to
have a start fight now basically what's
gonna happen is you're going to pass
warriors into the start fight function I
don't I just go in here and do this so
you're gonna have and let's make it
static just like here because it makes
sense it's basically the battle class is
going to be a utility class so it's
gonna be static it's not gonna return
anything and this is gonna be--start
fight and it's going to receive both of
the Warriors in some special way and it
is then going to compare attack values
to block values and is going to spit out
a result and also it's going to provide
a way to end our attack and say that the
battle is over and one of the Warriors
won and the other one didn't win or died
and then on top of that you might want
to go and create another function
and it also should be static you might
choose to do this in a different way
than I did and it is basically going to
return something or not and I called it
get attack result and it's basically
going to receive two warriors and it is
going to calculate damage and so forth
and so on
and decide who wins all right so I think
I gave you enough tips for you to be
able to stumble through this at least
and give it a go pause your video right
now and otherwise I'm gonna show you
exactly how I solved this kind of
complicated problem alright so back up
inside of here what different types of
things are we going to need for our
warrior well public what is going to be
some attributes our warrior will have
well it's yeah you know what let's keep
everything private and protected so I'm
gonna say private and the two attributes
of warrior is gonna have is it's going
to have an attack maximum and it's also
going to have a block maximum and that's
doing it all along with these two guys
right here and and I think that's all
that I need for that what also we gonna
need well obviously I'm gonna keep this
public because I don't think this is
information that needs to be protected
I'm going to have the name be defined
inside of here and also we're gonna need
access to change the health so to keep
things kind of easy I could do the
setters and the getters and so forth but
I'm just gonna go in here and put health
inside of there now what else do we need
well we're gonna need a constructor for
a warrior and that is going to be
structured like warrior and we're gonna
go and we're gonna define it directly
inside here just to show you that that
can be done as well
so it's gonna receive a name it's going
to receive a health amount it's also
going to receive a attack maximum amount
and it's going to receive a block
maximum amount what's going throw that
inside of there and then I need to set
all these values you know how I do that
a pointer operator is going to be equal
to the name that was provided and I'm
gonna do the same for all these other
guys
so go health and health and we'll also
do the attack maximum just go and copy
that and attack maximum and attack
maximum the names are the same right yes
and block max as well so there is our
constructor that it's going to receive
those values and assign them to each of
our warrior objects okay so what are we
gonna do down inside of attack well
we're just going to do something very
simple we're just gonna go return and
where you get a random value and we are
going to do modulus and this to get our
attack amount that are different words
are gonna do okay pretty simple I mean
one line of code in a function pretty
easy then what are we gonna do well
we're just gonna change this to block
max and that is going to go and allow us
to block attacks and guess what that's
it
there is our your entire warrior class
pretty simple and this is a pretty good
example of the type of classes you
should try to make so there um we went
and created that now we get down into
our battle class what are we gonna do
here so basically we're going to pass
warriors into our function start fight
right here and we're going to pass them
by reference why are we doing that we're
passing them by reference so that we
will be able to change the values and
the values will stay the same so how do
we pass by reference I've covered this
in the past of course if you're getting
anything any of this wrong or anything
don't worry about it it's a very
complicated problem this is a
challenging one so everyone's one we
need to challenge ourselves to think in
new ways and I'm gonna say warrior two
and and I'm very very doubtful that
you're solving this exactly the same way
that I'm solving it because you know I
don't know your might be new alright
this or whatever so then what I'm gonna
do I'm going to use a technique that I
used before and this is going to
continue to loop forever until one of
our warriors health goes below zero so
I'm going to use the wild true
and then inside of here I'm going to
create the situation in which we are
going to end it so I'm gonna go get
attack result and get attack result is
going to pass over warrior one and
warrior two then what it's gonna do is
it's going to compare so I'm gonna go
compare to and what I'm gonna do here
just because I think this makes the code
easy to understand I'm actually gonna
have the function get attack result pass
back a string that's going to say game
over and if game over is indeed pass
back it will signal that the game is
indeed over and here I'm using compare
anytime you compare two things and they
are equal compare the compare function
is going to return the value of zero and
that's what I did right there all right
so we got all of that all set up and
then what I'm gonna do as you saw in the
output sample output that I provided
before if indeed one of the warriors
triumphs over the other one let's throw
a new line inside of there I'm going to
end this and then I call break to kill
the whole entire while loop and end our
program so pretty cool stuff then what
I'm gonna do because I have two warriors
say the first time I'm attacking with
one word a second time I'm going to
attack with the other warrior so I'm
gonna come in here and we like this and
I'm just gonna change this to two and
one
so where one's gonna get a chance to
attack warrior two and then one or two
is gonna get a chance to attack warrior
one and that's all I need to do
everything else is exactly the same now
what I need to do is figure out how I am
going to handle get attack result what
am I gonna do to figure out how that is
done well I'm going to receive a
reference to the same warrior objects so
that whenever I change one it's going to
affect the other one and I'm gonna go
over and again reference and warrior and
I'm gonna call this warrior B and inside
of here I'm going to go and get our
attack amount so I'm gonna go warrior
a attack amount is going to be equal to
warrior a tack and remember that's a
random value that is being created for
us and then I'm gonna do a similar thing
for warrior B so I'm gonna go warrior
because I have to figure out what his
his or her block amount is so there's
the block amount and to do that I just
call block on this and there we go now I
got that okay then what am I gonna need
to do well I need to figure out how much
damage has been done so I'm gonna go
damage to warrior B is equivalent to and
I think I'm gonna round this up so I'm
gonna go to ceiling and warrior a attack
amount - warrior that V block amount
okay got that
all set I also want to protect against a
negative value coming out of this so
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to use a
ternary operator so I'm gonna say damage
to warrior B is going to be equal to and
that's gonna be I'm just gonna copy this
instead of constantly copy or type this
in here so I'm gonna go damage to
warrior B is less than or equal to zero
in the situation in which that comes
back is true I want to set the value as
0 otherwise I'm gonna let it remain
exactly what it is so that just make
sure I don't get a negative attack value
which could throw this into an infinite
loop and what else do I want to do oh
well I'm gonna go and subtract the
damage from the health so I'm gonna go
warrior be and health and that is gonna
be equal to whatever warrior B's health
is prior to the attack - whatever damage
to warrior be was so we got that in
there and then I'm the rest of its just
gonna be printing out all the
information so I'm gonna say print F and
I'm gonna want to put in the name of the
warrior and say attacks and get the
other warrior's name
and deals and then I want to get the
amount of damage that was done and then
of course damaged followed by a new line
then I just put in the different things
I'm gonna say warrior a name and UPS I
want to change this I want this as a
string for print aft so if you have a
string like this to get this to work
with string F using the percent and S
sign I almost forgot about this you're
gonna have to put a C underscore T or in
there like that to have that show up and
then I'm gonna do exactly the same thing
for warrior B so that's the reward be
inside of there and then I'm going to
have output damage to or your be
whatever that unheard-of value is so
let's throw that inside of there and
there we go cool stuff so what else are
we down oh that I wanted to print out
how much damage has been done to our our
warrior that we have here so once again
I'm gonna go % and s let's move this up
the whole way so you can see everything
at once is down to and then I'm gonna
print out the health amount that the
warrior is after the attack and I am
then going to go and get warrior B's
name just right here and paste that
inside of there and then I'm also going
to go and get the health amount for that
warrior so I have to go
warrior B and health and then what else
I'm gonna have to do well if the health
is below zero then I know I have to pass
back game over otherwise I'll pass back
nothing or I'll pass back and I'm
something so I'm gonna go if the health
for the warrior is less than or equal to
zero well that means the warrior is dead
so that means I have to handle that so
I'm gonna say print a message like I did
before so I'm gonna say print F and
we're gonna go as whoops has died and
and then we'll print out the other
warrior's name is victorious
a new line and then we'll print this out
so that would be warrior be it's gonna
be the warrior that died in this
situation and then warrior a is going to
be the warrior that continues alive so
like this and like that and anything
else we need well yes of course I'm
gonna have to go return and game over
and that is a signal that the game is
over and otherwise I don't really need
to return anything but I'm just gonna go
and return fight again just because I
like the way that looks in the code it
makes code a little bit more readable
alright so did it all and please
whatever if you got this to work in any
type of code that you you know did on
your own please leave that in the
comments I'd greatly appreciate seeing
what you guys came up with I think
that's very cool and it also helps other
people in different ways of thinking so
let's run it and see if I made any
errors I probably did yes I did
okay C++ requires a type specifier for
all declarations this is line 47 let's
see what I accidentally typed inside of
here oh I see I forgot to put in that I
was going to be returning a string all
right I got that let's run it anything
else
yes line 63 it says right here now I
accidentally typed in two equal signs
save it and run it and there we go looks
like it work beautifully so we're gonna
have Thor attacking Hulk Soga has
authority talkin does five damage Hulk
is down to 130 health what do you start
with 135 looks good then hawk attacks
Thor deals zero damage you must have
missed or Thor throw up some sort of
storm or something in his way so where
attacks Hulk does ten damage down to 120
and you can see that they are attacking
each other over and over and over again
until finally Thor is down to negative
seven health we might want to correct
that and have that be zero if it is
equal to or less than zero but either
way it's fine as far as I'm concerned
and Thor has died and Hulk is a victim
yes so like I said please if you went
and did this problem and you solved it
in some other neat way please leave that
in the comments so I greatly appreciate
it hopefully you guys enjoyed this
tutorial it was fun to make and like
always please leave your questions and
comments below the last till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
