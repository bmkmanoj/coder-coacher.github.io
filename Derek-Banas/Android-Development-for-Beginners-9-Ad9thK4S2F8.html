9 of my Android development for
beginners tutorial today I'm going to
start creating a big application this is
going to be a pretty
professional-looking weather application
by the time we're done with it what
we're going to focus on in this tutorial
however is how to use JSON weather data
and how to pull it into our application
now if you've never heard of JSON it's
not really that complicated it's just
used to transmit data using key valued
pairs and by key I mean for example
we're going to have current temperature
and the value is going to be 37 degrees
or whatever it is okay so the key just
represents the name for what the data is
and what we're going to get into in this
tutorial is how to pull that into our
application and then we're going to in
the part 10 figure out how to organize
that data and then import 11 and
whatever we're going to actually make a
professional-looking
application so let's go and jump in and
look at exactly what we're going to have
by the end of part 9 ok so in this
tutorial this is what we're going to
make we're going to pull all this raw
data from weather gov and then we are
going to cycle through it now what's
going on here is this JSON data which is
just key value pairs so you have right
here creation date and then right under
it you have a date and a time
creation date local and this is a credit
and then you're going to have all your
interesting information like weather a
few clouds weather image windchill and
all of this data what our goal is going
to be and actually in the next part of
the tutorial we're going to do it is to
cycle through all this data and pull out
just the pieces that we want which we
are eventually going to use in our big
professional looking weather application
okay so at the end of part 10 this is
what we're going to have we're going to
be able to in real time get the current
location temperature weather all this
information we're going to be able to
get ourselves an image we're going to be
able to pull in late afternoon that's
going to be dynamic we're then going to
be able to pull in information about the
weather late afternoon tonight and
Saturday all this stuff is I'm percent
dynamic and then on top of that we're
going to be able to click on refresh and
grab latitude and longitude so refresh
now you can see latitude and longitudes
there all of this information is all
brand new and it was all downloaded
dynamically
can I say dynamic more so it's kind of
neat so that is our goal is to pull this
in and then that's all the heavy lifting
work that's all the real work and then
everything else is going to be placing
these values in the right part of the
screen to make it look professional okay
so now you know what we are going to
have by the end of part 9 and this
tutorial and of course all of the blocks
and every single thing links to it is in
the description so it would probably be
good to have it in front of you this is
going to make a lot more sense if you
have it in front of you so I have a lot
to do so let's get into it okay so
you're probably wondering what exactly
JSON data looks like or you you might
know most of my people that watch my
tutorials know exactly what it looks
like but either way here it is this is
the exact data we're going to be using
and this is where it's coming from
forecast dot weather.gov map click PHP
blah blah blah blah blah I'll put a link
to this and then you're going to put in
latitude and then you're going to put in
longitude and of course we're going to
dynamically generate all that and then
this part here is going to determine
that this is going to be JSON data we're
getting this part right here and then
everything gets a little bit funky
inside of App Inventor whenever we pull
this data in so let's specifically go
and look at what that is going to look
like ok so this is just like an overview
you will completely understand this by
the end of part 10 but I just wanted to
give you sort of a rough overview of
exactly how the stat is going to be
organized now when this data is pulled
into our application this guy right here
operational mode and this is just going
to be lists of data so this is going to
be the main
main list of data if we wanted the
operational mode which is actually
nothing that is actually going to be
labeled as eight so the eighth item in
our list source name is going to be 10
and up drawing this with my mouse so
bear with me
creation date is going to be number one
in the list creation date local was
going to be number two and of course
we're not going to be paying attention
any of this production center this is
Pittsburgh Pennsylvania is where I'm at
I might pull the location information
and display that from there where I
might decide that I don't want to and
three is the credit and then weather.gov
this guy right here is seventh in the
list and then we get into location which
is going to be sixth in our list and I
doubt I'm going to get anything from
there because I'm going to get my
latitude and longitude inside of my
actual device time is going to be eleven
and this is going to be very important
because I want to dynamically pull in
this afternoon tonight and Friday so
that you know that can be dynamic I
don't you know have today tonight
tomorrow what happens whenever it's
tonight well you know see the problems
so I'm actually dynamically going to
pull in this afternoon tonight and
Friday and then if we cycle down through
here this is where we get to the data
part of this data and this is going to
be very good information and that's
going to be five and it's going to have
things like the highs and the low highs
and low that's what these guys are right
here will have weather that will also be
great information to be able to get to
but this is actually weather and
temperature and pop these are actually
going to be list items inside of the
data list so each one of these is going
to be its own list this is going to be
number five list inside of our total
list and then inside of that this is
going to be item 1 2 3 and so forth and
so on so hopefully that makes sense and
then I'm going to get more and more and
more into all of these and by the end of
this tutorial you're going to know what
all of these numbers are I just wanted
to give you a brief introduction to
exactly what the JSON data is going to
look like and where I'm getting it from
ok so now that I covered all that what
I'm going to need to do is in that list
the main list that has all of our data
inside of it there's actually
to be 11 items and by the end of this
tutorial what I want to do is list
inside of our application
those 11 items what their numbers are
just showed you the numbers a second ago
and then how all the data is organized
inside of them so that I will be able to
traverse all that data and pull out just
what I wanted so I'm going to keep this
quite simple I'm going to come in up
that funky sort of thing happened here
that sometimes happens inside of App
Inventor where I don't have all my
components all aligned right so I'm just
going to hit reload and hit continue and
this is called the weather app look up
say it went and automatically got it and
now everything's in the right order good
thing that little errors like that
happen okay so now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go into layout and I'm
just going to get a whole bunch of
horizontal arrangement some drag that
inside of there come over here to user
interface I'm just going to be using
labels so I'm going to grab this label
throw that inside of there go grab
another label and drag it and throw it
inside of there okay so they're going to
be side by side and I'm going to give
these guys pretty normal names so this
first one I am just going to call it
well I'm going to inside of the text for
it I'm going to type in JSON one and
then I'm going to click on rename rename
this button and I'm going to give it the
name of JSON label one and there we go
and then I'm going to come in and give
this a name also over in the text area
for that I'm just going to call this
data and then come down here click on
rename and then I'm going to call this
JSON data label one so there's going to
be next to each other and now you can
see data is in there in JSON 1 okay so
just to keep this nice and simple I'm
going to generate 11 of those remember
there's 11 items in the main JSON data
list so I want to figure out what data
is in each one of those okay so I went
ahead and I created 11 of these so now
I'm just going to go in here and give
them the same names so just to keep this
nice and simple well select that come
over here JSON 1 I'm going to copy that
and I'm going to come in here and change
all these names real quickly so paste
that inside of there
pull that JSON to I'm going to select
that one call this JSON 3 so just so you
understand all I'm trying to do
is figure out exactly how all of this
data is stored meaning data place one
data place two data place three that's
all I'm doing here so paste that inside
of there and you'll be able to use this
for numerous other different ways of
parsing data and that just means making
sense of it pretty much and eleven there
we go so you have all the right names
for all those and now I'm going to go in
here and give them the right values as
well so this is going to be JSON label
one I'm in here click done I click on
rename and this is JSON label one so I'm
going to call this JSON label to there
we go
copy that and I'm just gonna click
through each one of these click on
rename paste change that to three rename
this one's going to be four and I think
you get the point just renaming all
these so it'll be easy to see them over
in the block section ok got all those
renamed and then I'm going to go through
and do exactly the same thing with this
I'm going to give these all the value of
data right like that and I always
consider doing stuff like this sort of
like it's a game and in the end if I
play the game right and solve it then I
got myself a nice little customized that
okay so all those are now data
this is JSON data label one I'm gonna do
exactly the same thing see JSON data
label one so go and change all those
click on rename JSON data label to JSON
data label 3 and I'm gonna do that for
all these and then the last one JSON
data label 11 okay so the hell will have
good names and all the boring stuff sout
of the way I'm actually going to throw
in two more labels just grab a label
drag it in there drop there this is
going to be latitude and longitude and
I'm going to grab another button throw
it inside of there and that is going to
be for refresh and I'm going to just
call this latitude what I'm really doing
here is just working through testing
this longitude because if my names make
sense then everything else is going to
be good rename this to latitude label
rename this to longitude label and then
the text here is going to be refresh and
then I'm going to call it refresh button
so rename refresh button
okay so the whole entire interface is
set up so now I'm going to go in the
block section and start making things
work okay the first thing that I'm going
to need to do is I am going to need to
generate this URL which links to the
JSON data so go into App Inventor
and I'm going to create myself a whole
bunch of variables inside of here
they're going to store that information
so initialize global name and I am going
to give this guy the name of whether URL
beginning and that's going to be the
beginning of this URL up until the
latitude and longitude information so
all of that right there
I'm going to copy it and then inside of
here quote boom and there we go and I'm
going to piece this together as I go on
here then I'm going to have to have my
latitude value inside of it and I'm just
going to give it a default first off the
name for this is going to be latitude
value because that's in the URL itself
and I'm just going to put a quote here
and I'm going to could 40.4 406 which is
like pittsburgh which is where i live
and then i need to get the next part of
this URL which is going to be the
longitude part right here so i'm just
going to come in here and i'm going to
select just that little tiny piece and
this is just so everything is all nice
and neat inside here create a new
variable pull this out of here drop it
right there weather URL and i'm just
going to call this longitude because
that's pretty much what it is quote
inside of there drop that there enter
and there you go and then i'm going to
have a latitude value i can duplicate
this as well save time so let's just say
long or yeah longitude value there we go
and then let's set this to negative
seven nine point nine nine five eight
and then if we go back to our URL this
is going to be very important because
this is going to be used to pull the
information into our application so i'm
going to select that last part come now
side here duplicate it and then this guy
is
going to be called whether URL and URL
and then inside of here I can put the
end of it
so that's going to allow me to
dynamically sort of pull that
information together and create the URL
then what I'm going to need to do is
whenever the application starts I'm
going to have to initialize a whole
bunch of different things so when
screen1 initialize we've done this
before
if any of this doesn't make sense it's
because you didn't watch part 1 of this
tutorial series where I go over location
sensors initializing the screen and
things like that so what am I going to
do here well the very first thing I want
to do is I want to take the URL and use
the web component to go and get data
because I know that it doesn't matter if
the location sensor works or doesn't
work it's still going to be able to go
out and get this information so before I
do that I'm going to create a custom
function that's going to do that for me
so I'm gonna go procedure pull this out
of here rag it down here drop it in if
it's at all confusing just stick with it
here for a little bit it will all start
to make sense and inside of this well I
have to first go back into the designer
because I forgot to pull over the web
components all right so what am I going
to need here I'm going to need some
sensors I'm going to need my location
sensor so drag that over there drop that
inside of there I'm also going to need
the ability to connect to the Internet
and pull in my JSON data so the web
component is going to do that for me I'm
also going to be communicating with the
user with dialog boxes or in this
situation App Inventor calls them
notifiers drop that in there and then
finally activity starter is also going
to be used and that is also going to be
under connectivity and that is going to
be activity starter drop that in there
all right so there's all my non visible
components right there jump back over
into blocks and now we're going to be
using our web component so cycle whole
way down inside of here and here it is
right this guy and then I'm specifically
going to set the URL that it's going to
be pulling data from there you can see
right there JSON texty code we're going
to use that later on zoom out of here a
second and then come down here which
says web URL that guy dragged
out of there and I'm guessing you know
what I'm going to put in there I'm going
to put the URL this is where all the
data is coming from but to do so I'm
going to need to use a join which means
text because that's multiple lines so
grab that and then I'm going to need one
two three four five lines so I'm going
to click inside of here and I'm going to
create five strings so I can put my
entire URL inside of there okay great
now what I'm going to do is just go in
through all these different guys so I'm
gonna go this right there grab that
that's the beginning of the URL this guy
right here is going to be the initial
latitude this is going to be the initial
well the little thing before the
longitude this one right here is going
to be the actual longitude value and
this is going to be the end of the URL
okay so I said where I want to get the
data from now I need to tell it to go
get it so that's also in the web
component click on this and I'm going to
call get and that's going to get all
that data for me and bring it right into
my application for me I don't have to
think about anything then after it gets
it I need to do a couple other things
which is basically I need to check that
I got the right data and then I need to
cycle through and in this situation I'm
going to put it into all those different
little boxes so after got text that
means I got what I was searching for
what I asked for
drop that inside of there and I'm gonna
have to do a couple little checks inside
of this response code is going to tell
me if it got the data without errors and
what you need to do is check that the
response code is 200 just like you
saying to somebody hey did you send me
the right information I wanted and they
say yes well in this situation a yes is
equal to the number 200 so what I need
to do here is I need to do certain
things if certain conditions are met and
other things if other conditions are met
that means I need to do a control and
get an if then drag that drop it inside
of there and I need to check for
equality and one of the equality's is
going to be a number
I'm checking the Equality to see if the
value of response code is equal to 200
so that means I need to go into math
grab this guy right here
if drop that right there the response
code get the response code drop it
inside of there is equal to I'm going to
go into math I'm gonna get myself a
number whoops didn't get it don't think
I did there it is Robert drag it down
here drop it in there and the specific
number I'm looking for is two hundred
two hundred means yes everything is fine
and for now I'm not going to worry about
if it is an equal to if it is fine then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
start decoding the data however like I
said previously all of that JSON data
all of that data is going to be a list
of less so you know just a list a list
so that means I want to store that
information so I'm going to get and
create another variable drag that out of
there just drop it anywhere and this is
going to be called weather data and yes
you can store lists of lists inside of
here however if you're going to create a
list you need to actually create it
create empty lists grab this drag it
drop it inside of there and then we're
going to come back down to this guy so
just so you see it it's weather data and
it's going to end up being lists of less
okay and like I said all these blocks
are available a link in the description
all right so now what I need to do is
come in here and actually start getting
all of the data and putting it back in
the right boxes what I'm going to be
doing I'm in a designer again I'm going
to see what is list item number one in
the JSON data and put that data here
what is list item number two and put
that data here and do that over and over
again so back in the blocks now the very
first thing I need to do here well let's
go and get this and I'm going to go into
weather data and I'm going to say set
global weather data grab this guy drag
them down here and then come back down
here again alright so if we got a
response go to 200 that means we got our
data and everything looks fine then what
I need to do is decode it so to decode
it I'm going to need the web component
again and I'm going to go specifically
this is JSON data so I'm going JSON text
decode this right here drag it drop it
right there
then inside of that response content
that's a fancy word for saying all the
data you requested so
I'm taking all the data I requested and
I want it put into the list of Lists
which is called weather data then what I
need to do is start setting all of these
guys so meaning in the designer view so
I'm going to go set right here JSON data
label one this guy I need to set the
text for it so drag it drop it right
there and specifically I want to grab
the weather data and figure out what
index number one is inside of that so
remember whether that is just a list so
we're going to come in to lists and
let's say select list item you could use
length of list and put the weather data
inside there do that for homework just
to see that there are indeed 11 items
inside of there but select list item
list and the specific index that I want
remember there's 11 items drag that
right there and inside of here I'm going
to go and get global weather data is
what I'm looking for so we come up here
grab this again get global weather data
drag it down there and this is the list
that I want to work from drop it right
there
and then I specifically want index
number one so math number grab it drop
it in there one so there is list item
number one then if I want to do this for
all the other ones remember there's 11
of them I can just do a duplicate drag
that right there change this to label
JSON data label to where that is and
then in this situation I want the second
item in the list and then if I want to
do it again and duplicate it number I've
11 of them come in here do this and am I
going to be able to get to it yes JSON
data label 3 there it is and we can do
that for all of them and that's also
your homework remember I have the
completed blocks in a link in the
description underneath the video so
there it is do that for all 11 of them
and you're going to see exactly what I
said you'll see previously - beginning
in the tutorial alright so let's get all
this information drag it out of here and
then whenever we initialize the
application we need to call well this
guy right here which I forgot to give it
a name its name is going to be called
get whether that's ah there that is and
if I want to call procedure let's go
over to procedures call get weathered
data and it's going to call for all that
stuff that we just define there to
execute and then I need to basically set
up the location sensor so that I can get
dynamic information I covered this
previously but I'm going to blow through
in literally in Part one and two I
covered location sensors but I'm going
to blow through this really quickly just
to give you a review so if I want to use
the location sensor just come over here
click on location sensor and I'm going
to look specifically well first off what
I do is I need to verify that the
location sensor is enabled and turn it
on well to always get this to work you
need to do something a little bit crazy
you need to before you use a location
sensor you need to first shut it off I
know that sounds silly but I talked
about this before and logic remember
that look there's true it doesn't matter
change that to false first we're going
to shut it off and then we are going to
change it back to true so duplicate that
drop that right there and turn it on to
true so the location sensor works a
little bit weird but either way that
always works then what we need to do is
verify the GPS is a potential provider
of data for our location sensor so if we
need to do in if-then-else well click on
control if-then-else drop that right
there then we need to get the available
providers for latitude and longitude
information we're going to go into the
location sensor again there it is and
we're going to look specifically for
available providers and we're going to
also this is alt text so we're going to
have to go into text and look
specifically for the list of available
providers is one of them GPS so we're
going to say contains text this guy
right here drop that inside of there and
then take the available providers list
and then put in the very specific part
we want which is GPS there that is
whoops green one a little crazy there we
go got it back so we're looking for GPS
in the available providers put that in
place then if GPS is an available
provider we are going to lock our
provider name for our latitude and
longitude information location data and
quickly provide our name set provider
name drop that inside of there and
that's going to be GPS duplicate drop it
in there and then for the location
sensor once we set that we want to use
GPS we need to lock it and we need to go
to provider locked set drop that right
there
grab this nice true up here duplicate it
lock it there we go then we can set our
latitude and longitude information that
we had in the designer view if we want
to jump over there real quickly this
right here latitude and longitude right
there come back over into blocks and
here we are in here slick through all
this stuff there is latitude label there
we go set latitude label text there it
is grab it drop it right there would
actually probably be a good idea also to
set the latitude value up here so get
this and change this to set drop that
right there there we go
- and latitude value is going to be
whatever the value of latitude is from
the location sensor click on that and
there is latitude grab that drop that
right there and we could also go and
duplicate this if we want to kay drag
that drop that right there and then I
let the heck let's just go and duplicate
all that duplicate drop that right there
duplicate drop it right there and we're
going to do the same thing for longitude
so longitude value boink and change this
to longitude oh I can't do it you need
to get myself some more screen real
estate
punjah tude era's longitude change this
to longitude as well
there's longitude and then don't forget
to change this to longitude did it there
it is alright and then all we need to do
and what we're doing this for it so we
can dynamically pull the weather
information based off the current
latitude and longitude position what we
need to do is if it couldn't get the
latitude longitude information it's
going to give latitude or longitude a
value of zero so we want to check this
is the final piece by the way we want to
check that that's true it's going to
control so we're going to go in here
drop it right here and this is just to
protect from errors and we're going to
say hey we want to get the let's just
say latitude value get and we're going
to check that it's not equal to went to
the math get this card here drag it down
here if the turrent latitude value is
not equal to zero
grab it drop it right here then we want
to call to get the weather data
otherwise don't and what you should do
is put a notifier in there something's
wrong and then the final little piece we
could do here which we did before if the
location sensor is not working what
we're going to do is force them to go
into their settings and turn on their
GPS and to do that we need to click up
here and go else drop that right there
going to open up the else right down
here there it is and let's open up a
notifier there's notifier dialog box
fancy name and then we're going to put
in the same information we did
previously which is going to be please
enable GPS and then for the title input
can't access GPS there we go okay there
we go
and that's just going to be the text
that's on the button cancel is going to
be on the other button for our dialog
box and then if they click that they
will enable their GPS what we are going
to do then is send them to the right
part of their settings on their device
and allow them to change it and you do
that by clicking on notifier after
choosing this is what's going to be
called after they make the choice
hopefully clicking on OK otherwise the
app isn't going to work and then again
this is going to be a conditional if so
that's in control if then drag that drop
that down there get myself some more
screen real estate there we go nope
actually I have to come up here again
click on logic grab this we have to
verify that they chose ok for their
option inside of this so get choice
verify that get choice was OK which is
that button drop it right there and if
it was then we want to open up our
settings so that they'll be able to go
in there and change and turn on their
GPS to do that they're going to have to
start an activity click on procedure
get this guy try
down here drop it right there open
location settings that's going to allow
them to go in there and change their
settings where I need to call the
activity starter to start this outside
activity to do so we're going to have to
first set the action that we want
performed which is to open the specific
part of the application that's going to
allow them to change location settings
I'm getting that from here this isn't
something you memorize this is something
you just copy and paste so I'm
specifically on here I'm going to search
for location and here it is this is the
one I'm looking for like I said you
don't need to memorize this and whenever
you do it's going to actually give you
the special code you're going to have to
put in if you want to open up the
ability to change the GPS to on which is
that guy right there
come back over into App Inventor doing a
lot of this work for you so you don't
have to which is a good thing and then
of course after you set the activity you
want to start you need to start it so
that's right here call start that
activity and then hopefully they turn on
their GPS settings and then the very
very final thing is to call for open
location settings to actually open and
we're going to go into procedures and
call and drop it in open location
settings so that was an absolutely crazy
tutorial actually I didn't do one thing
which is making the refresh button work
because I think that would be great
homework I want you to go in there and
figure out how to make the reset button
work so that you can dynamically choose
latitude and longitude based off of your
current position and of course the
answer to that homework is available in
the link in the description for this
video okay so to finish this off this is
what the app looks like after it runs I
showed you this previously and for the
next part of the tutorial what we need
to do is focus in on grabbing just the
data we need so what was important about
doing this is we found out that we could
get the creation date at part 1 inside
of this data creation date local credit
current observation in for which we're
going to be using a lot of that
information the next part of the
tutorial so for homework if you want to
go ahead and try and weed your way
through this remember it's just lists of
lists then feel free to do that be a
great learning experience otherwise tune
in next time and I'll show you exactly
how to do it please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
