minecraft modding guide you guys have
asked me about 500 times to show you how
to create minecraft mod since i started
my java video tutorial so today at least
i'm going to show you how to set up the
development system so that you'll be
able to get in there and start playing
around first thing you need to do is
open up your copy of Minecraft and this
is extremely important you have to click
on options and you want to click on
force update and done and you want to
start minecraft this is very very
important because it downloads a fresh
version of all the code for the
minecraft game and then you can start
playing around with it but that's very
very important if you're getting the
error messages chances are you did not
do that and then after that load you can
just close that out then we need to get
ourselves some software so the first
thing we need to do is get what's called
mod loader and i'll provide a link to
all the links for everything underneath
this video so you can get all this stuff
and you just want to go to this page and
then you won't scroll down until you see
modloader 1.1 and you click on download
direct right like that and it's going to
download into your download folder and
this is specific to max but it pretty
much works almost identically with a pc
it's actually easier to install this
stuff with a pc then what you need is
the minecraft coder pack and again links
underneath the video and you want to go
to this web page and scroll down until
you see right here which says history
and then you want to find version 5.6 or
if there's a newer version you use that
you want to click on this little hard
drive here to download that file and
that's going to go into your downloads
directory then you want to go to
eclipse.org for it / downloads and i
like to use eclipse to do all of my
coding for the most part and I you like
to use the Eclipse IDE for Java
developers and if you're on a PC just
click up here and pick with that or if
you're on Linux or whatever my situation
I'm going to click on Mac OS X 64 bit
that's gonna open up and it installs
just like anything else so I'm not gonna
waste your time of that then what you
want to do in my situation if you're on
a Mac you're the same just go to your
Macintosh folder and then I'm gonna go
to my specific one and I'm gonna go to
my downloads section double click on
that you're gonna see these two new zip
files inside of here and you want to
double click on both of those guys and
they're gonna open up into folders as
you see right here and we're going to
copy those guys select them hit control
C or command C then we're going to jump
back I'm gonna go
to my users directory and go into
documents and then and I pasted these
two folders inside of this guy so it's
really really easy here you're not quite
catching it I provide this on a list
format now what we need to do is get all
the little parts of Minecraft and we're
going to need to copy them into this mcp
56 folder right inside of here so you
might be locked out of the Minecraft
folder if you are then you need to be
inside a finder you need to go to go and
then come down here to where it says go
to folder and click on that then you're
going to type in tilde forward slash
library forward slash application
support forward slash minecraft and hit
go that is going to open up your main
minecraft folder like I said you may be
blocked from it so that's a sure way to
get to this folder now you want to copy
the bin folder inside of minecraft just
hit coffee inside of that and I'm gonna
jump back into Macintosh and back into
my users folder and back into my
personal users folder and back into
documents then you're going to want to
find where it says mcp 56 or if your
versions different open this guy up and
then go two jars open that up and then
inside of the jars file you want to
paste that folder then open up the bin
folder this is going to be really
important to keep everything all nicely
organized and here's the minecraft.jar
file well I like to create a new folder
inside of here and I'm just gonna leave
it titled untitled right like that I'm
going to drag my minecraft.jar file into
this guy then what I want to do is I
want to open up my terminal and if you
want to get to your users structure you
can just type in CD and n tilde that'll
take you to your users directory you do
LS to see what all is inside of there
and then I put everything into my
documents folder so CD documents LS and
then I can go CD mcp 56 LS again change
directory two jars file LS change
directory tube in LS and then change
directory to untitled which is where I
have everything stored you can see just
the minecraft.jar file inside of there
well now inside of terminal what you're
going to want to do clear my scroll back
on this guy is type in jay-ar XF mine
craft dot jar and then hit enter wait
couple seconds and everything we find we
can close terminal jump over there and
see what happened all right jumping into
our untitled file and there is
everything inside of here you're going
to see the minecraft.jar file inside of
this guy you want to make sure you
remove that from this and I'm actually
going to open up a Macintosh folder like
this jump in users documents mcp 56 jars
and then I'm going to open up bin and
then I'm gonna grab this gun I'm gonna
drag him over here the minecraft.jar
file and then I'm gonna rename it
minecraft be u dot jar so it's gonna be
a backup version of this whole entire
thing okay so on the right side of my
screen I have the untitled folder that
has all of the code from minecraft and
on the left side i have my bin folder
I'm gonna bounce out of this guy the
whole way back to my main documents
folder where I have the modloader file
and I'm going to double click on that
gonna select everything all those class
files inside of there copy them jump
back over into the untitled folder and
paste them into there and it's going to
say do you want to overwrite all these
click on apply to all and hit replace
then inside of the untitled folder still
you're going to do a select all you know
right click on this guy on all of them
they're all selected and you want to hit
compress and I have 990 items but I have
no idea how many you're gonna have
probably 990 if you're doing this any
time around right now and that's going
to compress them down into an archive
folder if you scroll through here you're
gonna see this guy more than likely way
way way at the bottom what you want to
do with this guy is just select him and
we're gonna hit copy we're gonna jump
outside of untitled back into the bin
folder and remember this is an MCP and
we're gonna paste it inside here and
then we're going to rename archive zip
minecraft dot jar and make sure you get
rid of that zip that follows after it
and then click anywhere and it's gonna
say do you want to keep this as a jar
say use as a jar now what you want to do
is reopen your terminal and we can do an
LS to see where we're at okay we're in
that wild and crazy untitled folder so
CD dot dot it's going to make you jump
back we can do an LS again and do
another CD dot dot space dot dot LS CD
da da
and then whenever you see all this stuff
on here like clean up and decompile and
all these different things you know
you're in the right place inside of your
terminal clear my scroll back then
you're going to type in bash te come
pile dot sh and then hit enter it's
going to pop up all kinds of crazy stuff
what we're doing here is we turn it all
those class files into real job of code
that we can mess around with and play
with and whenever you get down here to
the bottom it normally says one out of
one hunk failed don't worry about that
you're going to know if it works here in
a couple seconds and just wait until it
has removing comments renaming sources
don't get ahead of yourself don't close
out the terminal let all this stuff
execute reformatting sources and
whenever it says missing jar file don't
get nervous about this aborting or any
of this other stuff it's recompiling it
don't worry everything's going okay and
there now you can quit whenever it comes
back up and it shows your users name you
know that everything is done so I'm
gonna close the terminal and I'm back in
that bin folder I'm gonna back out of
this guy now inside of here I'm gonna go
to source this is inside mcp 56 and if
you go into minecraft net minecraft
again source now you're gonna see all of
this code is now called Java instead of
class now to be able to go in there and
start playing around with it all now
chances are everything set up right
we're going to open up eclipse and then
ran your wood says select a workspace
you're going to click on browse I'm
going to go to My Documents folder I'm
going to go to mcp 56 double click on
that and I'm going to look for the
folder called clips I'm going to double
click on that and then I'm going to hit
open and then I'm going to hit okay and
here is eclipse and if you click on
client we're not messing around with a
server stuff right now click on client
over on the left hand side and click on
source and then net dot minecraft source
you can see all the code for all the
minecraft files that are inside of this
guy and what's really neat is if you
come up here to this green button you
have up here this is run see me hit it a
million times you seen any of my other
tutorials it is actually going to run
Minecraft right inside of Eclipse just a
Java program just like anything else and
I'm letting this play out so you know
what it looks like and there you go
there's minecraft running inside of
eclipse leave any questions or comments
below if you have any try
with any of this leave a question below
i'll do my best answer until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
