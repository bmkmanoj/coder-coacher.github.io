of my learned program series in this
part of the tutorial this is going to be
the second part of the TK inner tutorial
so if you haven't watched part one you
should definitely watch that first
otherwise you may be confused and in the
description there's a link to that in
this part I'm going to cover menu bars
TK variables message boxes we're also
going to talk about styling widgets and
a whole bunch more
and they ACOTA as well as a transcript
of this video is also in the description
and I have a lot to do so let's get into
it alright so first off I'm going to
handle some of my imports the things
that I know I'm going to need anyway in
this tutorial I said message box so it's
going to get that also and if I need
anything else pycharm will tell me so
the very first thing I want to do here
is talk about TK variables and maybe
also do something with unbind so just
like always we're going to come in and
create our TK object and then as I
showed you previously the there our TK
inter variables and you can use them
with widgets to both set and get the
values in different ways so I'm going to
cover the string value option as well as
all the other different options so let's
go and create an integer variable as
well and that's just int our and there's
also one for doubles and that's double
var and then finally there's once per
boolean Zoar true or false and boolean
bar so there we go we created those so
the first thing we want to do is set
default values for these and this is
going to show up in the interface that
we create and I'll just go string bar
and to set those values we just use set
and you can put anything inside of these
at this point
whenever you're first creating these up
make sure that I change that to var so
we keep everything consistent and I'm
going to do the same exact thing for all
these other ones and if at any point I'm
going too fast feel free to pause your
video and type everything in I move
really quickly so that everybody can
watch the video at their own speed
double enter double and then
finally boolean emsco and set this to
true by default so is what we're going
to use here is either a checkbox or
already a box I haven't decided which I
will decide here in a moment so now what
we need to do is assign the variables to
either a text variable or variable
whatever you want to call it so I'm
going to say string and entry is going
to be equal to entry and we're going to
reference root here and then we define
the variable that we want the data to
pull from by going text variable and
then you're going to go string var in
this situation and then I'm just going
to use the pack geometry manager to keep
everything nice and simple here so
string entry and pack and I want
everything to go on the left side of the
screen so I'll just define that and then
I'm going to do the same exact thing for
all of the other different options so
we'll go da da and this is just going to
be int entry and this will be in
tomorrow viously and into entry
everything else to be the same there do
the same thing with this let's call this
double entry and this is going to be
double var and double entry and then
boolean well actually let's change this
I think I'm going to make this a check
button and then depending upon if this
check button is selected or not that's
going to determine what data you're
going to get inside of your widgets and
then I think I'm going to set it up so
that we can use bind and unbind and
that's just going to allow me to unbind
and bind a function to the press of a
button just so that I can cover
something different so I'm going to call
this the check button and then this is
going to be a check button and then this
is going to be root as well if you want
to use a check button here I'm going to
put text is equal and I'm just going to
put switch inside of here and then this
is going to be tied still to the boolean
but this is going to have to be just
called variable instead of
variable and then after I have that
setup let's go and set the binds to the
left mouse button so the check button
and I'm going to bind this guy
by default when it refers stops over but
it sets up here to the left mouse button
and that's button one and then I'm going
to call a function here I'm going to
create a second called bind button and
then we will just pack this again the
check button and there we go now after
this I said there's going to be a
regular old button inside of here and
that's going to call get data so let's
go get data button and I'll create that
function here in a second so it's just
going to be a regular old button again
tied to route and the text here is going
to be get data see here in a second when
I create the function what it's going to
do get data button and I just need to
bind this guy to the same mouse click
left mouse button and called function
get data it gives me an error message
because I've created it yet and get data
button again and here we're just going
to pack it once again on the left side
so everything's going to be all on one
row and then since I'm here I might as
well just finish this up and down here
and create main loop so that it keeps my
window open and my program running now
I'm going to create all of these
different functions so what is get data
let's just create it up here before any
of this even starts let's define what
get dad is going to get for us so get
data and what it's going to do is just
get whatever is inside of all of these
different entries that the user types in
so we're going to get events here and we
could set this to none handles if an
event is not passed inside of there in
this situation you don't need it
sometimes you do need it as well just
throw it in there what the heck I know
what I want to do is just output over
here on the console side all of the
different values that are stored inside
or that the user typed inside of here
and to get a value that is stored inside
of an entry we're just going to call get
on that entry and I'm going to print out
all of the different values we have here
and there's four of them and the next
one is going to be integer and then
we're going to have double of course as
you saw and then we're also going to
have our boolean value and then I just
have to come in here and just reference
those guys so it says int bar and double
bar as well as boolean var and there we
go that's how we can get all those
different values and that's all we're
going to do with that function now on to
the bond button button one that what
this is going to do is it's going to
unbind and rebind an event to a function
so and it's going to be based off of
whether this guy right here the check
button is checked or not so I'm just
going to call this bond button just as I
defined down below and once again we can
go events and not on that guy and then
if I want to check if it is currently
set or not I can just go a boolean bar
and then get and it's going to return
either true or false depending upon if
it is set or not and if that comes back
as true then I want to say get data
button and I want to unbind that guy and
leave it to you to think about why we
are whenever it's true we run binding it
think about it you'll get it alright and
then else we're going to say get data
button again and in this situation will
say bind and once again we will bind to
button to button one and then we define
the function that we want to have it set
to and that's going to be get that once
again so if we get rid of these
parentheses and I think that's all I
need to do let's run it oh give me a
little air of course I went and did some
silly
after that the duh line 18 what I do up
that has to change that to var there we
are
oh and I see here I'm so stuck in
camelcase world where I always uppercase
the next thing there I get rid of that
and did I do that anywhere else being
silly that did it today yes I did it
right there is also alright so there we
go fix those common errors and let's run
it and you're going to see that yes
indeed everything looks like it worked
out good let's just come in here and
enter us anything into that for the
string and then the integers say
something like one and then 3.14 and
then the switch is going to be true or
false we'll click good data see what
happens
and you can see all the inputs we put
inside of here all showed up there you
can also see that boolean is set for
true now let's go and let's open this
guy up again and see what happens when
we default or change the switch here
click on that click get data and look at
that nothing happens and if we click on
switch again and get data you're going
to see that it works again that's how we
use some TK variables as well as we can
bind and unbind functions inside of TK
enter inside of Python and now I'm going
to show you different ways that we can
style our widgets alright so I got this
message box here might as well go and
use it so I'm going to show you how to
open a message box so we're going to
create a function here called open
message box and to open a message box we
can just go message box like this and
then we can say show a warning a couple
other different things you saw show info
and all those you play around with them
see how they work and for this guy we're
just going to say something like event
triggered and then that's going to be in
the title and then this is going to be
the message itself I'm just going to say
something like button clicked and there
that is alright so now we'll come down
inside of here and like I said and we're
going to cover some different ways we
can style our widgets one thing you do
is define the size of your window as
well as the position on the screen and
basically what you do there as you go
with and then the letter x height and
then what you're going to do is have a
plus and then you're going to have x
offset that's going to be from the upper
left-hand corner of your screen and then
another plus and then you're going to
have the y offset okay so that's how
we're going to be able to define where
our windows going to be and how big
they're going to be so let's go and
create that we go root followed by
geometry and then just like I said we're
going to define our width and then
to put an X inside of here and then
we're going to define our height and
then I'm going to put a plus and then
the offset from the X as well as the y
offset from the upper left-hand side of
our screen you're also going to be able
to set it so that the window can't be
resizable obviously it's resizable by
default and to do that you can also say
that like the width can be resized but
the height can't be so I'm going to make
them both false you can play around and
see what happens whenever you make
either one of them false and height is
to false I'm going to go and create a
simple frame that's going to house all
of my widgets and then you're going to
be able to change the styling options by
a defining style is equal to ttk style
however if you do that you're going to
have to come up here and import ttk so
I'm going to say from TK enter import t
TK and that's just going to make things
work a little bit better on different
operating systems and now whenever we
want to set our different styling
options we just go style and you can
either go config or configure but I'm
going to do configure right here and if
you want to target the button for
example as changing the styling you go T
button like that and if you want to
change the foreground or the text for
the widget the button widget could do
that and I'm going to use midnight blue
here and all of the different specific
names for colors inside of TK enter can
be found at this specific website right
here so just go there and there's a
whole ton of different colors you can
use so feel free to do that and the
links in the description as well we're
also going to be able to come in here
and change the font and to do that
you're going to list the fonts name
followed by the PX the size of the font
and then after that your different font
styles that you want to change so let's
do bold and italic here there's a whole
bunch of different things we're gonna be
able to do
forget to put that calm inside of there
and let's also go and do padding let's
change padding on this 220 okay
so there's just a couple different
things we can do and if you're wondering
what the different names are for the
widgets you can see here's tea button
there's check button these are what
you're going to use if you want to
specifically style or change the style
of different widgets and those are all
the different widgets that are available
to you to style so there they are and
click pause if you want to write those
down or whatever get them in on the
description as well
another thing you going to be able to do
is you can change the theme style for
your application and one useful thing in
regards to that is I'll show you a
command that's going to allow you to see
all the different themes available for
your specific operating system you're
using and that function is going to be
ttk and then you're going to call style
and then you're going to call dot theme
names that's going to print all those
out for you you're also going to be able
to see the current style settings that
you have set for any of your different
widgets you have so you can go style
lookup and depending upon your operating
system you're going to have more or less
different options available to you in
regards to styling your functions so
let's say we want to find out what the
font was for all of our buttons we could
do it that way and we also changed
foreground on here and that's the text
color and we also change padding so we
can look those up and have those print
it out on-screen now why don't we go and
actually create our buttons so that we
can see what's going on with it
so we'll go the button and ttk button
and we're going to tie this to the frame
instead of route and the text that's
going to show up in the button is I'm
going to say something like important
button and because I called it important
it is important and I want the message
box to open up whenever this button is
clicked on so I'm going to go open
message box there we are and that's this
guy that I created up here there you are
yeah what else can we do with our button
here well another thing you could do is
you could disable as well as enable your
button so we'll go button
and you reference state with that so
we'll say state for our button is
currently disabled and if we want to
re-enable our button we can do that of
course as well and you just call that
normal and if we want to see this we can
say the button and call pac---- on this
there's nothing else in there so I don't
need to style it at all and then we can
call frame pack and route mains there
and you're going to be able to see the
different styling changes will be made
and there it is see important button we
went and bolded it and tile sized it
changed the format of it change the font
and all those different things and you
can see right here that it shot out all
the different types of themes that are
available as well as the font the color
and the padding so whole bunch of
different things we can do and since we
know the different themes that are
available why don't we jump up here and
change the theme just so you can see how
a theme change looks so to do that you
go ttk and style these are built-in
themes and then we say theme and then
use and then the theme we want to use so
let's see what clam looks like and we'll
run it and you can see right there
that's what clam looks like the default
theme for buttons anyway there's a
rundown of a couple different ways we
can style our different widgets inside
of TK enter and now I'm going to do some
really cool stuff we're going to take a
deep look at menu bars all right so what
I'm going to do is create a menu bar
this stuff right here I'm going to
create three of them I'm going to create
file view and help and then I'm going to
create own check boxes inside of there
and expandable menu bars a whole bunch
of different things
so let's first off let's go and create a
couple of different functions so I can
show you first off how to close an
application because quits going to be an
option inside of here so if you want a
once your applique inter application to
quit you just go root quit there you are
that's how you shut that down all right
and another thing well we already
covered the message box we're going to
call for that to open by defining a
keyboard shortcut and events and this is
going to be set for none as well and
this is review so a message box you want
a message box to open up show warning
and then the title for this message box
is going to be about and then we're
going to say something like this awesome
program was made in 2016 and that's
pretty good and let's come down here and
start creating the menu bar in our
application so first thing we want to do
is create the menu object and I'm just
going to call this the menu and how you
do that is by going menu and then
passing route to it and I'm going to
create each of these I'm going to create
file then the view and then the Help
button afterwards so to create a
pulldown menu that's not going to be
able to be removed from the top of your
screen or your little application you're
creating it's normally better to you're
gonna see here in a second let's say
file menu is equal to menu and the menu
you want to tie this to and then you're
going to follow that with tear off and
you're going to set that to zero
tear off if this was set to positive
you'd be able to rip that off maybe it
depends on operating system I don't
think I've ever had this actually be an
option so we're going to always leave
tear off be equal to zero and then what
you're going to do is add items to your
menu and these going to be the the
things that show up whenever the user
clicks on file like that see all those
things have popped up well we're going
to define and all the different things
are going to show up inside of the menu
and to do so you go file menu which is
what we're going to be tying these items
to and then you follow that with add
command in this situation sometimes you
put other things in there but add
command is going to work here and this
is going to be a label that does nothing
so I'm going to say there we are and
it's going to be open so I'm going to
create a whole bunch of these different
things and I'm going to create ones that
do do things whenever you click on them
I'm also going to have save be another
one of these guys and smooth this up a
little bit maybe you want to add
a horizontal bar that's going to
separate the different commands that are
available to you you can also do that
just go file menu and then add and
separator there that is I'm about you
guys felt separate or wrong everyone's
tool on so it's good to do that and then
let's go and use this function we
created up here to call quit application
with our quit option so I'm going to go
file menu and add command it's going to
be the next one we want to do here we're
going to say label is going to be equal
to quit and then we're going to define
the command or the function that is
going to fire whenever we click on that
and that's going to be a quit app like
this make sure you get rid of those
parentheses though and then you need to
add the pulldown menu to your menu bar
how you do that is you go menu and add
cascade and then you're going to put
your label inside of here which is going
to be file name file and then you go
menu is going to be equal to file menu
and that's going to tie all those
different options altogether then last
thing you want to do here is you want
your menu bar to actually show up on the
screen and how you do that is you go
route config then you're going to say
menu is going to be equal to the menu
which is the guy that you defined before
and then main loops there that's all you
need to do let's run it now if you click
on this you're going to see file shows
up over here and you can see open and
save show up here and if we click on
quit look at that the application quits
alright so let's add some more things
here that are a little bit more
feature-rich let's create another one
and just so this shows up a little bit
better I'm going to actually name this
so View menu is going to start right
here and we can go up here and we could
say file menu for this guy just so we
know where the different menu options
show up there's file menu and there's
View menu alright so for the view what I
want to do is just go view menu kreega
is equal to menu I'm going to tie it to
our main menu of course and the tear off
option is going to be set to 0 I'm going
to have an option in here that is going
to allow the user like what I'm doing
here
is I'm acting as if I'm creating a text
editor so let's say we wanted to provide
the option for the user to click a
little checkbox inside of our menus that
either allow them to show line numbers
or not show them so I'm going to store
this in a TK variable so I'm going to
say line numbers is going to be equal to
int var and now you're starting to see
why knowing how to use TK variables is
useful
so we'll just go line numbers and by
default we're going to set these to be
checked now what I need to do is bind
the checking of the line number option
in the menu to that variable and to do
so I'm just going to go view menu and
add and this is going to be a check
button it's going to be a different type
of guy and the label that I'm going to
have this have is going to be a line
numbers whether they want the line
numbers to show up or not in this fake
text editor and then I tie the value of
whether it's checked or not to our line
numbers TK variable that we created
right here okay so this is going to
change automatically depending upon if
they click on it or not and then we just
go view menu like this add cascade and
let's say that we want to have another
one of these guys show up and this is
going to be fonts and this is going to
be another function that is going to
allow them to check whether they want
different types of fonts to show up so
let's go and do fonts and then we're
going to tie this to the font menu which
we haven't even created yet we'll create
that right now then after we do this
we'll add the whole thing to our menu so
we're going to say the menu add and then
cascade and this is going to be label
it's going to show up it is view and
menu is going to be equal to the view
menu all right so now we need to create
our font menu so let's just copy this
right here and throw font menu inside
air just going to have a whole bunch of
options just like we did before alright
so what we want to do is we want to
store our different font options inside
of a TK string variable so I'm going to
call this text font is equal to
and this is going to be a string
variable and text font once again and
we're going to set this to Times New
Roman by default so just have it be
Times and let's say that we want to
output our font changes over here on the
screen just so we can see that things
are changing so I'll create a function
it does that say something like change
font it's going to receive an offense
maybe and throw that there and whenever
this is called we're just going to say
something like font picked obviously you
don't need to do this I'm just doing it
so you can see what's going on whenever
we click on these different guys and we
can get whatever the result of the font
picked was and I'll put that on the
screen then we're going to define the
font drop-down that's going to be
attached to the view so we're going to
say font menu is equal to men you tie
this to the main menu again tear-off is
going to be equal to 0 then we're going
to define all of our different radio
button options for our fonts because if
one of them selected we don't want the
you know it's impossible to check that
you want to use multiple different fonts
so the way a radio button is going to
work inside of TK enter is we're going
to put a label inside of here and we're
going to have times obviously be an
option as a font we're going to tie this
to the text font TK variable that we
have here and if it is clicked on it is
going to call our change of fonts
function for it to execute and then
we're going to do this for a couple
different other fonts just so you can
see a couple of them on here and there
we are and we don't need to change
anything except the name so we'll have
courier be another option inside of here
as well as Arial so there you are for
our mermaid fans and everything else I
want to do yeah Wow whoops
tear off like little errors like that
and let's come in might as well do the
help and the about function that we have
inside of here as well so let's go and
just do this and so that we can see
where the help part starts so
call this help menu and we'll start off
defining this with help menu is equal to
and it's menu when it's tied to the main
menu and of course tear off is going to
be equal to zero then I'm going to
actually call for whenever the about
option is clicked on inside of the help
drop-down that it's going to call a
function but it's also going to be tied
to a shortcut so to do that what you do
is you go help menu and add command just
like we have done here before except I'm
going to go put about inside here is the
label and then the thing that's going to
be different is I'm going to go and call
accelerator and accelerator is going to
be used to show that a shortcut is also
available to us and that shortcut in
this situation is going to be command H
and these are different on different
operating systems here I'll show you how
they're different here in one second and
let's say that we want to call the
function show about which is our message
box guy way up here we created this well
go this guy show about it's going to pop
up a little message box whenever that's
clicked on or this little command
shortcut is clicked on and if you're
wondering how to set the different
shortcut keys commands or whatever on
different operating systems this works
on Macs as well as on Windows and Linux
here are a couple different options you
can put something like command o shift
ctrl s command Q command option Q and
your main modifiers you're going to use
or control control option option alt
shift and command and of course there's
going to be inside of quotes just like I
defined it right there and let's finish
this off so you can see all of the
different changes we made here so we're
going to say add all menu and add
cascade and the label for this last guy
is going to be help and the menu is
going to be to help menu and then if we
want to find our shortcuts to our little
keys that we defined inside of here we
just go route bond just like we did
before and then we will say command dash
a like that like I said play with these
different options up here
depending upon what operating system you
or use
and then we just say what we want to
show so show about is going to be that
guy right there and let's say that we
also want this to work if they have a
lowercase a don't we just come in here
and change out the lowercase a right and
if I do everything right let's run it
and see what happens and it looks like I
did everything right man let's see our
handiwork so there is our little
application we can click on file you
already saw that guy you can see here is
view click on line numbers that's going
to check or uncheck depending upon
whatever is going on we would be able to
call a function of course it would be
able to change what's going on inside of
here there's also our fonts and you can
see that whenever we click on one of
them that the other one automatically
goes away and you can see here is help
and there is about and command H I see
what I did look let's just go and kill
this right now well we can just go file
quit see I defined this is command H but
command a there well that was kind of
silly so let's go and get rid of that
and we'll throw that in there and we'll
run it again now if we come up here
click on help now you can see the
shortcut actually shows up inside of
there see it has to actually be bound
for it to show up if we click on it it's
going to pop up the little message right
like that but we're also going to be
able to go and click on command a and
have it pop up again alright guys so
there is a whole bunch of new things
about how we can use TK enter with
python in the next part of the tutorial
i'm going to continue covering all the
other different things and like always
