software has not been working properly
and I really wanted to make a video so
today what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
play don't starve shipwrecked on iPad
and we're gonna see how good it is I
have zero experience using this I played
the original don't starve I absolutely
loved it and I saw that don't starve
shipwrecked was available for 5 bucks
and I decided to give it a try so what
I'm gonna do here I haven't done
anything as you can see here is that
morgue if you know anything about don't
starve you will die so there's proof
that I haven't even played the game yet
and I'm gonna jump in here and see some
different things yeah that's not what I
want and let's jump out of here and
let's just click on play and new game
click on that and you can see there are
a whole bunch of different characters
you can pick from there's Wilson's
overall a pretty good character there's
crazy old willow who starts fires I'm
not going to pick her Wolfgang is extra
strong so I'm that's normally Who I play
with so I'm just gonna is there anybody
else
there's W x78 with her bottom clicker
bottom well this guy can be upgraded
with gears so that you can find don't
want to skip this girl Abigail I don't
think I've ever played with her she's a
haunted sister that's like a ghost or
something like that
yeah I never did anything with her this
Wicker bottom she's really cool as a
character cuz she can generate her own
spells because don't starve is all about
crafting neat little tools to use to try
to stay alive I mean the whole point of
the game is to try to not die and
obviously there's other cool things
about it like your I'm guessing with
this you're gonna be looking for
treasure and things like that and there
is woody he comes equipped with an axe
Wes was extremely weak who you get
maxwell which is the original
protagonist from the original don't
starve
and this is law what I'm gonna do is I
am going to use my same old Wolfgang who
I always use so I'm gonna click on apply
and then I'm gonna cheat a little bit
because don't starve is wicked wicked
hard what I'm gonna do here is I'm just
gonna give myself a little bit more in
the way of Flint Flint is used to make
all kinds of tools like axes and I think
there's like machetes and and there's
pickaxes it's sort of don't starve it's
sort of like a sadistic type of
Minecraft if you're wondering what it is
and you've never tried it so I'm gonna
sort of game the system here a little
bit I really don't consider this to be
cheating I'm gonna give myself a little
bit more berries I don't no idea what
that is
what is it sweet potato I'm gonna give
myself a little bit more in regards to
sweet potatoes and I don't know is this
food limpets I don't know what that is
I'm gonna give myself some limpets no
idea what olympics are those things
wicked and that's it I'm just gonna
cheat just a little bit like I said this
game is so wicked hard that I don't
really consider it cheating and
especially because this is my first
playthrough and I don't want to die
immediately I'm gonna just go with this
so let's jump in here and let's explore
the iPad version of don't starve and I
heard that generating the islands in
this game it takes a lifetime so I may
have to pause a wife come on I mean I
haven't iPad what is this I don't even
know what this is it's an iPad it's a
newer iPad I think it's like a year old
I'd load it instantly alright there's a
bird here you called me a chomp in any
flew away alright so basically what we
do in this game if you've never played
it before is you run around and you
collect stuff and then you're gonna use
all of this stuff to build other stuff
so what I'm doing is I'm gonna get
myself some sticks and maybe I can get
that crab to eat it probably he'll run
away though in grass and this is wicked
cool also this is kind of an excuse for
me to play video games here on New
Year's Eve
I can make it look like I'm doing
something important whether I am or not
and so I got myself some grass and some
more sticks and there is a hill up here
can I dig in it says that I can not dig
in it so I'm gonna go over here and get
some more grass and it starts off it
looks kind of boring it's basically a
lake I said it's like this it's sort of
a mellow sort of game like Minecraft
except it's a little bit more sadistic
because it goes out of its way to kill
you you will either starve or some
monster will get you in the middle of
the night or something else bad will
happen so that's basically the entire
game and I'm just kicking up a couple
different things here and let's don't
build something so over here on the left
side I see that I can build an axe I
normally build an axe or a pickaxe here
first I'm gonna go get himself an axe
and let's explore and see what else we
have here pick up some more grass and
some more gas and a couple more sticks
and so far I'm not seeing anything in
the way of food I remember I gamed the
system there a little bit and said that
I wanted extra berries haven't seen any
so this palm tree up here
Oh coconut just hit me in the head okay
it hurt me I don't know it didn't look
like it hurt much so I guess if a
coconut hit you in the head it doesn't
hurt that bad I kind of doubt that in
real life all right so I got a coconut
I'm guessing I can eat the coconuts to
say alive since I haven't seen anything
else here as a seashell I have no idea
if that's even useful oops
and you're gonna need the like I said
the difference and basically all you do
in the iPad version of this is to grab
stuff or to perform an action you just
press them hold on the screen you'll see
if the coconut hits me in the head again
all right and as you can see on the
screen here you're also going to be able
to punch which means attack the
different things here so let's see if
that works oh oh I'm not getting that
crap okay that crabs too fast for me so
let's get some more grass you use the
grass to do things like make traps so
far I have seeds and coconuts to eat
unless I can eat those seashells which I
don't believe that I can do but we will
find out because eventually I will start
to starve and just go and get some more
coconuts and some other random different
things here and let's see if I can split
see if I can figure out how to spin the
screen I'm trying to spin my screen
oh okay if you take two fingers and go
like this you can spin the screen and
that allows you to get stuff that's sort
of hidden oh there's money doubloons
okay these sticks what looks like bamboo
I'm not able to chop for some reason and
I'm gonna get myself a jungle tree and
I'm gonna chop that guy down as well and
I'm also going to want to get see you
have basically three things you have to
worry about you have to worry about
dying
which is the heart you have to worry
about staying sane which is the little
brain in the upper right hand corner and
then you also have to worry about
starving and that is the stomach there's
another flower in st. flowers keep you
sane for some reason and food keeps you
full and eventually oh this game is
gonna provide some way for me to heal
myself I'm just supposing in the
original don't starve you would heal
yourself with spider sacks mixed with
ash
so yeah that was pretty weird and so I'm
trying to turn here there ya get myself
some berries the island surprisingly
can't big and in expect it to be that
big oh let's see if this is that's that
limpets thing what is that I don't know
muscles or something so remember I was
like limpets is that food and so just
like a barnacle I don't know if you can
eat a barnacle barnacles are on ships or
something I know nothing about ships and
sea life so that's not probably not good
all right I'm trying to turn that we are
the pine cones you can use to plant
additional trees if you're into that eco
sort of stuff and I'm gonna chop down
another tree here and now it's starting
to get dark now if you do not create a
fire for yourself and it gets dark you
will die because monsters will get you
and I'm gonna go over and get this
limpet and there's a box down here I
can't do anything with a box looks like
I need another tool for that and you can
see in the upper right hand corner
there's like a day that is being slowly
decreased
yeah really seen any rocks so I'm gonna
try to stay out here alive as long as I
can do it I don't know if you can avoid
those coconuts I don't know
I'm trying to oh I broke my ax stuff to
make another axe oh I see I can make a
machete maybe the machetes used to go in
there and cut down on the bamboo and
other things like that for pressing my
luck here there's seeds all right and
it's more sticks and some more grass and
some more grass some Flint
like I said Flint's used to make tools
sounds some rocks rocks sir every
everything's used to make things it's
it's sort of like like I said it's like
minecraft a little bit and it's almost
getting dark here there's a seashell I
have no idea what you can do with a
seashell you can crack it open and eat
it look it's getting dark alright so I'm
gonna build a fire
xisa man I look emaciated and one day
what is this what is this that is I
don't even remember getting this examine
is tasty helps a lot let's cook it what
is it alright eat all right and I'm
gonna cook seeds I don't know if the
seeds cooked actually give you any more
nutrition or not but I'm gonna find out
and eat them and I'm supposing the whole
point of this is to build ships and get
off of the islands so that's what I'm
gonna aim to do here and I'm going to
loot everything I can loot off of this
island and then progress from that point
on and let's see it's more of that that
anything also gonna eat oh there's the
lipids can I eat those trying to get
some lipids
know what that is all right and eat and
eat all right
there's coconut so I didn't try eating
those I will try eating those later and
let's see if I can make a machete to go
and cut down the bamboo so there's a
machete I'm gonna build that and that
was probably really stupid of me because
I probably should look for rocks and it
made a pic which would allow me to get
additional Flint's I don't know what
happens if you completely run out of
resources on an island if it just kills
you or or what I got plenty of grass
here well there's a there's a thing and
of course I'm stupid and I don't have a
pickaxe now so I need a more anymore
Flint's is there a map yeah there is oh
boy all right so here's my map that
shows me what's going on here and I've
been across the entire island and let's
go back and let's see what else is going
on can I find any more Flint's that was
probably a big mistake making that
machete instead of making the pickaxe
alright so I'm back I collected a couple
other different things yes I was right
you used the machete and the to cut down
the bamboo and what are these called
um examine I don't know the bushes so
and I also found out that you look over
here you can make yourself a raft or
raft okay
and I think I'm gonna go with this raft
right here and I ran out of flint
officially so that's not good and well I
guess I can't build that and I got
myself some more money and I am going to
be I don't know I guess I'm going to try
to eat seeds so that is what I'm down to
of run out of food my machete I think
has to be used to break the coconuts and
I'm out of them so I am sunk here guys I
need some Flint really bad and I'm
hopefully gonna be able to get off this
island get some Flint get some more food
here before I die right here during the
very I don't know what day three yeah
not good so I'm gonna eat my seeds and
hopefully my next world's gonna be a
little bit better I've also found out
that the one of the bad guys are really
bad guys are snakes so yeah not good
okay so I am off on my quest to find
some more flint and hopefully I can do
that so let's get this and let's place
it there we are and I'm on my raft now
am I gonna be able to move a ride look
at this I'm doing something so what I'm
gonna do is go off and hopefully find
myself another island that I will be
able to get some more good stuff off of
I'm able to do I don't know what those
are everything it's always better in
don't starve to assume that the worse so
I'm guessing that that jellyfish there
can probably kill me so I am going to
avoid them and I do not have it any more
space so I can't pick up those ropes or
whatever else that stuff is and I'm
basically just going to move along here
and now I have waves and I think the
waves are going to kill me oh okay and
the waves are pushing me alright so
that's cool and hopefully they are
pushing me to a new island so that I can
get myself some Flint and get myself
some food and survive those things are
not looking good for me right now
geez man oh what's this up here is this
an island
and there are jellyfish everywhere not
good Jenna fish sounds just looking here
to see if I can find myself something or
I will die no doubt about it
alright so I guess this is some I don't
know what this is some coral so I'm
gonna do my best
let's see if the map can help me at all
no the map can't do anything for me see
there fish there maybe later on I can
create a fishing pole in the original
don't start that was a fishing pole so
I'm guessing there's probably a fishing
pole in this one also and I'm looking
for some Island you can see there I am
almost starving to death
my health is down pretty low but my
sanity is good and that's because I
picked flowers I guess and actually I
don't consider it weird that I would die
or very early on in this because just
how wicked this game is so let's keep
going on I assume I'm doing the right
thing here and looking for an island
additional islands I know I can't
subsist off of what the previous Island
gave me and I don't know what happens if
you die out on the island or if it gets
dark just trying to do some different
things here to see if I can find an
island
hopefully this island head yeah look at
that there's an island another Island
and there's some berries there for me I
don't know if my BRAF flies away or
swims away on its own
blows away and give himself some flowers
what I really need is Flint though do a
little turn well it looks like the
spiders survived here and the new
version of don't starve there's rocks I
get rocks yep
yeah and there's bamboo but I don't have
flint so I can't get it and there's
berry bush and another berry bush so it
looks like we may be able to survive
here I don't remember if we can actually
eat those mushrooms or not or if they
make you sick or delirious that's
another thing certain things lower your
sanity and then if your sanity goes too
low the world gets really evil and then
it kills you of course you know because
that makes sense all right I got some
more Flint's still not there's more
Flint up there and let's try doing a
little tourney tourney dams still need
some more food Jase it's wicked
oh and I can make myself a hat now the
garland helps with your sanity and I
can't eat that but it's not gonna do
anything for me eat and eat ya lookin
for Flint and food no seeds seeds and I
don't believe I can cook the seashells I
think probably can I make another
machete yes I can
I was holding off on making another
machete though to see if I could instead
find myself some rocks here I don't know
if they he's he mean he looks mean
definitely don't look happy but I guess
he's alright we're cool with the Pelican
ish thing and there's some more Flint's
and I'm gonna eat some the very meager
amount of food that I have and see if I
can subsist on that wicked this game is
hard
the original don't starve was not as
hard as shipwrecked even though it was
wicked hard 30 berries I'm almost dead
here so I better eat something you can
eat the spiders but they also make you
sick and I think that's my original raft
seriously this island is that small
bullet I said alright so let's go and
make ourselves a little campfire here
and see what happens so I'm going to I'm
just yeah cook these seeds up eat
I'm gonna do my best here to stay alive
whoops because berries I do my best to
stay alive and hopefully whenever I'm a
little bit better in a better position I
will come back and we'll see what else
is going on in don't starve a ride look
at this I found myself a boulder that
probably has gold in it yeah and I got
myself some more Flint I'm doing a
little bit better than I was doing err I
was looking a little bit hopeless for a
second and let's go in here and see what
else I can get this island isn't looking
too wonderful though so I'm gonna build
myself another machete and I'm going to
commit but I can't carry it all right
I'm gonna eat this now I'm gonna get my
machete and now I'm gonna get switch
into that and cut down some more of
these bamboos and I'm guessing I have to
be able to eat the coconut because
nothing else is really available food
wise and I think I pretty much looted
all the flint off of this island my let
my Flint's not in too bad a shape mounds
came to carry seeds what I'm gonna do is
make a backpack here in a second so that
I will be able to actually do something
a little bit better so let's go I think
survival is where the backpacks are
there you go I can make a thatch pack so
there you got I got a little bit extra
space so that is also good so I am going
to cut down a whole bunch of bamboo and
I'm going to see ah snakes there's two
of them that's not good
wait arrived see if I can kill them
ah it me
alright I'm gonna get him now and they
died and they didn't give me any meat or
anything I think that Bush is shaking so
I think that means there's snakes in
there so I'm just going to avoid that
Bush disease and I'm gonna continue
getting myself some bamboo here and then
I'm gonna chop down some more coconut
trees oh and how much bamboo bamboo do
wise and it's more bushes and it's
pretty good I mean it's a little you
know like the graphics wise in
comparison of the desktop version of
don't starve isn't as good but it's
really cool that you can just have it
right here you know carry it around with
you and play around with it whenever you
want the reviews for it were that oh
it's terribly unstable and it takes you
know forever to load and I haven't seen
that at all and I mean I don't know
maybe people are just using really
really old devices iPhone fours or
something and wondering why the game
isn't working out as good as they would
have hoped that's all I can guess and
the bushes are where the snakes are at
so those are nasty let's go in there and
get some more bushes and I want to get
off this island because this island
isn't all that wonderful but before I do
probably gonna spend one more night on
this island I feel like I'm moving
really slow and don't start oh I broke
my machete build another one and don't
starve you feel like you have to get
moving and get a lot of things done as
quickly as humanly possible I don't know
if they have a winter in this and
because when winter comes and don't
starve like the regular
that's whenever you die which isn't good
all right get these rocks right here
take a look at my map where did I leave
my raft my raft is down there so I
should be able to get to my raft no
problem
before thee the Sun completely goes down
and I die so I'm gonna go down here
there's a fire I don't really need that
I have a gold get a couple more bamboos
so I got spiders and snakes and haven't
really seen anything ridiculously crazy
here yes there's my wrath so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna chill right here
and I am going to see if I can go and
get myself do something with these
coconuts all right can I do anything
hack yay okay hopefully I can eat them
now hack and hopefully I'm not spilling
coconut juice everywhere because or
something like that so alright hack I'm
gonna keep on hacking until I got all
those up and I'm almost dying from
starvation right now and come on
coconuts I got here alright I think I
got them all so I'm gonna pick up all my
coconuts here real quick I'm just gonna
run up here cuz I feel like I'm gonna
die at any moment
so I'm gonna cook my coconuts eat I
don't know run over grab this
eat eat just trying to get some some
food in myself I can't eat the seashells
or at least I can't figure out a way to
eat them let's go down here get some
more coconuts boy ate some coconuts
think there would be a little bit more
nutrition in coconuts than what I got
out of these coconuts and so I have 25
coconuts hopefully that's enough to get
myself or keep myself alive
geez a man
and I'm gonna cook some more of them you
have to cook them one by one
there'll be another thing be nice if you
could cook like all of them in one go
but of course now don't starve doesn't
like making things easy you have to cook
one coconut at a time like you would it
in the real world and of course not get
spiders eats and eat the coconut
provides zero nutrition all right so I'm
gonna do is I'm when I sit here I'm
gonna eat some coconuts for a minute and
then we'll set out on another journey
all right so I found out I went on to a
new world this new went Island down here
that's like red and I got poisoned so
don't do that
day five poisoned I'm hoping the poison
goes away and I don't have to try to
cure myself somehow but yeah and I also
found that there is an end to the world
so I went way over here and it actually
the world comes to an end so that's not
good so that's from Adam as I leave you
right now I am currently poisoned I am
out in the ocean I'm slowly dying as
well as starving at the same time oh
look at this
thank God I made it alright so I am here
and let's see if I can do anything to
get rid of this poison and also to heal
myself if at all possible so if I
survive the figure out a way to survive
oh look at that
as things are starting to look good all
of a sudden some bad stuff starts
happening so snakes are chasing me now
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to try
I think that's poisonous I think that's
how I got poisoned those nasty things so
what I am going to try to do is figure
out a way to heal myself and if I do
that well then I will see you again
otherwise I will probably be dead the
next time we see each other which is not
a nice way to end video all right it
looks like I'm gonna die so I can't get
rid of this poison there are there's
somebody went and pooped over there
probably this monkey who he looks like
he has poison also the monkey didn't
hurt me and I died so there it goes I
lived for five days and now I'm dead so
I might give it another try here and see
if I can get myself on better footing
and then jump forward and see what else
we can explore and don't starve I'll
ride so after I died I went and try it
again and now I know a little bit more
about how the game works so maybe I'll
be able to play it a little bit better
so let's jump in here and I'll show you
a couple different things dave was able
to figure out kind of a fun game it's
just ridiculously hard okay so now I
have a machete I have this guy which is
for tech catching muscles and I have a
shovel and so let's go over here here's
a Sandeep oh oh this is just sand I
don't know if this is supposed to give
you anything else but so far all I've
gotten out of these is sand and as you
can see I found some bottles and a
couple other random weird things and I'm
pretty weak pretty unhealthy here not
doing that wonderful and whenever the
seasons change which they're going to
change I'm sure I'm gonna die so I just
wanted to jump in here and what I do
with my raft my raft is the whole way
over there so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
run over there and get to my science
machine and try to build a couple other
different things there's there's Dogon
monkeys if you hit a monkey or hurt a
monkey in any way they start throwing
poop at yes so don't do that
sanity is doing great worry about that
you can see here I got a vest and what
I'm gonna try to do now is build an
alchemy engine and I have to make these
electrical doodads to be able to do that
there's an electrical doodad and I need
a block a stone to be able to do that
and block a stone I'm not close enough
now I can get it so I come down here and
make a block of stone
I can't carry it of course because that
would just be too much all right and you
can hit this little button up here the
hand and it'll go and grab stuff just
useful all right and I forgot electrical
doodad
I can make one so we will prototype that
and how many of those electrical doodads
do I need I need two of them so I'm
gonna come down here make some more
stone and add some more stone and some
more stone eat that pick up my stones
and eat these flowers even though they
don't really do anything for you and as
you can see I'm starving and so let's go
make another electrical doodad and let's
go and make I think I need four wood to
make that yes I need four wood yeah so
let's go and cut down some more trees
all right so I have enough wood now so
I'm gonna go and create myself some
planks and another one
and there we go and now I can make
myself one of these alchemy engines just
put it wherever okay where is it there
we go and now I can make all that stuff
so you know the game is just crazy let's
see if I can do one more thing let's see
if I can go and catch some stuff here
just to finish it off with my muscles
sticks well I can come up here and
outfit my boat with all sorts of extra
features so we can come up here and can
I put a sail yeah look at that I got a
sail and that's gonna let me make my
boats a little bit faster out there in
the ocean and let's go out into the
ocean and I heard that you can catch
mussels with the mussels stick and you
I'm just constantly almost starving in
