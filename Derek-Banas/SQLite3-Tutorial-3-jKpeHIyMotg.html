3 of my SQLite video tutorial today I am
going to cover a ton of topics I'm going
to review the create alter select like
order by limit offset update delete
distinct and numerous other different
built-in functions inside of SQL in SQL
Lite now I always thought it was easiest
to learn SQL just by submerging yourself
in the language because it is so natural
so what I'm going to do is just go
through and show you real world ways to
use SQL and specifically SQL inside of
SQL Lite because there are differences
and so I have a lot to do so let's get
into it
now the very first thing we want to do
is just cover a couple of the roles of
SQL number one as I'm sure you already
know each command ends with a semicolon
there are three types of values there
are string literals which are characters
that are surrounded almost always with
single quotes there are numeric literals
which are numbers of any type of course
without quotes and then there are binary
literals which are numbers that are
represented as hexadecimal so we're not
going to spend that much time with AXA
decimal numbers then on top of that
there are five main types inside of
SQLite there are integers there are real
which are of course numbers with
decimals text blob and null you're going
to see more about blob later on if you
ever do need to use single quotes inside
of a string because the string is
surrounded with single quotes you of
course like I said previously in last
tutorial you should put two single
quotes in a row to cancel that out and
not cause confusion single line comments
are going to start with two dashes like
you see on the screen while multi-line
comments are going to start with a slash
and a star and then you put all your
content inside of it and then whenever
you're done you put a star in another
slash SQL is case insensitive so it
doesn't really matter if you use
uppercase or lowercase letters and each
table can have only one primary key and
there's just a couple rules to think
about now I'm going to jump over into a
text editor and show you another couple
interesting ways to use SQL okay so over
here I have SQL Lite running and I'm
using the superhero database
we created last part of the tutorial and
then over here we have a text editor and
I'm going to describe couple things here
and I'll be bouncing back and forth now
basically whenever you are using the
select command what you're going to be
doing here
is select on this first line is defining
the action or the verb then on your next
line you're going to be defining like I
have here with general power the subject
of your query and then with the where
keyword you are going to be defining the
predicate or that thing which describes
your subject which as you can see here
I'm looking specifically for a power
type that is equal to invulnerability
right like that so that is one way to
think about different commands inside of
SQL and now I'm going to come over here
it actually create a new table inside of
our database and as I go along but
explain what all the different things
mean so to create a table of course you
go create table and let's say that I
want to create an Origin issue for each
one of these characters and I'm just
going to increase this fullscreen so you
can see it well then I'm going to define
integer and this is going to be primary
key which of course is going to Auto
increment for you and it should of
course remain unique then what I'm going
to do is define comic name and it is
going to be text and if you do not want
a null value to be an option inside of
that you just type in not null and if
you want to define how this information
would be sorted or compared to other
information you would type in collate
and then you have a couple different
options but for the most part you're
going to use no case if you type in no
case what that's going to do is it's
going to convert uppercase characters to
lowercase characters whenever it's
comparing two different text items if
you would instead type in binary in that
situation if two strings are compared
they're going to be compared using the
exact same characters which may or may
not be a good thing and then finally you
have our trim and what
going to do is compare just like binary
except if there is any trailing
whitespace in one of the text items that
whitespace is going to be ignored but
like I said before I'm going to leave
this as note case because that works
most of the time then we move on to
issue number and it is going to be an
integer and I'm going to put this in
here as not null and if you would ever
want a default value to go in if nothing
is ever entered which you very well
normally define whenever you have not
null as an option you would just type in
default and whatever you want this to be
then I'm going to type in comic is n
which is a number that is recently used
to identify comic books actually doesn't
really work in this situation but I was
just trying to figure out a reason or a
way I could use unique and by typing in
unique that just means that every value
inside of comic issn must be unique if
you want to check to make sure that a
value falls within certain constraints
you would just type in check and then we
would say something like comic issn is
greater than zero and then let's say
that I also want to put a character ID
inside of this and I'm just going to let
that as integer and then after that like
I had talked about previously we can
define foreign keys in a table to
reference a primary key in another table
and like I said before this is just
going to be a character ID and then
you're going to type in references and
then you're going to type in where the
primary key exists what table name that
is and then we're going to type in ID
after that and there you go created that
whole entire thing and taught you pretty
much everything you'd want to know about
create table at the same time of course
I have a link to all this stuff in the
description under the video now let's
say that you'd want to be able to add a
column to a table after you've already
created it how exactly would you be able
to do that well you're going to use a
command that is called alter table and
let's say that I want to put the writer
of the issue inside of here well then
I'm going to define the table that I
want to add this new column to and then
I'm going to tell you
in AD column writer and define it as
text and of course you could use any of
this information that is up here as well
inside of there if you want to constrain
it in any way and there we go
and then if I would type in a schema and
origin issue don't put a semicolon there
you're going to see that writer text is
inside of there so let's clear this
scroll back now what would you do if you
want to rename your table now one thing
to remember about alter if you're going
to be adding a column
it can't be unique it can't be a primary
key it can't have a default value that
has anything to do with current time
current date current timestamp or an
expression inside of parenthesis and of
course if it is set as not null it can't
have an all value of course now back to
what do we do if we want to rename our
table let's say that I decide that
origin issue is a bad name for this
table I'm just going to go alter table
and I'm going to type in the current
name of the table then I'm going to go
rename to and let's say that I want it
to be called first issue instead
da-da-da-da-da schema first issue and
there you can see everything is all set
up the same and if we type in tables
you're also going to see the first issue
is inside of there and orange an issue
no longer exists just remember that with
SQL Lite I know this is weird but you
can't delete columns in any way and of
course like I had said numerous times
before select is going to be used to
quarry your database so I'm going to do
is show you a whole bunch of different
ways to use select and the main cool
thing about select is it's going to
provide you with numerous different ways
to create clauses inside of your
searches that is going to narrow down to
a very specific type of data so of
course we can go select and it is very
common to have the keyword set in
uppercase letters so that's why I'm
doing it that way so let's say I want to
go select ID and character meaning that
those are going to be the things that I
want to show on the screen and I'm going
to say identity and there you go it's
going to print all that information out
now say I want to go in here and define
something a little bit nicer in regards
to separator so that's a little bit
easier to work with boink boink and
there you go now it looks a little bit
nicer of course if I want to show every
single thing from a table I'm just
to put the star inside of there and
there you go and everything's printed
out and then let's go in here
type in schema again let's go in go
schema superhuman like that and then I'm
going to be able to look at this
information above so that I will know
what specific columns that I want to
read information from so let's say I
want to come in here and go select
identity ID from super human I can use a
where clause of course which you've seen
before
power ID underscore 1 is equal to 6 and
there you can see that it printed out 3
and 4 and if I go select from super
human everything you're going to see
exactly where that 3 and that 4 came
from because those are the two matching
sixes
we could also further define this
information down to go identity ID from
super human and say where power ID 2 is
equal to 14 and then put and to further
neuro that information down or those
results down and then go power ID 3 is
equal to 14
and there you see it only listed the 3
as a possible result there we could also
go in here and put or inside of here so
just to save myself some time bounce
through this from and then come in here
and change the and into an or there you
can see it's giving me the results in
which power ID 2 is equal to 14 or power
ID is equal to 3 and that brings us to
like which is going to provide you with
a way to match a series of characters or
zero or more characters and a whole
bunch of other different things so I'm
just going to show you exactly what like
works like somebody say select power
type from general power wear and I can
say something like power type contains
information like and here I'm going to
say superhuman and then I'm going to put
a percent sign and it's going to match
any for instance of superhuman that is
followed by absolutely anything and
there you can say superhuman agility
superhuman endurance super human
longevity da da da da da da so that is
one way that like works another thing we
could do like let's say that we only
wanted to pull up superhuman and then
followed by a word to be
with the letter s actually pretty easy
so here I'm just going to bounce in here
where and in here I'm going to change
this guy just a little bit I'm going to
type in an S and then I'm going to put %
after that then I'm going to go from
general power paste that in there and
there you can see it just popped up
superhuman followed by a word that
begins with the letter s there's another
way to use the like key word another
thing we could do like let's say we
wanted to pull up everything began with
superhuman and then voice followed by an
S word but wasn't followed by the word
strength we're getting really kind of
weird but you only really learn SQL by
playing around with it and actually it's
one of the languages that I've always
found to be the most fun to play around
with so I'm going to say select power
type general power where power type is
like and again we're going to say
superhuman and then we're going to
specifically look for superhuman
followed by an S word and then I'm going
to put and power type is not like put
this in here and then if we want to make
sure that we don't get any results that
contain strength inside of them well we
just do that and there you can see
strength was thrown out of that result
so like I said something you want to
play with to really get another thing is
kind of neat is you can use an
underscore just a simple underscore like
that to do different selections so let's
say you want to do I'm gonna clear the
scroll back let's say you want to come
in here and do a selection on power type
from general power just like before
where power type is like and then you
want to say something like begins with
the word power and then it's followed by
nine spaces or characters so you just go
one two three four five six seven eight
nine like that and there you can see
that's exactly what it did that's pretty
cool there's tons of different ways to
mess around with this stuff another
thing that's really cool is order by so
let's say we want it to do select and
then we're going to say power tight and
let's say we want general power
description as well from general power
we're general
power description which is the
description for the superpower is like
which basically means that it's going to
in this situation have the word control
inside of it somewhere so we're looking
for a superpower that control something
okay and then let's say we want to order
by which just means put them in a
certain order and we're going to say
power tight I don't have to put
ascending in there but I'll put
ascending in there that would be like
alphabetical order or you can type in
descending depends on money oh whatever
you want to do you don't really have to
type ascending in here I'm just doing it
just to show you what it is and then
we're going to say power tie it and then
let's say on top of that you want to
limit your results to ten you just type
in limit ten and then on top of that you
want to delete or ignore the first two
results that meet all of the different
clauses that you've already defined so
you want to get rid of those you just
type in offset two and there you can see
it's kind of a mess but you can see
there's a whole bunch of different
things that popped up there and if you
look inside air controls there and
controls there and controls there and
controls there and so forth and so on
so that's how order by an offset and all
those different things work and limit
another thing that's kind of cool about
this is you could actually use a comma
after limit to set both the offset
number as well as the limit number save
you from a little bit of typing so I'm
just going to cycle back through this go
like that from general power where blah
blah blah blah looking for the word
control again and then we're going to
have order by dah dah dah dah well if
you don't want to type in offset what
you have to do is you have to type the
offset number first which offset is just
the number of results that you want to
skip and then you type the ten after
that and that's going to give you the
exact same results again so that's just
a shortcut way of doing it where you
don't have to type in offset another
thing you could do is if you want to
change the title of columns you can use
the as keyword and that is actually very
useful so we're going to say select and
then power type well power type just
looks terrible like that let's say
instead you want to put something like
common power as your header from general
power and I'm going to say where
power-type is like and then let's say
that I think superhuman human is a kind
of common type of power so in that
situation going to do it that way and
there you can see calm and power showed
up as the header instead of power type
so another thing another thing that I
noticed from the last tutorial was we
come in here from identity was I
actually spelled Steve Rogers name
incorrect I actually have to get rid of
that D to make that right so how do I
change it pretty easy actually I'm just
going to go in here and go update
because I need to update it and I need
to define what table I want to change
then after that I need to define what I
want to set so I want to set secret
identity equal to Steve Rogers so that
that's correct and then I just need to
define the clause so I'm going to say
where ID is equal to 2 which is Captain
America's ID and then if we come in
again now you can see that Steve Rogers
name is spelled right so that's how
update works now the things kind of neat
what I'm going to do here because I need
to have duplications so I'm going to
insert into identity and I'm going to
type in secret identity and character
which are going to be the two columns I
want to change and then I'm going to
type in values and I'm going to create a
new ant-man just to show you how
distinct works and his name's gonna be
Scott Lang and he is ant-man I like that
so now if I go like this you can see
that Scott Lang shows up here as ant-man
and Henry Pym also shows up here as
ant-man
so if I only want to show up one ant-man
how do I do that I'm going to use
distinct so I'm going to say select
distinct character from identity and now
it's only going to show one ant-man even
though there are multiple ant-man's
and that's actually distinct is very
very useful and as this tutorial
continues here for a little bit longer
you're going to see how useful that is
now if I want to go in there and I
decide that I no longer want that
ant-man to exist pretty easy just go
delete actually I'm going to go like
this print that out you can see here
Scott laying the ant-man let's say I no
longer
to exist in my universe I'm going to go
delete from identity where ID is equal
to 7 and now if I do select from that
you're going to see that he disappeared
so that's how delete works
another thing that's neat is SQL Lite
has a ton of different operations that
can perform for you in regards to
arithmetic and boolean operations and
bitwise operations relational operations
and a whole bunch of other different
things so let's say you had SQL laid
open up and you decide you want to do
some addition and some division and some
subtraction and some multiplication well
it can do that for you and that's kind
of neat and of course it can also come
in here and you can do a modulus
operations you find a remainder and
there that is as well you can also come
in and perform numerous different
boolean operations and in this situation
0 is going to represent false and every
other number is going to represent true
and you could actually perform multiple
boolean operations at once and you don't
need just and you could also use or and
of course you could also use not which
is going to give you the opposite of
whatever you type in and there you can
see all the results of those operations
you can also come in and of course do
some relational operations and you can
do more than one of them on each line
and equals is both going to work by
using a single equals point or it's also
going to work if you put two of them in
a row and not equals can be represented
by this symbol here or of course it
could be represented by not equals which
is probably the more common way and
there you go other operations that you
can do with select is concatenation of
strings so let's say you wanted to take
a string super you're going to put two
pipes like that and then you can put in
here o inside of there and that's going
to spit out superhero as one string no
other thing you could do is if you
wanted to check results to see if Paul
for example is in another series of
results here's the in operator here
we'll just put Mike and we
put Phil and Paul like that and it's
going to give you zero which means false
and the reason why is Paul is uppercase
and this Paul is not so it also tells
you how it compares those two guys and
you could also come in here and go
select star from identity where
character is in one of these options and
we'd say Iron Man and Hulk like that and
there you're going to get all your
information in regards to those matches
for Iron Man and the match for all so
pretty cool now a glob is sort of like a
like command the only thing is is it is
case-sensitive when you use glob and on
top of that what you're going to be
using is what are known as UNIX file
globbing syntax instead of the different
syntax that we saw previously well if
like and let me give me an example it'll
make more sense so let's say I go select
from general power where general power
description and then we're going to type
in glob instead of like and if you want
to match for any for instance of super
remember we use before percent signs
well now we're going to use stars and
we're going to type in super like that
to get our results and there you can see
that super say supers their supers
they're super super super but like I
said before when you use glob glob is
case-sensitive while like is not
necessarily if you'd also want to come
in here and search for anything that
matches for nine characters for example
and we're going to say from general
power where power type and then we're
going to say glob again inside of quotes
we're going to say one two three four
five six seven eight nine and here you
can see that it matched animations 9 and
length in organic saamana and telepathy
that's cool no other thing you can use
is between and before I do that I'm
going to bring up everything from power
here on the screen there you go those
are all those different things now let's
say that I want to search for matches in
which power type ID is between 1 and 40
for example how I would do that is I
would go select star from power what
power-type ID is between one and 40 and
there you can say match for all of those
different matches
that's how between works and on top of
all of that
SQLite also has a ton of different
functions inside of it like let's say
you need a random digit I can do that
it's going to give you a really random
really random number or you could come
in here and I'll show you also you can
do absolute value just by doing this ABS
and then if you wanted to say generate a
random number that is between 0 and 100
you actually use the ABS because you
want to get rid of negative results
there you're going to do that and that's
going to give you a random number
between 0 and 100 over and over and over
again
so that's useful like I said all this
stuff I'm typing here is available in
link underneath the video
another thing you do is generate minimum
and maximum values from results so let's
say that you wanted to get the minimum
ID and the max ID or whatever from
identity and there you go 1/6 is the
answer to that and if we go in and go
select everything from identity you can
see 1 + 6 is indeed all minun and the
max if you want to say for example come
in here and print a string in lower case
you just go say secret identity like
that and you want to print another one
in upper case just go upper character
like that and from identity like that
and there you can see that their real
name where their secret identity is
lowercase and their superhero name is
capitalized know the thing you can do is
let's say you want to find out how many
total changes you have made to this
database for some god-awful reason ever
since it's been open you just type in
select total changes and 10 is the
answer to that if you want to see the
number of characters in a result we
could say length dot Ironman in that
situation is going to kick back 8 if you
want to count the number of rows in the
table go select you actually will use
this quite a bit as well count from
identity and there that is 6 and then
you can do all kinds of crazy things
with date you just type in date for
example whoops typed in
ha no you type in date and there you go
that'll give you the current date you
want to type in time in a real geeky way
hey cab that'll give you your current
time date time will give you your data
and time of course now you can do all
kinds of other different operations like
select let's say you want to say date
and you want to find out what the date
was 30 days ago we're going to type in
now like that and inside of quotes
you're going to say - 30 days like that
it's going to tell you the date if it
was 30 days prior and you could also
come in here and go date you want to
find out 20 months ago what the date was
and go now
inside of quotes - 20 months and there
is your date again if you want to find
out what the date would be for the next
Sunday that comes up let's go to select
date I'm gonna type in now again and
then you're gonna type in dot weekday
zero zero is Sunday one is Monday
da-da-da-da-da and there you go you find
out when the next Sunday is going to be
could also come in here and go select
time you can do a lot of things with
these you do now let's see what the time
was 1000 minutes ago and there you go
you could also come in here and go
select time from now and what was a
thousand seconds ago make sure you put
quotes around it though and it'll give
you answer and then another useful thing
you can do is if you wanted to come in
here and modify the format of your dates
just type in STR F time and then inside
of that we're gonna go M which would be
month and I'm going to do another once a
day and then another once a year and
there you go and then for the final
thing I thought I'd do something kind of
fun
Thanksgiving Day changes every single
year date wise and country I live so
let's calculate the next time we will
have Thanksgiving what you're going to
do is type in now and then start all of
year and then I'm going to say ten
months because I want to try to get
somewhere around the end of November
because Thanksgiving always comes on the
fourth Thursday of every month and to
get in that ballpark make sure you put a
quote in there
I was getting there I'm gonna put 21
days inside of this and then I'm also
going to go week day cause I need to
find Thursday which is four and there
you go
Thanksgiving will be on November the
28th 2013 so there is a ton of different
commands you can issue inside of SQL
Lite 3 using SQL please leave any
questions or comments below of last till
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
