object oriented toward in this one
tutorial I combined all the questions I
received on my website as well on
YouTube and I'm going to answer pretty
much everything you'd ever want to know
about object oriented JavaScript we're
going to cover objects properties
constructors prototypes private
properties numerous different ways to
create getters and setters how to use
defined property inheritance how to call
parent methods I'm going to cover some
design patterns and even oo P in
ECMAScript 6 or what would be commonly
known as the future of how to do
object-oriented programming in
JavaScript in the description underneath
the video I have timestamps to all the
different things that I cover so if you
want to just click on those and jump
around in the video and learn only what
you want to learn feel free to do that
and of course all the code is also
available in the description and I have
a lot to do so let's get into it okay so
on the left side of the screen I just
have sublime text here basic text editor
and you can see all of the code that's
right there and this is where I'm going
to be typing everything over here I have
Google Chrome and I just went over here
and went file and open file and then I
opened it up and that's it later on
whenever I cover ECMAScript 6 I'm going
to come inside of here and I'm going to
come down inside of here where we have
more tools and I'm going to click on
developer tools and a whole bunch of
things popped up inside here errors and
such and what I'm going to do is open
this up and I'm going to click on
scratch j/s and if you type in scratch
j/s in google you're going to see it
right here and this is going to add this
in as a developer tool you can use
inside of chrome ok so just install that
and then I showed you how to open it and
later on we're going to get into exactly
how to use that and also just so I'll be
able to follow my different errors I may
make I'm going to click on View and
developer and JavaScript console and
that's going to open up a little console
here and tell me if I make any errors
and if you haven't watched my JavaScript
tutorial you should probably check that
out but it's not necessarily needed
because I'm going to cover some things
here that I covered there along with a
whole bunch of other things well first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a basic object inside of here and
I'll show you a couple different ways to
do this but you'll be able to come in
here
and define some different properties
like the customers name being Tom Smith
we can also come in here and find a
function for our customer and in this
situation we're just going to return a
string and it's going to be my name is
and then on to this we're going to tack
on this which is a reference to a
specific objects value that value being
named and we'll close that off and then
down here we're going to put another
comma everything separated by commas as
you can see right there and also you can
see right here that we'll actually be
able to put objects inside of objects so
let's say I wanted to put another object
inside here for address and then I
wanted to go and put some additional
properties inside here like 1 2 3 main
street again we're going to separate all
these with commas and you can see I can
go and put double quotes or single
quotes or whatever I want to put inside
of here and state and PA and then the
final one you don't do anything with and
then you close this off with a semicolon
now that is a basic object inside of
JavaScript now inside of a write
statement I can output this to the
browser just by going and referring to
the objects name with customer and then
follow that up with speak and since it's
a function put it on like that and
reload it you can see my name is Tom
Smith pops up now we can also come in
here and get ahold of the information
that's inside of address so let's say
that I wanted to say something like
customer name and follow that up with
lives at and then customer I would refer
to the inside of that object is just to
refer to it like this address
save that reload and you can see Tom
Smith lives at 1 2 3 Main Street so
that's how we'd be able to refer to
objects inside of objects we're also
going to be able to come in here and add
properties so we'll just say customer
let's say that I wanted to add to the
address object country also I could do
it this way and I could just go US and
there it is inside of there and of
course I'd be able to come in here and
out
that information again just by referring
to it in exactly the same way country
and you can see us pops up there now if
you wanted to be able to come in here
and create multiple different objects of
the same type you're going to use
something called a constructor function
and basically a constructor is going to
provide the functions that classes
provide in other object-oriented
programming languages and you start it
off by just going function and then
you're going to define exactly what you
want your object to be called and if you
want it to receive certain properties
sent into it and set you do it this way
and you would set those values just by
going this name is equal to name you
don't have to define the data type or
anything like that and we could do the
same thing with street of course and
then if we wanted to define a function
this way we're going to do it in a
different way than what you see up here
say previously we define speak and
function like that whenever you're
defining them inside of a constructor
function instead you're going to list
the name of the function followed by
function like this and then you can have
it return some sort of information and
there you can see it's just going to
list out the name and it's going to say
what street they live on now of course
I'm going to be able to refer to this
person object by first coming in and
calling our constructor function so
let's say I want to create a person
named Bob Smith equal to new person like
this I just pass in the name like we
have to find that it's going to do and
then I would also pass in some type of
street address so Main Street like that
works fine and there we go I just
created a new person object named Bob
Smith and I'm going to be able to call
this with document.write and I can go
Bob Smith like this and then to call the
specific function I want to call I just
do it like that with a dot operator and
reload you can see my name is Bob Smith
and I live at two three four Main Street
now we can come in here and check if a
specific object is an instance of a
specific object type so we could say
something like Bob is a person meaning
the object type there and then we would
be able to come in and check if he was
by going Bob Smith like this and then
instance of
just asking if it is a person object and
you can see Bob Smith is a person that
comes back as true all these things are
very useful to know because you're going
to use them a lot another thing we'll be
able to do is pass an object to a
function and change its values and to do
that we'll just create another function
and let's call this function change name
it's going to receive a person we can
then just go person name is equal to and
Sue Smith and I'll show you later on how
to make these private so it's not so
easy to come in there and mess them up
we will then call the change name
function and pass Bob Smith inside of it
and we're going to then be able to come
in and output this change so we'll say
Bob became make sure you put quotes
around this and now we'll come in and
we'll say something like Bob Smith and
name and you can say that Bob Smith
became Sue Smith it's also important to
know that objects are only going to be
equal if they reference the exact same
object it doesn't mean that they'll be
equal if they contain the same data and
we can see that that is true let's just
come in and go person 1 is equal to new
person and I will pass in Paul and then
we'll also pass in 1 2 3 main and there
you can see they are precisely the same
object however if we would come in here
and see if they are actually equal we'll
say are they equal and we can check for
that equality by just going in here and
going person 1 and checking and we can
do double equals or triple equals it
doesn't matter which person too and the
difference between double equals is it
checks the value and triple equals it
checks the type also it's not going to
matter in this situation though and you
can see are they equal it's false and if
we change this to double equals like
that you're going to see that you get
this same exact answer that's just
different ways to check equality now
let's take a closer look at prototypes
now every function is going to have a
prototype property that's going to
contain an object and you're going to be
able to add properties and methods to
the prototype object and then whenever
you call for them to execute they are
used just as if they belong to your
object which
so let's just come in here and create a
generic function because like I said
every function contains a prototype
object and this guy is just going to
return the number one plus the number
two addition right here now what we're
going to be able to do we're going to be
able to do a lot of different things but
we could come in here and find out the
number of arguments that this function
receives will do something like num of
arguments and then we can come in and
get some and follow that with length and
you'll see a number of arguments except
it is two and the number of arguments
that it receives is two we're also going
to be able to add properties and methods
to an object using prototype so let's go
and let's create another one here this
is going to be an object in this
situation so we'll go function and then
we'll create a mammal function and or a
mammal object and we'll just come in
here once again Ango this name is equal
to the name that they passed in this and
then we'll create a function for it
equal to function like this and it's
just going to return mammals name is and
then pass back the name and now we'll
use prototype to come in here and add an
additional variable to it by just
referencing the functions name followed
by prototype and let's say that I want
to add a sound for this guy and I don't
want this to be a function in this
situation I just want this to be a
string for Gurr
so that's going to be the default for
our mammals I'll then be able to come in
here and add in another reference to
prototype and here I'll add a function
so I'll call this make sound
equal to function and this guy's just
going to return whatever the name of it
is plus and then it'll say says and then
after that it's going to pass back the
sound now what I'm able to do is create
a specific mammal called grover and he
is a mammal and his name of course is
grover and then i'll be able to call
document.write on this just to prove
that
added in properly the make sound and
sound and all that stuff
I'll just call make sound like this and
you can see Grover says goer so that's
how we can create another object and
then add in different variables and
other different functions quite easily
using prototype we're going to be doing
a lot of things with prototype could
also be able to come in here and list
all the properties of an object and for
this I'm going to use the for in looping
structure so we're going to variable
prop which is going to be the temporary
holding cell for each property that we
find inside of Grover in this situation
as we cycle through all of its
properties we'll just go document right
and let's say that we want to just print
out the property that we have for it and
then specific type here's Grover how
we'll reference those properties is
right like this and you can see right
here we have a name property and the
value associated with it is Grover get
info it's actually going to print out
the entire function right there sound
you can see that right there and make
sound it's also going to print out that
entire function which is very useful for
going in and doctoring and messing
around with different objects so there's
all kinds of really cool things you can
do with JavaScript and I'm just
scratching the surface of it or at this
point in time it could also come in and
verify if a property belongs to the
prototype part of an object or the
object Grover itself so let's just come
in here document right and we can see if
name is a part of prototype or Grover so
I will say property of Grover and to be
able to find that out we're just going
to say Grover and then we'll say has own
property and use cheat sheets don't try
to memorize all this stuff that's the
reason why I made you cheat sheets so
we're going to check if name is part of
the Grover or not and then likewise we
can do the same exact thing let's come
in and check if sounds is a property of
Grover and then to verify that again
we're just saying say Grover dot has own
property and then we'll pass in sound
this time instead you can see name
property Grover
that comes back is true and the reason
why is name is indeed in here however
sound comes back as false and that's the
reason why is
we have that in the prototype so that's
how we can check those different things
another thing it's really cool is we
were able to add methods to our objects
that we created what's also cool is we'd
actually be able to add methods to build
in JSX
so let's say we wanted to do something
at in an additional function or method
or whatever you want to call it to the
array built-in object we just go array
prototype and one function that is
missing from the array object is an
array which is going to allow us to
search through an array and find out if
an item is inside of it so let's go and
create it since it isn't already
built-in so we can pass in a value to
this array and then what it's going to
do is we'll create a for loop inside of
this is equal to zero start off with the
first index and it will cycle through
this is a reference to the array and
length like this will cycle through all
of the different items in the array
until we reach the end and then if we
hit a situation in which the array item
is equal to the value that we are
looking for we are then going to return
true meaning that we were able to find
the item we were searching for inside of
our array and then otherwise if we go
through the entire loop and we don't
find anything we'll return false and
that's how easy it is to add an
additional function to a building object
inside of JavaScript so let's come in
here and verify that this actually is
going to work let's create a new array
throw in some sample values here and
then we'll be able to come in here and
search it to see if it's true so we
could say something like three in array
and find out if that actually comes out
and to do that we'll just go sample
array like this in array our new
function we created and throw three
inside of there and reload it and you
can see that it comes back it's true
because three indeed is inside of the
array that we checked so really cool
stuff now let's take a look at private
properties now all properties in an
object are public in that any function
can modify or delete these properties
however you can make properties private
by declaring them as variables inside of
a constructor
I'm going to do that right here so let's
say we have something called secret code
and we want to protect our secret codes
so nobody come in there and alter it or
get it or do anything no problem we're
just going to come in here and actually
declare it so we'll go secret number is
equal to 78 and I'll show you that it is
indeed private and protected I'm going
to create a function however that is
going to be able to interact with it
however it is not going to be able to be
manipulated to get the number so it's
going to receive a number guess and then
what it's going to do is it's going to
search inside here and find out if the
number they passed in is greater than 78
or we could refer to a secret number if
we wanted to let's just keep it simple
just go 78 otherwise return and we're
going to say that they need to guess
something that's lower else if the
number that they are searching for is
less than 78 well then we're going to
return that they need to guess something
that is higher and then else in that
situation that means they actually
guessed it so we're going to say return
you guessed it now let's go in here and
actually verify that all this stuff
actually is private so go outside of
your function and I'm going to create
something called secret which is a new
secret code function or object let's go
in here and get a document right and
we'll say something like value of secret
number and let's go in and try to get it
and we're going to say secret and go
secret number which is the guy that we
have right here you would think that
would work let's go and see if it did
value a secret number and comes back as
undefined okay so we weren't able to get
the secret number that way let's try and
see exactly what else we can do with it
well we could just plain ice and just
call the function we created so let's
just go is 70 the number and we'll say
secret and we'll say guess number and
the first number we're going to guess is
70 and you're going to see that comes
back with higher that we need to guess a
different number and indeed if we come
in and guess 78 that gives us the option
to know that it's true and you can see
that you guessed it pops back another
thing that's interesting is even if you
go and add and know
function it even the function that you
add isn't can be able to get a hold of
secret number so we can go inside here
and we can go secret code and go
prototype and get secret because you're
thinking a trick G I'll be able to come
in here and get a hold of this and we'll
create a function and the whole purpose
of this is to return the secret so we'll
go this and secret number like that Oh
ever whenever you call it you're gonna
find out that you still can't get it it
is protected secret number is and this
is the point which we are foiled we'll
say secret get secret and whenever we
reload that you're going to see the
secret number is undefined so there you
can see that it is indeed possible to
make private variables inside of objects
in JavaScript and protect them and yet
in the same way we'll be able to come in
here and work with them and you can also
say that inside of this function if I
just go and throw a secret number inside
of there instead of 78 you're also going
to see that both those also work so
pretty cool stuff now let's take a look
at a bunch of different ways to create
getters and setters and while doing so
I'm going to teach you a whole bunch of
other things about object-oriented
JavaScript now getters and setters are
going to both protect your data so for
example they couldn't enter a number in
for a name or something like that but
they're also going to provide useful
ways for you to be able to set values
and like I said I'm going to show you a
bunch of different getters and setters
because as you look at other people's
JavaScript you're going to see these
implemented in numerous different ways
and also it gives me an excuse to show
you other things about object-oriented
JavaScript so what I created here is
just a basic old address object and I'm
going to create a getter for it so let's
say get address and what it's going to
do is it's going to combine all of the
data that I have there into one line so
it's going to come in and say return and
just put in the streets and it's also
going to go and divide all this stuff up
with commas and there you can say it's
going to get this street the city and
the state and return that and it was
implemented just by throwing get in the
front
and you're going to see how these are
going to be able to be worked with and
of course separate these with commas
once again and now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to allow the user to send
in three values that I'm then going to
split up and stick them into their
separate pieces and then of course
they'll still be able to be accessed
using get address so this is how you
create a setter so we'll go set address
and they'll pass in an entire address
and of course I can't always guarantee
they're going to pass in the data right
and I should check it but I'm just
trying to keep this simple here so we
can focus in on what's important and I'm
going to convert this into a string and
then I'm going to split it and how I'm
going to split it is with the comma and
the space in between all the different
parts and now what I'll be able to do is
go and assign those different parts so
we'll go the street is going to be in
the parts array index 0 and if they
didn't enter anything just to protect
myself I can just throw in some quotes
there that will be used as a default and
I can also come in for the city and get
the parts as well the second index
should contain that or we're just going
to throw nothing inside of there and
then finally the state is going to be
equal to the last index that we have
inside of there or we will throw just an
empty thing inside of it ok so that's
how our setter is going to work so now
let's come down here and actually do
some cool stuff so we'll do and call
address and we will call set address for
this guy and we'll pass everything in
here real nice and neat the way that we
want now we're going to be able to call
the setter just by putting an equal sign
we don't have to use it as a function
and then we're just going to come in and
we'll say 1 2 3 and Main Street and
divide everything up with commas and
there we go and now what we'll be able
to do is come in and output the address
and I'll show you how to use the getter
here
we're just going to go address and get
address and again we don't have to use
the parentheses there for the normal
type of function and if we reload it you
can see it prints out exactly what we
would want and of course we would also
be able to come in here and
print out just one of those items
because we divided everything up so we
could come in and do something like city
and then we could just call the specific
variable inside of it and it's also
going to print out the city so there's
one demonstration on how to use getters
and setters now I'm going to show you a
deprecated way of creators and getters
and setters it still works in all the
different browsers however and it is
very likely that you're going to see it
eventually so now we're going to create
a constructor function and I'm going to
call this coordinates and I'm going to
create a couple more getters and setters
here I'm going to show you some things
that are still used a lot and you should
know about but I'm also at the same time
going to show you the up-to-date way of
using getters and setters actually I'm
going to show you how to go and use
getters and setters in JavaScript in a
way that's not even implemented yet on
all browsers but soon will be and now
what we're going to do is we're going to
define the getter and setter for this
now that we have latitude and longitude
inside of there and how we would do that
is go object dot to underscores and
define get her two underscores and then
we're going to call call what we're
going to pass inside of here is the
prototype that we want to assign to it
and that's going to be coordinates like
this prototype then we're going to pass
in the actual property name so let's
just call this get chords and then we're
going to create the function and come
down here and close this off with a
semicolon just so you don't get confused
and then what this guy is going to do is
return the latitude and longitude
quite simply plus and then we'll go this
and we'll go a latitude and it will also
come in and output the longitude data
this longitude and there we go we just
created a getter and I promise you if
you get in contact with enough people's
code you will see this being used now
I'm going to show you how to use or
define a setter call and once again
we're going to pass in the prototype to
assign this setter function to so it's
going to be coordinates again and
prototype and then we're going to define
the name I'm going to call this set
chords and then once again we're going
to define the function itself for our
setter so function and it's
to get coordinates passed inside of it
put the semicolon there so you don't
forget and now we'll divide everything
up like we did with the address before
so I'm going to go parts is equal to
chords like this I'm going to convert it
to a string once again I'm then going to
split that string based off of commas
and spaces and then I'm going to assign
the latitude for this guy equal to the
parts array index 0 or let's just throw
nothing inside of there and then I'll do
exactly the same thing for the longitude
parts of it parts and that's going to be
one or nothing and there you go you just
define getters and setters for an object
constructor and we can come in here and
test it is equal to create a new
coordinates object and we'll be able to
call the setter by going to US
coordinates and set chords like this
again we're not going to use the
parentheses and then we can come in and
just throw in a latitude and a longitude
into this and then of course we'll be
able to come in and output some
information so we'll say something like
coordinates and then we'll be able to
come in and just call test coordinates
and call the getter and reload and you
can see it works except I have too many
O's and coordinates but that's not a big
deal
so there you go that's another way of
creating getters and setters now I'm
going to show you how to create getters
and setters using something called
define property now I went ahead and
created a point constructor function and
I'm going to show you a bunch of always
work with this let's say we want to come
in and add a getter and a setter using
something called defined property how
you would do that is reference object
which by the way is the object that
every single object inside of JavaScript
is inherited from so every single
function inside of object is available
to everything else
so let's come in here and go define
property now what we're going to do here
is we're going to pass in the prototype
to attach our new function to so that's
going to be point and take guess what
this is going to be
prototype once again then we're going to
define a name for it so I'm going to
call this point position then we'll put
it in our curly brackets and then I'm
going to say get and then I'll define
the function for our getters and setters
and what this is simply going to do is
just return a string of course so it's
going to have X and then it's going to
return the x position for this guy and
then it's also going to get the Y point
position and output that as well so Y
position like that and that is how we
would come in and define a getter using
defined property now let's go and create
a setter once again so just to find the
function it's going to be passed in a
string called the point and you've seen
this a bunch of times here is the array
we're going to cycle through it get rid
of the commas in the spaces and stick
them into the individual parts of our
point object then after you do that make
sure you put your semicolon here to
close this off and that's all you need
to do with define property you can
define the getters and setters at the
same time now we'll go in and create a
points which is going to be a point
object will then be able to come in here
and call the setters by going a point
and calling point position and then
we'll pass in 100 for the X and 200 for
the Y and then we'll be able to output
this information on our screen so we
could say something like point position
and then we'll just go a point like that
and then how we will get a hold of the
getters is to just go point position
once again same exact thing and close
that off and there you can see exactly
how that works okay so I showed you a
bunch of different ways to use getters
and setters and I'll show you the pretty
much most up-to-date way of creating
getters and setters now this way of
creating getters and setters is based
off of the ECMAScript 5.1 version and
let's just come in here and let's say we
want to create a circle and it's going
to receive a radius and real simple
let's put an underscore here to separate
this from all the other radius
references that we're going to be making
not what we're going to be able to do is
reference the prototype again and create
the Sutter and
to do that we just type in set and
radius followed by radius right there
what it's going to be receiving then
what we'll do is we'll just go this
radius which we have stored inside of
our object is equal to the radius that
was passed in and the getter part of it
is going to be radius and it's not going
to receive anything and it is just going
to return the value of radius and then
make sure you put commas between all
these guys so comma and comma and it
will create another one that's going to
get an area which is another function
we'll have here and we can just say
return we can call the value of pi
because that's stored inside of
JavaScript in our math library and
multiply that times this underscore
radius times this underscore radius and
then close that off we don't need any
more commas and then put another
semicolon here to close off that
definition right there now we'll be able
to come in and create a circle object
and we can pass in a radius for it and
then we'll be able to actually set or
change the radius calling the setter
just like that so you can change it to
15 and now we'll be able to come in here
and output this information on the
screen so we'll say something like a
circle with radius and how we'll be able
to get ahold of that radius again we'll
be using the getter here in this
situation circle radius and then we'll
also be able to come in and get the area
of it as an area oh and how we'll be
able to call that area function is just
go to circ area and then let's say that
we want this only to be two decimal
places we'll use to fix again I covered
this all in my JavaScript tutorial up
had a little bug here on line 18 and you
can see exactly where that occurs put
that dot in there you can see right here
says this radius is not defined say and
now you can see a circle with radius 15
has an area of 700 6.86 so that is the
final way that I'm going to cover on how
to create getters and setters inside of
JavaScript now let's take a look at
inherit
now to understand how inheritance works
inside a JavaScript you have to
understand exactly how prototype works
inside a JavaScript now whenever you
call for a function let's say it's bark
inside of dog it's going to first check
the dog object and find bark and it's
going to execute it let's say however
you have a variable name that is stored
in the prototype object which is also
inside a dog if you would say that you
wanted to use a dog object and find name
it would first check the dog object say
I can't find name here then it would
check the prototype and say ah here's
where name is and use it okay so it's an
object inside of an object just like we
created objects inside of objects now if
we wanted to inherit name inside of
another object let's say it's animal and
name is actually stored inside of animal
how are we going to get ahold of this
because dog is a separate object from
animal quite simply all we would do is
come in and make prototype actually
equal to the animal object then it's
going to be able to come in here and say
I want name for the dog and it's going
to go into the prototype and say huh I
don't know where it is oh that's right
prototype is actually an animal object
and then it's going to be able to get
the name so what I'm going to do is
demonstrate exactly how that works so
we're going to start off by creating an
animal object and it's not going to get
anything and we'll say that it does have
a name and let's just have it be called
animal by default just to keep this
simple we're then also going to define
two string and it's a function that's in
the main object object that every object
inherits from but we're going to
overwrite it here so this is how easy it
is to overwrite functions you just
overwrite them and this guy is going to
return my name is and then pass back the
name okay so that is going to be store
and make sure you close that off with a
semicolon like this now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to create another
object and it is going to be called
canine and in this situation I'm going
to create a name inside
it as well and this is all for tracking
purposes so we'll be able to see
different things and then I'm going to
create another one which is called wolf
which is in the canine species and it is
going to have a name of wolf now if I
want to overwrite the prototype for
canine and wolf what I'm going to do is
just go canine is and then go prototype
and assign it to the animal object okay
so now the prototype is actually an
animal object going to also do the same
thing for wolf and this is going to give
us the ability to come in here and
create multiple well it's not multiple
inheritance but it's different levels of
inheritance and in this situation it's
going to get the canine object assigned
to that prototype one thing to remember
however is after you overwrite a
prototype its constructor is actually
going to point to the main object object
so you're going to have to reset the
constructor for it don't really need to
worry about it much more than just to
know to do this canine prototype and
then follow that up with constructor is
equal to canine okay so make sure that
you do that and then you're going to do
exactly the same thing with wolf
prototype and then go constructor this
is equal to wolf so there you go we just
assigned the animal objects and all the
methods and variables inside of it to
the canine prototype so it will be able
to access them that way now we'll be
able to come in and say something like
arctic wolf is equal to new wolf and
I'll show you how to get ahold of those
parents or animal methods and fire those
instead even if you have the same name
inside of them and now we'll be able to
come in here and access the two string
even though two string is only in the
animal object and I'll show you how to
do that it's how we're going to do it is
document right of course and we'll say
arctic wolf like this and we can go to
string and it's going to jump up
multiple levels because see canine a
wolf are all separated from the animal
object we have up here we're still going
to be able to call it though and you're
also going to see that it's going to
output the proper information and you
can say my name is wolf so it's going to
use the name part right here and it's
going to use the two string which is
located inside of the annum
project and work perfectly so even
though the function is only an animal
it's still going to access it it's going
to jump from the wolf to the canine the
whole way up to the animal object and
use to string
however since name is inside of wolf
it's going to use the proper name right
here so pretty cool and also sort of a
demonstration of polymorphism we're also
however going to be able to check if
wolf is an instance of animal and of
course how we're going to do that is go
arctic wolf instance of animal and you
can see that that comes back is true say
so the wolf is actually an animal even
though it is also still a wolf so pretty
cool stuff another thing that's
interesting is we'll still be able to
add in different variables and functions
into this even though we changed our
prototypes so let's say that we want the
canine the wolf and all animal objects
to have a sound property well we can do
that just like this we're not giving up
anything by assigning the prototype to
another object we're just changing the
way we are referencing it come in here
and also go and create gifts sound in
the same way that we did before and
return and say this name says and then
reference sound which is only inside of
the animal object and then we could also
come in and define sound differently
using prototype it's not going to mess
up anything so we can't assign a
different sound for our canine and also
come in and define a different sound for
our wolf just like that so we're not
being hampered in any way by assigning
those objects to the prototype and we
could say we want to verify arctic wolf
and get sound and you can say wolf says
girl wolf so it's able to use the sound
that's been attached to the animal
object but it also is able to also use
the new sound that we attached
specifically to the prototype for the
wolf so really cool stuff however it is
very important to also know that more
often than not it makes more sense to
just inherit the prototype to speed up
the lookup process so let's go and
create another function here and we'll
call this rodent and it's not going to
get assigned anything and it's going to
have
a name equal to rodent and then will
also create another one called rat and
give it a name also now we'll be able to
come in and go rodent prototype is equal
to new animal say we went and tricked
you there and through an animal and go
rat prototype again equal to rodent
prototype and remember we have to reset
the constructors will say rodent
prototype constructor make sure that is
still a rodent and I'm going to show you
a trick to get around all this here in a
second make this a lot neater so
prototype constructor is equal to rat
now what we're going to be able to do is
come in here and target a specific type
of rat new rat and remember we were able
to get the animal inside of there so
we're going to say to string and I'll
put that and if we reload it you're
going to see my name is rat pops up so
pretty cool and it was very easy to come
in here and just add in that animal
object to a prototype and speed that
along now let's see how to clean up a
lot of this mess by using an
intermediate function now what I'm going
to do is just create a function that's
going to handle a lot of the messy work
for me and let's call it extend and it's
going to be passed in a child as well as
a parent object and what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to create a temporary
and I'm just calling over giving these
uppercase letters just to define that
they are objects that's the reason why I
use that just to differentiate them this
is going to be a temporary holding cell
so I'm going to go to town and I'm going
to say prototype and I'm going to assign
the parent prototype to that and now I'm
going to go and get the child prototype
give it the value of a new or new temp
object we have here and then child
prototype constructor is going to be
equal to child such sort of handles
assigning the prototypes as well as
assigning the constructor and making
sure that everything works well over
there and the reason why this is
important is let's say we created
other function called deer and we can
say this name is equal to deer and this
sound is equal to snort will then be
able to very quickly assign deer to
animal by just going extend passing in
or new deer object and then also passing
in an animal object see that's a lot
easier than what we were doing before
and now we can go and actually get this
to work so let's go up first off let's
go and create a different specific type
of deer so we'll create an elk equal to
new deer and now we can output that
information so we'll say we'll say elk
get sound which is inherited from the
animal object and I accidentally went
and deleted the animal object before I
was done with it so let's throw this in
there paste in everything that we just
did see there's exactly the same thing
save that reload it and now you can see
deer so snort so there's a bunch of
different ways to streamline the process
of inheritance inside of JavaScript now
I'm going to show you how to call parent
methods or super classes or whatever you
want to refer to the mass okay so I
created a vehicle object here and now
I'm going to assign some functions to
this parent object that we're going to
be calling here in a second so just go
prototype again is equal to and then we
can define a whole bunch of different
functions here so it's function and this
guy's just going to return this name and
just keep it very simple drives forward
and then we'll separate this and then
we'll also throw in a stop function and
then this one's just going to return
this name stops now I'm going to create
another object except this guy is going
to be called truck and it's going to get
passed in a name this name is equal to
whatever the name is it's passed in and
now we want to inherit all of the
different functions that are inside a
vehicle for truck
so we'll just go truck prototype equal
to new vehicle then come in here and
also assign the constructor equal to
truck and now we'll overwrite the drive
parent method so we'll go try
 dot prototype this is how we would
overwrite a method inside of it if we
would like to we just go function and
then the different thing we want to have
it do I'm going to go here is a create a
drive message which is going to be equal
to and now if I want to call the parent
method which is inside of prototype I
can do that vehicle prototype drive and
I'm going to follow that with apply and
then I'm going to pass this inside of it
and that's going to allow me to call the
vehicle version of drive even though I
am overwriting the drive version for
vehicle inside of my truck object and
now what I can do is I can say return
and I could throw in the drive message
just to prove that it actually still
works plus equal to and since this is a
truck it's going to be able to drive
through a field cause it's a big tough
truck now I come down here and verify
that let's go and create a jeep which is
going to be a truck object and we'll
just pass in jeep as the name for it and
then we can just call Jeep drive and
then Jeep stop and you can see right
here it automatically went and grabbed
the drives forward from the main vehicle
guy up here say vehicle drives forward
like that and also use the name which
was assigned for jeep and then it also
tacked on the through a field which is
added into the truck
so that is how we call parent methods
now let's go and take a look at how Java
Script is going to be changing by taking
a look at ECMAScript version 6 ok so I'm
going to have to do a couple little
crazy things here I got scratched Jas
over here opened inside of my browser
like I showed you in beginning of the
tutorial and now I'm going to walk you
through some of the changes and I'm
going to execute them over here because
they currently do not execute in all
browsers but it's something that is
definitely coming very soon now the very
first thing I want to talk about is how
method notation in object property
definitions is going to be changing this
is the way that we currently do it
inside a JavaScript and what I'm going
to show you is the ec6
way
of doing things and how that is going to
help so I'm going to define everything
exactly the same way ad stuff is equal
to and this is the part that's going to
change we're now going to be able to
come in here and define methods with
some num1 and num2 in a way that is more
common in other different languages so
we'll say num 1 plus num2 and then the
document.write stuff is going to be done
in exactly the same way and if we go and
we copy that and paste that down here
and we copy this scratch j/s is going to
allow us to see what the future is your
JavaScript is going to look like and I
just copied and pasted that inside of
there if I click on run you can see that
one plus two is equal to three works
just like that so you can see there we
don't need to put the functions in or
the colons or anything we can write in a
style that is more common in other
programming languages now let's take a
look at how classes are going to change
now previously or currently classes
don't exist inside a Java Script but
they soon will so for example in today's
Java Script if we wanted to come in here
and define a point this is exactly how
we would do it this is the way that
we're going to be defining classes
inside of ec6 we will instead be saying
class and point and then creating a
constructor separately passing in the x
position and the Y position we'll be
using this once again to set these
different values so now that's going to
change we're just actually going to have
classes and then inside of that instead
of putting commas between everything we
won't need to do that anymore for our
different functions that we create
inside of here we'll just be able to go
get position and then we'll return
everything exactly the same as we did
previously up here okay
so it's a little bit neater and easier
to see then we'll be able to come down
inside of here and create a point let's
just call it point just to keep
everything simple new point pass in 100
and 200 and then the document.write part
of course is going to be exactly the
same we can paste that inside so now
let's go and copy this and see that this
works over inside of here paste that in
there there it is
as before and run and you can see indeed
that that does work so classes are
coming to JavaScript and they will be
coming very soon now let's take a couple
other looks at other specific
object-oriented stuff with ec6 we're
going to come in here and create an
animal object using a class go and
create a constructor course we're going
to assign the value to that we can then
come in and go to string and return
animal is named this name and we're
going to be able to create static
functions as well and we'll be able to
just come in and type static get animals
and return new animal let's go and
create an one side of this with no name
so this is going to allow us to generate
new animal objects just by calling the
get animal function inside of here which
is static we're also going to be able to
extend or inherit in different ways with
ec6
so we can just inherit everything that
animal has inside of it just by putting
extends inside of there here we can then
change this up so that the animals also
get an owner we're also going to be able
to call the superclass in an easier way
just by using the super reference so
this is automatically going to
initialize name just by calling the
super constructor up here and then
because owner doesn't exist inside of
the animal object we'll have to assign
that then we'll be able to come in and
overwrite to string inside of our dog
object and return we'll be able to call
the super version of to string just by
putting super in front of it you see
this
just easier and then we can say dog is
named and pass out the name like that
and now we'll be able to come down
inside of here if you're having trouble
seeing all this stuff just go in the
link in the description and get all the
code at one time and we'll say pass in
Rover and we'll pass in Paul as Rovers
owner and now we can pass in print all
this information out just to prove that
everything works and then print out all
of this additional information on this
dog object and then also why don't we
come in and also call the two string
method just to show how that works
by calling Rover to string and then
let's call the static function as well
to generate a new animal object will
call it Bowser you can see we can do
this as well and then we can print some
information out about this new Bowser
animal object and call to string of
course because it exists there and there
you go and now if we go and copy all
this we're going to be able to throw it
over into scratch j/s and test that it
actually all worked and run and you can
say Rover is owned by Paul animal is
named Rover dog is named Rover and here
is all of our Bowser information so
there you go guys there's a rough
overview of how object-oriented
programming is going to change in the
next version of JavaScript now let's
take a look at some cool design patterns
and how to implement those inside of
JavaScript okay so now I'm going to
cover some design patterns in JavaScript
so I'm going to cover four of the most
common starting with the singleton
pattern and Singleton's are basically
used whenever you know that you'll only
ever want one object to be created of a
specific type so let's say we want to
create a game character that's going to
have fixed statistics I'm going to come
in and define object called hero and
it's going to be given a name when it's
created now what I'm going to do here
before I create a new hero object is I'm
going to check if the object already
exists and how we can do that is go if
and then we could say type of and hero
instance and then check if it's an
object if it's an object that means it's
already been created and in this
situation which is created we can just
go return hero instance and return the
only hero object that will ever be
created otherwise what we're going to do
is allow them to command and create the
first hero object and to do this they'll
go and find the value for name and then
we'll go hero instance is equal to this
and then finally return that new hero
object so it's quite simple to create a
singleton now let's go in here and
actually test that it works so we'll go
and create a hero Derrick and he will be
hero type and his name will be Derrick
of course then we could say our hero is
called Derrick hero and get the name and
then just to verify that this cannot be
changed we're going to come in and we're
going to create a new hero and let's
call this Paul hero because remember
we're making a game in which we're only
going to have one hero so doesn't make
sense to have to we're going to verify
that this works and it will call Paul
hero if we execute that you can see that
the name stays as Derrick so we can only
ever create one hero type and that's a
rough overview of how the singleton
pattern works now let's take a look at
factory patterns now a factory pattern
can be used to generate different
objects on request so let's stick with
our game analogy here and let's say that
we want to generate weapons for our
different heroes and they are going to
have a description of the type of weapon
that they are so there's going to be
weapon type and we're going to set that
by default to sword because this is a
sword and then we'll also define the
metal the style of sword and whether
it's a magical sword or not likewise
we're going to do this let's say that
the hero starts off with the option of
either having a sword or a bow well
we'll just change this to bow then and
then set this the bow and then have the
default now I left that as metal doesn't
really matter what it is let's just
leave it as metal we could call it
material if we'd like to that works have
that set the would have the default be a
longbow and have magic be false now what
we're going to do is create a weapon
factory which is going to generate very
specific types on demand so weapon the
factory and it's not going to do
anything right now here I'm going to
define everything underneath now I can
say weapon factory and target the
prototype and let's call this make
weapon and this function is going to be
passed a description of the type of
weapon that we want to get passed and
we'll just go weapon class set this by
default to null and then we'll say if
the description for weapon type is equal
to sword well in that situation we'll
set our weapon class the class that we
want to use here I'm
following a class but it's actually this
object just trying to differentiate it
there and make it a sword object okay so
if they say they want a sword we're
going to give them a sword else if in
the description for weapon type they say
they want a bow
well then we're going to pass them back
a bow object so let's just have this be
weapon class is equal to bow and then
else if they don't pass either of those
we'll just pass back false and now after
we have that defined we'll say return
and define this new weapon object for
them and then pass in the description so
it's going to define dynamically what
type of object we're going to create for
the weapon and then pass in the
description and define all that stuff
and I can generate this factory by
saying my weapon factory is equal to new
weapon factory and then come in and
actually define one of these let's call
this blade fist is equal to and call the
weapon factory and call the make weapon
function and then pass in all of the
information about the specific type of
sword that I want so I want weapon type
of course I need to tell it sword so
that it knows I'm creating a sword and
then metal is going to be dark iron and
then style is a Sai type of sword and
then has magic let's have that have a
value of true and then put a semicolon
down here and let's go and print out
some information about my weapon if I
reload it you can see sword of types I
crafted from dark iron prints out on the
screen so there's a way of using factory
patterns to dynamically create objects
inside of JavaScript now let's take a
look at the decorator pattern now the
decorator pattern is going to allow us
to alter an object at runtime so let's
go and create a pizza Lytton basically
the main goal here is to go and
calculate changes in prices based off of
different toppings that we add to our
pizza I'm just going to add one topping
here just keep it simple so let's have
the price for a default pizza is going
to be equal to ten now what we can do is
go
create a prototype function called get
price and there we go it's not going to
get anything passed inside of it and all
it's going to do is return the price for
said pizza now what we can do is
generate another object and that objects
going to represent
extra cheese that could potentially be
put on our pizza and if that extra
cheese is added that's going to have a
additional price so we want to get the
previous price set for our pizza and we
can get that just store that temporarily
and now we want to create a new price
for our pizza which is going to be the
previous price plus one dollar let's
extra cheese cost one dollar all right
so now how we'll be able to add extra
cheese to our pizza is let's go and
create a pizza object first new pizza
stay that every pizza starts off as $10
and if we want to add extra cheese and
change the price for our object we just
pass in our pizza into the extra cheese
object and it's added and now what we'll
be able to do is get our updated price
for our pizza very very easily and you
can add anything you'd want to all these
different objects dynamically just
showing you a very simplistic overview
of how this would work but go in there
by all means and play around with it see
what you can come up with you can see
the cost of the pizza goes from ten to
eleven dollars okay so that's how we
would use the singleton and the
decorator and the factory pattern and
now let's take a look at the last
pattern I'm going to talk about which is
the observer pattern now the observer
pattern is going to use a single object
that's going to notify many other
different objects or observers whenever
a state change occurs so what we're
going to do is we're going to create
what I'm going to call and observe a
bowl which means it can be observed by
others and this observable needs to have
a list of people that have subscribed to
be able to be told some bit of
information I'm going to use like a
stock market analogy here and then we're
going to have a couple functions for our
observable so
prototype and the different functions
I'm going to have them and have an
option to subscribe of course let's just
leave that as subscribe and that's going
to be passed a subscriber and then quite
simply we're just going to go
subscribers pay reference to that object
this subscribers and then push on this
new subscriber onto that array and what
else do we need well they probably want
to unsubscribe so let's give them the
option to unsubscribe as well and of
course one subscriber I don't know if
that's even a word but I'm just going to
use it is it makes sense and then to
unsubscribe we're just going to cycle
through all of the subscribers and if we
get a match then we are going to take
them out of our rack so subscribers
length and then increment through all
those until we find one and then we're
going to check to see if the subscriber
in our list is equal to the un--
subscriber that was passed into this
function and if they were I'm just going
to go this subscribers and I'm going to
splice them out of our array and I can
do that just by going I and then one
meaning that I want to get rid of one
item inside of the array and then if I
get here I know I found it and I can
just leave so I could do something like
on subscriber pass back the name maybe I
want to come in here and get that and
put information out on the screen that
somebody has unsubscribed and then do I
want to do anything yeah well of course
I'm going to need to publish some
information to all of my subscribers so
let's create a publish function and
there that is and it's going to publish
some type of data that's going to need
to be shot out to all the subscribers
and how I would shoot through all of
these different subscribers and notify
them that things have changed as I want
to use a for-loop this subscribers and
then cycle through all of them and
meant that of course and then I'm going
to need to call this subscribers once
again I'm going to call a function that
is called received data which is where
they're going to receive this
information and I have to create that of
course and then come down here and
that's all that I need for that so
that's going to be the observable who is
going to push data to all the of the
observers so now let's go and create a
brokerage house let's call this organ
Fannie very classy name and of course
it's going to have organ Fannie and it
is going to have a receive data function
inside of it I could have used
inheritance to get all this but I'm just
trying to keep this simple and it's
going to output some information on the
screen something like this name received
your info and then it's going to push
out whatever info was actually passed
inside of it and there we go and then
let's create another top-notch
investment company maybe we call this
one Boldman yaks there they are and it's
going to do exactly the same thing I'll
put all that information and now what I
can do is create a new observable and
just go new observable there's an
observable object and I can subscribe
people to it easily so observable and
subscribe and then I'll pass in the
organ phani object and then we're gonna
do exactly the same thing for the
Boldman yaks we are and then I can quite
easily come in here and push information
out to all of these different
subscribers just by calling publish and
let's say I want to put something out
like IBM at certain price 145 30 or
something like that and we'll be able to
come in here and check or why don't we
just unsubscribe somebody just to show
that that can work as well and we'll
just go observable and unsubscribe and
who's going to unsubscribe from our
wonderful service let's say it's the
organ Fannie group and remember whenever
unsubscribe is called the sky Fair it's
going to return the unsubscribers name
and you can see here whenever the
data is passed it's going to call
receive data for all these different
objects so that's going to print all
this information out on the screen each
time one of those updates and then we
could say something like on subscribed
and then we can come in and also notify
that another pricing change has occurred
with IBM and execute it and you can see
we're going to finally receive your
information this comes from this we
passed that with publish we jump up here
to publish you can see what it's doing
it's calling receive data on every
single subscriber and receive data
prints all this information out on the
screen you see that organ Fannie
unsubscribed and then you can see that
only Boldman yaks was then notified
thereafter so there you go guys that is
a insane amount of information about
object-oriented JavaScript
and please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
