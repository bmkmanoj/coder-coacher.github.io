8 of my wordpress featured content
tutorial where I'll teach you how to
make this featured content tool that you
see right here and in this tutorial I'm
gonna refer to pages multiple times what
I mean by pages is the pages of this
featured content tool here and whenever
I click on the arrow tool as you can see
here I'm switching to pages so i have a
total of three pages so i just wanted to
go over that before I jump into the code
and then these would be the individual
posts an individual post title and
excerpt this is the featured image here
are the featured thumbnails and this is
read more and again these are all of the
separate pages that contain all those
thumbnails and featured content all that
other stuff okay now into the code okay
well from the last tutorial which if
you'd I haven't seen it definitely watch
it before you proceed here otherwise
definite confusion will ensue we ended
with the end while and what I'm trying
to do here is create all this stuff over
here dynamically by pulling all this
information from the WordPress database
but it sounded way more confusing that
really is what I'm going to do first off
is I have to create my pages which I
just told you what those were and how
I'm going to do that I'm going to go ntt
underscore I is equal to 1 and I'm just
going to create this for loop and it's
going to cycle through what are three
pages in this situation but this does
work if there's only one page or if
there is two pages obviously and then
ntt Nam FC pages is a reference to how
many pages are stored that's a variable
that's all that is I'm going to go and
TT I and I'm going to increment it at
the end there that's all I'm doing with
that for loop and then I'm going to end
this for loop AB in here then I'm going
to find my first host number so there's
five posts per page 5 posts associated
with each page as you can see here so
what I got to do is cycle through and
figure out what this guy is right here
so if this is the first page this is
going to be the first thumb now this is
going to be the sixth and then you go to
seven eight nine ten and then the third
page this turtle here is going to be the
11th so I have to define what that's
going to be so how I do that is go in TT
underscore I and multiply whatever that
is x 5 and then subtract 4 from it if
there is only one page NT ti times 5 is
going to give me five which is going to
give me minus four is going to equal to
one so the first post is going to be the
first post and then what if there's a
second page this is going to have
value of to multiply that times that and
then you can see how all these other
different things going to fall in line
and then I'm also going to create or
establish what my ending post is going
to be I'm going to find that in much the
same way just multiply it times 5 don't
subtract the floor and there you go got
all those now I'm going to initialize
the beginning of the page with the first
title and all this it's stuff that you
see up here so i have to create all that
dynamically so I'm gonna go ntt FC age
is equal to I'm gonna go to do glass is
equal to n TT and all this code is
available in a link in the underbar if
you want it you can do anything you want
with that it's canoe license so you can
edit it do whatever you don't even have
to give me credit for creating it don't
care all right so and then basically
what I'm doing is when I was plugging in
all this HTML that's on the right side
of your screen if you can't see it you
can display this full screen and you'll
be able to see it better because it's an
HD movie and then we go ntt and because
i created all of this stuff in the
previous part of this tutorial i can
jump in here and grab this title it's a
shark here but I want this to be dynamic
so it's going to grab whatever the real
title is and I stored that in their
array in the previous tutorial so I
Glenn TT start post because it's going
to put the first post title in there by
default whenever we first start out and
all this stuff's going to later on be
dynamically created or edited using
jquery div and i'm going to close off
that div equal to m TT i'm gonna throw
in a horizontal rule I'm just copying
all the HTML from the right side of the
screen nothing I fancy create another do
give it a class equal to and TT particle
excerpt so I got all that defined inside
of there and now i'm going to create all
of these article excerpts that are
inside here so i got to create five of
these so what am I going to do I'm going
to create a for loop in TT I'm going to
create a new junk variable called J ntt
start post I'm going to give it the
value of whatever the starting post
value is as long as we don't get to the
value of the end post I know that I need
to create five of these guys and I'm
going to auto increment that and then
I'm going to create all these excerpts
that you see over here on the right side
of the screen just by copying the HTML
so you know ntt FC underscore page I'm
adding nttf see page is going to be all
of this stuff on the right side of
screen everything so I have to a pen
to it I'm going to do put a pee inside
of there and we get a title and then I'm
going to close that off and I got to
replace all the spaces in the title with
dashes so it's pretty easy to do very
title do a string replace and I want to
replace the spaces with dashes they're
just did that and what do I want to do
that for I want to do it on FC info
which is the title in the array
underscore J and the zero index for that
is the title and then I got to make all
the characters in the title lowercase
and d2 temp title is equal to if I want
to make it go to lower case i call this
inside a PHP STR to lower in TT ten
title then I want to place the title
into the title attribute for this
paragraph so it's going to go right
after this line right here so I'm going
to go in TT FC page since i'm adding to
it i'm going to put the dot operator
inside of there and TT temp title and
enclose that off and i'm going to
continue adding to this ofc page dot
operator equal to n t 2 FC the array
that has all my information in it that I
need a TT underscore j and this is the
location for the post excerpt I think
that and then close that off and then I
close this off this is all the code
that's needed to generate all this
information right here for all these
excerpts all we need to do really nice
and easy so that's real super so let's
continue ntt FC age operator and I
clothes off that day of create a new div
class is equal to n TT read more then
I'm going to create the read more tag
and give it the first post URL link by
default just like I gave up here i use
the first title as default well down
here i'm going to use this read more is
actually going to be that thing right
there so i'm actually going to put
something inside of age reference here
and i might as well just copy this
because I get to keep tightening over
and over and it's going to be a H
reference because it's a link that close
that off dot operator to join these
strings and i'm going to say i want the
first post now i go NT t start post so
i'll get me the information in regards
to the link here to the main post that's
stored in part two of that array i'm
going to have read more be there every
single time
this up close that div and I'm going to
create another div class actually I got
to daves to close just using the right
side as a reference to what I'm doing
here say closing div closing div it's
all I'm doing so then one of my guy down
putting ntt featured pic inside here
glass and TT featured pic and close that
off so then I got to create a for loop
that's going to generate all the code
needed for all the featured pics again
have this start out as ntt start post
just like before it's always going to be
the same cycle through these as long as
I don't come to the final post or up
until I get to the final post that i
want to put inside of there and then
auto increment J again now what I got I
got to get the featured image link to
the post so that if they click on the
featured image they're sent to the
actual post and i also have to get the
post title so i'm going to go ntt
actually go like this so i'm going to
surround this with an anchor tag so that
whenever the featured image is clicked
you get sent to the post and you're not
displayed the image or whatever FC info
ntt post number and we get to which is
going to be the actual URL for the post
and have image source is equal to close
that off and i'm going to NT to FC info
n TT j and then in the array i have the
actual reference to the featured image
stored in part 3 of that array or index
3 if you would like you go alt don't
forget to put two equals sign inside of
there and TT i'm using the title here
which is located in the zero index for
that erratic goes that off and then
close off the anchor tag and that's all
i need to do to generate all of these
featured images that you see right here
so that's what i create it right down so
now i'm going to create all of the
thumbs just keep adding to this page div
class is equal to n TT thumb box and if
you're in any way confused by this it's
probably because you didn't thoroughly
understand what i had done in regards to
creating arrays and putting all that
information and arrays in the last
tutorial so just take another look at
that you should be fine I probably
should have said that earlier in this
tutorial alright so let's generate these
thumbnails so ntt f
page on equal to if class is equal to
and TT thumbnail frame and TT and then
I'm actually going to plug in all of
that HTML that we had stored previously
this is going to save me a ton of time
and that's stored in index for and then
I closed off that and we can continue
making some stuff here in TT so we got
all this done all of that is finished
now we're getting down to this part ntt
FC underscore page equal to close the
div just like it tells me to do on the
right side of the screen think a lot of
the problems with people learning to
program is just being organized is so
hard you're organized you should do much
better source equal to dangerously close
to being down here Oh copy that paste
and of course this is heavily commented
on my website and the code that i have
here I would never do this without put
in any type of comments but it would
just take forever I was doing these
tutorials and also putting comments and
at the same time so I go images /f see
so I'm just grabbing the left arrow this
is always going to be the same I go alt
is equal to back be there as my alt
close that off clothes off the day of
create another day of class name it's
equal to n TT right so this is a
reference to the right button the image
source is equal to and just to break
this up a little bit so it doesn't
become overly complicated ntt plug-in
directory this is a just a exactly what
it is it's a link to the plug-in
directory and it's going to jump to the
plug-in directory for this plug-in that
I'm creating here and it's going to go
into the images folder and it's going to
grab in a situation the right button out
of there alt-text next give this a
capital B and then close the deal just
like it is over here on the right well
those that guy off let's scroll this up
so we can see it a little bit better now
in the future i'm going to use something
different here that i'm using on my
local machine because when a local
machine you can't access urls in the
same way you use the server so i'm going
to show you what I'm going to use later
on just so you know how to do this
featured data one this is where the
first page for the featured content tool
is going to be stored by le ok so in the
future this is going to be used to jump
into the plugins directory and then go
grab this and then this right here is a
reference to the current plug-in that
this is like we're actually in a plug-in
file right now so it's going to say okay
in the same directory where this plug-in
file exists I want you to look for
featured data one dot txt ok so that's
in the future right now we're not going
to use it because in a local machine
you're not able to do that you have to
actually tell it where the stuff exists
on a local machine just go to library
web server and I'm gonna documents
announce to the whole way wordpress WP
so that you know where it exists plugins
say I have to actually go directly to it
then what I'm going to do is I'm going
to go this and go ntt start so that this
is also dynamic and then after that go
dot txt cuz I'm going to be pulling in a
text file that's how I'm going to
actually grab that and then I got to
open the file and then i have to write
to it so i'm going to go ntt FC call it
page to write and you go F open it's a
just simple PHP and i'm going to say i
want to open this file right here paste
that in there and then i want to write
to it and this is how you say you want
to write to it and if this file doesn't
exist it will create a new one and if
you go F right go ntt FC let's just copy
this link and TT see page this is what
we've been creating this stuff over here
has been stored in this variable called
ntt featured page and now i'm writing
that to this file right here on inside
of the plugin and then after you're done
UF close this guy right here and i close
the file and that's it got the whole
entire thing done and now this code that
we've created over the last tutorial
over the last two tutorials is going to
generate all this stuff dynamically
based off of information that the user
submits do any questions or comments
