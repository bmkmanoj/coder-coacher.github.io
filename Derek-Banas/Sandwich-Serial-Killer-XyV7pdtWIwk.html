and asked me to make a sandwich that was
healthier bigger and tastes better than
a subway veggie Delite sub or what she
said was there healthiest submarine
which ends up being that well I'm
competing against a 6-inch sub and I'm
actually going to make a 12 inch sub and
my submarine is going to not only have
absolutely no fat in it it's also going
to contain no cholesterol a very minimal
amount of sodium and the secret weapon
the reason why Subway sandwiches are so
bad is the high fructose corn syrup in
their bread which my bread does not have
any what I'm going to need here and all
by the way these are the knives that
Dexter uses on the TV show dexter to
kill people if you ever wondered the
mundial future is the name of the knife
and he uses the six-inch blade what you
do cut up all of your ingredients right
here is about a cup and a half of
mushroom and then I got myself a big
slice either use red or white onion it
doesn't matter and I like to keep them
clump and bake and then to that I'm
going to add some banana peppers this is
exactly one-quarter cup here I chopped
up some red peppers and how a painting
peppers this is exactly one half a cup
and this is fresh direct salsa this is
exactly half a cup and that's pretty
much the best Saul so you're going to be
able to get I'm going to combine that
with a schwans this is a frozen baguette
bread it's fat-free it's only 120
calories in comparison to the 200 and
some calories and I'm going to weed the
calorie count down even further yet by
tearing out the insides of the bread so
I got to turn my oven on 24 25 and cook
this for 10 minutes and then take
everything I got here on this tray and
throw it in a pan okay now i got my pan
I'm going to spray a little bit of ham
spray in there that's like next enough
that left Pam spray pretty much zero
calories then to that I'm going to add
my mushrooms and my onions this is
turned on hot that's a total of
thirty-one calories actually it's less
than that's probably about 25 calories
for all those mushrooms and then for the
onions at five calories for a big giant
slice of onions and there's no reason to
put oil in here because these mushrooms
have a lot of water
them and please watch them I fear people
all the time saying don't watch my
friends it's manure on that don't eat
that okay so take that cook it in cans
and the water is going to come out of
the mushrooms and it's going to just
likes to hear and then to that we're
going to add my quarter cup of the
banana peppers that right there are
seven calories and then these are red
and how painting a whole bunch of the
pepper said a lot of slice here and then
freshdirect also there's a half a cup of
that boom that comes out 240 calories
like I said just gonna be a 12 inch sub
instead of a 6-inch sub and it's going
to be roughly around 200 calories flat
instead of the subway 230 calories which
is essentially just tomatoes and lettuce
and onions inside of a loaf of bread
that is six inches in length upon
further inspection actually absolutely
annihilated the subway veggie Delite
sandwich again they have a six-inch
white bread roll so it's smaller than my
sandwich and that comes in at two
hundred calories why high fructose corn
syrup they use it I don't and not only
as high fructose corn syrup worse for
you it doesn't suppress hunger like the
sugar in my bread does and quite simply
why they use high fructose corn syrup as
its cheaper on top of that I went into a
subway told them to give me the generic
veggie Delite that met the specific
nutritional guidelines they put on their
website and what I got was a handful of
lettuce essentially one slice onion
essentially a couple handfuls of green
peppers and about two slices of a tomato
that equals out the 30 calories doesn't
taste very good either with that I came
to a total of 2.5 grams of fat again
this is off of their website 410
milligrams of sodium and five grams of
fiber with my sandwich which was 12
inches it came in at a total of 130
calories no high fructose corn syrup no
additives and actually I could have made
this a lot healthier and lower in
calories if how it made the bread myself
which is extremely easy to do if you've
never tried to make bread and on top of
that my bread is more filling the
peppers i use were much more filling in
higher fiber so are the mushrooms much
more filling i also used onions and
lettuce and tomatoes and the salsa made
my sandwich tastes a lot better all of
that 40 grams of fat less sodium and
right around if not more fiber
ok so the bun is out of the oven again
10 minutes for 25 what you want to do is
get a baguette white bread with no high
fructose corn syrup remember that's what
subway has in their bread that makes it
fattening and terrible for you and then
you just rip out all of the insides I'll
feed this to somebody for those people
to say I'm wasting food if I take more
time I normally would rip out just about
everything because you're not going to
miss that bread so why consume it and
this is one of the core reasons that i
went from 250 pounds to 164 pounds left
and weighed myself and i'll provide more
information on the day and then you just
stuff this in there in it this isn't
rocket science tearing out the inside of
bread for a lot of people they just
don't think of stuff like this and you
think that's going to taste better than
some lettuce and tomatoes and onions
awesome and of course if you don't like
hot food you can put in milder covers
and then throw some lettuce on it and
then the throws made in there and
there's a heck of a sandwich and this is
one of the core reasons why I lost as
much weight as I did this is a huge
sandwich I'll fit it all on the screen
came in federal on the screen so there's
a healthy sandwich a healthy alternative
to subway it's healthier you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below otherwise till
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
