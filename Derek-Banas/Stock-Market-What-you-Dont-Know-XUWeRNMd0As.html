presentation which I explain why I
believe Bayern hold investing is dead
here I'll prove you shouldn't continue
investing the way you have then first I
want to start off by explaining exactly
what I mean by dead the stock market is
no longer what it was long-term
investing is dead buy and hold investing
are dead and it is my opinion that only
a very sophisticated investor can make
money in the market now the problem is
that brokerage houses keep telling
everyone that the old days will come
back I actually received a direct mail
piece from a brokerage company last week
and it took me back to the old days I
used to be a stockbroker and one day I
started to wonder about our marketing
why did we only show the performance of
the stock market from 1980 to 1999 the
piece I received last week actually did
the same thing it's 2010 right now so
why not show the performance for the
last 10 years it's quite simple the
reason is that the Dow Jones Industrial
Average grew by 13 point 99 percent
year-over-year during that period this
growth rate historically is off the
charts so what is the average return of
the Dow historically most people don't
know that between 1897 through 2003 the
Dow grew by only five point one six
percent before fees per year in fact the
return of the market from 1897 through
1980 is but three point seven three
percent which is approximately the
average rate of inflation and I'm
talking about the real rate of inflation
now not a made-up inflation number that
the government now uses so why did I
choose to look only a data between 1897
the beginning of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average to 2003 well first
off its simple I had this information on
hand secondly in 2003 the market was
roughly where we are today being that
the Dow is floating between ninety eight
hundred to ten thousand also I didn't
want you to think about the financial
disaster of last year and now and lastly
brokers are saying a complete collapse
is a once-in-a-lifetime event so I
simply won't even count that even though
it would be a positive on my end to do
so so what exactly is the Dow Jones
Industrial Average the stock market is
considered by most people to
be the Dow Jones Industrial Average the
Dow was created in 1896 by Charles Dow
at that time it was made up from 12
stocks that were chosen to be on the
list because they best represented the
performance of their specific industry
of those 12 stocks only one remains
being General Electric every other one
has either been bought up or gone
bankrupt so how is the Dow calculated
originally the Dow was calculated by
adding the prices for all the stocks and
then dividing but not anymore to keep
the Dow a meaningful number more needs
to be done with all the stock
substitutions stock splits spin-offs etc
so in calculating the Dow they have to
figure out the exact value of all 30
stocks if they purchase the exact same
dollar amount of each share on that last
slide I talked about something you might
not know about it's called a stock split
and a stock split is when a company that
is currently selling at $50 for example
for share decides to double the number
of shares but have each be worth half as
much so this company would still be
worth the same overall but it's per
share price would now be $25 so this is
why a company with a huge per share
value such as Google or Berkshire
Hathaway may be worth less than one that
is actually priced at around $10 now I'm
going to go through and show you the
real stock market and the real returns
here I'm showing you the beginnings of
the Dow Jones Industrial Average and as
you can see here year-over-year from
1896 to 1910 you were able to receive a
annual return of 2.4 8% that is it we
then move on to 1910 through 1920 during
this period we were able to see a return
of 3.7 1% again not a great return on
investment here we saw a major boom but
we know what that ultimately led to from
1920 to 1930 if you invested in the
market you were able to receive a return
of 10.1% but then from 1930 to 1940 you
actually lost 5.4 6 percent
year-over-year then from 1940 to 1950
were able to receive a wonderful return
of 4.8 5% then things started to kick
back in and you were able to receive a
return of eleven point seven person
which is to a certain extent an
abnormality but also to a certain extent
is a major boon time for this country
overall then if you invested from 1960
to 1970 you saw a wonderful return of 2%
if you invested from 1970 to 1980
received a return of 1.7 percent and
then we start getting into a very odd
situation if you look closely at what is
going on here on the screen you see a
lot of words like deregulation you also
see a lot of scandals that occurred
during this period in regards to finance
on the stock market
you see crashes and you see a lot of
very odd things that you did not see on
the previous slide such as junk bond
market collapses so there was obviously
a lot of odd things potentially illegal
thing I'm not saying that nothing
illegal was done in the past it most
definitely was but you could see here
that all of a sudden the charts started
to change then you see a major growth
period this is totally abnormal this is
whatever the market was earning a
average return of 14.8% again you can
also see a lot of odd references to
finance on this chart as well and then
as you see on this chart the return of
the Dow Jones from the year 2000 until
2003 and now we are in our present day
in which we've seen an average return
from 2003 to 2009 of pretty much zero
the market has gone pretty much in fact
nowhere for the past ten years and what
makes it even worse is that brokers
can't even beat the return of the Dow
Jones Industrial Average I track the
performance of the top 3,000 mutual
funds and their performance between the
dates of 1993 to 2003 61.3% of these
funds actually lost people 20 percent or
more during this boom time in actuality
only three point three percent provided
a return of 7% even though the Dow's
annual rate of return was nine point
eight three percent and that 7% number
I'm referring to is actually before fees
and the shift into the present
of 2010 Bloomberg recently reported on
Goldman Sachs that seven of the
investment banks nine recommended top
trades for 2010 have been money losers
for investors who adopted that firms
advice now during the rest of this
presentation and into a future
presentation I'm actually going to
explain how much actually goes into
investing in the stock market I was
taught by some pretty intelligent older
brokers how to invest in the stock
market and know this isn't gonna be a
sales pitch I don't sell stock anymore
you have no doubt heard about asset
allocation well I just want you to know
that asset allocation in the regards to
the way you know it is complete nonsense
it's in actuality based off of the real
way to invest which is called covariance
analysis
so what's covariance analysis well to
cut it short you create efficient
portfolios made of stocks bonds and
short selling for risk aversion and the
ultimate goal being to create a
portfolio of investments that provide
the greatest return at the lowest risk
they only give you an example let's say
you own her she stock you notice that
when her she falls in value sugar Rises
in value on average so if you added
sugar to your portfolio you would then
lower your overall risk low action such
as this allow you to create what is
called an efficient portfolio imagine if
you did this now by looking at how all
investment products perform not just two
you could create the ultimate efficient
portfolio by doing this one hedge fund
actually did just this for many years
producing average returns of 19 percent
with not a single loss since inception
they were called nwq but they no longer
around sorry they were bought up and
finally I leave you with the big answer
to the question why did the market go up
so dramatically from the 1980s into the
1990s put it quite simply it's political
but one Republican and one Democrat
mainly are to blame for this to
occurrence and we all are now paying for
their actions now do you have any
questions leave them in the comment
section below but I don't really want to
get into politics
