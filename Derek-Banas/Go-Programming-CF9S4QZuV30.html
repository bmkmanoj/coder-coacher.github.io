programming tutorial you may ask
yourself why is Derrick doing a tutorial
about go well basically go brings
together the best of both worlds in
regards to striking a balance between
both dynamic as well as statically
compiled languages as you're going to
see the code is both easy to read as
well as a specification for go is quite
short even though it includes ridiculous
things like a built-in web server and
yes indeed I will cover that and I
basically decided to cover go because it
allows you to set up an app quite easy
and in this tutorial and to cover all
the basic syntax for the entire language
so I'm basically going to leave
installing go all up to you it's quite
easy just go to golang.org forward slash
dl and find whatever operating system
you're using click on it and install it
and for the most part you're just going
to be using a basic text editor as well
as the terminal or if you're on Windows
you're going to be using the
command-line and here we are I have a
basic text editor over here and here I
have my terminal or my command line I'm
going to be typing in code over here and
executing it over there now basically
every go program is going to start with
a package declaration and you just type
in package and main and this is
basically going to provide us with way
for us to reuse our code and in this
situation I have main here because this
is going to be an executable program
we're then going to be able to import
all types of things like here I'm going
to import a format package which is
going to allow me to provide formatting
for both input and output you can have
comments by just typing in two forward
slashes just like that or you can have
multi-line comments just by typing in a
forward slash and a star and a whole
bunch of things in a store in a closing
slash and I'm going to move quite
quickly through this so if you want to
jump to any specific part just look in
the description we're going to come in
here and define a function this is going
to be the main function which is going
to be called for execution whenever the
application is executed and a function
is going to open up with a open and
curly bracket and close with a closing
curly bracket we'll get more into
actually creating your own functions
here in a little bit we're going to be
able to use a function called print line
by referencing the format package and
this is going to allow us to output
information onto our screen and this is
basically all you would need for a basic
hello world program inside of go you can
see over here we can execute a go file
and the name of it is here we go go the
extension is ji-ho and you would just
go run and whatever the name of your go
program is you can see hello world
prints out like that
another thanks kind of interesting if
you have the terminal over here you can
just type in go doc and then whatever
the package name is and then whatever
function you're interested in it's going
to provide you all sorts of information
regards to what that function does and
how it operates
now variables inside a go are statically
typed which just basically means that
the type can't change once it's defined
and your variable names are going to
start with a letter just any letter and
they're going to be able to contain
numbers as well as underscores one of
the variable types you're going to have
are integers and you can see right here
all of the different integer types
there's unsigned 4 8 16 32 bit as well
as 64 and then there's regular integers
4 8 16 32 and 64-bit as well but for the
most part we're just going to use basic
int and you can see how big these guys
actually get they get quite large
there's a couple different ways to
define a variable inside of go but I'm
going to start off with this one and
cover the other ones as we go just type
in VAR age and then you're going to type
in whatever your data type is you type
in 64 just int like I said normally
going to use int then you're going to
assign a value to that variable type
then you have floats which are going to
be numbers with decimal places and they
are either going to be float 32 or float
64 for the most part we're going to use
float 64 however I need to find those in
much the same way you're going to come
in here give it a name so say favorite
number followed by whatever the data
type is is equal to 1 point 6 1 800 3 3
9 as you may have noticed you do not
need a semicolon at the end of all your
statements but you could put one in
there it's not going to cause an error
another way we could come in here and
define variable types is just by putting
colon equal to and then throwing
something in there and go is going to be
smart enough to automatically create an
integer for that and of course we can
come in here and print these guys out
with random num but I'm going to hold
off on that for a second because if I
tried to do that and I went and created
variables I didn't need that is going to
throw an error one thing it's important
to know here is well go will
automatically go and create this random
number and assign in an integer we're
not going to be able to come in there
thereafter and go random number
and type in something like a string
which is going to just be a series of
characters between double quotes so once
it's an integer it must remain an
integer this right here would cause an
error we would then be able to use these
variables inside of print line so let's
just go print line and then say age and
this is automatically going to put a
space in here but if I actually go in
and put a space it's actually going to
put in multiple spaces but let's just do
this just to see what happens and there
you can see it executed and also it put
in multiple different spaces here so
let's just get rid of this now you're
going to see it automatically through a
space in there another thing it's
important to know is while integers are
going to provide you an exact result
whenever you're performing arithmetic
floats often will not and I'll just
demonstrate that right here and this is
true of every programming language this
isn't just a go thing so number 99 it's
equal to 0.99 nine and we can also
perform arithmetic directly inside of
the print line it's going to I'll put
that on the screen so let's just say we
go number one - num 99 and if we execute
that you can see how it comes out kind
of wacky that's just one thing to think
about that your floats are not always
going to be 100% accurate and in regards
to the type of arithmetic operations
you'll be able to use you would be able
to use plus and minus and multiplication
and division and modulus which is going
to return the remainder of a division
and just to show exactly what that's
going to look like right here you can
see all the different arithmetic
operations I'm going to save that
execute and here you can see the actual
rithmetic operations and their final
answers now I'm basically going to
bounce around a little bit in the
language let's say you want to create a
constant you would just start off with
Co NS T you're going to have to define
the data type for word however and then
we can just come in here and type in 3 1
4 1 5 9 2 6 5 or whatever and then once
that value is set it's not going to be
able to change you could also declare
multiple different variables there's a
whole bunch of different ways to create
variables inside ago so we could go
variable a is equal to 2 and variable B
is equal to 3 and then close that off
with the closing little bracket there
parentheses now strings or going to be
either a series of characters between
either double quotes or backslash quotes
like that but for the most part you're
going to use double quotes they're going
to be defined in exactly the same name
so I could just
you're into a string is equal to and
type my name inside of here
there you go you could then get the
string length let's say that I want to
print it out on the screen we just type
in le n of course you could assign this
to a variable or do whatever you want
with it and type in my name and you're
going to see that that's going to show
up let's just comment this out right now
so it doesn't throw an error and there
you can see eleven came back for the
length of the total string also going to
be able to come in here and combine
strings with the concatenation make sure
this is an upper case print line be able
to combine strings with the
concatenation operator or the plus sign
where we want to call it you are however
going to have to put a space in this
situation so say robot and there you can
see it print it out the thing it's
important is if you wanted to come in
here and use your double quotes you're
going to of course be able to use
backslash symbols like new lines so
let's say I go I like and then throw a
bunch of new lines in there I could then
create another one and then just type in
new lines under this let's comment this
out and there you can see all the new
lines that show up inside of the output
another data type that we have available
for us or boolean so let's say we goes
is over 40 and they are defined with B
lol and they're going to have either the
value of true or false something else
that's good is while we have print line
we also have something else called
printf which is going to provide us with
different ways to format our output
let's run through these right now no
need to come in here and try to memorize
all this stuff but just in case you want
to know how to do it you wanted to know
how to print out a float this is how you
do it throw in a newline there it's very
important to use new lines with print F
because it doesn't skip to the next line
after it outputs on the screen and we
could look PI inside of there and it's
uncomment this another thing we could do
with floats is we could define the
precision of the decimal places so we
put point 3 in there it's only going to
output the first three decimal places as
you can see right there but you don't
need that there if you don't want that
precision let's say you wanting to get
the datatype or I'll put that on the
screen just put an uppercase T inside of
here and then you can throw anything in
there it's automatically going to return
whatever the data type is and you can
see right here float 64 comes back for
that data type which is exactly the same
as what we have defined up here going to
print boolean change this to a lowercase
T and of course throw a boolean in there
is
over 40 and uncomment this and you can
see true shows up they're going to use %
and D followed by any time you want to
have an integer show up inside of here
just keep this simple and just put 100
in there and then there's all kinds of
other odd things like if you wanted to
get the binary representation of 100 you
want to get the character that has the
character code of 44 if you want to
print hex codes use X and we can tape
something like 17 in there
and then if you wanted to get scientific
notation just put a lower case E and
let's throw a pie in here just for the
heck of it and execute you can see all
this different things come out there's
100 for the decimal you can see here is
100 in binary you can see that the comma
is a representation of 44 in regards to
characters 11 is the hex code and here
is scientific notation for pi there are
three logical operators inside of go so
let's go print line and your odd logical
operators are going to get boolean x'
and the first one is and and if you put
false inside of here this is going to
return false and let's just actually
show that here on the screen so if you
have true and false this is of course
going to return false
because both of those values need to be
true and these are also used very
commonly whenever you're using
conditional operators you're going to
check multiple conditions and I'll get
to that in a second or is going to
provide us with a way to provide a true
if either one of these is true which
this is of course so that's going to
return true then the last logical
operator is the knot symbol which is
going to return exactly the opposite of
whatever you put in front of it and if
we come down here and if you go to the 9
in there and save that you can see
exactly how they output there on the
screen of course let's go into four
loops which is going to provide us an
option to be able to do something
multiple times and we'll create an
iterator here give it the value of one
and we can create four loops in a couple
different ways let's say we want this to
loop as long as I is less than or equal
to ten we're just going to print out one
through ten here on our screen and we
could just print out on the screen then
you could have I plus plus which is
going to be shorthand notation for I is
equal to I plus one but that of course
saves a lot of time so these two things
are exactly equal and of course you're
also going to be able to come in
here and use shorthand notations for
negative negative which is going to
decrement the value you can see they
printed 1 through 10 they're out on the
screen and of course always make sure
the P and print line is uppercase
otherwise that will not work because
these are completely different functions
being that one is a function and the
other one is not a function now we
looked at logical operators there's also
a bunch of relational operators are
going to be able to use it B equals sign
and or equal to and then you're going to
have not equal to less than greater than
less than or equal to and greater than
an equal to
pretty much exactly the same as you've
seen in pretty much any other
programming language another way we're
going to be able to define for a loop is
actually to define what we're going to
be iterating through here right on one
line and we just create that and here we
need semicolons and let's say we want to
do it as long as J is less than 5 and
then we're going to increment the value
for J all in one area and this time we
were going to be able to come in here
and actually print out the value for J
on this one little box save that execute
and there you can see it printed out 0
through 4 and the reason why it didn't
print out 5 is we said we want to loop
through it as long as J is less than 5
and that's why whenever it hit the value
of 5 it skipped over this and did not
print 5 out on the screen
now since we have four loops of course
we're also going to have if statements
and let's go and create something called
your age and let's give this a value of
18 we're then going to be able to
perform different actions depending upon
different conditions so if your age is
greater than or equal to 16 we're going
to say alright we want to come in here
and print out on the screen you can
drive owls and we're going to just type
in else if that condition is not true
then we're going to come in and we're
going to say something else I will say
print line you can't drive if we execute
that you can see you can drive shows up
there one thing it's important is once a
condition is met this code here is going
to be executed and nothing else no
matter or even if it is true is even
going to be seen inside of if then else
statements another thing of course we're
going to be able to do is go and create
multiple different conditions we can say
else if you're a
is greater than or equal to 18
you can vote will be an option here and
then we can say else as a default option
something like you can have fun you're
going to see that when it's execute you
can drive shows up even though this
condition here is indeed true another
way we can check multiple different
values is the switch statement so we
could have your age here and you're
going to use this anytime you have a
limited number of potential values for
your age so we could say case if the
value of your age is 16 we could have go
drive in here case the value is 18 we
could put go vote in here and then
otherwise if nothing else matches we
could go and put the fault and have
something like go have fun and of course
come in here and put your age and equal
to you can put five in here and there
you can see go have fun shows up now
let's go and take a look at arrays and
basically an array is going to hold a
fixed number of values of the same data
type for you so let's say we have an
array that is called fave number and say
that for the most part we come in here
and say we only plan on having five
total favorite numbers and we expect
them to all be floats we could then come
in and define each and every one of
those just by putting in the variable
type name and in index the index is
going to start off at zero and go all
the way up to four to take up all five
spaces this is going to fill the entire
right we're going to be able to come in
here and access those by passing in the
index that we want to show so let's say
we want third index to print out here on
screen there you can see pi print it out
and another way we could initialize an
array is go fave number that we want
inside of here and then float 64 and
then inside of curly brackets put all
the different values we're going to
store inside of there now we're going to
be able to really easily iterate through
the entire array we'll just say four and
then we'll put I value colon equals two
and range is going to allow us to get
every single value out of our array so
favorite gnomes three now we're going to
be able to print out both the value as
well as the index that's associated with
that value and there you can see it
printed out all those different guys one
being the value and zero being the
index and onwards and upwards if you did
not want these indexes to show up here
or you have no need for them you could
come in here and just put it in
underscore right there and that's going
to completely just regard that so we can
just come in here get rid of that and
execute and you can see everything shows
up right there now a slice is like an
array but whenever you define them you
leave out the size so let's go and
create a slice let's call it number
slice and there it is you're going to
put in brackets just like you do with it
right let's just say this is an integer
slice and let's go and throw a couple
values inside of there another thing
it's interesting is we will actually be
able to make a slice by slicing from
another slice so let's go and define a
new one called slice two and let's say
we want to take some values from num
slice first when we created here we're
going to say that we're going to start
off at the third index and we want to
take everything up through the fifth
index we could then check to see what is
in the zero index for this slice same
way we use arrays right like that there
you can see back to comes out there and
why is that well the reason is this is
the zero index this is the first second
third and to get two and one and two put
them into slice number two what we're
going to do is we're going to say that
we want to get from the third up through
the fifth which is actually going to get
the fourth and ignore the fifth I know
it's kind of weird but whenever you put
five in there basically means get three
and four and ignore five as you're going
to see if I come in here and put one and
one right there that's going to show up
however if I come in here and put two
that is not going to show up say bunch
of hairs a little bit weird but you'll
get used to it if you do not supply the
first index like we did here with the
three let's say for example we get rid
of this all together and go numb slice
and then type in colon and two like that
and then of course to find the same
thing outside here and execute you're
going to see that five and four show up
basically what you did here by not
putting a number before this colon is
you're saying that you want to start
from the first index which is going to
be the zero index so that would be
exactly the same as if you typed in 0
also if you wanted to type in 2
and : and put nothing here that is going
to be the same as if you said you wanted
to get all the indexes as you can see if
I come in here and type in two and : and
execute that it's going to get three two
and one
you're also going to be able to create a
slice that is not going to have a
defined set of values whenever you start
off to do that let's go to num slice is
equal to and then make then you're going
to define the type of slice you want
which is an integer array then if you
want to provide a default value of zero
for the first five you would just type
in five going to have a maximum size for
the slice of ten you would type in ten
then you could copy over into slice
number three the values in the first
number and if we output those onto the
screen you're going to see that yes
indeed those values were passed over and
I can cycle through and prove it but you
know you get the point and also finally
we'd also be able to come in here and go
something like num slice three and if
you wanted to append some new values on
there remember we have room for ten
total values inside of this slice just
call pend the slice that you want to
append values to and then just keep
listing values as long as you have space
so I'll set one zero and negative one on
there and I want to print this out onto
the screen
I'm slice three and then let's say I
want whatever is into six in ducks and
you're gonna see negative one shows up
because I put the negative run right
there now let's take a look at maps and
a map is just a collection of key value
pairs you have a key that's going to be
associated with a value so to create one
say we want to have a map that's going
to have president names matched up with
the age they were when they became
president going to type in make followed
by map then you're going to find the
data type for the key which is going to
be string in this situation and then int
is going to be the value for the values
we're going to store inside of here
we're going to be able to come in here
and go press age and do something like
Theodore Roosevelt think I'm spelling
that right it would be a very weird key
but what the heck and I give it value 42
we're then going to be able to get the
value for this just by passing in the
key so like that and you can see 42
popped up there you'll also be able to
get the length for this and of course
you could store this length in a
variable or do other things with it I'm
just doing this just so you can see the
output of me
leigh-anne type being LAN to get the
length and there it is and then after
you create one of them you're going to
be able to create more so let's go
president's age again and you could also
put spaces inside of here just doing
this just to show some weird things you
can do so F Kennedy we wanted to do that
43 and we could also see that the length
of our map change there you go and we're
also going to be able to come in here
and delete items from our map by going
Bleeth pres age and then typing in
whatever key we want to have deleted so
John F Kennedy and then length again to
show that it's no longer there and there
it is back to one and I could actually
show you how to put maps inside of maps
I'm in the description I'll put a link
to the code and inside of there I'll
show you how to do that just something
kind of weird you might want to know how
to do but a little bit more crazy than
what this tutorial needs to cover now
you're going to have functions other
than the main function also so let's say
that we want to have a list of numbers
and it's going to be a floater rack and
let's go and put that closing bracket
right there and find it just something
really simple right like that we're then
going to be able to come down here and
create another function and I could call
this add them up and this is going to
allow us for a way to reuse our code as
well as provide some structure to our
program and to create this you're going
to type in func
followed by whatever you want your
function name to be there's going to be
a list of parameters that are going to
be passed inside of here in this
situation I'm going to be getting a
float array so I'm going to define that
and then after that I'm going to return
a float so I'm going to put the return
type down here so here you're going to
have your attributes and here you're
going to have your return type then
you're going to have curly brackets and
then here we're going to find some and
just so you know any value that is
assigned or created inside of here or
variable is created inside this function
is not going to be accessible outside of
that function just give that a value of
zero then we're going to cycle through
for we're not going to care about the
index value for this array so we're just
going to put an underscore like I talked
about previously going to get the value
I'm going to type in range here so that
we cycle through every single item in
our numbers float array that was passed
here and then put our curly brackets of
course and then I'm going to be able to
in here here's some more shorthand
notation if I wanted to add a value to
summon and save it back to sum I would
just type in plus equal to and Val and
of course that's going to be the same as
if we would say sum is equal to sum plus
Val and we're also going to be able to
come in here and put negative signs of
multiplication or whatever anytime we
want to perform an arithmetic operation
on a value and then save it back to
itself and after I cycle through all
those I can come in here and return the
value of sum and then I can call that
function from up side of Main and print
it out if I'd like to I can just go sum
like this and then add them up passed in
my float or a list of nums or instead
lists nums and change this to range
sorry about that
and here you can see that the sum comes
back as 15 another thing that's really
interesting about go is we will actually
be able to call a function that is going
to return two values which is really
kind of neat to do so we could say num1
and num2 is equal to and let's create a
function called next to vowels and pass
in five inside of here and whenever we
get these back we can print them out on
our screen so to return two guys we go
function just like we did before next
two values this is going to receive a
integer that I'm going to call number
put your curly brackets inside of here
and then if we're going to be returning
two values you're going to put a brace
inside of here with int + int if you're
going to be returning two integers it's
going to assign those properly and then
we can just say return and number plus
one and then a comma and then number
plus two when that's executed it's going
to return six and seven so that's how
you return two values from a function
kind of neat because most programming
languages don't allow you to do that
we're also going to be able to send an
undefined number of values to a function
and this is referred to as a very attic
function so let's go and print out the
output from calling this function and
we'll say something like subtract them
we could have all these different values
subtract from each other and get a final
result now we're going to accept these
multiple values is to create a function
down here and of course it's going to be
called subtract them and if I don't know
how many values I'm going to be getting
to type-in args followed by dot dot dot
and then the datatype I'll be receiving
then follow that up with the datatype
I'll be returning then I'll be able to
go in here and do something like final
value is equal to zero I'm going to
cycle through all these values I don't
care about the index so I'm going to
just put an underscore type in value and
I'm going to type in range don't know
why I'm spelling that wrong and cycle
through all the arguments that are going
to be passed in there don't need to know
how many then I could go final value and
then here I could subtract shorthand
notation from subtract from itself and
save back to itself and then finally
return the final value and you can see
there negative 15 comes back we're also
going to be able to come in here and
create a function inside of a function
here I'm just going to use function main
let's go and get rid of this extra curly
bracket here and whenever we do that
remember I said if you go and create a
variable inside of an outside function
outside of main you're not going to have
access to any of the variables inside of
main nor are you going to have access to
the func the different variables that
are assigned outside of may however if
we use what are called closures they're
going to be defined inside of main and
we'll have access to pretty much
everything to define a closure we're
going to say something like number 301
is equal to let's give it the value 3
then we'll go double num and define our
closure and to do that we'll just go
function it's going to return a value
that is going to integer and this is the
function and it's ultimately going to be
saved inside of this guy right here and
we can just go number three another
shorthand notation
multiplication times two and then save
it back to the value of number three and
then we could return number 3cm able to
access this variable inside of here even
though it is outside of my function then
on top of that say I wanted to double it
multiple times we could go double num
call that function and then call it
again and once again you don't need
semicolons but they don't hurt there you
can see six and twelve pop back another
thing that confuses a lot of people or
is something called recursion this is
whenever we call a function from inside
of itself and this is often demonstrated
through the use of generating a
factorial so let's call or create a
function called factorial going to be
receiving an integer I'm going to call
it num and it's going to be returning an
int first anytime you use recursion
you're going to need an out which is
basically what
this is going to represent here if
number is equal to zero on that
situation we're going to return a value
of 1 which is going to end the function
nothing more is going to occur otherwise
we're going to return num times
factorial we're going to be calling
itself and passing a number minus 1 see
we're going to be calling the function
from inside of itself now the way this
is going to operate let's jump up here
first and with so and call factorial and
let's pass in a value of 3 into it
now what this in essence is going to do
is 3 is going to come down inside of
here I'm going to put some notes right
here just so you can see it so we're
passing 3 into the factorial so
factorial is going to get a value of 3
passed in the very first time it isn't
going to be equal to 0 so we're going to
come down here and in this situation
we're going to have 3 times and we're
going to pass in 2 factorial once again
to this is going to be equal to 3 times
2
same exact thing that's going to give us
ultimately a value of 6 this 2 is going
to come from the fact that we're going
to come here and pass in 2 times
factorial and this time we're going to
pass in 1 which is going to be
equivalent to 2 times 1 which is going
to give us the value of 2 well this 2
right here is exactly the same as this 2
right there and then finally we're going
to come in here and go factorial and
we're going to pass in 0 which is going
to be equivalent to 1 so this one right
here is the same as this one right here
and that is the reason why the factorial
3 is equal to 6 hopefully that made
sense play around with this idea a
little bit and all of a sudden you'll
get it that's the way working with
recursive functions actually work so you
just have to stare at it a little bit
and eventually it just makes sense
didn't want to skip that because that is
often something that a lot of people
skipping tutorials I think is rather
important and while I'm down inside here
might as well cover defer and how that
works
other things kind of interesting let's
say we have one function called print
one and it is just going to print the
value of one out on our screen now let's
have another function called print two
and it's going to print out the value of
2 now up inside of main I'm going to
come up here and I'm going to type in 2
fur print 2 and then I'm going to call
print 1 now we want
one two print before the two and it will
because of the fur you're going to see
here a little bit later exactly how the
fur is really helpful I just want to
demonstrate what happens here basically
what happens is the fur is going to
execute a function after the enclosing
function finishes so after main finishes
it's then going to print the two on the
screen because the fur is here before
that function even though it comes first
it is not going to print it immediately
and the furs normally use to keep
functions together in a logical way but
at the same time it's going to allow you
to execute one last function as a
cleanup operation and know that it will
actually be executed at the very end of
the function very often we want to
define that we want to open a file and
then also that we want to close it but
of course we want to perform a whole
bunch of operations in between those two
things occurring you can see here if I
save this and execute it that one prints
out then too and the reason why is
because it's a fur now let's create
another function that's going to allow
us to perform division in a safe way
it's going to receive a number one and
number two and these are both going to
be integers and then it's going to
return an integer here we're going to
use the fur again with function and
let's go print line and recover make
sure you put capital P inside of there
and what recover is going to allow us to
do is catch if an error would occur so
let's say we have solution here is equal
to the number one divided by number two
and we want to return the solution well
if they go and they send a zero inside
of here what this is going to do is pop
this up here to recover and then recover
is going to be able to handle that error
if it should occur because of division
by zero of course is going to cause an
error whenever the code is executed
let's go up here and create that error
format print line and then we'll go save
division and pass in a three and a zero
for a division by zero and then we'll
perform a normal division underneath
that divided by two or something you see
here prints out integer divided by zero
but the program continues executing
without completely crashing and also
goes and performs the other division
right here another thing you're going to
see is if I go in here and eliminate
this print statement all together and
execute it that's going to go and
perform that
vision and not throw an error at all so
it's up to you exactly if you want to
print the error out or you don't
but what recover allows us to do is to
continue execution even if a fatal error
should occur then finish this all off
let's go and create another function to
demonstrate what a call to panic would
look like and have a handle a panic or
an error that we can define with the
recover function so let's just call this
demonstrate panic inside of here defer
func again we going to decide if we want
to print out the error not here I'll
just print it off just for the heck of
it close that off right there and if I
ever hit an error that I know I want to
send to recover I just type in panic and
panic and it will send it over there
then up inside of here I'll just call
this function so it's sort of a way of
using exceptions and catching exceptions
and other programming languages and
there you can see panic prints out and
of course if I didn't put this print
line here nothing would print out now
let's take a look at exactly how
pointers work inside of go let's come
down here and create a function let's
call this change X Val it's going to be
passed an integer it's going to go
inside of this variable X and here I
just want to demonstrate that because I
change the value of a variable inside of
a function it's not going to have any
effect up here in the main function now
I'll do that as I'll define X up inside
of main give it a value of 0 and then
call change X Val and pass X but in this
situation it's passing the value of x
being 0 not X itself and you're going to
see that here I put Frontline and I say
give me the value of X and execute that
it's going to print 0 out on the screen
now pointers are going to allow us to
come in here and actually be able to
change the value so let's get rid of
this down here let's call this change X
Val
now instead now down inside of here if
we want to single that we are going to
be sent a reference to the value and not
the value itself we're going to put a
star right there what this is going to
allow us to do is actually change the
value at the memory address referenced
by the pointer and then by putting a
star right here this is going to allow
us to store 2 in the memory address that
X refers to has nothing to do with the
value anymore it actually deals with the
actual
variable now to pass this value we're
going to come up here get rid of that
and a call change X vow now if we know
it pass the reference to X so the actual
value can change we put the ampersand
followed by X and then here if we want
to print this out we're going to see
that value actually changed so that is
the power that we get with pointers
we're actually allowed to pass the
actual memory address in and then assign
a value to that memory address rather
than passing by values which is what
happens by default we then want to prove
this by printing out the actual memory
address for X we could get the memory
address by putting ampersand and X just
to prove a whole bunch of things and
there you can see is the memory address
likewise we could print the memory
address inside of change X value as well
we could also come down here and let's
change this to change why thou call this
Y pointer and then get Y pointer and
give this a value of 100 and pop up here
inside of main again and we could
generate a pointer with the new function
this and then call new int and then go
to change Y Val now pass in that pointer
and then print this out on the screen Y
is equal to star Y pointer and execute
it you can see 100 shows up there and
that's pretty much all it is when it
comes to pointers way more complicated
or people make it way more complicated
than it actually is just passing memory
addresses and assigning values in a
different way nothing else now Struck's
are going to provide us with a way for
us to define our own data types so let's
say that I want to define a rectangle
data type I would follow this with
struct and inside of here I would define
some things that a rectangle would have
so let's have maybe the left exposition
save that as it floats the top Y
position also a float height also a
float and then width and you guessed it
also a float I'll then be able to go
inside of main and define a rectangle of
my own making
by calling rectangle and then I can
define all the different parts I can go
left x : 0 top y : 50 height : 10 and
whit : 10 right like that or if I know
the order that these are structured and
I could just come in here and go zero 50
ten and ten and find them either way it
doesn't matter one way is if you know it
one way is if you don't then we'll be
able to access these values that I have
stored inside of here I could say
something like rectangle and put a quote
inside there of course is I want to
access the specific value I just go rect
one width for example and then I could
put wide execute that rectangle is ten
whatever wide and I could also define a
method area for my rectangle struct as
well just come down here and do that and
define this will go func just like
before and then we're going to define
the receiver rectangle right like this
so that knows what to attach it to and
then the function name which is going to
be area and then it's not going to
receive any attributes so there's
nothing inside of there it's going to
return a float right like this and then
I could just go return rect with x rekt
height it's going to get the width and
the height right out of here
automatically because I define this as
rectangle that this area method is going
to work with this rectangle struct save
that come in here area of rectangle
equals and then rect one and instead of
putting that in there I'll type in area
if the executor comes back with 100 so
that's how you would define strux as
well as assign methods to them another
thing is kind of neat is create
interfaces and use a sort of
polymorphism inside of go first we're
going to create a new struct I'm going
to call this shape struct works there we
then come in and define a method they
every other struct is going to have to
implement if it's going to use this
interface so we'll go float64 so we're
saying that if you want to use our shape
interface well all you got to change
this interface sorry about that
you must implement the area method I
could then come in and create another
rectangle struct and here I'll just keep
it simple and have it have a height and
a width and then that's also just to mix
things up here a little bit let's also
create a rectangle or a circle and
there's a circle and for a circle to
figure out whatever the area of it is
all we need is the radius let's say it's
a float as well well I could then come
in here and define functions here I'll
just have our rectangle followed by area
and it's going to return a float close
that off bounce up in here and go return
our height times our width and do
something similar for my circle on here
let's just change this to a c' call this
a circle and then here let's say I want
to use another guy here let's import
another one of these math libraries
that's how we would do that and then you
calculate this I'm going to go math dot
pi times math power and then we would
have whatever the radius is for our
circle and we'll square that to get the
area for our circle and then down inside
of here we'll define our area for our
shape just going to be sort of a generic
area we'll tie it to the shape just like
we did with the other methods and say
that it returns a float and returns
shape dot area what's neat about this
see these guys are all going to be tied
together because of the interface now
what we'll be able to do up inside of
main is go and create a rectangle which
is of type rectangle and we'll give it a
height and width of 20 and 50 and then
we'll also create a circle and give it a
radius of 4 make sure you use curly
brackets like that we're then going to
be able to call print line and say
rectangle area is equal to and go get
area and pass in a rectangle see you get
areas this guy right here which is tied
to this shape interface so we have right
here and we'll also be able to do the
same thing for circle so I'll go to
circle area and then in this situation
pass in a circle and it's automatically
going to call the right area functions
as you can see right there made a little
error whenever I first type this in and
put a column inside of there instead of
a dot operator so make sure you put dot
operator but you can see right there it
automatically went and called the proper
area function depending upon the type of
data we were working with all because
they were all tied to the shape
interface so kind of neat ok now I'll go
through a bunch of string functions
cover file i/o accepting input from the
user and casting then we'll create a web
server and then I'll cover go routines
and channels and we'll be all done so
let's create a string called sample
string and let's just give it the value
of hello world I like that we could then
check if another string is contained
inside of it by going strings
going to have to come up here inside of
this type in strings we're actually
going to be using a whole bunch of
different imports and if you want to
import a whole bunch of things very
often it's easier just to go import put
this bracket right here then we type a
couple other different things we're
going to also cover sorting need OS
package cover log IO high util and
string conversion so a whole bunch of
different things close that off at the
end all right so if we want to see if it
contains we're going to pass in sample
string the guy we have here and then if
it contains the string ello inside of it
we would do that then I'm going to have
this do a whole bunch of different
functions here here if we want to return
the index for a match if so it should
exist will type in index there instead
of contains if we want to output the
number of matches we're going to say
count so oh you NC and let's say we want
to check to see the number of L's that
are contained inside of here let's
actually get rid of all these different
guys here for now paste them down here
because I'm going to need them in a
little bit I could also come in here and
replace certain values I'm just using
the print line here so you can see the
output on the screen so if I wanted to
replace all the LS with X's and I want
to do that for the first three that's
how I would do it and if I execute this
you can see that ello indeed is in hello
world that begins at index number three
there are three total ELLs inside of
here and here I decided I want to
replace all the elves with X's and you
can see the output that comes out with
that also come in here get rid of that
and get rid of this strings right here
always want to get rid of any imports
that you're not using otherwise you'll
get an error I could create a comma
separated by you string give it the
value of one two three four and five six
format print line now let's go and do
another strings operator here say I want
to split this guy CSV string every place
that we have a comma strings up in there
and you can see it went now put it that
on the screen which is going to return a
nice list separating the values anywhere
there is a comma I could then also come
in and do list of letters create a
string all right let's put them out of
order like that and then say that we
want sword up here sort sort the strings
list of letters and then
put the letters in there you can see
them in order and we could also join
them in much the same way so we'll say a
list of noms call strings join string
all right and we could say three to one
like this and say that we want to
separate each one of those with a comma
and a space then close that off and then
print out lists of gnomes and there you
can see it printed them out now let's do
some file i/o let's get rid of all that
and let's get rid of these guys right
here and just type in OS which is the
package we're going to be using if we
want to create a file we're going to go
file error is equal to O s dot create
and we'll call this sample text is going
to be the name of the file we're going
to create you want to output any types
of errors that might occur just error if
error is equal to nil and then we can
come up here and open a log to output
this and of course we're going to need
to come up here and import another
package which is going to be the log
package and there it is we want to write
a string to our new file that we just
created to go file write string and then
whatever text we want to put inside of
here we say this is some random text we
then want to close our file just do that
we then could try to open our file and
we would do this even if we didn't
create the fire or whatever go I you
till and then we'll put I you two up
here o
util there it is and read file and
provide the file name that we want to
read from and we're going to have an
error catch here if there was an error
it's going to print that out we can
convert this into a string go read
string I like this and this is going to
be the stream of data we read from the
file this guy right here first put the
equal sign inside of there and then we
can go format print line and read string
a red string whatever and this gap here
is i/o forward slash and then put double
quotes our save that execute it and
you're going to see that it open created
that file printed text over to it and
read that text out again and displayed
it on the screen a whole bunch of
different things now we'll just come in
here and
show you how to cast and then we'll
create a web server and a couple other
things then we're done so I promised you
I'd teach you a lot of things let's go
in here
delete all this stuff go and create a
whole bunch of random values if you want
to convert number types so let's go
print line you want to convert an INT
into a float just put float 64 and
whatever your integer value is and
that's going to work you want to convert
from a float into an integer
you just put int and whatever your float
is and that's how that would convert if
you want to convert a string into an int
you go new int like this FOMA underscore
equal to string conversion and parse int
random string then we're going to find 0
and 64-bit and then we can print out new
int on the screen new int being an
integer that used to be a string then we
could do pretty much exactly the same
thing to convert a string into a float
let's just call this new float and
random string to here we'll get rid of
the 0 just leave this be 64-bit because
that's what it is and then new float and
then just make sure this is lowercase C
this is lowercase C and this is part
float type over here and you can see
right there all this print out now I'll
show you how easy is to create an HTTP
server first we're going to have to come
up here
we'll have format inside of there but
we're also going to have to put net
forward slash HTTP right like that know
what you're going to do inside of main
is go HTTP and handle func
right like this and anytime they go to
your server and go to the default
directory we're going to say that we
want to call the handler function well
we'll have to create the handler
function
no problem func and then handler inside
of this W HTTP dot response writer and
the response writer is going to assemble
the server's response and then write it
to the client we have our star HTTP
request this is going to hold the
clients request and then if we want to
output to the clients screen whenever
they go to our server just go
FMT and here we'll go F print F like
that passing W and then whatever you
want to go on the screen and we can do
more advanced things but this tutorial
is very long so I'm just going to stick
to this and there we go now let's say we
wanted to do this for another directory
so inside of main let's go create
another one handle function let's say
they go to something called Earth a
directory called Earth inside of our
server and let's say one handler - to be
called in that situation no problem just
duplicate this paste that in there
change this to handler - and then in
this situation we'll have it the hello
world and here it'll be hello earth I
don't know just something to do
something and then the final thing we
need to do inside of main is tell it
which port to listen to for our server
and we'll just type in listen and serve
like this : let's say we want it to be
8080 pass in nil jump over here execute
it you're going to see that pauses jump
the localhost you're going to see hello
world shows up right there and if I come
in here instead and put earth like that
now it's going to say hello earth so
that's how hard it is to create a web
server using go alright now let's talk
about some go routines I put time inside
of here because I'm going to be showing
it how to pause some events and we're
going to create a go routine which is
basically going to allow us to run
multiple different functions in parallel
so let's go inside here you can also
create functions up here and create
functions anywhere really let's create
one called count and it's going to
receive an integer that's going to have
the name of ID this go inside of here
let's go and create all for loop inside
of here equal to zero while I is less
than 10 and then increment I and then
inside of here we can just print out to
the screen it's like a thread ID and
then something like this and I
incrementing and then we're also going
to create a pause of one second inside
of here to do that we'll use time and
this is just so this function will
temporarily sleep so that it has time
for all the other functions to execute
so second times 1000 that's going to
give me a one-second pause for this guy
and now down inside of main I'm going to
crew
another for-loop equal to zero it's
going to create ten of these guys ten
versions account and the go routine is
executed by going go and whatever you
want to have execute so I'm going to say
count I it's going to pray ten of them
just like I said before and then what we
need to do inside of main is create
another sleep so that this pause is long
enough for all the go routines to
execute so a millisecond times I don't
know it's try like eleven thousand so
all we need to do oh good to shut down
the server over here just go control see
they're shut down and execute you can
see everything is executing here are the
different versions account zero one two
three and here it's printing out all
those different pieces so that is what a
go routine looks like and you can see
right there it finished like I said if
you guys are interested I'll create a
whole bunch more go tutorials doing
really cool things I plan on doing so
otherwise and then that brings us to
channels which are going to allow us to
pass data between go routines here I'm
going to make some pizzas so let's just
come in here and let's create a function
and let's call the first one make dough
and it's going to receive a channel and
this is how that works
how you define that you're receiving a
channel I do a couple things here ahead
of time I'm going to need this and I'm
also going to need to convert a string
create some variables outside of here
variable Pizza number because I'm going
to create a bunch of different pizzas
each of them is going to have its own
number and pizza name is going to be the
pizza name whenever it prints out you'll
see here in a second so whenever it says
hey I want you to make me a new pizza
well the first thing we're going to do
is we're going to increment the number
of pizzas that we are creating the first
one is going to be number one
and then when you go pizza name is equal
to pizza number plus string conversion
and what I'm going to do here is convert
this int into a strength Pizza number
like that
and it probably makes sense to go down
and main here into a little bit before
we start jumping into the different go
routines so here we are inside of main
and here we're going to create a channel
that's going to be able to hold a string
so I'm going to call it string Chan like
I said it's just going to allow us to
pass string values back and forth but
clean all of our go routines can and
this is going to be a string that's
going to be passed between the go
routines if it wasn't we would have this
be an int for integer or whatever
everything else will be the same then
we're going to cycle through and make
three pizzas so we'll go for I colon is
equal to 0 I less than 3 we're going to
keep creating pizzas until we have three
pizzas made but we're going to have to
make the pizzas in order dough and then
sauce and then toppings so we're going
to go go
for our go routine just like we did
before just a second ago we're going to
pass in our string this guy right here
and those strings are then going to be
passed between all the different ones
there we go there's that guy now we'll
jump back up here and let's say we want
to prune out onto the screen that we are
currently have made our dough and we
need to get sauce for our pizza dough so
make dough and send for sauce there's
that now if we want to send our pizza
name on to the channel for the next go
routine we're going to say this string
Chan there's that guy same guy that was
passed inside of here and to pass it on
to the next go routine like this and
pizza name is what we want to pass then
we're going to also sleep for a second
so that the globe go routines have time
to come in here and execute let's say 10
that works and then we'll create a
couple more of these let's go and create
another one it's going to allow us to
make our sauce so let's just call this
one add sauce it's going to be passed in
that channel that's string and if we
want to receive the value that was
passed into this channel let's go and
create pizza and give it a value for
string Chan that was passed in there and
we are we don't need to do this because
this is passed in no problem and here we
could say add sauce and send and then
pizza which is going to be pizza
followed by whatever the number version
it is and for toppings again I put those
semicolons in there whether they're
needed or not then if we know pass it on
to the next go routine this is going to
stay exactly the same and this guy is
also going to sleep I'm going to create
a final function that is going to add my
things there's that again string chin is
the name pass and string and then add
toppings is going to store pizza
followed by the number that was passed
inside of this we get that value that
was passed with putting that little
bracket there with a dash after it and
string Chan which is passed into it and
then we could go format print line add
toppings to if we wanted to print out
the pizza name that we are and then we
can say something like and ship and then
put the little timer inside of here
again to make sure everybody else has
time to get finished and then down here
we're going to go go make dough well
actually after this we have this sleep
also so like this and then change this
to something like five thousand so that
we know it has enough time to get our
pizzas made and here we will get this
guy create our different go routines and
they are going to be add sauce like that
and then the final one is going to be
add toppings if I did all that right
you're going to say make dough send for
sauce add sauce send pizza one this is
what we've been passing back and forth
between the different go routines with
the channels and you can see it's adding
all those and it's doing it one by one
by one until it's finished
there you go guys just covered a heck of
a lot about go and how to program with
go please leave your questions in
comments below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
