tutorial on how to make a java
application executable I've received
this question countless numbers at times
and today real quickly I'm going to show
you exactly how it's done on both PCs as
well as Mac's because it's identical so
what I got here is a basic application
that I went and created here's a whole
bunch of different files and the
measurement conversion dot Java is the
main guy that has the main function in
it that's important to understand
because this is going to be something
you're going to use so now that we have
all that we just need to locate where we
have all these files saved in our file
system and if we bring them all up I
have them all set up right here on the
left side of the screen as you can see
right here and I'm simply going to
select all of them and I'm just going to
copy them then what I did was I created
a folder also called measurement
conversion and inside of it I save two
folders one called classes one named
source well the files that you just
copied our source file so we're going to
paste those in that directory so you can
see them all right there on your screen
and that's basically all you're going to
need to do now you need to open up if
you're on Windows your command-line tool
or if you're on a Mac you need to open
up your terminal now if you are on a PC
you just have to click start and then in
the run section or the open field at the
bottom that opens up there you need to
type in C m.d dot e ax e that's going to
open up that guy if you're on a Mac you
just open up your terminal now another
thing that's different this is the only
the other thing that's different on a
Mac you're going to type LS if you want
to list out all of your files in your
directory and on a PC you're going to
type dir for directory and what we need
to do this is on Macs and PCs is just
change your directory to your source
folder if you aren't already there but I
already am so I'm just going to work
with this and then you're going to type
in Java C and then a dash and D and this
is going to put all your compiled code
into classes folder that you have
created hopefully and then we're just
going to put dot dot forward slash
classes and then star dot Java and hit
enter ok so we have all of that setup
and now we could go change directory dot
dot classes like this
LS and you can see all of the classes
right there and then if you wanted to
execute one of these you can just go
Java and then measurement conversion and
don't think this is where I'm stopping
I'm actually going to show you how to
make an executable jar file to so it
works just like an application hit enter
and you can see right here the last
program that I made gallons two pints
and hit OK and you can see one gallons
equals eight pints and you can hit OK
and it closes see it works just like an
application I'm going to show you how to
make an executable jar file which is
also very easy so we are already in our
classes directory if you were not you
would do something like this and to
change your directory to your classes
directory but like I said we're already
there and then what you're going to want
to do is make a text file called
manifest dot text so I'm going to open
up a basic text editor and then inside
of this guy you're going to type in main
with an uppercase M - class colon and
then whatever the name is for the Java
file that you have that contains the
main function and then after that you're
going to hit return and then you're
going to file save as and you're going
to save this guy in the same location
where we have your classes files which
are right here
so here's classes here source and you're
going to save them in the classes folder
that we created so we just want to go in
here and type manifest dot txt make sure
it's like that don't open it in Word
make sure it's a text editor and you're
gonna save it in there make sure you hit
return after the end of this another big
piece is done now back inside of the
terminal I'm gonna go LS we're on a PC
dir and you're gonna see manifest text
as shown inside of there and I'm going
to go Jarre - C V M F manifest dot txt
and then I'm gonna go measurement
conversion dot jar star dot class and
hit enter and that's going to go and
crush everything down exactly the way I
want it we can get rid of that and then
if we jump over here to the classes
folder like that you can see that our
jar file is right there and it's called
measurement conversion jar and if we
double click on it it's going to open up
just like our previous application
except it's just a double click so we
can go
one gallons two pints hit enter one
gallons equals eight pints so there you
go that's how to make Java executable
applications on both a Mac or PC leave
any questions or comments below
otherwise the next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
