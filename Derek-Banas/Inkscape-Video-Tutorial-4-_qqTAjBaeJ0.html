of my Inkscape video tutorial today
we're going to be focusing in on the
Bezier tool as well as nodes in general
and I'm going to cover all of the path
effects that are available and a whole
bunch of other different things if you
haven't seen the previous parts of this
tutorial I provide a link in the upper
right-hand corner of this video and also
in the description that is under this
video so I have a lot to do so let's get
into it okay so here we are inside of
Inkscape and we're gonna be focusing in
on the Bezier tool which is this guy
over here and of course the shortcut for
it is B so let's just come in here I'm
just gonna click click again I'm gonna
draw myself a curve and then I'm gonna
draw another curve and you can do pretty
much anything you'd like with this guy
and there you go and those are nodes and
let's just go in here and increase the
size of these so we can see them a
little bit better 210 and there you can
see them better on your screen well
something I want to cover here first
since I have both of these selected
something we're going to use a lot
especially whenever it comes to using
path effects is we're going to need to
combine these guys and it's just ctrl K
you could just think of somebody that
doesn't know English and thinks that
combined starts with the letter K and
there you go and to uncombined we're
going to go ctrl shift and K and there
uncombined so that's just something
we're going to use a lot later on now
when we are working with these Bezier
curves and I'm going to zoom in here so
you can see this better on the screen
then I'm gonna shift to nodes and I'm
going to select this now you can see
here with this Bezier curve because I
had three clicks there's a node there
there's a node there and there is a node
over here as well those are all of our
nodes and to make sure everything shows
up I'm going to come over here and click
on zoom to fit drawing there now we can
see everything on the screen something I
can do is come in here and click on this
guy up here and it's going to add nodes
to my drawing as long as I have these
points all selected there they are
they're all selected and now we can just
add nodes as you can see right there now
if I want to simplify this bezzie a that
we have here this Bezier curve I can
just hit ctrl L and it's going to
eliminate those nodes and continue to
eliminate those nodes until none are
left you can also hold down control L
and it'll just continue simplifying
simplifying simplifying faster and
faster and faster
in a related piece of information if we
come down here click on this and go into
Inkscape preferences open that up and
then whenever this guy pops up come in
here and go the whole way down to
miscellaneous you can also see here that
we're able to change our simplification
fresh hold which is just going to make
it work quicker or slower or whatever
depending upon how you set it however
this should never be set to anything
that is higher than point zero one
otherwise things get a little bit messed
up so let's get rid of that I'm not even
going to change anything there another
thing we can do I'm going to go and get
the selection tool delete that off the
screen and I'm going to draw a rectangle
here on the screen real nice and big if
I want to start messing around with this
as if it is a path instead of an object
and you can tell it's an object because
there's a little circle up here I just
have this guy selected and I'm going to
click on end to go into nodes and then
I'm going to click on this guy up here
that's a little crazy eight and that's
going to turn it into a path if you want
to just use the keyboard to shrink or
enlarge the path you can hold down
control and hit 9 that'll shrink it or
if you want to enlarge it you can hold
down to the control and hit the zero and
it gets bigger and bigger and bigger and
bigger as you see right there now as we
saw before the node tool which is this
guy up here with the shortcut n is going
to allow us to manipulate nodes and
we're going to spend a lot of time there
of course if we come in here and we
click on this with the node tool we're
going to select that but we're not going
to select any other nodes of course if
we want to add another node here while
also keeping the other node just hold
down shift and there they are they're
both selected at the same time as you
can see you can select two nodes by
clicking on the line that connects them
and tab is going to allow you to cycle
through the nodes so where's the next
one that's been clicked on here up see
there went and it's going to go again
and now it's down here and then if we
hit this hopefully it's going to go up
there and that's exactly what it did
ctrl a is going to select all of the
nodes on our screen as you can see right
there and that's special to the node
tool so let's say we come out here and
we draw another Bezier curve like that
and
come in here and we select this select
the node tool and then hit control a you
can see that all the nodes here were
selected but none of the nodes here were
selected so that's just something that
differs whenever you're using the node
tool versus the Select tool say if I
went with a select tool and hit control
a it's gonna select everything let's say
I wanted to come in here and there was
something in way of selecting my nodes
and I got my node tool and I select this
one and I select this one but really in
actuality I want to select these two
down here just act as if something's
over top of it let's just simulate this
let's just get a rectangle draw another
rectangle underneath of it and then
let's throw a fill on that rectangle
okay so let's say we have this rectangle
selected and I actually want to select
these two nodes down here but they're
hidden one way I can do that is to
select the nodes that aren't hidden and
then hit the exclamation mark and now
you can see that these nodes down here
are now selected that's kind of a neat
little trick to know let's just come in
here and delete that now we can of
course come in here and delete nodes
just by selecting one of them click on
it and then hitting delete you can see
there that it ultimately became a curve
we can add nodes with our node tool just
by clicking anywhere basically say
there's a node let's say we want one
there let's say we want one here just
double click and there they are
then let's say that we want these two
nodes that are right there to actually
be joined so that they are just one node
easiest way to do that is to just come
up here and click on this guy right here
click on it and now they are 1 and then
we can continue to do that let's select
these two nodes and click on it and now
they are 1 and we can do that over and
over again let's say let's just get rid
of this all together I'm just going to
hit the Select tool and delete let's
focus in on this guy right here let's go
and increase the size of it so we can
see it a little bit better and there we
go of course we can go and increase
their size with the Select tool just
like we always have now let's say that
we want to combine this node draw a line
from this line right here this node
there to this one down there all you got
to do is select both of them zoom in
here click on that and now you can see
that they've been joined I like to use
these up here rather than keyboard
shortcuts because sometimes you know
keyboard shortcuts just become a bit
much we can also break or eliminate this
line
created here or lines between nodes in
general by just selecting them and
coming up here and hitting that see
there are one-way and then of course we
can also just come in here and move
these guys around however we would like
with the node tool as well as coming in
and selecting them there you can see now
you can see there's also these handles
on all of these different nodes that we
have here and I'm going to zoom out by
going Z and holding down the shift key
and there it is and then let's go and
get our node again and let's take a look
at these handles now these handles of
course can be used just to move the
curve around just like that if you hold
down the ctrl key while you rotate it's
going to bounce them 15 degrees at a
time if you want something a little bit
more steady and stable if you would like
to rotate these but keep the handles
locked you can hold down the option or
the Alt key and you can see here I'm not
able to move that handle in I can just
basically rotate around the point we can
also use these guys right here on our
keyboard to rotate like we do with other
tools and we can also shrink the length
of the handles with these guys right
here
so shrink length and they can show you
exactly what that would look like let's
get our node tool and then we are select
the node and here I'm hitting the
brackets at the top to rotate and then I
can also shrink them down the caret
pointing forward is going to make the
handles go forward and the caret
pointing backwards is going to shrink
them like you might think would make a
lot of sense if we want to shrink a
handle on a node we just select the node
of course hold down the ctrl key and
click on the end of the handle there you
can say it shrunk
or went away and you can do this with
both of them which is going to turn this
into a line segment there you go
and of course we can make them all come
out by holding down the shift key and
pulling out handles so you can pull them
out in different directions if you'd
like as well another thing that's kind
of neat that we can do with text let's
just get the selection tool get rid of
this open something up here and let's
type in hello
maybe let's go and increase the size of
this there we go you can see it real
nice and well now let's say I want to
change this into paths I'm just gonna go
into my node tool click on this there
now their paths and if we select these
individual guides you can see that's
exactly what they are and this provides
for the option of what is called node
sculpting which is basically going to
sort of smoothly blend these nodes so
let's go and let's select all of them
and select if I want to move them all
together I just hold down the Alt key
and there you can see I can sculpt them
or move them in unison and remember I'm
holding down the alt or the option key
to do this and of course we have to have
all of the nodes selected on every one
of the letters or all of the nodes on
any object that you're currently working
with another thing we can do here is
let's just delete all this and let's
just draw a basic line segment crossed
our screen we can create a type of bell
curve inside of this there we go so we
can see it a little bit better what I'm
going to do is I'm going to select this
and I'm going to go to the node tool now
I'm going to come up here and I'm going
to create a bunch of extra nodes just by
clicking that a bunch of times
there you go whole bunch of nodes on the
screen all at once
now with the node tool still selected
I'm also going to hold down the alt or
the option key and you can see that they
move out there and create a pal curve
which is a nice smooth progression as we
move the nodes around on our screen if
you hit the H key you can flip this guy
horizontally as you can see it's bobbing
back and forth and the V key is going to
flip it vertically so horizontal and
vertical pretty easy to remember and of
course we can still use those same
brackets to rotate all the nodes all at
once just like we did before or enlarge
the nodes or the object or shrink them
down and once again that would be with
this bracket and that bracket for
rotating and this bracket in this
bracket for shrinking and enlarging if
you'd like to drag or create a copy of
this guy you're just going to select it
first off and then drag it down and hit
space and you can create as many copies
as you'd like and that pretty much
covers a lot of what you're going to do
with the node tool going to get into a
couple more things here of course as we
go on I'd like to spend a little bit of
time on path effects and of course you
come in here click on path scroll down
and find path effect editor click on
that and here is the path effect editor
it does all kinds of really neat things
but basically everything you're going to
be applying path effects on have to be
paths so objects need to be turned into
paths because you're not going to be
able to use path effects on text clones
or bitmaps so we're basically going to
be working with paths and shapes in
general now one funny thing is if you
were on a Macintosh and PC and Linux
users I apologize for this but basically
it is very common to get what is called
an XML wrapper error inside of a Mac
very easy to fix it what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to go into
applications there you go and I'm just
going to right click on this show
packages like that contents folder we
want to open that up we then want to
open up our resources folder right there
and then we want to come in and click on
the bin folder
that is going to then show us the
Inkscape txt file right here that has a
whole bunch of settings and we're going
to want to open that up with your
preferred text editor when you do that
to fix that error on a Macintosh all you
need to do is go down to line 32 right
here and put this line right here export
version or python version 2.6 if you do
that that's going to get rid of that
very common error that you're going to
see that's going to mess up path effects
as well as a whole bunch of filters okay
and now we're back tanks game I'm going
to look at a couple of these different
guys first one I'm going to take a look
at is what is called pattern along path
and what it's going to do is it's going
to take a path or pattern and stretch it
across another path so what we're going
to do is get our Bezier tool in here and
we're going to draw ourselves a path on
the screen there it is now if you ever
thought wow it'd be really great if I
could go and put rectangles across this
whole entire path well you can just
going to draw ourselves a rectangle
inside of there I'm going to convert it
into a path so come in here Creek on
krazy-8 right there now it's a path I'm
going to copy it I'm going to go back
to the path that I want to put all these
rectangles on top of actually to make it
stand out a little bit more I'm going to
go into fills and strokes this guy right
here and I'm going to give it a stroke
and let's just take this up a little bit
there we go
and the fill I'm going to get rid of so
we're going to be able to see easily
where the rectangles are so let's just
select that again and we're going to
copy it then we're going to click on
this guy right here this is the path
we're going to draw our rectangles on
there we go and then we're going to come
over to apply new effect and like I said
before we're going to look for pattern
along path click on that and then we're
going to hit add right here with the
path selected of course okay now that we
have that selected we're going to come
in here since we copy our rectangle
we're going to click on this which is
going to paste it in there and there you
can see it basically took this rectangle
and stretched it across the whole length
of path now if you'd like it to instead
be a whole bunch of rectangles just come
in here again and click on repeat it
right like that and now you can see a
whole bunch of rectangles so there's a
whole bunch of really neat things you
can do of course it's not just tied to
rectangles and you can change the width
and the spacing and all that but I'll
just let you do that on your own we
could also come in here and let's just
undo that all together and let's say
that we want to do a circle now
sometimes these guys have to be on the
top which means they have to be above
the path that we're going to be drawing
on and always these objects must be
converted to paths with the krazy-8
there we go so let's select it and let's
copy it ctrl C click on this guy right
here where's that let's just come in
here and hit paste and there you can see
it created this sort of crazy-looking
circle and then of course we can come in
here again and hit repeated and there
you can see it drew a whole bunch of
circles on the screen there's a whole
bunch of really neat things you can do
with pattern along paths and I use it a
lot and that's the reason why I covered
it first another guy that's really neat
is stitch subpaths
and what this guy is going to do is it's
actually going to draw stroke paths
between two separate paths so let's go
and create ourselves and other bezzie a
curve inside of this there we go and we
want to select both of them
hit ctrl k4 combined then come in here
and go stitch subpaths right there and
there we go and add and there you can
see it's kind of mangled and crazy but
if we go in here and increase the number
of paths by clicking this you're going
to see that it is slowly going to build
up and show something that looks kind of
three-dimensional on the screen and of
course you can come in here and mess
around with all these different guys and
we can also come in here select this and
move these guys around in different ways
to change the way that it looks I don't
know we can also shrink it down and do a
whole bunch of other different things
another thing we can do is we could come
in here and select this rectangle copy
select this guy right here come in here
and go paste and it's going to throw a
whole bunch of rectangles inside of
there and you could also do the same
exact thing with the circle as well just
make sure the circle selected copy come
in here select that paste and now
there's a whole bunch of circles so as
you can see there's a whole bunch of
different things you can do with all
these different effects tools and it's
something that you really learn based
off of your own artistic style and
things that you just want to play around
with or things that you're attracted to
design wise now the things kind of cool
like let's come in here I'm just playing
around by the way this is just fun for
me so I'm just having a good time here
just messing around let's say I want to
go in get our store tool or a polygon
tool by just clicking on star on the
keyboard and we come in here and I'm
going to draw a hexagon there we go and
there we got it on the screen I'm gonna
get the node tool and I'm going to
select well first what I need to do I
have the node tool selected and I want
to break it apart so now I have nodes on
the screen and let's go and zoom in here
so we can see it a little bit better
move that up there now I'm going to take
the node tool and I'm still going to be
using stitch sub path just like I did
before but I'm going to take all of
these individual nodes which are now
joined and disconnect them so got my
node tool I'm going to select this guy
right here and I'm going to break it
into two separate notes say break path
at selected nodes so I got that selected
I'm going to break that click this break
that click this break that and just keep
going until I work my whole way around
this hexagon what it's going to do is
it's going to have a whole bunch of
paths that we're going to stitch
together and make some kind of neat
looking effects okay so I got all those
selected I'm going to come in here with
a node tool select all of them I'm going
to hit ctrl K again to combine them all
stitch sub paths and hit add and there
you can see it did some pretty funky
crazy things there on the screen and I
think it's kind of getting a little
tangled up mainly because of both the
stroke as well as the fact that I am
recording this video let's come in here
zoom out a little bit and I really do
think that the recording is actually
messing it up because this actually is a
real intricate nice looking thing if i
zoom out of here and then zoom in on it
you can see that pattern so there's tons
and tons and tons it's like a lattice
pattern tons and tons and tons of
different things you can do just with
stitch subpaths so go in draw some
different objects convert them in the
paths remember that and then just play
around see what you come up with now if
we come in here and draw our Bezier
curves like we did before
I think it's kind of important to talk
about what all of these different nodes
are called so that we can better work
with them so there we go got that in
there and let's go and increase the
stroke size 15 boom now we're going to
be able to see them a little bit better
and there you go now these guys I'm
going to get the node tool again this
guy right here is known as a cusp and
basically what it means is it is a sharp
turn that doesn't have any handles as
you can see when I select it no handles
popped up this guy however is a square
and it's known as a smooth and as you
can see it does have handles that I can
work with now I can turn a cusp or a
diamond into a smooth just by selecting
it and then coming up here and click it
on this and there it is now it's a
smooth as you can see right there and I
can also turn a smooth into a cusp by
selecting it again coming up here
clicking on that and there you can see
now it's back to being a regular cost
and like I said before you can make
these handles go away by just dragging
them
to the note there it went went away
there it went it went away and now we
have no handles now these buttons up
here are really your friends basically
you just have to get used to using them
and knowing when to break them apart
when to join them and so forth and so on
now in regards to the different ways of
making a smooth this makes a cusp as you
can see it's sort of off a little bit
it's a cost this makes a smooth this guy
right here is going to make a symmetric
which just means it has two handles that
are the same distance apart from our
node and then this guy is going to
create an auto node which is basically
just going to as you're moving the node
around on the screen or the curve or
what have you the handles are going to
automatically move along and try and
keep everything in order as you're
moving them so if we come in here and
select this cusp right there and then
come up here and hit on symmetric click
on that you can see as I am moving
around that the handles basically stay
in place and don't move however if I
click on auto which is this guy right
there whenever I come up here and try to
move this around the handles are going
to move around and try to keep things
orderly and make sense
so again just stuff you got to play
around with to get used to so let's jump
back over into the path effect editor
and play around a couple more of these
different guys let's go in here and
let's delete this all together and there
we go I'm just going to take and draw a
basic ellipse on the screen and let's
say that we want to create a snake type
of object of course I want to convert it
in the path just like that just like I
did before and I'm going to demonstrate
how Bend works now after I have this guy
drawn and I select everything gonna come
over here and hit Bend which is way up
here
there it is and hit at and there we go
after I have that selected I'm going to
click on this little arrow on a path
right like that and whenever I do this
guy is going to show up and it's
basically going to allow me to select it
and then let's say that I want to add
nodes to it right like that
now I'm going to be able to bend this
guy hence the name by selecting
individual nodes on it so let's say I
want to go like this and I want to go
like this I don't want to go like that
and twist it and turn it into some funky
looking shape well the bend tool is
going to allow me to do that as you can
see that's basically what the bend tool
does of course it looks a little bit
better whenever the stroke size for the
object isn't quite so large select tool
again delete that let's say we want to
construct a grid we come in here bezzie
a tool we can just click like that and
click like that make sure that we have
three points and then make sure that we
have everything selected come over here
and click and go construct grid click
that and hit add there you can say
really easy to pretty much construct any
type of grid that you never want to all
we basically did here was just created
this point right here and this point and
this point and it automatically adjusted
and created a grid system we can then
come in and and shrink it down make it
larger or shrink it like that or do any
number of different things let's delete
it though for now and let's create a
different type of grid so I can show you
another different path effect
so as the a tool click this time I'm
just going to make a basic sort of
square there we are then we come in here
construct grid and hit add again there's
a grid now let's say we wanted to come
in here and warp this guy no problem
got another a path effect for that and
it's called envelope deformation so come
over here the path effect envelope
deformation click on that hit add and
yes you can stack these path effects
then what it's going to allow me to do
is basically morph this I'm going to
morph it based off of clicking on these
little arrows that click on nodes or
whatever this little button here and
whenever I do that you see this guy
shows up and I can click it and morph
the grid just I can see there I can
morph this and I come in here click on
that new node shows up and move it just
like it's piece paper so it's kind of
neat and those and then finally left
Bend which is also going to allow me to
curve it and move it around on the
screen and make three-dimensional shapes
all right so I know I'm being a little
bit short with all these but I just want
to cover the basics of it and then let
you go in there and play with it and do
whatever you'd like with these tools now
the gears tool is
kind of a toy so let's just come in here
and let's just draw ourselves another
Bezier curve and there we go and there
we go and there we have it okay and
let's just select ourselves some nodes
and go into gears and hit add and there
you can see it went and through a whole
bunch of gears and on the screen so
maybe there's a reason for that I've
never found any reason for that but
either way you know how to quickly
generate gears inside of Inkscape so
let's look into a more useful path
effect and that would be called hatches
so let's draw another curve inside of
here again now basically what hatches is
going to do is fill a path with squiggly
lines and it's probably better just to
actually look at it rather than talk
about it so just selected it hit add and
there you go
turn the hit whole bunch of squiggly
lines and we can change the randomness
of this just by clicking on it and you
can see there's different types of
squiggly lines and there are numerous
different little things you can do with
this but what I prefer to do is actually
to select the node tool this guy over
here with it selected rather than
playing with all this nonsense it just
sort of doesn't make any sense
stead what I like to do is come in here
and actually start manipulating these
lines with these nodes that are provided
to us and you can see as I go in here
and move these around I can change the
squiggles quite dramatically and make
some kind of interesting looking little
designs and here you can see that got
really crazy I increase the number of
squiggles pretty exponentially and it
sort of went a little bit crazy ooh
there you go
so again patches rough this guy right
here something better to play with and
as you play around with it you're going
to get used to it and incorporate it
into your general style or you're not
going to use it at all I think I talked
about interpolate subpaths but let's
just do it again here because I am NOT
certain so I'm just going to draw two
different paths inside of this and they
don't have to look at all alike they're
just going to be whatever they are I do
however have to select them hit ctrl K
to combine them into one click on this
interpolate sub paths and hit add what
it's going to do is it's going to take
this path in this path and sort of morph
them
together and create numerous different
shapes and we can change these steps
over here inside of it or the number of
curves inside of it and we can also come
in here click on this guy again and it's
going to allow us to come in and move
the shape around manually on the screen
depending upon however we would like not
is absolutely worthless what it tries to
do and by not I mean this guy right here
where is it not there it is what it
tries to do and it crashes my machine
almost every time I use it so that's why
I'm going to bother but basically if you
would create a not sort of looking thing
like this what it's going to do is where
this line crosses this line it's
basically going to put like a little cut
here where it's going to be white and
make it look like this line is going
over the other line but like I said for
some reason it likes to crash my
computer so I'm just going to skip that
you can play around with that on your
own if you'd like ruler a little bit
useful let's say that we come in here
and draw ourselves another curve there
we go and let's say we want to put ticks
on it just come in here and go to roller
and of course hit add and there you go
puts little ticks on this curve for us
and we can change the unit and pixels to
millimeters to inches to whatever we'd
like you can change the distance between
marks you can change the distance
between major lengths you can change
minor lengths number of steps da da da
just by clicking on that but for some
reason it's kind of taxing on computers
in general it's also something I haven't
found a whole lot of use with so we're
just going to get rid of that then I'm
going to cover another one that is kind
of useful this is called sketch and
basically what it does is it takes
whatever type of a line you would draw
on your screen go and select it click on
sketch there you go hit add and what it
does is it sort of makes little sketch
marks over top of the different paths
that you would create now there's really
only there's a lot of things going on
over here but there's really only two
things that you really need to worry
about strokes are going to follow the
path of your curve or your path whatever
you want to say while construction lines
are going to be tangent to your paths so
let's just come in here and
increase the number of strokes and there
you can see gets thicker and thicker and
thicker but they're going to be
following the path of the path that we
drew on the screen and if I take down
the strokes to nothing there's just one
stroke on the screen and construction
lines let's take that down to nothing
there you can see that's exactly what
one stroke would look like take the
strokes down to nothing add one
construction line and you can see what
the construction lines look like so
again it's a way of adding interest to
your drawings and the tremble frequency
this guy over here is basically by
increasing it you're going to change the
squiggle enos of these lines and it's a
little bit hard to demonstrate because I
am recording while using Inkscape which
is doing a whole bunch of mathematical
calculations which is messing it up but
as you can see there you can do really
interesting sort of strokes that you
wouldn't be able to do with anything
if the sketch effect editor wasn't
available and then the final two things
you have what is called the Spiro spline
and for this I'm going to use the pencil
tool there it is click on that here it
is Spiro basically what it does is it's
going to as you're drawing curves it's
going to smooth them so and you can see
right there not very smooth let's take
the smoothing up to 30 try drawing the
same thing again and there you can see
it's pretty doggone smooth so that is
basically what Spiro does and you can
use the effect editor to also apply it
to different curves but I prefer to just
apply it inside of here using the
general pencil tool if I decide that I
want to make things that look a little
bit smoother inside of Inkscape like I
said that's all general preferences then
the final thing is the von Koch which I
find almost no use for but basically
let's just say it does fractals that's
what it does so let's just say we draw a
curve inside of here and I've seen
people that like this but it's just not
me there you are drew that it's really
in here von Koch basically it's just
going to make copies of whatever you
drew on the screen so there see I made a
coffee made another coffee made
the coffee another coffee forever and
ever and ever and you can say that
machine's getting a little bit tired
because it's doing video editing and a
lot of math so there is coverage of all
the different effect editors available
for you as well as a pretty detailed
look at how the Bezier tool and the node
tools all work for you inside of
Inkscape please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
