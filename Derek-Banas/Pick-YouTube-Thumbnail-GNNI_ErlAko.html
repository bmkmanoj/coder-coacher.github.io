going to try to figure out exactly how
YouTube defines what thumbnails it
displays to represent your videos as you
can see in the bottom right hand corner
I have an elapsed time because many of
the experts say all you need to do is
take the length of the video / 4 and
that will be the thumbnail for your
first or your that will be your first
thumbnail then all you need to do is
then multiply that times x 2 and that'll
be where your second thumbnail shows up
and then just again add the length until
your first thumbnail shows up to the
time at the point in which thumbnail 2
shows up and that will tell you where
thumb no 3 shows up others say it has to
do with color changes on frames
transitions video effects or sound
changes we're going to test all those
right now so I thought I'd put a 3d
image here that is available free on the
internet test that out and then I have
just a straight cartoon that's brightly
colored see if that affects it then we
have a blurry picture of an elephant see
if that has any effect at all this image
actually showed up as a thumbnail at one
point in time so I'm going to put it on
here and see if it shows up as a
thumbnail again here we have kind of a
muted kind of black and white kind of
whatever picture is just totally
different than anything else so that's
why I picked it and then here is the
money that supposedly you're going to
make a cute if you can figure out
exactly how to define your thumbnail and
then i thought i would let the let rest
of the video play out by playing music
at a louder level and we'll see what
happens if we don't figure out anything
sorry about that and otherwise leave
your comments below till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
