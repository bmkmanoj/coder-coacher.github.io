tutorial on how to edit a featured
content slider couple videos ago I
showed you how to make this featured
content slider that's here on the screen
and since then I received tons of emails
asking me how to edit it it actually is
extremely easy to edit and at the end of
this tutorial you'll actually change
that big giant featured content tool
into this nice elegant tool that you see
right here and yes both these featured
content sliders are cross browser and if
you would go to browser lab adobe com
you can go in here and test all of your
web sites for free here's an example of
what the slider would look like in
internet explorer 6 now it's not
animated so the buttons don't work so
that kind of stinks but it still gives
you an idea that everything's laid out
properly and you could also check it out
for example in Firefox 5 and any other
different browsers that you want to
check it out so that's browser lab adobe
com is a great way to check if your
website content is cross browser so now
i'm going to change this guy right here
this kind of bloated huge into this nice
elegant guy it's going to be amazing
just how easy it is to do this so i'm
going to shrink this down so you can
actually see it on screen as i edit
everything here and I constantly get
asked what tools i'm using this is just
google chrome over here on the left side
of the screen and right here is text
wrangler which is just a basic text
editing tool now the only thing I had to
do is of course these images are really
really big and these ones are really
really small so I had to crop those
images and that's exactly what I did I
just took the regular images that were
for example 762 by 310 that was the
original big ones 762 by 310 and I
shrunk them down to 481 by 297 that's
all I did so I cropped them all to
exactly the same size and then I created
this thumbnail that's right here this
little tiny bluish green square so that
is all I did in regards to changing the
images now what I need to do is go into
the actual code and change it and it's
so simple it's unbelievable pretty much
don't have to touch anything up here and
whenever i created my new images i just
added a letter S at the end of them so
I'm just going to go in here and point
at different images so I'm just going to
put
s inside of there and another little s
don't need to change anything else i
made this feature content slider to be
extremely easy to use and then down here
I just need to point at my new thumbnail
so I'm just going to open this up copy
that name paste that in there right like
that then I'm going to copy this paste
it in instead of using the big giant
thumbnails i'm going to use those little
ones and i did that for all four of the
thumbnails and then here for height i
decided to make this 10 instead of 50
again so that it doesn't cover up the
entire screen i'm just going to copy
this and make changes and this is in the
index.html file but we know it's in
wherever you want this to be so and all
of the code is available underneath of
this video and that is it those are the
only changes I needed to make I needed
to point at my four new images you can
put five six ten and as many images you
want just as long as you have a
corresponding thumbnail for them if you
want those something else to be there
those thumbnails don't even have to be
there if I file save that now this isn't
gonna look too nice because the styling
is not right okay so that's what you see
there on screen well now what I'm going
to do is I'm actually going to jump into
the jQuery code a slide or two
javascript file I'm going to make a
couple little changes here I decided for
example that I didn't like the fact that
the slider slid so quickly so under auto
slide interval I'm just going to come
down here and add 6 to that so now it's
going to change every six seconds
instead of every four seconds and
because i don't need the dynamic arrows
anymore i'm gonna come down here and i'm
going to change this to false and i'm
gonna say that let's see what changes
happen basically the arrows one away
that's it you might be able to see these
little dots down here for the new
thumbnails so now what I need to do is
go into the CSS code and change
everything inside of there and just so
you guys understand in the actual file
that we have here inside of this area
inside of this div you don't just have
the option of putting an image inside
here you can put images you can put text
you can put anything inside of here just
as long as it's in between these divs
and it will show up in there instead of
the regular pictures anything everything
works and it'll remain cross-browser as
long as you don't break anything so i'm
going to jump over into the CSS code and
continue making changes there and that's
code a slider dash two point O CSS and
again there's not that many changes I
decided I didn't want my background to
be black anymore I wanted it to be white
I'm going to change this to FFF but a
little semicolon there and then of
course my images are no longer 762 in
with their 481 so change that the 481
not too hard and then you want to scroll
down here until you see nav thumbs and
there is nav thumbs right there and now
my height is no longer 50 pixels so it's
10 pixels so I'm gonna put it in 10
right there and then I need to decide
how far i'm going to move these from the
left when I come back that in a second
and then I'm going to scroll down here
to where it says devkota slider rapper
arrows and i'm going to change this to
41 but it really doesn't matter I just
do this just to keep everything
consistent because those arrows aren't
going to show up and let's save it and
see how that little tiny bit of a change
affected this all right it's looking
pretty sharp and everything's snapped in
in there and looking really really
really good the only problem is you
probably can't tell this but this is a
little bit off-center let's zoom in just
to see it and their their apparent again
but the only reason they're popping up
there is because my dimensions aren't
quite right on the thumbnails and there
you can say so I'm going to go in there
and correct that and that's just a
matter of moving those thumbnails around
basically I told you before I was going
to come back to that so I'm going to
scroll back up to where nav thumbs is
and there's nav thumbs and from the left
side of the screen instead of 230 pixels
I'm going to make this 180 again this is
something you'd have to play with
depending upon the size of your image
area and I'm going to move it to the
left by 11 pixels and right there file
saved it reload it and you can see that
everything laid out perfectly and just
the couple little tiny changes have made
extremely dramatic changes overall to
the way the featured content tool works
so the big takeaway is the future
content tool i have for you is extremely
easy to edit and on top of that if you
want to check to make sure that it's
cross-browser check out the browser lab
adobe com it's free you just have to
sign up to get an account besides from
that it's great leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
