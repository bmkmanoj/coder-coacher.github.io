of my Python 2.7 tutorial today I'm
going to cover dictionaries how to use
the print function and how to use
strings if you didn't see the previous
tutorial you should definitely watch it
otherwise you may be very confused and I
have a link here to it above in previous
tutorial I talked about lists and tuples
well there is another array type or
sequence type inside of Python and it is
called a dictionary with dictionaries
how they differ from tuples and lists is
that you can reference individual
elements inside of tuples and lists by
requesting their specific index number
while dictionaries don't have index
numbers they instead have what we refer
to as keys so the key would it be age
and then the actual value associated
with said key would be 35 on in my
circumstances and you can see here and
I'm going to show you some examples
using this very specific dictionary I
have you're on the screen right here in
a second okay so how do you create a
dictionary I'm going to create a
variable called di si te X and this is
just an arbitrary name of making up and
this is going to be the name for my
dictionary I started off with this
rounded bracket then I define my key
just like that followed by a colon and
the number or value I want to associated
with that key I'm going to do the same
thing here for height like you saw on
previously : and then I'm going to
actually put height inside of quotes and
I'm going to create a final one we call
it weight : and I'm going to assign that
the value of 165 okay there I just
created myself the dictionary now like
tuples dictionary types are immutable
that means once you create them you
cannot come in here and change these
values you can delete them and I'm going
to show you that in a second or you
could completely overwrite them now if I
want to print the screen you can see
right here there's the dictionary that
you just created and if I want to get
the value that is associated with a said
key to do that quite easily put in that
followed by get which is a function and
then type in the key I'm looking for and
you can see it printed out the value
associated with that and if I want to
print out the keys and the values I use
the function called items or method
where everyone call it method functions
to me it's the same thing you can
see here with that out put it here on
the screen and if you want just the
values to come out you just use the
values method and you can see it printed
out just those values and not the key
now if you wanted to actually delete a
value from this dictionary you can do
that but you cannot put in any new ones
and how you would do this is by using
the pop function or method and pass
along the key that you'd like to delete
and you can see here it deleted hide out
but it left age and weight and that's
dictionaries that's pretty much what you
do with them I'm going to show you some
really cool things you can do in
upcoming examples with dictionaries but
at this point in time that is the basics
of how dictionaries work inside of
Python now I'm going to get into how to
manipulate the values in s-- with the
print function so what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to create a string
called STR name I'm going to give it the
value Bob I'm going to create a float
represented by age sex meaning male and
integer just a value that doesn't have a
decimal place represent how many kids he
has in a boolean which only has the
value of true or false and give it the
value of true now why did I do that
you saw previously how to use the print
function to print things out to the
screen so let's say my name is comma if
I run that see my name is Bob pops out
here on the screen actually since I put
this comma in here I didn't have to put
that additional space if however I would
have put a plus sign would have had to
well what happens if you want to take
one of these values and implant it so
you don't have to continually keep
putting strings and wrapping things
around and so forth and so I'm going to
show you that right now so with the
print function if you want a string to
be placed inside of these quotes which
will then be sent to the screen you have
to put a percentage sign followed by the
letter S that represents a string that
is going to be transported there then if
you would like to do the same thing with
floats again percentage sign followed by
F years old and then put your last quote
then you want to put another percentage
sign followed by these rounded off
braces and you want to put in the
different variables that you want
transported into those positions you
just defined so this value here is going
to be put right here and
this value here it's gonna put right
here you can see that I run it Bob is
thirty five point five years old
whatever that works out to me you can
see that that it did put those values in
there however it puts some sort of weird
sort of numbers inside of there as well
if you would want this to be rounded off
to one integer it's real simple you just
put a point in here followed by the
number one and you can see that it
rounded off to thirty five point four
years old let's go and print out some of
these other guys you can see I'm going
to cover all the different common things
that you would want to print using the
print function if you want to print an
individual character percentage sign see
again and another percentage sign and
the name of the variable associated with
it and you can see that it that printed
up on screen as well and I'll show you
the remaining comment values D or I if
you want to place a integer inside of
here I want to use a single quote here
so I'm going to backslash it and I'm
going to place a percentage sign
followed by s to place a boolean in here
close that off another percentage sign
and kids will married and you can see
here printed all that out there and put
all the information in the proper places
so that's some of the different ways you
can transport information of different
types of variables inside of the print
function let's go over here you could
also define a couple other different
things let's say I want to use the PI
function here so I want to import the
math library so I have access to PI and
I'm going to jump down here and let's
say I want to print to the screen PI
with 15 decimal places of accuracy on
one 5f close that off math dot P screen
and it prints it out fifteen points of
accuracy let's say that I also these are
just other different ways you can mess
around with the precision and so forth
I want to guarantee there is a total of
twenty numbers that show up I just come
in here clean up with twenty this is in
decimal places this is total numbers and
what it does by default is it makes
space additional space here to make up
for those 20 digits that you are
recommend or that you are requesting now
if I come in here put one five in here
you can see that it moved
/ so it's left justified if I wanted it
to be right justified meaning all the
additional space should show up on the
right side of that let's say that I do
something like print I'd put this
negative sign in here and that will
force it to make space on the right side
instead of the left side close that off
and you can see here I put that
additional space that I recommended in
there and let's say I want to allow the
user of my program to be able to define
the precision of PI create a variable
called precision and the int function is
going to convert the string that's
passed back by the function raw input
into an integer so that's what I'm doing
here and then I'm going to use this star
symbol here to take this value right
here and define the precision we're
looking for a decimal wise in regards to
how we're going to print PI to the
screen and again percentage sign and
here you have to define the number of
decimal places that goes in the star
area and then you have to define the
value that represents the float and it
says how precise should PI be let's say
I say 30 and it prints it out to the
screen 30 decimal places of accuracy so
the star is going to represent precision
number of decimal places and PI of
course represents the number itself so
there's a whole bunch of different ways
pretty much all the different ways to
use the Print function inside a Python
and now I'm going to go into strings I'm
going to create a value called big
string actually covered some different
ways to combine strings like for example
if I would put this here this would
concatenate both of these strings or
join them together and then assign them
to big string as I previously had talked
about but let's say I wanted to print a
screen from the first index or this
letter right here
II remember this is 0 1 2 that's how
these are all sequenced out if I want to
print from here until the 20th character
every other character that appears there
I can do that with strings just like I
can do them with lists and all these
other different sequence types you saw
previously and you can see it prints
every other letter from index 1 through
20 here onto the screen sometimes it's a
space and that's why you see that there
I could also use the find function
to find the index value of the string
that I passed to the find function so
let's say I'm looking for the string
called string now I want to print out
the screen you can see 15 so 15 right
here this is going to represent the
first location of this value string
right there or let's say I want to count
the number of total ease in the string
called big strings that count and what I
want to count of course put the rounded
braces and there's four total using a
string if you go up there and count them
sure enough you're going to find out
that I'm right you can also define with
the count function just copy it where
you want to begin counting so I just
come in here if I want to start counting
after the fourth index do that it's
going to miss these first two e's and
print that out the screen and you can
also define a range so let's say I want
to go from here to the 20th character
you can see it actually doesn't make it
to this or this e so there's different
ways to use the find and count function
and from the previous tutorial you
probably remember you doing this I'm
going to show you how to turn a string
into a tuple using the tuple function
and then signing it to copy string and
you say it broke every single letter and
space and put it into individual boxes
and stress I'd of the tuple and if you
want to turn a tuple back into a string
this stuff is actually useful it's like
you do this often just put a single
quote two single quotes join and then
copy this T on and it will convert this
tuple back into its string and of course
you could have this and then reassign it
to another string variable type here so
if we did copy two I don't then it's
going to actually turn this tuple back
into a string and then assign the value
of that string to the variable type copy
two you could also do some other kind of
weird things with this join function see
the reason why there's nothing here as I
define that I didn't want anything to go
between these individual letters
whenever this tuple was turned into a
string what happens if I define that I
want to put say a comm in a space it
does just that and if you play with this
a little bit you start to see how useful
a lot of these different functions are
and how
quickly you can change multiple
different things inside a Python like I
can turn this string right here into all
lowercase letters and I'm not going over
every single method that's available
because there's so many but you can see
it automatically turned everything at a
lowercase it could also turn everything
in the upper case just that simple or I
could come in here and replace
individual words with other words using
the replace function so say I want to
say replace long with a string small
boom now instead of saying a long string
it says a small string using this split
function I can actually break up all the
different letters and it broke
everything up and stuck them into a list
and discarded all of the individual
spaces which allows me to easily go in
here you use this a lot for scrubbing
websites and as the last example let's
say I have a string that has a lot of
random whitespace and I want to
eliminate that whitespace no problem
strip function will take it off of there
as you can see it got rid all the white
space so hope you found this tutorial
very useful leave any questions or
comments below until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
