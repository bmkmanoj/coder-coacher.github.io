tutorial on exactly what is quantitative
easing and an overview of the US
economic crisis I'm going to be
simplifying a lot of big words and going
over a lot of statistics that very few
people know about in this tutorial and
I'm doing this because I've received
hundreds of emails asking me to do this
I'm gonna go over exactly what
quantitative easing is did it work I'm
gonna show why the Federal Reserve chose
to use quantitative easing to try and
bring the United States out of its
current economic crisis I'm gonna show
you tons of charts on income taxes
wealth net worth etc that I promise will
not be boring and for the most part my
main source here is the Federal Reserve
for its federal survey on consumer
affairs and the US Census unless I tell
you otherwise so this is the situation
we had after the financial collapse the
government went into a void a run on the
bank above all else they wanted to
stabilize the economy avoid depression
and stimulate loans the banks on the
other hand wanted to make money and get
rid of its toxic assets the banks came
to the Fed and they said we can't lend
money simply because we lost that we
nurses don't have any money the Fed
turned around and said we'll give you as
much money as you need to stabilize the
economy and we'll provide this money at
nearly a zero percent interest rate
banks turned around and said we're still
worried about loaning money out because
we have these toxic assets what can you
do about them the Fed chose to by 1.75
trillion dollars of these toxic assets
from the bank to further stimulate the
economy and get the banks lending the
banks did something unexpected at this
point they decided to invest all that
money that the Fed had actually given
them at 0% into US Treasuries and other
US bonds that paid roughly 2 to 3
percent so what they are doing here is
getting money for free in essence and
then getting a guaranteed 2 to 3 percent
return on said money what a lot of
people don't know about is that whenever
the Fed wants to buy Treasuries they
actually have to buy them from the banks
so the banks were making money here also
the banks were getting bonds and
Treasuries from the US Treasury and then
selling those Treasuries to the Fed and
then buying those Treasuries back off of
the Fed collecting fees both ways so
what the Fed decided to do now was to go
out and actually buy Treasuries so that
the banks could no longer buy those
Treasuries and bonds because they did
not like the
they were being manipulated and then the
banks made money again selling those
Treasuries by attaching fees to them to
the Fed the Fed then said to the banks
do you feel safe lending money now that
we have provided all of this stimulus in
another term the bank's decided to
invest the money that the Fed provided
to them not to stimulate the economy by
providing loans to the general citizens
and businesses in the United States but
instead to invest that money in
unregulated high frequency trading by
this point the public was quite enraged
by what was going on in this situation
and they demanded that the government do
something to fix it so the Fed
approached the banks and they said if
you're gonna continue doing what you're
doing we are going to force you to limit
your executive pay shockingly again
because really the only role corporation
has is to act in the best interests of
its shareholders the banks said to the
Fed sure we'll give you your money back
and since then they've basically just
pled with for the United States
government to not regulate them so they
could continue to make money through
high-frequency trading that is
unregulated so what exactly did the Fed
United States it''s ins and the
government get from quantitative easing
the feds spent a total of two point
seven six trillion dollars buying toxic
assets and u.s. bonds and Treasuries the
financial institutions had the most
profitable years ever the stock market
has been artificially inflated interest
rates are the lowest they've ever been
in history
however the Fed did succeed in stopping
a run on the bank which is what they
were concerned about the whole entire
time but a lot of people are unaware of
and this is what really forced the Fed
to get into quantitative easing is that
real GDP gross domestic product in the
United States historically has risen by
3 percent per year
however after the depression from 29 to
33 real GDP actually declined 34 percent
as you can see in the chart on right GDP
remained below 10 percent until 1941 and
during this period of time the dollar
lost 58 percent of its total value again
I'm talking about the depression here
Ethan fell on an average of 6 percent
year-over-year that's the value of total
goods fell 6 percent year-over-year
during the depression economists believe
this dramatic fall had little to do with
stock market crash in fact economists
believe it had more to do with the run
on the banks and other policy mistakes
of the government
what happened during the Depression is
citizens removed a large percentage of
their savings from the banks because
they were worried about a financial
collapse the banks in fact saw 48
percent decline in total deposits and on
top of that citizens decreased spending
during the British and by 58 percent
during the most recent collapse the Fed
thought its major goal was to do two
things mainly fight deflation and avoid
a run on the banks
they succeeded with that and how they
chose to fight those two problems is to
get as much cast as humanly possible
into the system and then encourage sound
banks to lend that money to get the
economy going again you see during the
Depression the Fed did nothing another
thing that is pointed out is a major
problem with the Depression was the
smoot-hawley Act which increased tariffs
on goods coming into the United States
this is called protectionism as the
United States raised its tariffs all of
the other nations across the world also
raised their tariffs and they believe
this caused a lot of problems with the
United States and increased the overall
length of the depression and this is
also why the Fed and the government in
general is very anti raising tariffs
President Hoover is also blamed widely
because of the depression because he
implemented price and wage fixing
policies he asked manufacturers across
the country to not decrease wages and
also ask manufacturers to do whatever
they could to keep prices stable this is
also why the Fed is anti raising minimum
wage and also anti deflation during the
depression unions were also formed to
protect workers a lot of economists
believe that these unions also hurt the
economy so in essence the Fed did what
it should have done however the banks
had different motivations and those
motivations were not to help the United
States to give you a little perspective
on exactly how much the feds spent
trying to quickstart the economy on the
left side of the screen you can see this
little bar right here represents 2.76
trillion dollars that they pumped into
the economy this right here is the total
net worth of the bottom 80 percent of
citizens in the United States which
amounts to four point fifty four
trillion dollars so that means that the
Fed pumped in over sixty percent of the
total net worth of the bottom eighty
percent into the economy and here by the
way is the total net worth in the next
19% and the net worth of the top 1% in
the United States so
exactly the Fed go wrong well they
thought the money would make its way to
the bottom 80% trickle-down economics
all over again
because the government did not regulate
the shadow banking system where you see
high-frequency trading which is in
essence legal front running the banks
invested all their money there of course
and also the corporations in the United
States know that the bottom 80% don't
have any money so what they started to
do is heavily invest overseas also
knowing that they would not be taxed on
any profits that they made overseas so
the Fed overreached on fighting
deflation keeping wages low allowing
prices to rise and in decreasing
protectionism and that was their major
fault
so how do we fix it it's not gonna be
quite that easy I'm now gonna give you a
rundown of exactly the current state of
the citizens in the United States and
show you why fixing this problem isn't
going to be particularly easy you can
see right here the average income of
United States citizens the top 1% earns
1.1 million on average you can see how
much of the total income base that is
then the next 9% earns 164,000 and then
you can see the bottom 90% who earn an
average income year-over-year of 31,000
$244 and in fact the bottom 80% earn
only 19,000 so let's look closer at that
1% you can see that there is a very
small fraction of the population that
actually earns most of the income as you
can see right here in this pie chart in
fact the top point 0 0 1 percent of
citizens in the United States have an
average income of twenty-seven million
three hundred forty two thousand dollars
so how exactly did we get here well from
1950 which is considered to be the
greatest point in history of the United
States the bottom 90% saw an average
increase of 75 percent in income over
those thirty years however from 1980 to
2008 the bottom 90% saw an average
increase of only 1% were 303 dollars
from 1950 to 1980 on the other hand the
point zero zero one percent saw an
increase of eighty percent or two
million four hundred thousand dollars
however from 1980 to 2008 that same
percentage saw an increase of 403
percent or 21 million nine hundred
thousand dollars now let's look at the
total net worth
of all citizens the United States the
top 1% of a total net worth or a control
of over twenty seven point seven
trillion dollars the next 19 percent
control thirty two point sixty seven
trillion while the bottom eighty percent
only control four point fifty four
trillion as a whole that means at the
bottom eighty percent only have control
over seven point one percent of the
total net worth of the nation meaning
that the average household only has a
total net worth which is all assets
minus liabilities of forty eight
thousand six hundred sixty nine dollars
while the average net worth of the top
one percent of households is 23.78 so
why exactly didn't the United States
citizens notice while they were being
robbed
well households were heavily motivated
to get both parents into the workforce
citizens thought the stock market would
pay for retirement with its dramatic
rise I provide a link to a tutorial on
the truth behind the stock market if
you'd like to watch that credit cards
were used to supplement a lower income
and then home equity loans were used to
pay off credit card debt
most Americans are underwater with their
mortgage and a numerous number of them
actually over 300% of the actual value
of their homes let's go have a little
history of taxation here just so I can
cover everything in this one tutorial
until 1802 sales tax on alcohol tobacco
sugar and corporate bonds were the only
taxes in the United States any ten -
they added taxes on gold silverware and
jewelry in 1817 and they eliminated
internal taxes and the government
actually ran completely on money that
was on and through tariffs in 1862 the
income tax was created and changed
multiple times until 1913 the rates
started at 3% and increased based off of
all total income in 1935 Franklin
Roosevelt raised the tax rate to
ninety-one percent for people making
more than four million dollars today and
that's in today's numbers the belief was
that the reason we should have a sliding
scale on taxation was because the
government at that time believed that
those people earning higher incomes
benefited more from government expenses
in infrastructure education or India etc
than anyone else in 65 President Johnson
lowered the highest tax rate down to 55
point three percent in 78 Jimmy Carter
load capital gains rate from 48 to 28
percent then an 82 Ronald Reagan dropped
the rate for 55 to 27 and corporate
taxes went from representing 33% of all
federal
taxes to 9% Reagan then doubled the
payroll taxes of citizens earning less
than $40,000 per year which dramatically
hurts small and medium-sized business
owners and then we had to george bush's
a bill clinton and a brock obama and
this is where we are right now the
bottom 90% pays on average of twenty
three point four percent in taxes that
includes federal state local sales tax
and capital gains and all taxes
inclusive on the other hand the bottom
point oh one percent pays an average of
sixteen point nine percent a lot of
people get confused about this because
they're supposed to be paying thirty
five percent just in federal you have to
understand this group earns over seventy
five percent of their income off of
capital gains which are only taxed at 15
percent corporations pay an average of
twelve point six percent and whenever
you hear about not taxing corporations
for shipping jobs overseas what they're
actually talking about is the tax
deferral system which allows
corporations to avoid taxes of any type
as long as they keep those earnings
outside of the united states so here's
an overall tax breakdown between 1950
and 2008 I don't have more reliable
information in regards to today's
numbers and that's why I'm using 2008
numbers because they were very reliable
you can see on the left side of your
screen that corporate taxes in nineteen
fifty made up twenty five percent of
total revenue that the government
brought in and now in 2008 it's down to
five percent on top of that you can see
a dramatic drop in overall other taxes
and a dramatic increase on payroll taxes
again this is supposed to go to Social
Security Medicare unemployment and so
forth and so on so you can see just from
this simple chart exactly who is paying
revenue to the United States government
and who is not so how these changes in
incomes affected the different groups
from 1980 until 2008 you saw the top one
percent increase their overall income as
a group by six hundred seventy three
billion dollars or five hundred ninety
seven thousand dollars per year per
household while the bottom 20 percent
saw a total loss of 136 billion during
this time period or five thousand six
hundred twenty three dollars per year
per household so can this be fixed well
what a lot of people don't realize is
after the Great Depression most of the
loss of employment in the United States
actually came through
Manufacturing and not through all the
other different sectors in the United
States as you can see in this chart here
and if we look closer at non-farm jobs
in the United States we see that in 1950
38 percent of all jobs in United States
we're in the manufacturing field while
today it's down to 18 percent and we've
also seen a dramatic increase in overall
service jobs well total government jobs
pretty much remains flat even though you
hear the total opposite in the news
every day and transport trade and
utility jobs have pretty much also
remained flat well now since we're in a
situation where there is not a dramatic
need for service jobs in the United
States because people don't have any
money what we need to do instead is
increase jobs in manufacturing just like
they did after the Great Depression and
this is a basic outline of exactly
what's needs to be done based off of
what other nations have done recently in
history to improve their economies as
well as what was done after the Great
Depression we need to increase
infrastructure rebuilding increased jobs
and high-tech manufacturing Institute
training and apprenticeships and
Manufacturing's create online free
training by partnering with the blog
community for one thing citizens also
need a fair arbitrator that is going to
represent them in all businesses
nationwide or basically just do what
Germany did in 1990 Germany is now the
second largest exporter of goods in the
world and they turned their economy
around basically by following exactly
what the United States did after the
Great Depression we need an increased
revenue by raising taxes on the
wealthiest 5% because nobody else has
any money we need to relax burden on
small and medium-sized business owners
by decreasing payroll taxes asper
eliminating Social Security Medicare
Medicaid and so forth this is the only
safety net for the bottom 90%
if you don't remember they only have a
total net worth of 48,000 $600 and it's
hard to support yourself in the
retirement years on such a small figure
for those people that say the taxation
doesn't help people it hurts nations I
list here the only three countries in
the world that do not have an income tax
in the nation that has the highest
overall tax rate which is Denmark also
has the happiest people recently the
Canadian members of parliament pointed
out how income inequality destroys
nations they stated that societies with
smaller income differences between rich
and poor have fewer health and social
problems
such as teenage births violence mental
illness and drug abuse so what nation
you may ask yourself were they referring
to the United States ranks number one in
regards to income inequality of all
developed nations and also they ranked
number one in teenage births
imprisonment homicides infant mortality
drug abuse and an inability to increase
social status which means that it is
harder to increase your overall income
or shows or status in the United States
than it is in any other developed nation
and just to say that I've pretty much
covered everything people are always
asking who exactly owns all the United
States debt in fact the United States
public and States owned over nine point
seven four trillion dollars then you
have the social security fund which has
actually been looted and then you have
all other government debt held in the
United States and then all the countries
that I have listed here on the right
side of the screen you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
