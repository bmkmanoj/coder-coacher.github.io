subscriptions around 300,000 views and
260 videos I thought I'd create an
interface for you guys that you could
use to access pretty much everything
that I've done all in one place this is
going to be very very quick and I'm
going to go through pretty much
everything I got here if you click
anything here on the screen you're going
to be driven over to a playlist in which
everything is organized you'll be able
to learn pretty much anything about HTML
cascading style sheets PHP and MySQL
javascript jquery XML flash animation
and if you want to see the worst videos
I've ever done you can check out my
wordpress tutorials because those were
the first then I did a ton of videos on
personalities as well as a recent one in
regards to the types of tests you would
take if you would go to a guidance
counselor these are some of my best
videos especially the personality ones
because they link to pretty detailed
personality reports that are all free of
course then I have my most popular
videos which my illustrator videos then
if you don't know I lost over 80 pounds
by reading nutrition textbooks I go
through all that in the lose weight area
then I touch a little bit on marketing
I'm going to get a lot more into this
later on then under negotiation I mainly
focus on how to win an argument or how
to negotiate basically but I also cover
one of the other topics that people seem
to like which is body language analysis
and a little bit on hypnosis this whole
thing is basically how to program people
then in the psychology section I focus
more on hypnosis and on how our brains
work in sales here is the tutorial that
I'm most proud of I explain step by step
how to use the advanced psychology
tricks that I talked about up above to
sell pretty much anything be it a
product an idea or even a date and
actually part of this tutorial was
recently featured on cracked.com which
is totally cool and then in the bottom
right hand corner I have a bunch of
random videos based off of submitted
questions that you guys have sent me
then finally to round everything up I
have an objective-c tutorial which I'm
actually going to reduce an a PHP
security tutorial which goes into how
hackers actually hack websites and how
to block that from happening and I have
a tutorial on Python 2.7 and Python 3
point 0 a bunch of stuff on regular
expressions actually I have over seven
videos on regular expressions and
finally SQL so I hope you find this you
useful please keep submitting your
requests for tutorials in the future and
on this page I list a couple other
videos that you guys specifically out
there have told me are very good and you
enjoyed well that's all for today until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
