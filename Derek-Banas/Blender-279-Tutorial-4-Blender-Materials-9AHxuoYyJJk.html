4 of my blender video tutorial and this
part of the tutorial I'm going to cover
materials lighting textures simulating
glass and numerous different examples
all the files used here are available in
a link in the description underneath the
video as well as a full transcript of
the entire video and I have a lot to do
so let's get into it alright so here is
blender and you can download this file
so you can play around with it now what
am i mainly be working with here is this
sphere so what I want to do is i'm gonna
right select it and i turned on my
display so you're gonna be able to see
all the keys that I have right here now
if we want to go in and change the
material this is the place where we're
gonna do that we're gonna click on that
guy right there
this is textures this is material so I'm
gonna cover a little bit on textures I'm
gonna try not to overwhelm you though
alright so I selected that then I'm
gonna come in here and click on new
Cisse it says right there add a new
material so I'm doing that just on our
little sphere that we have here and you
can see a representation of what we have
here now our material settings and there
are a ton of them are going to define
how simulated light and surfaces can be
changed to simulate the look of metal
and glass and cloth and skin and a whole
bunch of other different things I'm
gonna be using the blender render here
right now and later I'm going to talk
about the cycles render but I just
thought I start with a blender render
which is the default rendering engine
and these settings that I have here this
is in object mode and then down inside
of here I'm gonna have this set for
solid just so you can follow along now
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open up
the grease pencil over here and
continuous and draw and I just want to
talk about what happens when light hits
an object now it is going to diffuse and
what that basically means is it's going
to reflect off the surface in many
different directions depending upon how
rough the surface is so if our light is
coming in on our sphere in this
situation depending upon how rough it is
that light is going to scatter in
multiple different direction
and that is considered diffusion now we
have also what is called specular
lighting and you're going to say see
this says diffuse here
and specular lighting here shading
transparency mirror we're going to talk
about all those now specular lighting is
going to reflect the light in different
ways depending upon how smooth the
object is so diffuse is mainly rough Wow
specular lighting is going to deal more
in regards to smoothing now with
specular lighting we are basically
defining what happens with the light
hits our sphere and then shoots off in a
consistent direction okay so those are
going to be the different things we're
going to be playing with here in this
tutorial series another thing that
happens when light hits an object is the
object is of course going to reflect
back its own color as well as
surrounding objects if the object we're
dealing with is highly reflective and
also if an object is transparent it is
going to show what lies behind it as
well as you know its own form and
basically what we are going to do is
we're gonna change the lighting and
textures and camera angles and shadows
and translucency and so forth to
simulate a whole bunch of different
types of materials so what I want to
talk about here first is the different
diffusion options that we have now of
course you're going to be able to color
your object so I'm going to come over
here and let's say we want it to be like
a bluish color and you can see here that
I also have let's switch over to the
tools area here this is also set for
smooth then under intensity what we're
going to do is determine the amount of
light to reflect to our camera so as
this is lowered you can see that less
light is being reflected and as it's
raised you're going to see this there's
more like being passed back I'm gonna
cover ramp here later on this is
basically going to be used to set a
range of different colors and how those
colors are going to vary from the outer
edge of our object and inward so I'm
gonna give you an example of that later
on and you're also going to see that we
have different diffusion shaders here so
we have Lambert and you can see what
that looks like and here's an example of
it right here basically it is going to
allow you to define how much light is
reflected of course like I said
previously and I know I'm gonna butcher
all these names I'm just not even gonna
say them here sit well I'll say it there
is Oren NIR and if we go and select that
what this is going to do is provide us
the options to change the roughness
remember I talked about diffusion and
roughness you're gonna see as you play
around with these different values how
that is going to change for us and we
can lower that as well to zero then we
have the toon shader and here I jumped
into rendering mode just so you can see
example of that let's go back to the
Oran air and let's go in here and change
our roughness again you can see it's
rescaling as I go and draw inside here
as I changed the roughness on it from
zero the whole way up to 3.14 changing
the shader once again and with this guy
we're going to be able to darken parts
of an object to simulate different
materials you can see as I darken it how
that is being affected quite
dramatically and it goes of course from
zero whole way up to two and then the
last shader we have here is Fresnel and
this is just going to change what is
called the Fresnel effect which is going
to define how ambient light or light
that exists around our object is going
to affect our object and you can see as
we increase that up to five which is our
maximum and then we drop it down to zero
and the changes we have there whoops
drop it down to zero and then we could
change the factor as well all the way up
to five and the whole way down to zero
so I talked about ramps so I'm gonna go
and give you an example of a ramp I'm
gonna go and select this and like I said
before this is going to define a color
gradient across the whole entire object
that you have defined here so what I
want to do we have this guy right here
and this is called the color ramp widget
and right here we're going to be able to
add different colors so we can just
click on this guy right here and it
creates what's called a color stop we
can then go in and define specifically
what those colors are going to be now I
have one here selected first so we can
jump between the different color stops
based off of just clicking on those so
there is the first one this black one
right here and then this one one is the
middle one and then finally we have the
final one over here let's go to the very
first one which is set for black and
let's change its color to something
that's going to be it more easy to say
here so I'm just gonna change it
something extreme like this green and
you're gonna have two different types of
colors you're gonna have RGB which are
just straight colors and then you're
gonna have HSL and HSV which are going
to provide you with different saturation
options so I have this set for green and
then gonna jump over to the next color
stop this guy right here and let's set
this like a red let's take the color up
a little bit more pink I guess and then
I'm gonna jump to the next one right
here and this is white and I'm gonna
change this color as well and let's make
this into a blue okay so pretty dramatic
changes in colors as you can see right
there
so as you can see it is transitioning
between all of those different colors
across star or sphere that we have here
on our screen and we can go from our
shader to normal and we can change this
to our results which is going to be more
of a flat tone and let's just go back
and change it to normal we're also going
to be able to come in here in the blend
area and get some interesting effects if
we click on add and then also subtract
we're also gonna be able to come in here
and flip these colors around so that
we're going to start off with the purple
color and then go into the pink and then
the green and we can come back and flip
that again and now you see that the
green gets more of an emphasis then we
have what are called our interpolation
options and basically what those are
going to do for us is just to define how
we are going to transition between all
of the different colors using different
functions and you can see cardinal and
linear and b-spline these are just names
of functions that are going to basically
transition between these colors in
multiple different ways we're also going
to be able to come down here for
position and we're gonna be able to
change the positioning between our color
stops so let's come down here and move
it down you can see how that is being
affected pretty dramatically and of
course we can select the different ones
we have here let's go to the middle one
and drag that down as well and so forth
and so on let's change this to linear
and let's change this back to mix to
give it more of a smooth look we're also
going to be able to change the Alpha for
this guy if we just click there and like
I said before blend is just going to
provide numerous different ways of
blending the color across our color ramp
okay so there is a bunch of stuff and
I'm gonna turn that off because it's
kind of distracting alright and you
gonna be able to do similar things with
our ramp here actually exactly the same
things but
this is going to be in reference to our
specular lighting which like I said
previously is going to represent the
objects highlight this guy right here
now in regards to the different shaders
that are provided for specular lighting
you're going to have the Cooke torrance
shader which is going to be used to give
a plasti look as you can see right there
the falling shader as I selected right
there is normally used for skin and
organic surfaces Blinn is going to
simulate how light is going to bend
whenever it is reflecting and the
hardness down here that we're going to
be able to mess with is going to make
our light source glow smaller as the
hardness of our object increases and
then also if we go in the opposite
direction of course the highlight is
going to get bigger okay and IO are down
here which is an abbreviation for index
of refraction is going to allow us to
change how much the background is going
to be distorted based off of the high
light hitting the surface of our object
that we have set here and of course
there's more shaders we're also gonna
have tune you can see that that's a very
very stark highlight like you would see
with a cartoon cell shading and then you
have Ward isotropic which is going to be
used for things like metal and plastics
down here where we see shading we're
gonna have a whole ton of other
different options we're gonna have emit
which is going to define the amount of
light to emit from our object you can
see that that's getting more and more
intense as we raise it and less so as we
lower it let's lower it down a lot more
ambient is gonna define how the
different available scene lighting
effects are going to affect our object
we have on our screen and just so you
know if I come in here and jump out of
the rendering mode and select this
lighting up Here I am using a Sun lamp
in this situation cuz I thought that
from that basically worked the best for
what I was trying to preview here jump
back over into this guy and jump back
into the rendering can also may have
noticed down here where we have our
shadow this is very stark that is
because I'm using the blender render
we're gonna be able to get cleaner
shadows whenever we use the cycles
render but I just wanted to cover
everything and that's the reason why I'm
covering this also down inside of
shading we're going to be able to change
the translucency which is going to
define the amount of lighting be
find the object that is going to show
through I can raise this not gonna see
that dramatic I'm an effect however
because we're going to mainly simulate
transparency is down here in the
transparency area which is the reason
why it's called transparency if we come
down here and click on shadeless this is
going to make the lights and shadows
that we have here have no effect on our
object tangent shading is going to
intensify our highlight as you can see
right there causing quite a mess and
tangent shading does normally caused
quite a mess so we don't really play
with that very much and then we have
cubic interpolation which is going to
smooth the transitions between our light
and shadow as you can see there it's
very subtle but there is a little bit of
smoothing that goes on there all right
so now let's talk about transparencies
and then I am going to come in here and
actually create or simulate glass inside
of this scene using the glass that we
created in a previous part of the
tutorial let's come up here and change
this guy so he's not quite so nasty
looking alright so and it's also let's
also increase the hardness on this
object okay so now what I want to talk
about is transparency and to get the
transparencies to start to render or the
to simulate transparencies we're gonna
check this guy mask right here
is going to mix the colors from the
background along with the colors of the
object to simulate transparency Z
transparency is also going to mix those
object colors with the background colors
to create a transparent look what I
really want to focus in on is the
raytrace now to make the object
transparent first off you're going to
have to go to the Alpha and lower it
below one and as you do that more and
more and more you're going to see that
the background is going to show up say
there is the background showing up
behind our object Fresnel over here is
going to define how transparent an
object is so we can increase that and
you can see it's getting more and more
transparent and you can see that's
digging like right here in the center
how transparent it looks it's a pretty
cool effect specular in this situation
is going to define how quickly light is
going to be absorbed and we can use this
to simulate thickness of an object we
can
and lower that and you can see that our
object is looking more and more slight
and increase it the whole way to one get
that definition blend is going to blend
between our transparent and non
transparent surfaces down here once
again
IOR is a reference to index of
refraction and just to keep that simple
it's just how much of the background is
going to be distorted whenever it passes
through our object so if we go and
increase that you see a lot of
distortion as we increase it and then as
we lower it down gonna see much less
okay and I'm just gonna keep it at one
in this situation as we increase the
filter option the more we do the more of
the base color for our object is going
to overpower the scene as you can see as
I'm raising it it is getting it to be a
darker and darker blue and I'm just
gonna lower that down to zero once again
so it has less of an effect in that
situation fall-off is going to once
again give us or provide us the illusion
of thickness for our object raise that
and it makes the object seem more and
more thick it's gonna look a little bit
better whenever we go and have more
complex objects like we whenever we
create to the glass which I'm going to
do here very very soon limit is going to
determine at what thickness and object
loses its transparency depth is going to
set the maximum number of transparent
surfaces a light ray can pass through
for our object and then over here with
gloss as we come in here and change the
amount this is gonna cause blurring
between the object and the background
behind it as you can see as I'm lowering
that let's lower this below zero you're
gonna see a lot of distortion
kind of a little bit picky so I'm just
gonna go and get rid of that Ray's out
the whole way up the one and then in the
other two options that we have here for
gloss is threshold which is gonna limit
an object shapes influence on our gloss
and then finally samples is going to
define the complexity when determining
blurriness kind of a messy type of thing
and it's better to do some of these
different effects using our cycles
renderer which I'm going to cover it
later on so now why don't we go in here
and let's take the glass that we made in
a previous part of the tutorial and I'll
show you how to use all of these
different surface materials to actually
make it look like
made out of glass so here it is here is
our glass that we made previously and
I'm gonna make it look like glass if we
go in here and render it you can see it
looks nothing like glass so that's not
good okay so the very first thing I want
to do let's zoom out of here and find
our lighting and I'm gonna jump over
into object mode and I'm gonna select
our lighting right here and I want to
use hemispheric lighting so I'm gonna go
and check on this guy right here and I'm
going to come down here and click on
hemispheric okay so that's where I want
that to be I'm gonna zoom out of this
and I'm gonna have it actually line up
with our glass that we have here in our
scene I'm gonna change this to seven and
line it up right around the center area
of our glass now what I can have the
lighting do is actually come in here and
line up or track the glass on our screen
by issuing a constraint so once again
you want to make sure you're in object
mode hit tab to jump between edit and
object mode then what we're gonna do is
come over here where our constraints is
say constraints pops up right here and
click on that guy and add object
constraint make sure you have the
lighting set so I'm gonna click on that
and I'm gonna say track to click on that
I'm then going to target in this
situation our glass is called Bezier
curve because I never changed it so just
leave it like that and then I'm gonna
set this to negative seven and then I'm
gonna set this guy to Y you can see that
the lighting is now coming down upon our
glass and as we come like this you're
gonna see that it's gonna make our glass
show up much better on the screen and I
might have to move the lighting up a
little bit or down what have you but you
can also see if I go and select the
glass that we have here and move it
around that the lighting is going to
follow it no matter where I put it
so let's put it back there now what I
want to do is I want to add a plane to
our base so I'm going to come down here
then we go shift a plane and I'm gonna
come over this guy let's increase this a
little bit and you click on N to make
that go and come and leave and so forth
and so on alright so the very first
plane I want to have our location be
zero on the X plane
and I'm gonna set this to negative 8 and
then set this for positive 8 I'm gonna
rotate it on the x axis by 90 90 degrees
I'm gonna have this sort of be a wall
that comes up next to it then going to
scale this guy on the X plane by 8 and
on the Y plane also by 8 and our overall
dimensions are going to be 16 by 16 okay
so now what I want to do is create
another one well let's also create a
plane here on the surface that we can
use so a to deselect that and let's
create another one plane and let's move
this into this area right here and then
we're going to increase the scaling on
this to 8 and 8 up maybe a little bit
too much let's change it about 7 7 see
if that works out better z and change
that to 0 and let's take the Z and lower
it down so that it shows up be low our
glass changes to 0 move this guy into
position and then like this and the
scaling was right originally so 8 and 8
and once again move it down into
position and into position okay so now
we have a plane on the side and then
we're gonna put another plane over here
all right so that lines up pretty good
let's change this to 0 and 0 all right
so good stuff a to deselect that then
we're gonna create another plane and
it's gonna go right here and then we
will go and turn this glass we have here
to make it look like it's glass so let's
add another one and mesh and plane and
this guy once again we're going to have
this be negative 8 yeah let's put it
over on this side instead Y is gonna be
0 Z is going to be 8 I'm going to rotate
it on the x axis by 90 just like I did
before rotate it on the z axis also by
90 there we go got that to fit in and
then I just need to scale this so we're
gonna scale it 8 &amp;amp; 8 and there we go now
we got that in place all right so now we
have our glass with the different planes
everywhere so it's gonna line up a lot
better now what I need to do before I go
and do anything else is we have to add
materials to all these different
positions so
I have this guy selected so I'm gonna
come over here click on materials and
I'm gonna go new and I'm gonna give it
like a brownish color just to give it
some type of weird color maybe like that
and let's lower it I was kind of looking
a little bit good alright so got that
I'm going to also add material here so
new and material and let's go and give
it sort of a brownish color again but
let's make it maybe a little bit darker
than we had previously and then to do
something fun let's go with this guy
let's go just go new leave it with the
default and then what I want to do is
add a texture to it just to do something
different once again the textures are
right here so we can get a texture and
I'm just going to use an image I'm going
to cover more on textures later so I'm
just going to come in here and go new
texture and then what I can do is I can
have there's all kinds of different
things that I can create all these
different options we have here but I'm
just gonna leave this be image and then
down here I'm going to open up an image
which is gonna be wood and whenever
you're importing images you just want to
make sure that the size of it is
divisible equal by 2 so you want to
basically import images that are gonna
be 200 by 200 400 by 400 and so forth
and so on
I'm gonna go and open one of those up so
let's say I want to use a 400 by 400
wood that's selected that's a ping file
we can come over here and render this
out and you're gonna see there are our
walls and there is our wood texture that
we have underneath our glass maybe we
want to change this a little bit go and
select this guy jump back over in
materials and maybe make it a little bit
darker or some I don't know but and
render it there that's a little bit more
like what I was looking for now what I
want to do is I want to come in here and
make the glass actually look like it's
made out of glass so I got this inside
of here I got that selected I'm gonna
come in and I'm gonna go new under
materials and I want to come in here to
specular and for hardness and I want to
set this to like 300 which is gonna give
it more of a reflection so there we go
change that to 300 then what I'm gonna
do I'm gonna do most of my work down
here inside of the transparency here and
I
go and do rendering on this as well and
change everything as I'm going so I'm
going to select raytrace which is my
favorite way to make things transparent
remember we have to take our alpha down
if we below one if we wanted to actually
be transparent you can see that it's
already starting to look like it's made
out of glass let's just just to keep
this simple let's change this to point
one point one boom and you can see if we
come in it's already starting to look
like glass right they're a little bit
rough but what have you
let's go and tweak a couple other
different little things we have here
let's go to Fresnel and let's change
this to 5 maybe make this a little bit
more see-through I O'War let's change
this to like 1.25 see it's starting a
little bit more bandy and our depth
that's going to let's increase that to
like 10 and now you can say this is
whenever everything starts to get really
crazy whoops let's go and zoom in on
this whoops
so you see now it's starting to look
more like glass and as I increase that
depth it's going to look more and more
like glass
I could tweak and play with this all day
and night I'm just gonna leave it like I
don't know let's just change it to 10
and changing the background colors and
so forth will probably help this out a
lot I could also maybe come down here
and play around with tangent shading
which sort of emphasizes the highlights
on our glass as you can see right there
I don't know if I like that or not but
there we go and there is how we can
simulate glass inside of render all
right so later on I'm going to talk
about this cycles renderer or like I
talked about before it's a little bit
better in regards to different rendering
options but I just wanted to cover all
of the different material effects and
then touch upon lighting and texturing
just to keep the overall tutorial
interesting so hopefully you guys
enjoyed that and found it useful and
like always please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
