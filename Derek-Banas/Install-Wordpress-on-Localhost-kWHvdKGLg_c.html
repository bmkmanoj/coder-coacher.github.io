show you exactly how to install
WordPress on a local machine for
developmental reasons if you're on a PC
probably your best bet is to go to
Microsoft comm for such web /downloads
for such platform aspx this guy right
here because this is Microsoft web
platform installer and it is quite easy
to install WordPress automatically using
it you could also install lamp server
and you can get that at WAMP server comp
or slash e.n and what that will do is
it'll set up sort of a simulated Apache
server with MySQL and PHP installed for
Windows now if you're installing it on
any other type of machine and also this
would work if you have installed Apache
locally on your PC what you're going to
need to do of course is go to
wordpress.org forward slash download
right here and then you're going to want
to download WordPress okay and here's
the wordpress zip file right there gonna
open that up and this leaves me with all
my wordpress files well the first thing
i want to do is actually go into my
terminal and set up a couple things
using mysql i'm going to go into - do
all five - you root - p and log into
this and then what i'm going to do is
i'm going to create the wordpress
database actually i'm going to give it a
different name i'm going to call it WP
blog doesn't matter what you call it you
can call whatever you want it to be then
what i'm going to do is create a new
user who's going to have the privileges
to do pretty much anything they could
possibly ever want to do with the
wordpress database so number WP blog
star - and we have to to find the user's
name i'm gonna call them super-duper on
whatever you want you're almost always
going to type in localhost here on the
quote identified by and here we're
actually going to put in a password
quotes and then a semicolon alright got
that set up and now i'm just going to
tell you flush privileges and this just
cleans up some memory issues inside of
mysql and then exit out of this bad boy
okay we're pretty much done with that so
we got the database set up everything's
all looking nice and pretty then what
you're going to want to do is inside the
wordpress folder you're going to want to
find WP config forward slash sample dot
PHP open that up and whatever your
favorite text editor is i'm using text
because I'm on a Mac you could also use
notepad or notepad plus plus on a PC or
them if you're on Linux whatever you
want to use just don't use Microsoft
Word you want to open this guy up and
here it is so here I'm going to type in
my database name which is WP blog number
from before user name is going to be
super duper because that's what I called
him make sure you spell all these things
right you're going to type in your
password and then localhost is going to
stay the same everything else here is
going to stay the same
then you have to go and get some special
keys from WordPress to plug in here
you're almost done installing the whole
thing so then what you want to do is go
to API wordpress.org secret key with a
dash the middle forward slash 1.1 salt
and then you're just going to want to
take these keys and copy them in
actually shorthand why don't you just
copy the whole doggone thing jump into
WordPress and paste him in here okay
beautiful and what you're going to want
to do is save as and then here is the
file you want to get rid of the sample
at the very end of this bad boy and
delete that and just leave it PHP just
like that and then you're going to want
to save that then you have to figure out
exactly where you want it stored because
you're not going to leave this here so
here is the actual wordpress file and
i'm actually going to just copy it and
since I'm on a Mac I'm going to go into
library web server documents and I'm
going to paste it right inside here okay
so now I know in the WordPress folder is
where I got all this now what I'm going
to have to do is find install dot PHP
which is going to be in the WP admin
folder so just open that up and then you
can see install dot PHP right here and
what you're going to do is open that up
in a browser and run that guy then
you're going to want to jump over to the
localhost and then you're going to type
in WordPress if that's name you gave for
that folder and then you want to type in
WP dash admin forward slash install dot
PHP if you want to see what that looks
like looks just like that and you want
to hit enter and it's going to install
everything I'm going to call this sample
site username I'm going to leave this as
admin type in a password email in this
situation since it's going to be locally
I'm going to uncheck allow my site to be
appear in search engines like Google and
Technorati and I'm going to click on
install WordPress and as you can see it
was successfully installed and I jump
back here to localhost forward slash
WordPress and hit enter you can
the whole entire site is installed
WordPress is installed locally and I can
come in here and edit and do whatever I
want with this stuff without worrying
about endangering or destroying
something that's actually useful a lot
more in regards to WordPress themes and
plugins is comment if you have any
questions or comments or requests that
you'd like me to cover please leave them
in the comment section below or the last
