I'm gonna teach you how to hypnotize
people specifically I'm gonna show you
how to perform a hypnosis instant
induction the reason I'm doing this
presentation today as I was asked
Britany 34 sent me an email requesting
that I teach her how to hypnotize people
I suppose she wants to know how to
perform a hypnosis instant induction
which is when you pretty much walk up to
someone and almost instantly hypnotized
and this is what commonly people want to
know wow you will have to practice these
techniques they are the same techniques
used by milton erickson who is
considered to be one of the greatest
hypnotherapist of all time gnosis like
anything else worth learning will take
you a bit of time and practice but if
you believe that the technique will work
this is very very important if you get
the subject to fill a few simple
commands first if you act with authority
when you issue the command and continue
telling the person that they are indeed
being hypnotized no matter what they do
you should succeed one way you can help
increase your odds is to put them first
through a series of what are called
suggestibility tests these are tests
that will fool someone into thinking you
are really manipulating them these tests
will slowly build up your strength to
overwhelm someone and here's an example
of suggest ability test let's say you
would tell somebody to look at your
finger you then place your finger on the
top of their head and tell them to look
at it and then close their eyes
if you then tell them as they look at
your finger they will find it hard to
open their eyes they in fact well but
the reason why isn't because of your
suggestions it's because of how the
muscles work in the eye it actually if
they look up in the air while their eyes
are closed they will find it very hard
to open their eyes back up while looking
up where your finger is hope that's
understandable so that's an example of a
suggestibility tuff here are the basic
steps you must fall in a quickly
hypnotized or how to perform an instant
hypnosis induction first off you want to
build rapport this is the process of
getting the other person to feel
comfortable around you if you're
practicing a quick trance induction on a
friend this really should be no problem
then you want to gain their attention
get them to completely focus on all
levels on one thing and I'll demonstrate
how to do that in the directions below
then
you want to lead them into trance when
you notice their eyes are focused
completely on what you have directed
them towards lead them deeper into
trance and I'll demonstrate how to do
that below the most famous hypnosis
induction is named after Milton Erickson
to start off you can either take a
subject through some suggest ability
test like I mentioned previously and I
have a whole ton of those on my website
if you'd like to see more or you can
just start firing off command it's best
to do this with the clients sitting down
for safety reasons of course you would
want to tell them to please sit down and
place their feet on the ground and then
demonstrate how to do that
why are we doing that this is a simple
command it's going to get them
comfortable with taking more complicated
commands off of you later then you want
to demonstrate and command them to place
their hands exactly the way that you
demonstrate then you want to issue the
command I have here on the final
bulleted item and you want to reach out
to shake their hand and you have to
think in your mind at this point that
you are simply reaching out to shake
their hand otherwise they may sense that
you're going to do something else you
want to stop just before your hands
touch and gently grasp their risk with
your left hand point into their palm
with your right finger and say look at
any one spot right there say this was a
surprise as if it was a question and
then go on to say and yes just keep
looking at that as your mind relaxes now
closing your eyes then you want to issue
the final command here there is no
reason to talk continue issuing commands
that I'm not going to say just in case
you're listening to this in a car and
all we're doing here is we're describing
to the person how their body is relaxing
and then in the final bulleted item you
see here right after you say now the
person should be deeply in trance if
you're not comfortable with that hand
distraction that I just talked about
here are some other ways you can focus
the subjects attention instead of
grabbing their wrist and pointing at
their palm try the jerk handshake now if
you have any doubt that you cannot
support your subjects weight make sure
you do this in a seated position sit
next to the subject and turn towards
them and have them do the same to you
then you want to establish positive
rapport by getting the subject to agree
with you or using suggestibility tests
like we talked about before then you
want to reach out to shake the subjects
hand again as if it's going to be a
natural hand shake shake normally and
then sure
- your hand down and to your right side
but of course you don't want to injure
them a slight tug will do because they
will not be expecting this as you pull
them towards you place your left hand on
their neck and pull them towards you in
the same motion and you want to do this
as if you're giving them a hug again as
you perform steps three and four command
them to sleep now speak the same
suggestions of relaxation that we talked
about previously here's another example
of how you can distract somebody reach
out and shake their hand naturally and
while doing so you want to stare into
your subjects eyes and let the hand
shake naturally come to a stop but hold
their hand loosely at this point slowly
as you release your hand you want to
randomly touch different parts of their
hand look through the subject or between
their eyes at this point and begin
deepening their thoughts with commands
to relax like we used in the previous
demonstrations continue to touch their
hand lightly while continuing those
commands and now for the master trance
induction I've seen this work on even
the most stubborn of people it works
mainly because you are assaulting
subjects senses on all levels all at the
same time even better yet
you will know when they're deep in
trance because they're going to stop
counting you want to stand behind the
subject tell them to stand up straight
with your feet shoulder length apart and
then you want to notify them that
they're doing what you want by saying
great then tell them any moment I'm
going to ask you to start counting
backwards three numbers at a time count
backwards in threes starting at three
hundred out loud so I can hear you as
you count I will place my hands on your
shoulders now place hands lightly on the
shoulders now I'll begin to turn you in
circles if you find it easier to fall
into a comfortable deep trance go ahead
and you want to tell them be comfortable
in knowing you are in good hands you can
begin counting now as they begin
counting turn them slowly around don't
jerk them as they turn and count give
them suggestions that will relax them
like I gave previously then you want to
tell them as you count it is so
difficult to keep your attention
you are now spinning your mind spinning
where do those numbers go you will soon
let go into trance so comforting no need
to think of numbers anymore
then you want to say as your eyes feel
heavy heavier now let them close no need
to count but relax once they stop
counting they will be deep in trance and
ready for more suggestions like I said
before this trance induction works
almost every time and what makes it
great is the fact that you will know
when they're in trance because they'll
stop counting I recently put it out
there that you guys can hit me with any
questions that you have within reason
recently I received the following
questions how do I stop thinking about
people or mean to me or how do I control
my emotions how do I win an argument and
what is the Tea Party these questions
will be answered very soon if you have
any questions of your own please leave
them in the comment section below till
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
