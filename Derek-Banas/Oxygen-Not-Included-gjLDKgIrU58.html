in a different place because I'm trying
to get everything here in order and
let's go and get my streaming software
up how's my audio
we're playing oxygen not included or I'm
playing it I guess you for watching I
could see your comments I like to do
this thing called random livestream fry
or basically just talk about all kinds
of random things answer questions I get
all the time talk about random stuff
alright let's go in here I'm gonna go
new game I played this game for about 5
minutes or something and I was like I
should totally play this in a livestream
so so alright let's go start game
alright we're trapped in an asteroid
it's a space-based game and you
basically have to try to survive mmm and
it's loading up a world this is made by
the guys and gals that Claire bleep I
suppose that's a way that you pronounce
it it's que le I I don't know how that's
clay but I think that's what the name of
the company is hmm and here we go hello
who everybody success space adventure
awaits and I'm just guessing what's
going on here alright so basically you
get a whole bunch of different
characters and I suppose my audios
alright you guys aren't screaming at me
that it's messed up yeah clay made don't
starve which is one of my favorite games
ever so cool stuff alright so basically
I don't know how to play this game I'd
like it's at played for like five
minutes so basically my idea is I want
to get somebody the time Construction
high in athletics and high in digging
strength whatever so let's see if we got
here and these are the negative aspects
right here and flatulent these are the
positive things about these guys
yo colas duplicatable I don't know what
I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna go in
here and try and find like I don't
really see anything here that
like all that Mouse strength mm-hmm I
don't know see what that is
oh she's also strength Oh everybody's
bodybuilder what's going on all right so
let's just switch through here cooking
learning okay that's good narcoleptic
this I'm just gonna keep her it says she
can fall asleep at any time any place
I'm just gonna keep it just because I
like the learning part and creativity so
she should be good at building stuff and
you can also yell at me here if I'm
doing something really stupid so let's
see here cooking and medicine don't care
about that creativity is good I already
got that you know what I might stick
with this guy instead gasps Truffaut be
I don't even what that is this Duplin
has a deep seal distrust of the culinary
arts cannot perform I like that I'm
gonna keep that one instead
so it has creativity and learning which
is good and tinkering and so I'm gonna
go for athletics or construction here I
already got a person like that and they
look at nine athletics cooking immunity
slow learner that's fine they're gonna
be run on a treadmill the whole time and
what's the other thing digging I want
somebody can dig because a big part of
this game is digging and of course I
can't find him all right there's a
digging squeamish don't care all right
so there we go and the name of my colony
is little a leaky Acropolis and I'm
gonna say bark and there I am and
there's a whole bunch of basically what
you do this is a pod where all the these
are called duplicants where they all get
spawned and this is a ration box which
is just food for getting going and the
whole game and there's dirt there is
coal there is metal there's a surplus of
water obviously you can plant things and
do all kind of stuff so basically what
happens here is I'm gonna dig out an
area so we'll go dig and dig this out
stick out a bunch areas that
and 4x4 looks good to me so that's why
I'm doing 4x4 and I'm enough to figure
out what I'm gonna do here with this
water and it's digging away I write
something really crazy happened today I
don't know if you guys know this because
this song is ancient but when I run I
run because I sit in a desk all day and
I would my whole body would I atrophy if
I didn't run so basically I'm I can't
stand to run without any noise so I
listen to music all the time and I
thought to myself today you know a song
I haven't heard in a long time Johnny
Cash a boy named Sue which is an ancient
song I don't know if anybody even knows
what that is
and so I went and type that in and then
it started giving me all these ancient
country songs it was actually pretty
good I don't know if I'm mental if I'm
just getting old what's going on but
either way so uh why start talking about
that but it just came to my mind as I
was waiting for these guys the big all
right so as we're doing this you're
gonna add on things to your base so I'm
gonna say auctioning is important
obviously power is important I'm gonna
get a manual generator and I'm gonna put
it here and they'll build that whenever
they feel the need another thing we can
do is my job up here power I'm going to
shut it off and I'm going to say that I
want only gene who's like a really good
runner to be my runner
have I been working out I run that's all
I do I think that yeah somebody said
that they they heard the boy named Sue
and the best version came from a prison
concert I think that's what I listened
to today because there was people
yelling in the background yeah that's
good stuff I forget what else what was
the other thing I'm sort of getting
distracted here there were some great
songs I like you had had never heard
there was a dude named Marty Robbins he
some song about El Paso it was so good I
don't know just keep getting distracted
alright let's focus on the case sorry
about that
okay so we got a generator here and what
am I gonna do now so I'm gonna go and
I'm gonna probably these people are
gonna want to go to the bathroom so I'm
gonna have to be concerned about that
and we're sure I probably should keep
the bathroom sort of like away from
everything else so I'm gonna sort of dig
out this area and then I'm gonna dig out
like a little bit maybe down here I
don't know what this little dudes doing
here but oh there's another thing
there's this stuff called Aqsa light and
that's where you get your your oxygen
from in this game so anytime you have
access to oxalate at least that's why
I've been doing it I focus on getting to
the oxalate yo-you as you can see
there's oxalate right there so that's
cool so what's all this stuff it's coal
up here I only played it for a couple
minutes but basically there's all sorts
of different ways to generate power
which is really cool so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to put this here and
you can see here that the let's get rid
of that the oxygen is barely breathable
so that's not good so what we're gonna
need to do is figure out a way to get
more oxygen in here and right here this
oxygen is barely breathable this over
here very breathable so I'm gonna come
over and I'm gonna dig this area out
also so scared of that and then we'll
sort of steal the oxygen from over there
and bring it over here you can also
attack things you can harvest things you
could change priority like let's say I
want this dug out before I go over there
I can go priority like this and I can
change the priorities to now they're
going over there already but I could
change the priority here and it would
jump over there and ignore the previous
command which is also cool and yeah I
definitely got to get more oxygen into
this area let's see what else we got
here and you can say very breathable up
here and this is unbreathable I'm just
sort of move around you plant plants you
create stuff it's kind of I like it I
like the way it looks I think it's a fun
type of game
so Oh somebody says don't build your
bathroom and a lower contained area okay
that's exactly what I was gonna do so
thanks for that - oh there's more
oxalate I believe all right so I don't
know my air is not very breathable
well now it's breathable hmm so should I
move my I should probably since you said
that probably makes more sense well
youyou don't want to suffocate the
little guy whenever they have to go the
bathroom though so what do you do no I
don't have a Pascal tutorial who's
learning Pascal I can't believe any
teacher is teaching Pascal in this day
and age I can't believe that that's
crazy tell your teacher that there and
say okay so where should I put the
bathroom if I don't put the bathroom on
the lower I was gonna put it like over
here away from everything else so you're
telling me don't do that all right well
I won't put the bathroom I'll put the
bathroom here then I guess all right so
everybody needs a bathroom that's the
most important thing on earth and so we
will put some bathroom over here so is
that under plumbing yeah outhouse so we
have outhouses so somebody told me to
put the outhouse here and so that's what
I shall do and then I'm also going to
come in here and I'm going to build a
research station so that I can do
research obviously get rid of that and
I'm gonna have to power up all these
different guys so I'm gonna go from get
some wire and I'm gonna go from here -
you know what before I do that you can
also cancel things so let's go in here
and let's cancel that there see it's all
canceled I'm gonna put some tile floor
down because this tile floor is here for
a good reason so
let's see build some tile hmm
and people been asking me what my next
games are that I'm gonna make so I wrote
down I'm gonna do Zelda next which is
not gonna start tomorrow I'm drawing
tons of Zelda assets so I can't I just
can't do it that quick and because
Zelda's like nothing but assets you have
to D draw on assets so I'm drawing all
those
um after that I'm probably gonna do
field runner Kingdom rush clash royale
clash of clans Angry Birds and I don't
know if you guys want something just
tell me and I'll do it I'm getting to
the point where I've covered a lot of
really you know mechanics like I wanted
to so I'm pretty happy in general about
how things are going alright so and so
let's go and get this put this in here
oh they're falling asleep and I'm gonna
have to probably get them beds because
not good to sleep and up here we can
speed up time any other ones uh do a
fighting or shooting game yeah I was
gonna do like a doom a fighting game oh
yeah um Street Fighter all riled you
Street Fighter it's not good and I was
gonna do a magic game Magic the
Gathering card game there are Street
Fighter Street Fighter has been added to
the list Magic the Gathering which is a
card game what I'm trying to do is do a
little bit of all the different you know
control all the different game mechanics
and such so now they go into the
bathroom and hopefully the research
station opens up and then I can start
doing research and I think I'm gonna do
my research in the beginning is gonna be
unlike farming to get like food and
things I think that's a good way to go
so any other games you guys want to see
just tell me and I will make them
alright so I want to get away for them
to get over here and get this water and
there's water trapped down there also
and so I'm gonna get a ladder there's a
ladder and I'm just gonna like whoops
there is so now they'll have access to
water hopefully and eventually I'll
build them beds oh and there's a
research no research tasks so I'm gonna
come in here and what did I say I said I
wanted to do yeah I want to do farming I
think because this recycles carbon
dioxide yeah let's do that so that's
what I'm doing my research this game is
like so cool I mean I'd like me a game
like this um any other games you guys
want do a beam up like final fight or
shank alright that's a clay game
actually a shank town of Salem what's
town of Salem never heard of it
how about the indeed what do you mean by
D&amp;amp;D mean Zelda sorted D&amp;amp;D ish I mean you
know there's only one character but oh
no all right and they're doing their
research so I'm just gonna come out of
there and what else do I want to do um
well I'm gonna need I guess storage and
give me tips guys if I'm doing something
stupid just tell me I just say hey you
know something stupid cuz I'm just
guessing my way through the game I
figure I need some place to put stuff so
I'm getting storage that's the reason
why I'm doing it
town of Salem is pretty cool what is
town of Salem everyone heard of it
there's a game coming out which is like
a Zelda clone it's called swords of dead
oh it's coming out in 2018 it looks
awesome
towns of Salem's that was called town of
Salem of Salem game all right I'm
looking it up what's it look like blank
media games well he got all right I'll
check it out looks interesting anything
else
yeah Dungeons and Dragons I know I made
a game I made a dungeon and Dragons
um Oh SimCity that's a good idea right I
can't believe I forgot SimCity
alright SimCity hmm oh my ear starting
to get contaminated yeah I'm gonna try
and get that compost thing where is it I
don't believe I have it yet let's see
here oxygen oh there's algae dioxin do
whatever it converts algae into oxygen
maybe I'll make one of those
that doesn't make any sense okay so I'm
gonna put that like I guess I should put
it over here closer to the bathroom so
there that goes and then I'm gonna zoom
in I'm gonna get some wiring it down
there
I'm gonna watch Twin Peaks tonight don't
ruin it the new one I finally I decided
I was gonna get it what else don't want
to talking about oh I'm starting up
maker Monday again a lot of people
probably gonna get angry because I'm
gonna cover some really crazy weird
stuff so Monday a new maker Monday video
I've been wanting to do that for a while
dress up the old channel rollercoaster
type in I'll write it down
rollercoaster tycoon so that's a fun
game you just sort of just let it go
what else do we want to do here um it's
just done with a research yet basic
forming four out of 20 nope
I wish I had another duplicate we could
come in and also maybe focus in on
making their beds Grand Theft Auto I
think's a little bit too much no all you
need to know is the basics of c-sharp to
understand my game tutorials
so I'm gonna make them beds and I'm
gonna put it a little bit higher up in
the air and then I'm also going to get a
ladder and I will build a bed area up
inside of here
see that's probably high enough I just
don't want to destroy the Aqsa light
obviously okay so that's working
hopefully the air is getting better it
says breathable so that's good and then
this dudes picking that off one thing
about this I think this games fun and it
looks awesome like all clay games do I
just wish that there you'd get more
duplicates so that you could be building
things quicker and quicker and quicker
there's food there's a ration box and a
microbe musher and colony requires a
food source so when we make a microbe
musher get that and let's put that right
here and this is making 400 watts of
power and I'm using up 120 180 so 200
and this uses how much I don't know how
much it uses I guess I won't find out
until I use it there's a microbe musher
when am I going to visit Detroit
Cleveland or Atlanta again I've never
been to any of those places except
Cleveland I don't know why while you're
asking me that
then I like Cleveland I never been to
Detroit or Atlanta though yes if I make
clash Royale I will make it a network
type game I think I don't know it I
think what I'll probably end up doing is
showing how to set it up getting it to
work and then shutting down the network
because I I'm not gonna try to I'm not
gonna try to you know host something
like that
that's just not something I want to do
so I'll set it up but I'm not going to
make you know a full-scale game that's
gonna like run for forever at least at
this moment I'm not maybe I'll change my
mind I don't know all right so I got my
microbe ma sure let's see what that
thing does yeah give me some wire and
that uses 240 watts so I'm running out
of oh no I should still be good just
good just good enough okay cool
and then I guess I need to make another
one of these generators or should I go
there's power yeah I don't have a
where's my power generator anything here
maybe I don't have that mmm I swear I
saw that I had the ability to make a
coal powered plant but maybe I do not
doesn't look like it there's a washbasin
a med bed it's another station and you
can dress things up because these guys
get like depressed if things aren't
pretty so you can put plants down all
kind of stuff like that that's cool
stuff
I like Cleveland I'm from Pittsburgh
though so you know Pittsburgh very much
like Cleveland ghosts and goblins yes
I'm aware it goes to goblins I'll look
at it and see if it's something I want
to make ghosts and goblins it's a game
mm-hmm any guesses on what I'm gonna do
for Maker Monday well let's fast-forward
through this get these guys away and
this is complaining no fabrications
queued I don't do that what do I do with
it no fabrication oh okay let's I guess
I'll make a mush bar and I'm
continuously make them is it getting
enough power I don't think it is
insufficient resources oh I need dirt
and water well I know I got water up he
has to go the bathroom so we're dirt at
there's sand sandstone hey there's dirt
right there so let's dig out some dirt
and is it dirt up here amen that's algae
sandstone this is dirt this is coal
hmm and if I can reach this area up here
let's just see if I can reach it yeah
that's gonna dig up there
nope
I'm not cooking on maker Monday I I
doubt there is anybody that could figure
out what I'm gonna do all that I can
tell you is a bunch of people probably
not gonna like it
it's something I've never done before
it's something that I taught myself how
to do two days ago and I'm gonna do a
video on it just because I felt like
doing that Oh was he on the bathroom
again
it's dude consoling in the bathroom
what's this thing oops storage not
assigned okay I'm gonna say All Hands is
there anything I don't want wrong that
looks fun
raw metal I can't imagine that being bad
here's organic polluted dirt I'm gonna
shut that off and say I don't want
polluted dirt filtration medium sand
that's fine um the rest of it all looks
fine okay so I got that set and I'm
gonna say that I don't want dirt that is
polluted inside of here plate oh no um I
need to place a liquid bottler in the
water to collect it thank you
so I like doing these okay so I need a
liquid bottle er where is the water at
this oxygen power food plumbing liquid
bottle er pumps liquid into bottles for
transport so can i oh look at that that
is cool all right I'll just can I just
put it here
neat oh I wanted to make a bed for these
guys I don't know what's most important
it says insufficient oxygen generation
colony requires wash basins it's not
complaining about them not needing sleep
so hmm
can I do some close-up shots on a game
yeah see there you go see it looks
awesome I mean I love this game I think
it cost 20 bucks so it's beautiful I
love the way they they do all their
games don't starve and say I mean looks
it looks as like a Tim burton-esque type
of look to it and it's pretty cool
looking game I love it
alright so I got that set up so let's go
in here and let's start digging out an
area for them to sleep and I'm gonna say
that I want it to be for high I don't
know why I just that's an arbitrary
thing I've just picked I have no idea if
that's right if that's a good idea or
not and I'm not gonna go in here because
this is like contaminated see carbon
dioxide unbreathable I'm not gonna go in
there and then I'll put some beds up
here for the nope I'm not doing a
playdough thing on Maker Monday the last
time I did a maker Monday I did 3d
printing and I'm not doing that it's
gonna be something I've never done a
tutorial on yet and I need a way to
generate more energy oh this thing's
complaining what's this there's a
planter box and here is an algae
terrarium so let's go it gains a minor
efficiency boost so let's go and do an
algae terrarium because it keeps
complaining that I don't have enough
that I don't have enough oxygen
generation so I'm going to put that
there
what is it
hmmm alright and let's go and throw down
some more tile I think I want to do the
tile thing only because I think it makes
them happier if I if I do that and then
I want to dig out more up here and then
make them beds did I get anything else
in regards to the halation doesn't work
space heater I don't I don't think
they're cold just keeps complaining
about not generating enough oxygen so I
guess I'll just go and make some more of
these things because I I don't have
enough power generation from just that
wheel it doesn't generate enough it's
not stinks
well let's undo that let's cancel that
now maybe it's fun yeah I guess it is
fun
um somebody asked a question about
trying to solve project Euler problems
um I have my learned program series so
maybe you'll like that I mean it's all
about learning how to solve problems you
just get better at it the more you do
I mean it's there's really no secret to
it I mean it's just the more you solve
problems the better you get at it
so up new duplicate available awesome
and I'm gonna choose a duplicate I'm
gonna specifically look for somebody
that can move that can run so I want to
get athletics one oh I'm forced to pick
who they tell me to well that's not good
well this guy's very well rounded hmm
but this girl is strong who would be the
best runner hmm I'm just gonna pick her
frankly and then I'm gonna get another
one of these wheels and then throw her
on the wheel man yo generator plate
right here and then wire it up great and
then I'm gonna go into jobs and make
sure ah see I thought she because she
was strong she'd be good at that but I
guess not so we're just gonna put her
there anyway either way yes I moved to
the left because there was too many
things going on on the right side so
build a battery okay under how much they
store here I'll build multiple batteries
there three batteries and in wire ma I
don't know if I have enough power
generation no well food shortage I got
my micro ma sure what's it complaining
about why is it not working it says it
needs more dirt hmm I'm not sure how to
force this to work oh it says no power I
think that came up there just because of
that other thing
I don't have any specific preference for
I guess I like vim better than Emacs but
now I'm not somebody that you know
argues about that stuff I think that
stuff silly when people arguing whoops
Potter Windows or Mac or what's better
you know this programming language or
this one I got better things to do than
argue about stuff like that so all right
so I have to figure out a way to get Oh
see I was gonna make another one of
those power plants and then I was
distracted so I'm gonna make another one
of those generators I didn't make one
right no I didn't make another one and
then I have to run some more power to it
whoops power and I'm gonna shut off the
power from this
so let's kill that whoops let's
deconstruct that
how do I do it or maybe I can I don't
know I just did that I'm trying to
disconnect the wiring did I do it no I
just destroyed the tile I think which is
fun I have a feedback loop there for the
electronic whoops I put something there
I don't want there let's cancel that ah
and then let's do my tile again and then
let's run wires from this to that I'm
just playing around this is just me
goofing around having a fun time with
this stuff maybe give you an idea what
the games like it's in beta so it's not
it's not finished they keep it but clay
has a way with that they just constantly
are trying to improve their their work
so which I think it's cool alright so
let's go and furniture can I make beds
yes I can alright so I need four beds
alright what's this gigantic block of
sand here that's not nice all right so
let's well let's just go like this
one two three and four there you go now
they got someplace to sleep and what
else do I got here oxygen
refinement Oh compost this is going to
make the outhouses it's more breathable
you know generate oxygen generating so
I'm playing this on on a Mac but it
looks identical on Windows I tried it on
both it's exactly the same I made a mess
huh what happened I don't know it made a
mess these duplicates could not find a
toilet in time well there's two toilets
how's that possible I'm not going to
worry about that here's a few food
shortage I have no idea how to get this
to work it's saying that it wants dirt
and water and it will not make it
hmmm confused I have water over here and
supposedly a way to get it you're trying
to tell me I don't have dirt I mean
here's dirt right here this is
unreachable that's dirt right yeah so
let's go in here and let's dig this from
up above let's see if that works I
should be able to reach it what thing I
just don't want to go in here because
this is like all contaminated
somebody told me to dig that up so I dug
it up and anybody know how you make the
make them start putting food in the air
putting dirt and water into the microbe
musher I just started playing this game
literally for this live stream so I'm I
don't know everything by any stretch of
the imagination
it says unreachable food so there's food
here I just can't get to it maybe it is
Bristol briar mmm what's this
buried muck root and meal wood and
bristle wasn't it why is the water not
reachable it's right there hmm confused
by that somebody's saying I can't get
the water to water there so how can they
not get it or do I have to run a pipe to
this I didn't think I did it just says a
waiting material delivery so it's not
saying that it that the water needs to
be I figured that the the people would
make the you know the
there's a wall in the oh oh oh I see
sorry about that
all right so he was he has the dirt and
he's stuck there because of this that's
what you're saying he's probably gonna
go to the bathroom on the floor too if I
don't get that sand out of the way
hmm okay so I got that set and it's no
power because I'm gonna go and my
batteries are full so let's go and run
some power over to that wire and let's
run it just down here and then up to the
micro musher and let's see if they can
get to it don't know
hmm okay so here we get rid of this also
alright get rid of that everybody's
starving so now hopefully I am going to
be able to get oh look it's working
yep thank you person in the Jason in the
comments they just told me I got water
hopefully they're taking the water where
is it taking the water - oh he's
delivering the water to that so can I
set a priority difference on this
supposedly things are starving you would
think they would that they would try to
go and have it make some more food why
did it work
there it is put the water in the
mikromasch er come on there it goes
awesome okay so I think it's working now
saying it doesn't have any power let's
go see should have power I have these
batteries I have everything here there's
tons of power going to it why is it not
getting power ah it's working
okay so finally the microbe musher is
working and let's go is there anything
else I can research what looks good to
research so I have power regulation I
don't think I care about any of this
sanitation probably Mainers a lot so I'm
gonna try liquid piping that's fun game
I'm kind of enjoying it I don't know
what you guys think yes I make tons of
games there's my channel I don't know
how many games I've made so far made a
bunch of all pretty complicated the lot
the pac-man I just made is a rather
complex game
so either way I think I'm gonna I think
you guys get the gist of how this game
works and I talked about just about
everything I wanted and you guys gave me
some great ideas on some new games I can
put on my channel so I think I'm gonna
call it a night I've been playing here
for about 40 minutes so in general I
think it's just an awesome game but you
know it's up to you guys
ghosts and goblins it's on the list so
thank you Miguel for the tip and I have
algorithm tutorials on my channel it's
called data structures and algorithms so
I think I'm gonna call it quits guys
after I quit the stream I always hang
around the comment section if there's
anything you guys want to ask me or
there's anything else you'd like to
bring up but I think this is a fantastic
game and I enjoyed playing it and I'm
gonna play it here after I quit the
stream but I think I'm going to call it
quits here for the night and like always
please leave your questions and comments
down below and yes I do do that
sometimes
whatever I'm recording tutorials either
