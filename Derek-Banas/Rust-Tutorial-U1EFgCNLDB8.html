rust video tutorial in this tutorial I'm
going to provide an introduction to the
course in tax of the rust language
because I've received numerous questions
about it now unlike my normal learn in
one videos instead I'm going to focus in
on the specifics of the language so that
you have a really good understanding of
how it works and also I'm going to cover
a lot of the things that confuse
beginners so that then you can then move
on to books on other resources online
that you may find now while you link to
all of the code as well as a transcript
from this video is available in the
description underneath the video and
what I'm going to focus in here on is
I'm going to talk about input output
variables math conditionals looping
strings arrays vectors tuples functions
closures pointers structs traits in ohms
and a whole bunch more and I have a lot
to do so let's get into it okay so if
you are on Windows what you're going to
do is go to rust - Lang org and click on
downloads and if you have a good new C++
compiler on your computer you're going
to use this version and if you have a
Microsoft Visual C version of C++ you're
going to use that version and basically
just click on that click Next all a
bunch of times and there you go you're
ready to use rust on your computer and
everything else in this tutorial is
going to work on Macs as well as on
Linux and also Windows machines now if
you are on a Mac or Linux based machine
you're going to install rust more than
likely like this you're just going to
copy and paste this line of text
directly inside of your terminal and
then hit enter and that is going to
install rust for you and of course like
I said I have this in the description so
you can just copy and paste to make sure
you get that installed properly and I'm
going to be using the atom text editor
here to edit it's free and it's exactly
the same on every operating system so
that's why I'm using it and I want to
show you how you can come in here and
install a package it's going to make it
easy for you to use rust you're just
going to go packages command palette and
toggle install inside of here and you're
going to click on install packages and
themes and then inside of this guy
you're going to type in atom -
language - rust and hit enter and you're
going to see that atom language Russia
shows up here and there's going to be a
little install button just click on that
and it will be installed and then you'll
be able to easily program rust
applications inside of atom alright so
now that we have that set up let's start
writing some code now the very first
thing that I'm going to do is come in
here and install a module that's going
to allow me to show you more about
datatypes and how they work inside of
rust and you can see all the different
data types that are available to us I'm
just going to put a semicolon here in
the end and I'm going to soft rap that
so you can see all the code there on the
screen at one time I'm also going to
install another module that's going to
allow us to receive input from our users
and that's just standard in now the main
function is going to be the main
function that executes whenever you
execute your program and how you create
that is just go F N and main and that's
how you create all functions inside of
rust and then we're going to come in
here and just do a simple hello world
type of example because we have to
always do that and save that and then
you're going to come over here and
you're going to compile and I like to
get rid of all the warnings because if
you don't do this you're going to get
warnings for every single thing and
that's not going to work
so how you compile just go rusty and the
name of your rust application with RS
for the extension and a and warnings and
then after that's compiled you can run
the application and you can see that
HelloWorld printed out there on your
screen we're going to use let to define
all of our variables and the data type
will be guessed if you do not provide it
and it's very important to know that
variable values by default are a mutable
inside of rust which means that those
values can't be changed once they're set
so let's just go and create one and have
the rust compiler go and automatically
figure out what type of data type that
is that's just basic integer you could
of course come in here and not only make
a variable that is mutable which means
that the value can change but you can
also come in and define the datatype for
that value or for that variable and I
showed you before all the different
primitive data types that you have
inside of rust there's just the list
these are integers 8-bit 16-bit 32
- this is going to be an integer based
off the buffer size on your computer
this is going to be unsigned this is
going to be a flirty two-bit float which
just means a number with a decimal place
and we'll be using all of those as this
continues and just so you know what
sizes you can keep in all these
different data types I'm going to come
in here and go print line and if we want
to get to the maximum number we can
store in an 8-bit integer we just go
like this with max at the end and this
value is going to be transposed right
here between these two curly brackets if
we compile and execute that you can see
those numbers are quite large so let's
zoom out here max 8-bit integer and
that's 127 negative 128 is the minimum
and you can see so forth and so on how
big these numbers get inside of rust so
that's just a basic idea of the types
and how large those different data types
can be inside of rust we're also not
only going to be able to use those
different data types we're also going to
be able to use boolean so we can do
something like is it true and say that
we want this to be a boolean and we can
either store true or false inside of
bullying's of course we're also going to
be able to store individual characters
so let's say I want to distort the
letter X inside of here I can define
that's a character and that is going to
have the value of X of course and like I
said before we're able to place
variables inside of our output just like
you saw previously by just going I am
and throw curly brackets inside of there
years old and then right here we're
going to be able to go age and get that
value right there and there you can see
hello world kmac and I am 40 years old
and with age transpose directly inside
of the output another thing that's
important to know is we'll actually be
able to set the values for multiple
different values or variables inside of
rust and also the variable names are
going to start with letters and they're
going to be able to contain letters and
underscores and normally these variables
are going to be separated with an
underscore that's common practice you'll
actually get an error
do that and I can come in here and
assign two variable values just like
that there's a brief overview of
variables we'll be doing more with them
now I want to focus in on some other
ways you can output your data now you're
going to be able to place multiple
different pieces of information and in
different ways inside of rust so let's
come in here and do something like it is
curly brackets throw a zero inside of
there that curly bracket skin is and
throw that zero there and it will throw
is it true inside of there and let X and
we'll go and get those valuables and
throw variables and throw those back in
there and then we're going to be able to
run that you're going to see right here
it is true and it got to that true value
from this guy right here and then it
also used true right there so we're able
to use indexes to load the different
data over and over again for our output
we're also going to be able to output or
change our output in multiple different
ways so let's come in here and let's say
that we want only two decimal places to
show up for data that we want output on
our screen we could do one point two
three four and provide three and just
get to an exchange let's go into a
couple other different things here we're
also going to be able to output binary
hexadecimal and float information just
go binary and : B is going to get our
binary data output and hexadecimal is
going to if we throw a lowercase X it's
going to provide lowercase X in decimal
numbers and then octal as well or base
eight and we'll just do lowercase there
and we'll get the value for 10 in these
different number bases and there you can
see exactly how those all print out
right there of course the other ways we
can edit or format or output we're also
going to be able to use named arguments
as well as defined whitespace with our
data
so let's come in here and inside the
curly brackets of course we can put a
named argument inside of here and then
we can define how much white space we
want to put inside of there and then
outside of here define our named
arguments with our white space and also
we'd be able to pad our output with
zeros if we'd like again I'm just going
to use the same name door
that i used previously except i'm going
to say i want to pad with zeros this
time if we check our output you can see
right there how the whitespace was put
previous to this in here you can see
where these zeros were transposed inside
of there instead so there are some in
ways that we can mess around with our
data now let's look at some different
math functions that are available to us
inside of rust now we're going to have
all the basic mathematical functions
that you're used to so we'll be able to
of course to do addition inside of here
and then we just go 5 + 4 outside of
that likewise we be able to do
subtraction multiplication division as
well as modulus which is going to give
us the remainder of a division and there
you can see are all these answers to
those basic mathematical functions that
we have let's come in here and define
another this is going to be immutable
variable and let's make it negative for
now you can define these data types in a
couple different ways let's just make
this negative 4 and say it's going to be
a 32 bit int like that we could then of
course come in here and output that
information let's say we wanted to get
the absolute value of negative 4 we
could then put in our variable inside of
there and then get the absolute value by
finishing the variable with the actual
function name and you can see right
there how that works we could also come
in and define the variable just like
this and the data type along with it and
you can see right here we can get 4 ^ 6
we can calculate the square root we can
calculate the cube root round is going
to round the value depending upon if
this is a 5 or a 4 so if it's a 5 it's
going to round up if it's anything less
than a 5 is going to round down floor is
going to always round down ceiling is
always going to round up we can get e to
the power of whatever we put inside of
our exponent we can get our natural log
our base 10 log we can convert to
radians with 2 radians or 2 degrees with
2 degrees and here we can get whichever
value is the maximum value by just first
putting in a value or a variable name
followed by Max and the value in a
compare to it and we can do the same
thing with min and you can see the
output from all of those other different
calculations so there's a whole host of
different mathematical functions we have
inside of rust and there
more of course that I won't even cover
here but of course we're going to be
able to also come in here and get the
sign if you'd like to do that so you do
sign and 3.14 is equal to you put 1/4
and this is a floating 64-bit number and
to get the sign for that
just go in there and do that we'd be
able to equally also get the cosine
tangent arc sine or cosine or tangent
and so forth and so on
so as you can see a whole host of
different mathematical functions inside
of rust and now I want to take a quick
look at conditionals now our different
conditionals are going to be well aware
to you they're going to have not equal
to equal to greater than less than
greater than or equal to as well as less
than or equal to and our logical
operators are going to be and or and not
and I'm going to show you how all those
work here so let's go and create a
variable first and let's just call this
age old is equal to 6 and we can use our
if statements here to say age old and if
it is equal to 5 in that situation we
are going to output some information on
the screen that is going to say go to
kindergarten else if is quite simple
we're just going to use else if nothing
funky here like in other languages and
here we'll compare a couple different
values using a logical operator so we'll
say age old is greater than 5 and then
we'll throw and inside of here of course
both of these conditions are going to
have to be true for this to come back
it's true
so we'll say less than or equal to 18
and in this situation we're going to
perform a little bit of math so we'll
say go to and change this to grade and
then follow that up with that and then
we can come in and go age old minus 5
and that's going to get us whatever the
grade the person should go to and we can
also come in here
and go age-old and do another one we'll
say something like less than or equal to
25 and I'm just using this as an example
of course not saying somebody couldn't
go to school if they were in a different
age group obviously and then we could
say go to college and then finally of
course we're going to be able to say
else and here we'll just say do what you
want and you can see go to grade one
pops back now let's demonstrate some of
the other different options we have for
conditions let's use the not operator
and that is just going to convert all of
our trues two falses and all our falses
two trues and just go like this and true
also let's demonstrate the or operator
and this is just going to say true false
and if one of them is going to be true
then it's going to give a result of true
and we can just perform that operation
outside of here and then finally let's
come in and do the not equals to true
not equal to false and likewise we can
say true not equal to false to get that
output
oops had a little error there make sure
that you put in your curly brackets
inside of here otherwise it's not going
to know what to put inside of there or
what the point of that is and there you
can see all the results of that now
there's no built in ternary operator
which you can kind of make one so let's
say one to do something like can vote
and we want to assign a different value
depending upon a condition so we could
say something like age old and if age
old is greater than or equal to 18 then
we want to assign a value of true to the
variable can vote and we can do it just
like that else if it comes back as false
we're going to assign a value of false
to it and of course we're going to be
able to come in there and output this
information and throw can vote inside of
there and of course don't forget to put
your little equal sign in there and if
we execute that you can see it comes
back its value of false it's like I said
a little rough overview of some
conditionals and how we can use them
inside of russ now let's take a look at
some brief examples on looping
let's define a mutable value and that's
going to be X and first I'm going to
show you how loop works basically loop
doesn't have any conditions you're going
to have to put a condition to jump out
of it what I want to do here is I want
to print out all even numbers so I'm
going to use an if statement here once
again I'm going to say if X modulus two
comes back as being equal to zero which
means that it would be a even number
well then I want to come in and print
that information on our screen let's
just keep it simple do that and there's
X and it has to be mutable because we're
going to be changing the value of x of
course because in one way you can sort
of a shortcut way you can increment the
value of x is to do that right there and
then if I would no longer want to check
anything I can hit o continue and what
this is going to do is obviously
increment X because I did it right there
and then this is going to jump and skip
everything that follows after here and
jump back to the top of the loop and
check the value again now how are we
going to check these values well first
we checked if it was even or not now
what we're going to do is figure out how
we're going to jump out of this loop all
together and I'm going to say if X at
some point is greater than 10 well I
want to jump completely out of the loop
and break is going to do that for us
and otherwise we're going to come down
here and we're going to increment the
value of X also you can decrement the
values in exactly the same way and we
can go and do a continue once again and
if we run that you can see we print it
out only the even numbers right there
we're also going to have while loops
let's go and create another one here and
let's just call this Y is equal to 1 and
while loops are going to work in a
similar fashion except you're going to
put the condition directly right after Y
so I'm going to say while I or Y is less
than or equal to 10 I want to continue
looping here and I'll just keep this
simple and for that there throw your Y
right there and then of course you're
going to have to increment your value as
you cycle through this and there you can
see it printed out 1 through 10 and then
the final looping structure we have here
there's a couple other different ways to
loop with 4 but this is a basic way what
we're going to do here is work with a
range so it's going to be 1 through 10
and just keep the
real simple I'm just going to come in
here do this and we'll throw four inside
of there just so you can see how that's
different throws the inside of there and
there you can see all the loops then how
it worked with the for loop and how we
are going to be able to run through that
so we'll be doing more with looping as
the tutorial continues but there is a
brief overview of the different options
you have available to you and now I'm
going to take a closer look at strings
so we can come in here and define a
string and we'll just have this B I am a
random string now we're going to be able
to get our string length length and
we'll just throw that in there and we'll
go random string and follow that up with
le N and I'll put that information we're
also going to be able to split a string
in half based off of a defined index so
here's where we're going to be assigning
multiple values at once
so we'll say first and second and then
we'll go random string and then we'll
say that we want to split at a specific
index which is going to be six and then
we'll be able to output that information
so we'll just say something like first
and then second and then first and
second inside of here and there you can
see how those split out and exactly how
they're lining up the reason that extra
space is inside of there is because the
extra space is inside of the string
itself we're also going to be able to
create an iterator for our string so
let's go and call this count is equal to
random string characters and count those
characters no go and create a mutable
characters is going to be equal to
random string characters and then go
create another mutable to get our
individual characters and how we're
going to get each individual character
is by saying next each time so we want
to call next every time we want to get
into the next character we're going to
use a loop here then we're going to use
something called match which is very
similar to switch inside of other
languages and basically what we're going
to do here is this is going to return
either some followed with an actual
value and if it does that what we're
going to do is we're going to say that
we want to
print out those individual characters
just sign that 2x and otherwise it is
going to return none which means that we
no longer have any additional
information to output on our screen and
after this what we'll do is just go
individual character and call for the
next character we're going to continue
cycling through characters as long as we
have characters to display whoops and we
want to change this to characters and
then characters to this as well and run
that and you'll see that it outputs all
the individual characters as well as all
the whitespace involved we're also going
to be able to split this information
based off of whitespace so let's go and
create another iterator and we'll go
random string and to split it whitespace
we go split whitespace we'll go and
create another mutable which is going to
be each individual word that we want and
then we'll go iterate next and again we
will create a looping structure here to
cycle through this we're going to use
match again so this is going to allow us
to cycle through this information once
again Psalm with the individual word
that we're going to be using here is
going to be returned and then we can say
that we want to output that on the
screen or it's going to return none
which means that we don't have any more
words to work with and let's throw a
column inside of there and then under
wise we're going to go individual word
and say that we want the next word and
throw that outside of that match block
oops and change this to whitespace sorry
about that and run it and now you can
see it outputted all the individual
words we're also going to be able to
iterate over lines of a string so let's
go and create one here just call this
random string 2 and here what we're
going to do is we are going to be
outputting the lines and we're going to
separate those using a new line so let's
go beautiful lines is equal to this is
going to be random string 2 and it will
call lines to get those individual lines
of text and to get our individual line
just go like this
and again we're going to do the same
thing lines next and then we're going to
loop through those lines of text and
then output them and we're going to use
match again
just like we did previously so
individual line this time and just like
we did previously Psalm is going to
return a match for us and here we can
output those individual matches
otherwise it's going to return none if
there's no additional information to
output on our screen and if that happens
we want to break out of it and of course
we're going to continue checking for
additional lines outside of the match
but inside of the loop and there you can
see that we printed out those individual
lines based off of the new line we're
also going to be able to come in here
and find a string inside of a string so
let's just do something simple here and
let's say we want to find the word best
inside of here we'll just go random
string too and we'll ask it if it
contains the word best and you can see
that that comes back is true and that is
a basic overview of some ways we can
work with strings of course we're going
to be covering them more and further
examples but now I want to show you a
little bit more advanced application
where we're going to receive input from
the user manipulate it and then provide
different information depending upon a
number guessing game which we're going
to create so we're going to do a couple
things here we are first going to name
our loop so that we will be able to jump
out of it and I'm going to call this
outer and this is going to be a looping
structure and it's going to start off by
defining a number that is going to be
the number that we want them to guess
and that's just going to be 10 I'm then
going to ask them to pick a number and
then we're going to have another loop
inside of here and we're going to create
a string and we can get a string new we
then want to pass a reference to where
we want to store our string whatever it
is input on our keyboard and this guy up
here this is the input module we're
using here standard in and this is just
going to call that specific function for
us and we're going to read that input
that they have here and this is going to
be a reference to set input that's what
the little + sign there means it's going
to be a reference and we're going to get
more into that as we continue now let's
do something a little bit more complex
let's go and define our
we're going to say option and this is a
32-bit integer and an option value is
either going to return some with a value
like you saw previously with match or
none we're going to say input and okay
and this means that the reader is at the
end of the line of input that's what
it's going to check for we're then going
to follow that up with map or which is
going to apply a default value or apply
functions to a value so we're going to
say none here or what we're going to do
is come in and trim off the new line
that was put inside of here and then
we're going to call a parse which is
going to convert this string to a 32-bit
integer for us and then there is okay
again whoops make sure you put the okay
on the outside of that and then after we
have converted that into something we
can use we can go all match and guess
and this is where the option part comes
inside of here we're going to be able to
say if they don't have any information
well we want to print a little warning
that says enter a number if they however
did enter some information we want to
verify if it was matching our number
that we wanted we'll say if n is equal
to the number we define that's the ten
well in that situation we want to do a
couple different things we want to print
out that they guessed the proper number
and then after that we want to break
completely out of our loop which is
going to be our outer loop which we
defined above remember we put outer here
with that loop so we're going to jump
completely out of the looping structure
and then let's cover some other
potential issues so let's say that
entered a number but that number is
going to be less than the number that we
expected them to enter for us so I'm
going to say print line and we're going
to tell them something like the number
they entered was too low otherwise let's
go and throw another one in here this is
going to be too high so if number is
greater than the number that we have
here we're going to say too high and
then finally we can handle any type of
an error underscore and that guy right
there comes from this guy right there
and that's going to in that situation
we're going to say an error occurred
oops and an error pop back and we're
going to get rid of that by getting rid
of that semicolon and putting in a
regular comma and also up here we want
to make sure we put two colons inside of
there instead of just one and for a
print line we want to come in here and
put in our exclamation point sorry about
that and execute we put one inside of
there two three 100 if we type in just
enter nothing it's going to say enter a
number and if we type in 10 it's going
to say you guessed it and jump
completely out of the code there is a
little bit more of an advanced
explanation of how to use rust now I'm
going to jump over and provide some
examples on how we can use arrays now an
array is just going to be a fixed size
list in which everything in the list is
going to be of the same data type and we
can just throw some items inside of
there and we can get the array by our
index just going random array like this
and let's say we want the first item
this is a zero-based array that's going
to put that on the screen for us we're
also going to be able to get that our
array length just like we did previously
just by coming in here and going le N
and also let's show you how to get a
slice of an array so for example let's
say we wanted to get the second two
items in our array just go second two if
we want to output an array we're going
to have to use this little guy right
here that colon with a question mark and
that's used for debugging this
information and here we are going to get
a reference to our array and then define
a range we want so we went to the second
two so we're going to say we're going to
start at index 1 and then go up to 3 if
we execute that you can see right here
that one is going to come back because
we said we want the zero index and
there's one length there's
elements and then right here we were
able to get two and three by saying that
we wanted the second two items inside of
our Ray so that's just the basics of
arrays and I leave it to you to go and
check out the different functions that
are available with arrays inside of rust
there are a bunch of them but I also
want to focus in here now on vectors now
unlike arrays a vector is going to be
able to grow in size so Co and create a
vector here how we define them is go
back like that and just like that just
similar to arrays anyway and let's go
and get the index so let's say we want
something like item two from our vector
this of course is going to change to
vector one and the one the second item
while we'll just put in one inside of
there we're also going to be able to
iterate through arrays with four loops
so we can say for I in and we're going
to use a reference to our array we're
going to get more into how these
references are used and why they're used
just know that we're going to use those
when we are not using primitive values
and primitive values are all these guys
up here let's go and create this and
let's go and output vector
: and I is going to get all those
individual values we don't need to do
anything else with it and we're also
going to be able to push items onto our
array push items onto the end of our
rack just by saying push and 6 and then
we're going to be able to pop items off
of our array or delete them from the end
just by going to pop and let's get rid
of this stray quote we have right there
and run that and you can see exactly how
we're able to work with and cycle
through vectors alright so there's a
brief overview of vectors now let's take
a look at tuples basically tuples are
fixed sized lists of many different
types and instead of indexes they are
going to use keys and you've probably
seen them in other languages so I'll say
random tuple and we'll say Derrick and
40 you could also come in and define the
data types that you want to use for your
tuple let's go and create a new one
tuple two and we're going to put a colon
inside of there we're going to say that
we want to use a string here again it's
not a primitive so we have to put that
reference inside of there and then let's
just throw the same information inside
of here just keep this nice and simple
we're going to be able to get the value
from the index so let's just go print
line and we'll say name is what we're
looking for here and this is going to be
random to pull to and then if we want to
get the zero index for that we can go
point zero and there's our output so
again once again brief brief brief
overview of tuples much more to find out
just one to provide you with basic
information so now we're going to do
something a little bit more complicated
we're going to start creating some
functions here you're going to create
your functions down here outside of the
main function so I'm going to create a
function again I'm going to use FN and
this guy right here is just going to be
say hello it is going to receive an
attribute of name and you're going to
have to define what type of attribute
that's going to be it's going to be a
string again it's not a primitive so
we're going to use a reference here and
this guy is just going to print out
hello followed by whatever name you
passed inside of here so we'll just
throw a name inside of there and then we
can call that just by saying say hello
inside of the main function and then
we'll throw Derrick inside there and
when we execute hello Derrick pops back
so let's do something a little bit more
complicated let's say that we want to
receive two values and return one value
what are going to add these values so
we'll call this get some and we're going
to get number one again we have to
define what it is 32 bit int and num2
and this is going to be a 32 bit int as
well going to then define what value
you're going to be returning which is
going to be a 32-bit integer and if you
do not put a semicolon at the end of
your function this is going to be the
value that you automatically return so
you don't always need to use return but
you can use return as you'll see here in
a moment and then we'll be able to come
in
and perform this addition so let's say
five plus four is equal to and we can
call our function upside here so we'll
say get some and it will pass in five
and four as the attributes and run it
and you can see that that works other
things kind of neat is we can create
what's called a binding to a function so
we can say we want to define a variable
called sum and then bind it to the get
sum function and then call this and
execute it in much the same way so we'll
say six plus four is equal to and then
use sum instead of the actual function
name and with closures you're going to
see here in a moment that we're going to
be able to do a similar thing with a
whole bunch more and also pass those
functions inside of other functions and
here you can see is the result of that
and since we're talking about closures
why don't we go take a look at closures
now closure is going to represent blocks
of code and they're going to be able to
accept parameters and Pat and also be
able to be passed into functions just
like any other variable so let's create
one we'll say call this some nums and
then what you're going to do here is
define a parameter that's going to be
passed inside of it and you're going to
have the datatype so we'll say x and y
both of them are going to need to be
32-bit integers and then we're going to
define exactly what we're going to do
with those two values as they're passed
in we're then going to be able to come
in and let's say seven plus eight is
equal to and then we can do some nums
and pass in seven and eight and that's
going to perform that calculation for us
as you can see right there do something
a little bit more complicated
another thing that's kind of neat is
we're going to be able to access
variables that are outside of the
closures you can try doing this with
functions and see that you're not able
to do that but with closures you can so
let's go and create a ten variable here
and then create a closure that is going
to receive a value of x 32-bit integer
it's just going to add whatever value is
passed inside of there to num ten which
is the variable that lies outside of the
closure and then we'll be
come in and say 5 plus 10 is equal to
and then call our closure right here so
add 10 and pass 5 inside of there and if
we run it you can see that that indeed
works as well so a basic overview of
closures now I'm going to talk more
about ownership as well as pointers and
why we have to use references so
basically there's only going to be one
binding for each resource that we have
and when I say resource I'm talking
about anything it's not a primitive
value or a primitive variable inside of
rust and what that means is if you
assign data to another variable the
original can no longer access that data
so let me show you an example of what
I'm talking about so let's create a non
primitive let's create a vector and
vector one two and three and then let's
go and create another effect and let's
assign the value of vector one to that
now what I want to do is I want to print
out the value here and see what happens
so we'll go print line and I'm going to
say specifically that I want to get the
zero index for that vector and I'll put
that on our screen if we come outside of
here this you would think that that
would work but it does not and this is
the error you're going to see anytime
you're trying to use something that
you're really should be using reference
use of moved value so that is an example
of how you would have an error whenever
you were trying to work with non
primitives now that doesn't work but
would we be able to do that with
primitive values actually you're going
to see yes you can so say primitive
value and let's just give this a value
of 1 and then we'll create another
primitive value 2 and assign primitive
value to it and now try to print that
information out so we'll say prim value
and then call prim value and if you run
it you can see that you can access that
so primitive values you can access but
you're not going to be able to do that
with vectors and anything it's not a
primitive value so now what I'm going to
do is come down here and create a
function that's going to sum all the
values of a vector so we're going to say
sum of X and then we're going to call it
v1 and we're going to define that it is
a vector by putting our reference sign
inside of there and it's going to
32-bits values and then it is going to
return a 32-bit integer and then we're
going to define the sum of all those
different values and we're going to do
that by creating an iterator that's
going to cycle through all those
different values we're then going to
call fold and fold is an iterator
adapter that's going to apply a function
to all the values in this situation to
our vector and it's going to take an
initial value and that's going to be 0
and then it's going to contain a closure
which is going to receive an accumulator
and an actual element so we'll say
mutable sum is what we're going to be
working with here reference to X and
then the closure is going to be sum and
we're going to add all the incremental
values of X as it cycles through our
vector and store those in sum and then
like I said before you are able to use
return inside of rusts and we are going
to return that sum now if we want to
call this function up here we're going
to pass a reference to our vector so say
print line and we could say sum of
vector say sum VEX is the function we
want to work with and we're going to
pass a reference to our vector which is
going to be perfectly fine and this is
going to be vector 2 so let's come in
here and find that let vector 2 is equal
to and also we can come in here and pass
this value inside of a print line
statement let's just call this effect
again for debugging reasons we're going
to use the colon and the question mark
and call vector 2 and you can see right
here that not only were we able to pass
that vector inside of the function and
also we were able to still print it out
there after so that's how we use
references to pass data between
different variables as well as different
functions so now let's take a look at
Struck's now structs are going to be
used to create custom data types so
let's say that we wanted to create again
we're going to do this outside of main
let's say we want to define a circle
data type that's going to be custom to
us and let's say we have
an x-point inside of it we're going to
have to define what type of data type
also we're going to have a Y again
different type of data type and then
we'll have a radius because that's
important with our circles and with some
calculations we're going to be
performing with our circles so there we
go we created that now you're going to
I'm going to show you a couple different
ways to create functions that are going
to be tied to our Struck's the one way
we can do it which isn't considered to
be the best way is we can go and
actually define a function directly and
again we're going to be passing in a
circle reference and in this situation
we are going to be passing back 64 bit
float and to get that radius for example
we just go circle radius and that's
going to return it to us however is
recommended that we define strux with
the implementation operator instead and
that is impl and we're going to say a
circle here and then inside of it define
our function so let's say we went to
function that's just going to get the
value of x we could do so I'm going to
have self here which is going to be a
reference to the circle object we are
working with 64-bits
float is what it's going to return and
like I said self is going to return or
refer to the circle structure that we
are creating inside of here and now we
can come up inside of here and create a
circle so let's go say this is mutable
circle one is equal to this is a circle
struct and then we'll define all the
different parts we'll say X and give
that a value of 10 and Y give that a
value also of 10 and then to keep it
nice and simple we will go and create a
radius and also give that a value of 10
and then we'll close off this guy and we
can get our circle values so let's go
get rid of this and inside of there
we're going to say that we want to
return X and we want to return Y and we
want to return our radius and I'll put
all those on the screen and then to
reference them and get those different
values we're going to say circle 1 dot X
and circle one once again dot y and then
circle one dot radius and we'll be able
to output those onto the screen likewise
we're going to be able to reference and
get our radius using the function that
we defined down below so we're going to
come in and do another print line and
say that we want to get our sake circle
radius and then if we want to call that
function directly we can go get radius
and then pass in a reference to the
actual circle and that will return that
to us and likewise we will be able to
use the implementation function we
created in here we're just going to say
circle x is the value we want to work
with and what we want to get out of it
we're going to say circle one and get X
is the function we're specifically going
to call file and run and you can see
that we were able to get the radius and
also get the value of x and the
different ways we were able to get that
either by defining this function
directly or by using the implementation
option that's available to us now we're
going to also be able to use something
called traits which is going to define
functionality that a type is going to
provide so let's come in here and let's
create another struct and this guy is
going to be a rectangle and rectangle is
going to have a height which again 64
bit float and a width which is also
going to be a 64 bit float and you're
going to use traits much like you use
interfaces in other languages so let's
say that we want to calculate the area
for both rectangles as well as circles
we're going to say as area and then
we're going to define a function area
it's going to receive the struct we're
going to be working with here our custom
data type and it's going to return a 64
bit result to us and now we can
implement that has interface for both of
our trucks
so we'll say implement has area for
circle and then define the exact way
that the circles are going to implement
this so it's going to be passed that
object itself
returned a 64-bit value of course and
we'll just go 3.14159 and self radius
times solve radius it's going to be the
return value and then similarly we're
going to do the same thing for a
rectangle Struck's as arrow so this is
going to be rectangle and then of course
this is completely different here we'll
say self and height times self width
save that and now we can come up here
inside of main and play around with
these different guys so if we want to
calculate our circle area go in here and
we'll say circle area and calculate it
we're just going to change this guy
right here to area and then likewise
let's go and create a rectangle using
our custom struct we create it let's
just call this rect 1 is equal to and it
is going to be a rectangle and height as
well as width
close that off and in a much very
similar way we're going to do the same
thing here with our rectangle so just
paste that inside of there and we'll say
rect area and then to get the rectangle
area will go rect 1 and if we run it you
can see that indeed we were able to get
our circle area as well as a rectangle
area so a whole lot of information there
and now I want to take a look at
enumerated types to finish it off now an
enumerated type is going to have one of
several values so we're going to create
an enumerated type here and we're going
to call it hero and we're going to say
they can have a value of fast as well as
a value of strong and in that situation
it's going to also contain a 32-bit
integer and also we'll be able to come
in here and go info and define something
like superheros name which is a string
and the secret identity for our
superhero which is also going to be a
string we're then going to be able to
find functions to work with these so
let's say we wanted to do something like
get info and this is going to receive a
hero we're going to use match again to
perform different output to depending
upon what type of information
we were receiving here so we're going to
say if we receive hero with fast what
we're going to say is we want to print
some information out on our screen and
specifically we're just going to print
the word fast out otherwise if we
receive hero with a strong attribute
we're going to get to that value of I
and use it in our output so on and we'll
say something like lifts whatever number
of tonnes or if we're using info we get
the name as well as the secret identity
for our hero and we're going to print
that different information out here on
the screen is and then get the name and
the secret identity for our hero
and that little colon there and now
we'll be able to jump up inside Maine
and actually define these guys so let's
define the Hulk and he is going to be a
hero that is going to be strong now
remember it receives an integer so there
that is it also come in and go
Quicksilver and he's going to be a hero
that is going to be fast and then
finally we can go and define spider-man
and give away his secret identity with
info and here we'll pass in name which
is going to be his personal or his name
whatever his superhero name and we're
going to have to however convert this
from a string literal into a regular
string and to do that we go to owns and
then likewise we can come in and go and
define his secret identity which is
going to be Peter Parker - owned close
that off and then we'll be able to call
our get info function that we defined
pass in Hulk and also get info passing
spider-man to see the different results
we get and whoops put tones right here
and it's supposed to be outside of that
area so just like this get rid of that
and throw tons inside of there and if we
run it you can see that the Hulk is
going to lift a hundred tons and
spider-man is Peter Parker sorry go guys
that is a rough overview of rust and
introduction anyway
hope it helps a lot of guys out there
because I know there are no books on
rust and the documentation is considered
kind of weak so hopefully I helped you
guys out there understand the language
better so you can move on from here and
like always please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
