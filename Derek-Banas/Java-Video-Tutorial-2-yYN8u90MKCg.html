my Java video tutorials series in this
part I'm going to cover a whole bunch
other different things like accepting
user input a whole bunch of math
functions and a whole bunch of other
random things as we come about so what
I'm going to do first is I'm going to go
over here on the left side of the screen
and I'm going to come down to default
package right click on that go new and
I'm using eclipse here if you didn't
watch part 1 of this tutorial should
definitely check it out I'm gonna click
on file I'm going to call this off a
lesson 2 dot Java and I'm gonna hit
finish and it opens up here on the
screen I'm going to show a whole bunch
of new different things here first I'm
going to show you how to import an
external class all you do is go import
if you don't understand this whole thing
about classes and all that don't worry
about it I'm gonna get into it later on
all this means is I'm going to import a
bunch of functions and methods that I
want to be able to use here so you just
go import and I'm gonna go Java dot util
dot scanner and this guy's gonna help me
be able to accept user input which is
going to be really cool and if by chance
you wanted to import the entire Java
utility library you would just do it
this way and put a star there and that
would install everything so everything
will be available for you to use in that
situation but I'm not going to use that
just once scanner well then I'm going to
type in public class I'm going to create
our little program here and remember
public means it can be used by anybody
and a class is just a blueprint for what
we're creating here and of course you
have to make sure that the name of this
class that you're creating here is the
same as the name of your java file now
we're going to create a new scanner
object and just this guy's just going to
allow people to be able to ask our
program different questions such as andr
number as you see here on the right side
of the screen and remember from before
static just means that only a class can
call for this statement to execute so
we're going to go static and we're going
to call scanner which is the scanner
object here and we're going to give it a
name of user input and anytime you want
to create a new scanner object you have
to type in the word new and then scanner
you're always going to do this and then
what you have to do is define the input
stream that you want the scanner object
to look at for input and that's going to
be system in which is going to be the
users keyboard then what we're going to
do now that we have the scanner tool
setup I'm going to go to public static
void and void just means that the main
function that every one of our programs
must have does not return a value when
it's done execute and we're going to
define that we're going to need a series
of string objects called args to be
accepted into this guy and just like
before don't worry about that yet we're
going to get into that later on then
we're going to want to print a message
out on our screen so we're going to use
system.out and we're going to use print
this time instead of print line the only
difference between those two is print
does not cause a carriage return after
it prints stuff out on the screen and
print Ln does so that's the only
difference there no reason to worry
about it and then I'm going to say your
favorite number and ask them for their
favorite number and put a little space
after that I don't forget to put the
semicolon in there and then I'm going to
introduce you to the if statement it is
what is called a conditional statement
and just simply what that means is it's
going to perform certain actions if
something is true so we're going to say
if user and this is going to be a nice
little tool input dot has next int and
what this function does right here or
method is it is saying if the next thing
typed into the keyboard is an integer so
if the person types in a number that
does not have decimal places I want you
to perform all of the code or execute
all of the code that lies between these
two curly braces that's it and there are
other versions of this guy remember this
is your user input what you created up
here this is going to be the object
you're going to be using and has next
int what it does is it said is the next
thing that's typed into the keyboard and
Nanta jur that's all that does and
there's different versions of this guy
if you want to check if the next thing
typed in is a double for instance which
is a number that does have decimal
places you're going to instead type in
dot has next double and if you want to
make sure it's a float as next float and
there's also the same exact
things all you have to do is put an
uppercase version this type in boolean
or byte or long or short and I went over
what all these different things are in
the previous tutorial and of course byte
is going to be uppercase so that's how
to check what type of primitive value
was typed in by the user
now we're get back into the meat of this
what we're going to do is when we create
a new integer we're going to call it
number enter I like that you sure you
define it then we're going to call for
user input just a nice little tool here
and we're going to call next int which
is a nice little function and what this
does is it receives user input and
stores it in the variable named number
entered and that is an integer so we're
saying that we expect the user to enter
an integer if we wanted to instead get a
double we would have next double think
you're starting to see exactly where
we're going here or next float if we
expected a float value if we expected a
string which is what you're going to use
most of the time next line and of course
there's also boolean byte long and short
and just so you know if they enter a
type that is not valid which means in
this situation if they enter something
that's not an integer your program will
crash but we're learning here and
eventually we'll get around that so
don't worry about it well then what
we're going to say is that we want to if
they did enter an integer because that's
what this guy's checking it's saying if
it's an integer then we want to create
this new variable and we want to store
whatever they typed in into this new
variable there you go print line and in
this situation this is just silly we're
just gonna say exactly what they entered
you entered and then we're gonna go plus
and we're gonna go number enter that's
gonna do pretty much what you think it's
going to and we can show you just run
this guy and it says your favorite
number I'm going to type in 13 hit enter
and it's going to say you entered 13
okay not a magical experience but that's
okay we're going to learn a lot more
here now let's say we want to do
something like print out an error
message if they did not enter an integer
which why would they have even known
about that except because you don't even
bring that up up here but either way
well you use the else if you
want to perform certain actions in which
they did not enter what we originally
thought they might enter and in this
situation we're just going to copy this
right here paste that in there enter an
integer next time
well this keeps us from having errors
with this little else statement and
later on and get into else ifs and so
forth and so on but you guys are smart
you probably already know what an
else--if is and how it's going to work
and let's just run this guy leave any
questions or comments below and I'll be
more than happy to help you out
my favorite number in this situation I'm
going to type in a series of characters
and it's going to say enter an integer
next time so that's pretty easy to
understand let's say I want to perform
all kinds of mathematical calculations
based off the number entered well
there's a whole bunch of them they're
available so let's say we want to create
an integer num entered times 2 I'm going
to name this and I'm just going to say
number entered and all the code is
underneath of this video and it will
help you learn this stuff so you should
get it and read it so there we are we're
just performing some basic arithmetic
here to figure out what this number they
entered is plus itself or times 2 either
way they both work the same way and then
if we want to print on a special message
based off of that and use the print line
again here and I'm going to say number
entered plus and space and air plus go
after this go plus number entered plus
I'm just combining variables and strings
here is equal to and put another plus
sign in there and take number entered
times 2 and then don't forget put your
semicolon Java little flip out if you
can get that jump over here type in 45
and not only does it enter 45 but it
adds them together and does little nice
things there of course there's countless
numbers of other different things you
can do let's just copy this save
ourselves a little bit of time and paste
that there you can of course also say
subtract 2 so num entered call this
minus 2 and then we're just going to
have number enter and I'm going to
change this to a subtraction and put a 2
inside of there and yes you can do that
you can come down here and go number
entered plus okay well here we're just
going to cut this all
and instead replace it with - - because
we know what it is and then we're going
to copy this variable right here paste
course come in here and put a plus sign
and quotes sometimes eclipse drives me
crazy with it wanting to do everything
for me okay beautiful it's just going to
take the number they entered it's going
to tack on this string there and then
actually this doesn't make any sense
let's take that out of there all
together now that's much better and then
it's going to print out the number
entered - - and the value that this guy
up here built for us and of course we
can perform all kinds of other different
mathematical operations I just copied
and pasted that so let's say that we
wanted to do number entered times and
instead I'm going to say self in this
situation I'm just going to change this
to a multiplication so just put a little
fancy star inside of there here come
down here copy this throw this in as my
final result come over here
change this to multiplication even
though it's not really going to matter
and now it's going to perform a
multiplication times itself for a square
then we come down here again and let's
do a division well you just put that
forwards / come down inside of here
we're gonna change this to /and let's
say we wanna divide by two and then copy
paste that in there and let's just run
this just to see how it works I think
you probably get it favourite number
let's type in 56 and it's automatically
going to perform those calculations and
print everything out here on the screen
which is kind of cool
you know the other thing I did not use
here which are basic things you're going
to use pretty much all the time
modulus you may not use all the time
what modulus does the way it differs
from a basic division is it returns the
remainder of that division so I'm just
going to come in here and just call this
remainder and it's dual a division by to
change this to modulus instead and run
this guy and let's put 43 inside of
there so there is a remainder and 43
modulus to the remainder of that
division is going to be equal to 1 do a
couple more that are maybe a little bit
more interesting if you wanted to do a
shorthand edition like this let's say
you have a variable it's just saying
ever entered all right so let's say you
want to add two to number entered and
then save it back into the original
number entered value or variable you
could go and do it this way number
entered is equal to number entered plus
two and of course put a semicolon on
there at the end or you could do this in
a much easier way the shorthand way to
do this inside of Java and numerous
other different programming languages is
actually to replace what I've
highlighted on the screen and instead
put a plus sign on by an equals that is
going to allow you to do exactly the
same thing in a much shorter way and
another thing you can do let's say you
want to subtract two and then save it
back to the original variable no problem
just put a subtraction in it there you
go now you can see it so that's a
shorthand way of doing that and you can
also shorthand come in here and let's
say that you want to decrement you want
to lower this value by one just take the
new variable name put two negatives and
put a semicolon there you are
automatically lowered that variables
value by one you want to increment it or
raise it by one no problem just put two
pluses right like that the shorthand way
is to do a couple different things
inside a job opportunity and in Java
also has a math library that's kind of
cool it has a whole bunch of different
things which I'm not going to touch on
most of them let's say you wanted to
find the absolute value for a number so
let's just call this number ABS it's
equal to you type in math with uppercase
M followed by ABS absolute value and
then let's say we want to put number
entered inside of there and that is all
you'd have to do to find the absolute
value for this variable inside of here
that's kind of useful and it will be if
you do any type of math work inside of
here if you want to find out what is a
bigger number comparison like one or the
other is bigger there's a what's called
a max function inside of for this guy
meaning Java so let's say which is
bigger and you would go equals two and
again it's going to be math dot Max and
let's say you wanted to find out if five
or seven is bigger that's exactly how
you do it and of course there's also a
minimum version of this want to find the
minimum what this is going to do is it's
going to kick back in this situation max
being seven and if you just change this
to
am I am going to kickback five instead
and oh by the way I've never talked
about what I was doing here with these
things but whenever you put two forward
slashes this is a comment inside of Java
and if you want to put in multi-line
comments to put a forward slash star and
Eclipse is nice enough to go in there
and allow you to put all types of
comment and comments are completely
ignored inside of Java if you want to
return the square root of an argument
well of course you have to pass it a
double and let's just say square root is
equal to call the math dot s QRT
function and let's say you want to find
the square root of five point two three
that's exactly what it's going to do and
it's going to return a double so make
sure this guy is a double that this
variable here is a double and there are
numerous different ways to round numbers
inside of Java so let's say you wanted
to return the ceiling or we want to just
simply round the value of a number up
well we're going to actually call this
an integer because that's what it is and
we're going to call it num ceiling and
if we want to force or cast the value
that is returned from the function we're
going to be call which is math CEI l see
this guy math CIL returns a double if we
want to force it to return an integer
instead we just have to put this little
cast feature here and it's going to
return this and it's call going to be
nice and happy because it's going to
return an integer and then of course
there's numerous different ways to do
rounding so if instead of using ceiling
to round a number up we want to round a
number down in this situation to five in
this situation right here till six
we went instead call floor of course
delete that so this is going to round
this number down to five and just put
this in here so that's six and that's
five and if you want to round based off
of the fraction meaning if it's five
point five it's going to automatically
round to six but if it's five point two
it's going to automatically round
downwards to five of course there is a
round function inside of Java and guess
what it's called it's just call it
number round and it is ro UN D round and
this guy is since it's five point two
going to round this to five and if it
was five point six it would round it to
and then as the final thing we'll show
you how to get some random numbers
inside of Java there's actually a bunch
of different ways I'm going to show you
the simplest way let's say you wanted to
get a random so I'm just going to call
it in random number and I'm going to put
in a little cast tool inside here so
that I make sure it returns an int and
I'm going to go math dot random call
this little function here and it is
going to actually create a random number
that is between the values of point zero
through point nine nine nine nine nine
it doesn't actually get to one okay so
that's what this is going to return
meaning math.random so if I want to make
a number meaning a random number that is
going to be between the values of zero
and n actually nine that's all I do I
just put in the maximum number that I
don't want to show up if we wanted this
to be between zero and ten we would put
11 inside of there that's exactly what
this guy is going to do for us and then
we can actually print this out and it's
just copy this save ourselves some time
and type in random number plus random
number close that off close that off and
then execute and you can see here we are
again let's just throw in 57 and it
kicks out everything and it kicks out a
random number that is equal to eight
there's a whole bunch of different ways
you can use math functions and a preview
of the if statement and a whole bunch of
other different things like importing
classes and all the other stuff that we
covered leave any questions or comments
below and yes I promise I will
completely cover Java in this video
tutorial till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
