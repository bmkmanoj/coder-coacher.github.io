my Java video tutorial series today I'm
going to show you how to create classes
from which you can then create objects
and along the way I'm going to talk
about a whole bunch of things in regards
to classes and some theory in regards to
object-oriented program ok so let's just
jump right into this I decided I'm gonna
make a monster class and I'm gonna name
it monster and this could basically be
looked at as a way you would approach
how to design like a video game now
don't get crazy here this isn't going to
be an advanced video game just gonna be
a simple one now like we said before
public means this class can be used by
other classes and class names should
begin with a capital letter like I did
right there with monster just a couple
little rules we should follow and just
so you know this a file cannot contain
two public classes so you can't do that
however it can contain classes that are
not public so as long as you don't have
two public classes you can have multiple
classes and don't worry about it if you
place two class files in the same folder
the Java compiler will be able to find
them figure out everything ok so what
can we put in a class definition which
as I've said in the past is just a
blueprint for objects or whatever you
want to call them well you can throw
constants inside of them so let's say
that the constant for every monster is
it's going to have a tombstone when it
dies that says here lies a dead monster
that's a constant that's a string we're
going to get more into Strings later on
that's how you define that constant and
also what's good about creating objects
and using classes to define how they
should work out is you want to use as
many private class variables or what
they're supposed to be called fields so
you can either refer to them as class
variables or fields depending on if
you're taking a test or whatever they're
supposed to be called fields so we want
to define something as private meaning
that only the object can change the
values inside of these guys so we want
to say our monster should only be able
to change its health just trying to
think of things the attack points that
it has may be just defining some
integers here this isn't that
complicated movement let's say we're
going to use some sort of grid based
system and we want to say that this
monster can only move two spaces per
turn another thing we're using a grid
based system we might also have
position be something else x-position
y-position you know I'm going to set
that at zero this is just sort of like
some things you should think about and
some things that should be kept private
or protected maybe a better way and also
we want to monitor if our monster is
alive or dead and remember that boolean
values can only have a value of true or
false okay so there I did I created a
whole bunch of different fields or class
variables that I'm going to be able to
work with here to help my monster game
move along and of course you can also
have public variables and let's just
create a name let's give people the
option of changing the monster's name so
let's just give him big monster is a
default name hopefully it's not a little
monster and you should have as few
public fields as humanly possible always
aim to keep these private until you
absolutely find some crazy reason why
you have to make them public well then
after you have all your fields or class
variables defined what do you need well
you need some methods or functions that
are going to be able to set these
private fields up here because there's
no other way to set them so what you
need to do is like let's say we want to
be able to find out what the attack
value is well there's no way to get it
because it's private up here so you
attack its private so if we want to
access these variables we have to
provide them with the option to go and
ask us for these values what you want to
do with object-oriented programming is
try to protect this information and not
allow people to willy-nilly go in here
and change things because what happens
if you only accept an integer like we
have here for attack with 20 and they
try to go and change your attack value
to a decimal or a double or whatever
it's not going to work so what this guy
is going to do here for us is it's going
to provide the ability for the person to
find out what the attack value is
without going in and accessing it and
unless you can figure some reason for
them to go in there and be able to
change that attack value don't allow
them to do it and I'm going to keep this
very simple as we go through here and
say okay well how quickly can you move
well all this is going to do is it's
going to return that value it's going to
return the value of movement and these
are called access or methods meaning
they have access to the value of these
private variables up here but we keep
them protected and another thing is it'd
be very very helpful to be able to
find out what the health is for this
monster so that we know if we have
killed it or not so what are we going to
do we're just going to return that value
again so it's real simple that's all
we're doing here so let's move in now
that we got some of the basics down we
might also want to have a public method
inside of our class definition and void
again means it doesn't return any value
and let's say that we want them to be
able to set the health for our monster
meaning that the monster has been
attacked and at this point in time I'm
thinking okay well I should allow them
to do that because I want an easy way to
have them be able to change that health
so what am I going to do I'm going to
say health is equal to whatever the
current value of health is for our
monster - decrease health so that's all
we're going to do with that of course we
could have different checks and things
inside of here and why don't we just put
one in so let's say if health is less
than zero what we want to do in this
situation is we want to set the value of
alive equal to false that's just a
little check that we have inside of
there and one of the benefits of
object-oriented programming if we
allowed them to come in here and just
willy-nilly change the health eventually
health might end up having a negative
value the monster is dead and we're
still attacking at no point in attacking
a dead monster okay so let's continue on
here
so what are we else what else we going
to do we're going to go public way to
set health what we're going to be able
to do with this is let's say they do
pass a double value somehow you know a
value that has a decimal place in it
well what you can do inside
object-oriented programming is create
what are called overloaded methods so
this means if since I have set health
here and I have set health here I have
the same method but with a different
attribute inside of it by doing this
it's called overloading what it allows
me to do is to be able to handle double
values if they're sent or integers if
they are sent and you can pretty much
create as many of these as you want you
could have this be floats you could have
it be boolean for some crazy reason you
could have as many of these methods with
the same set health name as long as the
attributes in here are different you
however cannot just simply overload by
sending let's say that each of these
returned like this return an integer and
this returned a double as a value but
the attributes are the same that doesn't
work that way so whenever you're
thinking about overloading think Oh
me and not about what the return values
are going to be but what the attributes
are as long as you create a whole bunch
of methods with different attributes
you're fine that's how you overload you
don't overload in any other way so in
this situation they send a double so I
want to fix that so when I go in to
decrease L is equal to and let's cast
this let's make this an integer and
let's change decrease health I'm just
sort of like doing this out of my head
if you have any questions leave them
down below I'll be more than happy to
answer them and then we're going to take
how just like we did before
- int te Crees Oh boom just like that
and then we could also come in here and
do our little check that we had right
here actually I could have copied and
pasted this before but I didn't and
there you go that's how you overload
methods remember same name different
attributes sent so that's all that's
going on with that then you come to
what's called the constructor
constructor is just like a setup
function or method whenever a new object
based off of this class is created the
first function that is called is called
the constructor method and it will be
executed only when the object is created
based off of the blueprint that the
class defines it will only be executed
one time and never again and another
thing to understand is it has to have
the same name as your class so the name
of this class is monster so the
constructor also has to have the value
of monster or the name monster and in
this situation where you go allow them
to pass new health new attack so that
whenever they define a new monster
remember this class is just a blueprint
we're allowed to change the blueprint
however or not depending upon what we
want to do here and there we go so this
is the first time you'll see a
constructor and what's going to happen
is they're going to want to create a new
monster and in this situation they want
to change both the healthy attack and
the movement values for said monster
kind of boring if every single monster
in your video game has exactly the same
attack and health and everything else
we're going to get more complicated as
this tutorial progresses and here all
I'm doing is just setting the values for
this new monster and if it helps you at
all you could think of these objects as
being just totally self-contained to
programs or whatever that just have a
whole bunch of variables and a whole
bunch of methods inside and just
remember a constructor is only executed
once per object and the constructor also
I didn't mention is
before you cannot put void inside of
here the constructor cannot have a
return value of any type so just leave
it that way
you could also come in here and create
multiple different constructors so let's
say they want to create a monster and
they don't send any values well this is
expecting values up here if you don't
send them everybody's gonna get upset
about that so we're going to come in
here and create a second constructor
this is overloading the constructor are
creating multiple constructors that are
allowed to accept multiple attributes in
this situation three up here in this
situation none so overloading that guy
and in this situation we will leave it
this way and also what's kind of
interesting to note is if you do not
create a constructor of any type this is
the default constructor meaning it does
nothing the method exists but it doesn't
do anything however if you do create a
constructor file like we did right here
this guy's never created so just
understand this only is created by the
Java interpreter if you do not define
any constructor and another thing this
might be interesting to also bring up
say in this situation that the person
like let's say I had health up here
instead of new health ok and that would
cause some confusion because you have
health down here which pertains to your
object but this has the same value and
in mass confusion ensues so what would
we do in that situation
let's just do it let's cause some mass
confusion I'm going to come in here get
rid of that new name and how would I be
able to then reference the actual health
for my monstrum trait in here instead of
these attributes that were passed over
quite simply this this is a reference to
the actual objects variables so that's
what that is and then multiple different
programming languages if you use the
term of this that is a reference to
whatever object you're currently working
with so this dot health is the same as
well parent this guy right here and
remember each object as these variables
installed or fields inside of it if you
don't pick up on everything in this
tutorial don't worry about it we're
going to cover it later on and something
else to remember is you can also use the
this keyword for constructors because
this as a method is a reference to the
constructor and I'm going to come in
here and I'm just going to do some
little jazz here I'm going to delete
this in a second but let's say you come
in here and you
instructor five public and monster and
int and new health or what have you so
you just created this guy and what it
does is it goes health is equal to new
health right like that
well let's say if you also want to
create another construction file again
monster and this guy receives not only
health but also receives int new attack
so different ways to create monsters
sometimes we just want the health and we
want to use the default values that are
set and sometimes we want to set the
attack also well this function already
sets the health up here so wouldn't it
be really cool if we could just send
this health attribute up to this guy and
have him execute it we actually can if
you type in this and then take new helm
right like that that's exactly what's
going to happen and then what we would
do is just go attack is equal to new
attack if you do not quite getting this
don't worry about it this is kind of a
more advanced topic we're going to be
covering this more later but simply what
happens is it jumps into this guy
because two attributes are sent and this
right here is a call to this remember
when we're overloading methods it pays
attention to the attribute well there's
only one attribute in this constructor
and this is a reference to constructors
inside of our program so this guy's
executed right here and then we assign
the attack value just like we did before
like I said if you don't quite get that
don't worry about it we're gonna cover
it later alright so got rid of that
we're gonna continue on here okay so now
I've defined the whole entire class and
everything that I you need to be able to
create these monster objects now I'm
going to explain something a little bit
more to you right here on the screen in
regards to what it means by having
private variables now I'm still inside
my monster dot Java file right now and
I'm going to show you something that I
don't really see people go over very
often now let's say inside of here I
create public static void main like
we've seen before in the previous
tutorials inside of this guy I'm gonna
show you how to create a new object but
this is wrong but I just want you to
understand exactly what's going on here
now if you want to create a object based
on this class and I'm gonna call this
monster Frank this is how you do it now
I'm going to go monster right here
here and what did I just call with this
right here I actually called the
constructor file right there so that's
what's going on but I'm gonna lab right
here now this has all kinds of default
values assigned to it meaning for Frank
the monster now since I am in the class
I can actually go system.out.print and
then go Frank and attack right like this
and even though attack is a field and as
we saw before I went and commented all
this that's what all that extra
information is again you can see all the
comments underneath the video this is
private so why do I think I can print
this out on the screen well I actually
know I can print it out on the screen
I'm going to execute it just to prove it
to you and you can see right there it
shows up the reason why I'm able to
print out to screen this private field
is because I'm inside of the class
hopefully that makes sense to you now
I'm going to jump outside of the class
and I'm going to create a new class and
this is how you are supposed to use
classes and I'm going to call it lesson
seven very very important to understand
this concept so that you don't get
confused here and then inside of here
I'm going to go public static void main
again string create myself and do one of
these guys and of course spell public
right so now I have a new main and I'm
going to create another object just like
I just previously did inside of the
class but the sign emits outside of the
class and because Monster dot Java is in
the same folder as Java lesson seven
we're going to be able to locate that
class and just to instantly use it just
like we were using it before and there I
created a new object named Frank and
Frank name I'm going to be able to
assign to this so let's just call it
Frank just to keep everything nice and
easy and the reason why I'm able to do
this is because name is public and if we
jump over here you're gonna see that
name is indeed public see right here big
monster by default but it's public so I
can set that value but however even
though Frank has a default well let's
just jump over into this monster area I
just copy and paste it you're going to
see if I try to print out the attack
value for Frank in this other class
what's going to happen let's execute it
and you can see it's already given me
errors the reason why the field monstre
dot attack is not visible that means it
is private because I am NOT trying to
access it from inside of the class but
instead I'm trying to access it from
outside of the class now I could still
print it out so I can just go in here
for example and say Frank name because
that is public and put as on a tack of
write like that and then I can use my
accessor function to be able to get the
attack the right way and that is get
attack followed by my little quotes and
now you can see here if I execute this
that it's going to say Frank has an
attack of 20 so that's something that
you really need to understand you can
access private variables or fields
inside of the class itself like I did
here with this main function inside of
Monster Java however outside of the
class you can only access them if there
are access or functions that allow me to
do so so there was a whole bunch about
object-oriented programming you leave
any questions or comments below I'm
going to continue teaching more about
object-oriented programming coming up
next till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
