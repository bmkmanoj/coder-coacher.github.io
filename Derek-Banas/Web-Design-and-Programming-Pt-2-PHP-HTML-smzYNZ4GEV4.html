of my web design and programming
tutorial here I'm going to show you how
to interact with PHP code using forms
but before I move on Tasmin actually
wrote a comment asked for more
information in regards to escape codes
on what they are so what I'm going to do
is jump over here into my PHP code and
explain them to you let's say we have a
KO statement and let's say I want to put
multiple double quotes just like that
inside of PHP well if we jump over here
type PHP test1 and jump over here and
save this and then hit this nothing is
going to show up why because there's an
error PHP is confused the interpreter is
anyway it doesn't know when your string
that you want for another screen ends
because it considers these double quotes
to be the string but then there's this
thing hanging around and it's not a
variable so PHP doesn't know how to look
at it so what you do is you put a
backslash inside of here and that tells
PHP that you want double quotes to show
up and you do not want them to be
treated as if they are the end of the
string and you could also do the same
things with single quote and you'd also
want to do the same thing for dollar
signs because a dollar sign starts off
every variable and if you have a
variable inside of this code it's going
to print that value for that variable so
that is why you need to escape dollar
signs and the reason why you need to
escape new lines is because there's no
other way to put a new line in this is
the actual code that represents a
newline backslash n so I hope that
explains exactly why we escape things
inside of PHP code now I'm going to jump
over here and I'm going to show you how
to create a form in HTML it's real
simple just going to type in for one
action is going to be a reference to the
location of the PHP code that is going
to work on this and another thing was
brought up in comments was what or
arrays I'm going to cover arrays here in
future tutorials okay so this is just a
reference to where this information in
this form should be sent I'm going to
use the post method meaning that
information that set is not going to be
displayed in the URL it passed right
along
and I personally think it's good form to
always close off your tags as you are
creating them that way you don't forget
to do it and we use a paragraph symbol
here
it separates all of my input information
on the screen and I like to tab you can
do whatever you want this is how you
create a text box here I'm going to
assign in a name it's very important
that you do this because this name right
here is what you're going to be
referencing in your PHP code and then
make a default size on the screen of 30
and give it a value of nothing and then
close that out and come back here and
close this off that's going to create a
text box with a label name in front of
it if you hit say reload this boom you
see it shows up just like that I need a
whole bunch of these guys should do it
I'm gonna change this the address change
this address city city here I'm going to
have them guess a number
sorry if I'm shining your favorite
animal here put number in there put pet
and in here I'm actually going to cut
this off because this is going to be the
submit button input type and I'm going
to put submit name I call it submit it
does not have a size and value is going
to be what is shown on the button if we
save this jump over here reload it you
can see all that new information showing
up there and the only reason this box
isn't over here is because I have the
browser closed I'm using Safari a lot of
people have asked questions about why
I'm using the browser I'm using I'm
using it because it's not I barely ever
use it in a real world sorry Apple and
my other one is all being Firefox my
other browser is all jumped up with
toolbars so that's why I'm using it okay
so now let's create some PHP code that
will interact with the user only thing I
changed up here was for the title menu I
put in I have the information as you can
see this is sending your information so
that's the only thing I changed there
that you didn't see any change I'm an
echo to screen I know everything Alma
and this is how you reference that
information that is sent from the forum
in the HTML always post dollar sign
underscore post-2008
to this guy right here where it says
name so that is how you are able to
reference and pull that information that
is sent in and ford slash Hyrum using
the concatenation tool there's a whole
bunch of different ways to interact with
PHP and please if you have any other
questions or if there's something you
don't think I covered send me a request
I read all the comments because I don't
have tons of them okay so this is
actually an array that was sent over
here this is what we call key value
pairs don't get yourself all hung up on
that just understand what it's
technically doing you don't need to
worry more about it than that and if
you've got to put a semicolon right
there and if you save this guy and we
already built this and I used to fake
addresses because when actually around
this time last year I posted my real
address and I asked for people to send
me the leftovers please don't do that
from Thanksgiving and I got a lot of
rotten food in the mail if we had send
you can see there's the information
automatically pulled it from the forum
and put it up there for me so pretty
useful now what I'm going to do is show
you how to use if statements inside a
PHP so I'm going to echo again to screen
all we're doing here I'm going to turn
in the value that is sent over into an
integer with this cast tool here that I
went over in a previous tutorial and
then I'm going to create an if statement
this is just a conditional it's going to
do certain things if certain things are
true and do other things if they are not
true all I'm doing here is asking if the
number guessed which is what they sent
over is equal to 5 which I'm going to
choose is my number and just like it
sounds or looks like here on the screen
and I'm just using this I know it's
silly to use this and in this situation
but I'm doing it just to go over exactly
what and is this is going to check for
equality two equal signs this is going
to check if it's the less than this
symbol exclamation mark equals it's
actually equal to not equal greater than
greater than or equal to less than or
equal to I'm sure you can figure that
one out so what this is saying if number
guessed is equal to five and also number
guessed is less than 11 I want you to
perform certain actions I could also put
or inside here what this will do is it
will perform those actions if either one
these are true I can put X or this is
going to do is it's going to perform
these actions that follow if one of
these is false and one of them is true
but if they're both true it's going to
kick back a negative answer and here you
can see if they pass the number five for
example meaning this would actually be a
true statement and I put not in here you
wouldn't use not with two of these guys
though
it's going to return remember this is
true it's going to turn it into a false
if this value was actually false not
would turn it into true okay
so hopefully that was understandable
then what you do is you put curly braces
down here and all the actions in the
curly braces are going to be executed if
this is true okay semicolon there's an
error in your PHP code chances are it is
probably a semicolon being missing then
I'm going to use else--if and this is
just one word no space in between here
and I'm going to check for another
conditional and this would only come up
if either one of these came back is
false
okay so we're only going to get the else
if if both or one of those comes back
false and then close that on and any
inside the curly braces you want to
define exactly what you want to show up
to hi break right like that here and
then else I don't need a condition after
the elves and this is going to be the
default thing that occurs if the other
things all came back as false values
tada
and that is how those work so if we jump
over here and let's type in 5 as my
value and I hit Send
did you guess my number you guessed it
there you are that's exactly how that
works and if I would jump back here and
type in 10 for example and send to hot
ok so that's how if statements work now
I'm going to go over the switch
statement just continue your code switch
statements are used whenever you know
that there is a limited number of
potential answers or responses that you
plan on getting okay so let's get the
information here that they sent call it
favorite Pat it's equal to dollar sign
underscore POS T
semicolon and I'll move this up we have
our switch statement here let's say if
and I'm going to put the variable that I
want to test all these conditions on
inside
right up here and then put myself some
curly braces and you're going to say
case dogs so what you're saying here is
if favorite pet is equal to dogs I'm
going to put echo wolf so what I'm going
to do and then put break which is going
to kick me out of the switch statement
then cats echo you know break it's going
to kick me out of there again case fish
echo bubble great and then I'm going to
put in a default this is going to be
triggered if none of these other things
come back as true and I'm going to do is
because they're not following the rules
I'm going to answer them with a growl
and then you want to close off your
switch statement with a closing curly
brace it's a jump over here I'm going to
put fish in hit send bubble you can see
that popped up on the screen and if I
type in turtle and hit set it's going to
kick back grrrrrr so that is how to use
if statements a little bit more
information on escaping else if else and
how to retrieve information that is sent
to your PHP code through forms if you
have any questions or comments or things
that you want to make sure that I cover
leave them in the comment section below
