6 of my Python how to program tutorial
today we're going to cover
object-oriented programming and Python
of course I'm going to cover classes
which are blueprints you use to create
objects and is well going to cover
inheritance and polymorphism how you
create a class that you will create
objects from in Python is to type class
and then the name of said class then I'm
going to find a method we previously
referred to them as functions but here
inside of classes that refer to as
methods and this is a special method
that job is to initialize or construct
the object this is a function it's going
to be called every single time you
create a new object by default I'm going
to force the person to give the animal a
name and I'm not French or they will get
the default name no name and here again
with this underscore I'm denoting that I
want this variable to only be changed by
functions that lie within the class
you're going to see those functions or
methods here in a minute and the
reference to self is a reference to the
object you're creating so whenever you
create a new object that object is
actually passed here and then variables
within that object are played around
with in this case we're setting the
variable name to the name that was
passed or no name and here is the
function that is called whenever you
want to change the name for the object
and again we're going to call it put a
default in here
remember this is always good because it
helps you to avoid errors there we go
now if you want to retrieve that name we
are going to use and I'm using set and
get because these are common things to
use I'm going to show you a shortcut
here in a minute but what git will do
will return the value that is stored in
a variable name and that's what that guy
does and what we do we do all of this to
this is called encapsulation to protect
variable names so that they're not
accidentally set somewhere in code and
unset and step to something else and
comes confusing so if you keep
everything so that you can only set the
variable name by calling this function
it makes your code more understandable
now of course every animal is going to
make some sort
noise and what I'm going to do here is
just simply define a noise that animals
will get by default animals will also
move so provide a default that's all
you're doing whenever you're creating
these classes is providing all the
defaults okay
and let's just say every animal has to
eat just say crunch crunch okay so I
defined all the methods inside of the
class let's create an object that we're
going to call dog it's call the
constructor function for that animal
class and let's call our dog I'll be to
be original and then also let's have our
puppy make some noises and move and eat
and if we print run this function you
can see error moving forward crunch
crunch that's these methods being run
now if we go in here to Jake and use the
function get name to retrieve that new
name that we set see that just copy this
and paste and run it and you can see
error moving forward crunch crunch puppy
because that was the original name I
gave it when I created this object and
then you see Jake because I set the new
name to Jake and then retrieved that new
name this is kind of limiting though
this this overall class because we only
have one variable that is set that the
user can use and of course they may want
to set additional names well there's a
workaround with that inside of Python
what we're going to do now is we're
going to allow them to pass an unlimited
number of key value pair or dictionaries
and how we do that in an initialization
method that we have here is a
designating this this keyword whenever
we use this this tells Python the to
expect an unlimited number of
dictionaries to be passed to it I don't
like this signified to Python that we
were going to send an unlimited number
of variables to regular functions okay
and instead of name we're going to tie
ourselves down we're going to instead
give it a name like a true
because it's going to be an unlimited
number of potential values that they can
send to this class now you know might
not want to do this but this is a nice
work around because you an immense
amount of flexibility
now this changed from names so we're
going to want to change that to
attributes and this is a common thing
that is used in advanced Python
you're not always going to see it
especially but not by somebody that's
very new to Python but I think you can
imagine the flexibility that it provides
you and then we just put in attributes
again value and the key for this is
going to be the word key you want to
retrieve we have to do is pass the key
to the get attributes function and it
will return attributes dot get key and
it will put a default inside of there
and then if we come back down here and
instead of name here put attributes in
and attributes here and instead of this
set function here we're going to put
attributes inside of this guy as well
and let's put in here feet and let's say
that this dog had a horrible accident
and would split the value of 3 inside of
there so what we got here is we are
going to run the same functions as we
use previously we're going to assign the
key name to the value of puppy and we
are going to retrieve value stored in
the key name we are setting the number
of feet because now we can define an
unlimited number of key value pairs and
within our class I'm going to create a
new key value pair using the key feet
and the value being 3 and then we are
going to retrieve feet from the class
and if we run that you can see that's
exactly what it did print out the two
the three methods that we had previously
here it retrieves the name and here it's
going to retrieve the number of feet
that we set right there so that is a
extra
MLE flexible ability you can add to your
classes and now we will move on to
inheritance basically we don't need to
change anything up here inside the class
let's delete this information out of
here though and let's come down here and
basically delete all of this information
okay now what we're going to do is we're
going to create a new class that is
going to inherit all of the methods and
variables that are found in the animal
class we're going to call this class dog
and how you inherit is you make
reference to the animal class that you
are inheriting from and here we are
going to overwrite the noise function
and replace it with a noise that the dog
would more than likely make woof woof
okay but let's say we also wanted to
keep this noise the default noise and be
able to access it well you can access
all of the methods in the superclass
being the animal class that was that was
inherited from by just referencing with
it with the super function and the
method you would like to call and then
we come down here and instead create a
dog object do that in the same way we
created an animal object before if we
say print call the noise method that we
have here and we're going to also call
another function that we didn't define
in the dog class and this is in essence
what in his inheritance and if we run it
you can see here that we're going to
print out wolf wolf and just like we
have defined here and then we're going
to print out moving forward which is
what the move function or move method
does in the original class animal even
though we don't have move which is right
here in the original animal class we do
not define it in the inherited dog class
that we created from the animal class so
that is basically how inheritance works
you can overwrite that which you want to
change remember you can still make
reference to methods back inside of the
parent or superclass in this case being
animal in this way and you can also
overwrite any method that you want to
replace inside of this new class so
that's inherited classes and inheritance
in general now what I'm going to do is
explain to you exactly what polymorphism
is okay so we created let's get rid of
this guy again we created up here a
class named dog well another thing that
is an animal is a cat so we're going to
create
oops another class called cat and we are
going to define a different noise that
the cat makes and in this case we're
going to print meow and we're going to
get rid of this just to get rid of
okay so we've defined dog we've
overwritten the default noise but we
kept all of the other methods of animal
here we'd if we over wrote the method
noise for the new cat class as well now
in the program itself this is not inside
of any of the classes we're going to
create a new function called talk to me
and what it is going to do is it's going
to receive any objects that are of the
type animal whenever it does it is going
to run the method noise okay this is
polymorphism that we're talking about
really complicated word that really
should not be complicated then in the
real program part again outside of
classes outside of functions we're going
to create a new object of type class dog
and we're going to create another one a
new cat object type cat so we got that
there
well and now we're going to pass to our
function talk to me
Sophie our new cat just see what happens
whenever we pass C it's expecting an
animal object but we're passing it a cat
object what is going to happen see it
still prints out Meowth and it's still
going to print even though this method
is not defined inside of the cat class
here's the cat class in totality it only
has one method noise so it's going to
overwrite the method in the animal class
with its own method name noise but it's
going to retain all of the methods from
the animal class that it did not over
right and what polymorphism is is that
Python is smart enough to know that when
you pass it even though it's a cat
object that the cat object is still an
animal object and it's smart enough to
say okay basically what happens as it
goes this is a cat object which
originally was an animal object does
this new cat object have a method of
type noise yes it does great fire that
off then it comes down to animal dot eat
what the interpreter says is does the
new cat object having method that over
writes our eat method
it says no says fine treat it as an
animal that is polymorphism that is what
that gigantic complicated word means so
that's basically it that's
object-oriented programming I showed you
some of the most complicated things to
think about specific to Python but this
is true this is still inheritance this
is still polymorphism in every other
language so it's you can use this
information for other languages as well
because any object oriented programming
language pretty much works in the same
way polymorphism is polymorphism so if
you have any questions leave them in the
comment section
