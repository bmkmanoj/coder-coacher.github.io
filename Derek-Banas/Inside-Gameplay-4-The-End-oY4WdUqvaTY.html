thank you for joining me for this live
stream I am bound and determined to
finish the game tonight and hopefully I
am near the end and here we are and
there's my little man again so I just
have to adjust a screen here a little
bit I can see all of your messages
doesn't it yes the live video games
stuff is a new thing I'm just I don't
know how long I'm gonna keep doing it I
was originally just going to play
Resident Evil tell me if you know my
sound stinks or something I was
originally just gonna play resident evil
but then like a whole bunch of people
started watching it I was like oh excuse
to play video games so yeah just give me
an excuse and i'm all for it and from
what you guys are telling me i've never
played this game I know it's a little
bit older game then right there's a
switch up there and I can't get to it
alright thanks for telling me well I do
live programming videos I don't know
anything's possible I never expected to
ever play video games I never expected
to do pretty much most of what I ever
ended up doing so anything's possible I
just think it would be a little bit
distracting for you not for me because
if I keep getting a lot of questions a
tutorial could go on forever so I guess
this is the only thing I can do so I'm
going to push boo went the whole way up
I don't know it ooh that's now oh there
are bodies everywhere okay so crazy game
well thank you I'm glad you like the
tutorials that's my claim to fame I
guess even though i have made videos on
games obviously sales marketing cooking
I used to cook all the time but then I
like ran out of ideas so um I love the
try some new stuff but I don't know sort
of ran out ideas throw me up there guys
whoo whoa it's not far enough okay well
okay so that's not that's a no go see
what else we got here
I think I figured out what if I can
lower the water and then fall out of the
water the waters whoops sorry I hit my
microphone hopefully that didn't make
too much noise the waters above and the
grounds below let's see if I do this if
that'll solve it Oh boink all right now
can they throw me in the water well not
high all right so let's go back up the
stairs helloooo all-rounder and the next
game well people have been saying that
I'm afraid of Resident Evil nightmare
because I haven't played it so that's
the next thing I'm going to do I'm going
to do that tomorrow night and my
programming videos are still going to go
I always I'm never gonna stop doing that
wednesday and saturday morning always
and but i like this and we're gonna
continue trying to play games here for
as long as it works Oh breslin evil
nightmares the next thing I'm gonna do
because people thought I was afraid of
it and after that I think I'm gonna do
the witness which is the hardest puzzle
game ever made and I might really suck
at it so risley an evil nightmare
tomorrow and then I think the witness
well throw me I guess whoa well that did
oh and I don't okay that wasn't good
hi of Andhra I think I said that right I
may not have them so I apologize well
through me oh there we go whoops well
they didn't die the first time so maybe
they won't die this time and i still
cannot kill anywhere don't you see
somebody running yeah maybe there's
other people trying to escape this weird
factory world that I'm trying to escape
from hopefully they catch me hey all
right cool oh there's a opening up here
throw me up there oh I I always saw it
the main focus of my my tutorials would
be programming but there's a lot of
videos that I did that who I thought
would be major successes that totally
sucked my biggest disappointment is the
video that I think is the best video i
did that nobody watched or my tutorial
videos there's no point trying to live
this my sales videos they are actually
good I did a lot with sales later
earlier in my life but there's so much
garbage content out there with suppose
that sales experts that I can't compete
with
supply of garbage marketing so that's
probably the video i did series that i
did i was disappointed with another one
i was disappointed with was i did a a
tutorial that taught dungeons and
dragons at a extremely high level all in
one video and that bombed so you never
know what's going to be good and what
isn't so I just make videos and don't
worry about if I'm gonna succeed or not
I don't care all right so I'm just
trying to get out of this factory and my
little men here and women are hopefully
going to help me wait a minute I'm back
here again all right wait a minute i'm
gonna need to focus a little bit yes the
game is called inside I can't think of
any reason I want to do that let's see
here
sometimes when I go talking too much i
forget what I'm supposed to be doing all
right so I guess we're suppose we
already went this way what did I mess up
yes i did a dnd video which I taught
like everything you could ever want to
know about D&amp;amp;D and nobody watched it
even though a whole bunch of people told
me that I should do it and it would be
the greatest idea ever and yeah ok so i
guess i have to go up lucite a minute
oops ah and i have to go back up to
gather all those people ok let's just go
back and forget this whoops no don't go
back up focus on the game
i'm assuming i need all these people and
I was stupid didn't get them all got my
people
they're highly durable whatever they are
ok now let's go
very welcome to all you guys I'm very
lucky that you guys find the big essay
too useful it's my pleasure alright
let's open this site OOP okay still okay
sort of a funny sound whenever they hit
the ground no Fitz mean to say that yeah
there's definitely people running so
maybe they are like me I have no idea
who I am or anything about this game
yeah I missed the walking dead last
night so don't tell me what happened my
wife wanted to watch was a call mrs.
forget it was something peculiar
children that that movie they got pretty
bad reviews I never read the books it
was good my opinion was pretty good
anyway
alright so I was easy
I know what you guys think about negan
but I love negan there's a lot of hate
going on about Nia I was so pretty cool
I don't know what that was back there
that's a funky-looking thingamajigger
whoa I guess I'm not supposed to be
afraid of the people or maybe that's
somebody that's escaping you can't jump
that huh oh I bet I can use this to jump
that I it's already looking at Oh golf
cart then look at me I have no idea what
they're looking at maybe I will find out
someday
yeah what do you guys think about the
witness I don't know how many people
have actually played it i heard it's
wicked hard we have miss peregrine's
home for peculiar children oh I yeah
seriously unfortunate events I was not
that big of a fan I can't do what am I
doing here I watched part of it and i
don't know something about it can I jump
her
okay maybe i'll get to see what's over
there in that room hopefully I wasn't
supposed to do anything to try to keep
those guys with me people say this
ending is crazy like I said I have no
idea what happens I can't hit that
looking into some sort of fat yeah the
c-sharp GUI tutorials are coming sorry
I'm it's taken well let's wait and look
over here before I try open a nano the
c-sharp to tour on covering c-sharp in
massive detail so that nobody can ever
say oh you didn't cover this which I get
sometimes with some of my other things
so sorry about that but to do it
completely is gonna take him some time I
sandy sandy was the only person that
wanted me to do a special sunday live
stream so thank you for that I didn't do
it ronen jump look I die Oh landed on my
head boy that's a very inconvenient way
to land on your head ello
so how do I get over there this is the
door that opened no did I just you can't
run in this game Canyon no everything's
the same speed I just do some can I jump
that far jump a good thing I didn't go
back and waste more time
um no I don't post my code on github I I
just do it on my website it's just I
supposed to jump on that feel like I'm
gonna die but let's try it I didn't I
okay okay can I move this thing all
right there's a great be getting giant
ball can I move towards it what happens
touch it no I can't and that's it that's
as far up as I go so let's try going
something you're supposed to be able to
say okay so I guess
I'm gonna be making games soon using
mana game and unity after i'm done
covering c-sharp I haven't decided if
I'm gonna call some air if I'm going to
cover Sumerian yet or not first I'm I
could cover this manner and I just don't
know if I'm gonna cover it before games
are on talk to you guys tell me what you
want I do whatever you tell me
if you didn't see the previous videos my
superpower is that I have very good
ankles very good knees and I can jump
pretty well and I can breathe underwater
alright so we got that OOP can I come
down here and do something with us fuck
i'm getting quite get down there am I
supposed to get down can I come over
here
can't get there
I supposed to open that first and does
this kill me hopefully I wasn't supposed
to do that first because I'm not ideal
how I get down there unless I feel like
this and I get there now is there
something on the other side of this vat
yeah there's a switch
pull lever first I just look to the
right and set full the levers and what
happens
and it closed
ok mi fess to pull the lever again if I
swim down here it takes a while for it
to get going yeah I think that's it
letting it down there in time
and now I'm yeah whoa all right oh I
lost all my clothes oh that's what they
were looking at okay naked what do they
do if I fly over here real close nothing
okay ooh this is nasty am I supposed to
pull these plugs out here let's see no
idea what's go okay we're seeing it has
happened as I could die hmm these things
are trying to get me not very
anatomically correct here oh and I died
I think oh I'm controlling the blob this
came his so strange
yes it's made out of human bodies or
something like that it's fancy escape is
just nuts okay can I pull this
this is a strange game everybody's
afraid of me
let's take it down they're gonna pull
this off
this game is completely
hey can i suck them up no they don't
want to be part of this I'm gonna join
this party of blobby monster parts I
don't think I can't jump no I can't I
can grab I can't jump though no I guess
they're gonna have to help me up boom
throw me up there
game is completely nuts
it's oddly satisfying I guess can i suck
any of these other guys
am I supposed to jump up there
I love the noises the people make I'm
gonna be quiet and say you can hear it
I love you period
that's gravity I guess I use this the
climb
I'm sorry this is just google insane I
can't jump though can I oh I can roll
really well ate it with legs to mash
potatoes me
mashed potatoes run wild in the
cafeteria
its existence hey who's this just the
man in charge my supposed to did just
run over I guess
I don't know if I sucked it oh I think
that's what's left to them nasty that's
an eric s I'm supposed to be able to get
through G figure it out boom okay i
guess the store is reinforced
oh there's a switch up there but I can't
jump hmm ok can I jump nope whoo there's
the remains of the CEO of XYZ
corporation
can I pick this up kind of like do
something with this
I'd like to know who is supposed to
press that switch can I hoist it up
there
did it whoop best I assume this is what
I'm supposed to do because there's
nothing else I can do gigantic ball of
mashed potatoes and press hey did that
oh god I'm not really worried glad you
thoughts can I do anything go dawgs no
can I hit them with my gigantic pillar
chewed me up and freaking out
run
I made it was the father Oh somehow I
don't think I'm gonna be able to climb
up these this ladder nope only one where
to go cool can I smash this guy no he oh
I can't get through there
see all right okay i'm away don't pay
any attention all yeah sure i'll give
you plenty of time to get there and is
he helping me escape i tried to beat the
dogs with the bar didn't work do i use
through the hole i don't think i'm gonna
fit in that hole dream on there's
nothing else to do so there's people
helping me escape or they're leading me
to a trap one or the other can I go down
date a man
hey is this a one of this now whoo okay
so that's not one of the things with the
fan I guess my body parts just fall off
as I walk around am I supposed to take
this with me I think I'm gonna take it
with me just in case I feel like I might
help able to go but what is that there's
a leak ahead with arms this part is very
hard okay what's hard about it boom I
can't smash well there's this precarious
thing here can I throw that and can I
throw it up there again was it doesn't
really look like a switch Brody Oh
I wasn't very hard somebody told me that
was hard I was hard oh don't tell me let
me try to work it up okay done working
oh don't forget your box I need that box
that's just to open us up oh it's on
fire something tells me I can be burned
let's find out
mm-hmm it's not let me in okay so i
don't know if i can be burned
just throw the Box in there stop the
fire not looking at comments right now
and now the boxes
I don't know I supposed to do something
with the burning box he obviously fire
water trying to put my box out try not
wet the box fire
I throw it over top of it
hey I don't know if I'm supposed to burn
on anyway let's try that
50 box
and
Roy your mom
oh you're wrong Center
I don't get it passed here I'm gonna
probably check it's all right
throats
that's it again
what am I supposed to do with a flaming
box vote at this
roading still into it I know Castle it's
Betsy what else we're gone
throw it up there
hey some happen alright cool
this is a ps4 game called inside but I
think you can play inside on anything I
know it's on xbox something I said I
think this is becoming slowly becoming a
thing where you want me to try the
hardest games ever witness which is
supposed to be the hardest puzzle game
and super meat boy which is supposed to
be like the hardest game ever in the
history of video games I am home I'll
try anything but definitely not it's up
to you guys you tell me what you want me
to play if you decide that you would
prefer to torture me above all else okay
I don't know thinking can I oh it
probably wants me to jump up on that on
this and then jump up on that if that's
possible let's find out there's a switch
I climb up on this I can't jump this
doesn't look like it's working
try
no idea
let's just push it the whole way over
and then try to pry that down maybe okay
hmm I can't jump hmm there's actually a
square right here telling me that it
wants something together let's try again
the little boy was sucked into the
gigantic pile of mashed potatoes or body
whatever mashed you and NATO's I don't
know I don't know what the name would be
idea how'd he get up here or maybe I'm
not even supposed to get up here
confused is there something else
something else I'm supposed to pull out
of here ah oh that isn't it hmm
flex
can't be it am I supposed to can't grab
it and pull it let's try it
he is he has like a hawk can i push this
over and then run over
you guys have any ideas tell me in the
chat because I don't know I've never
played this so occasionally I just get
stuck it on with a dick stack the carts
on top of each other I haven't tried
that mean I've kind of felt like i was
using up the wall that's what I wasn't
no I cannot lift those up I can lift one
of them up but I can't stack them
somebody says they want to hook it so
they want me to swing this over cannon
died in any way move this
get to another there's no new control or
new ability I have being the smashed
potato blow nope try lifting it I'm
reading your comments no can't they go
somebody says push it to the right okay
oops keep the stuff in one cart into
another okay no there I can't get the
stuff out of the court
hmm
am i able to get another fire box
somebody said I had the right solution
but it didn't work okay maybe I wasn't
grabbing on to the right part of the
thing maybe that I grabbed this part oh
oh that goes I think okay figured that
out don't know why I didn't then work I
guess I needed to reach towards the
beginning of the thing and I was
reaching directly underneath or
something I don't so I got lucky and it
work hey
Oh push it
so tell me what game you want me to play
after this because i'm bound to
determine to beat this game tonight
hmm
I'm trying to grab this because if you
pull on the top of this box it like Oh
am I supposed to throw it over there I
can't
okay he helped me out so everybody's
helping me out tonight
boink okay that work oh ok so i have to
move quickly
you could just hit a switch on your end
that would open that door but no let's
do it this way hey Rana all right
there's like a whole bunch of people
here supposed to grab that I can't it's
for curiously out of reach I think oh ok
was a trap all along they were just
acting like they were helping me but in
actuality they were forcing me into this
cell i'm guessing where does this go i
guess it goes down this is the end
somebody just wrote this is the end I
can't imagine yeah it was a trap that's
what I figured it was oh the cushion
came off can I pull this up
another cushion and can I pull this off
this can't possibly be the end
please don't end this game today well
well I'm trying to do it there's fish
it's very beautiful my swimming it's
amazing
alrighty out of the water I'm supposed
to go this way or that way let's go
quickly just see if there's something
over here to look at boxes kind of pull
them no I cannot okay just like I said
wants me to go to the right it's
beautiful
I have absolutely no idea what the
meaning of this game is
somebody said there's an alternate
ending to this game I just fell down and
I run down and smash out of here hey now
falling down a hill alright and now i'm
at a beach and i cannot move I can't
move at all do anything I'm blob a
mashed potatoes sitting on a beach can't
do anything hitting all the switches
somebody wrote the end this can't
possible to be the end is this seriously
the end this is the strangest game
officially that I've ever played in my
entire life um I the little boy didn't
even come out did he yeah i mean he's
like is he coming up i'm hitting all the
buttons if you can't determinism I don't
know what determinism means this is it
I somehow feel like something for
displayed a huge joke on me the little
boy doesn't come out of the game this is
it or out of the blob even what does
this mean mrs. fake news they are out of
the factory it's the end this is the one
on there's a secret ending
okay I guess that's it I'm sitting here
looking at the credits just in case
something happens in the meantime okay
what game do you guys want me to play
next just tell me in the comments cuz I
can see them I know I feel like I've
totally been trolled this is like you
try to escape ultimately you just become
a blob of bodies on the side of a beach
and you can see this was made in unit
made by unity this is completely insane
the witness FIFA now I'm up I'm up
playing sports games I'm mainly gonna
try to do story based games so I keep
seeing there's an altered and give this
game okay well how do you get to the
alternate ending everybody just keeps
telling me will witness over and over
again that's what you want to see I will
give it a go alright I guess that's the
end of the game I still can't move okay
so thank you for joining me this has
been quite interesting and at least I'm
happy I finished it and I'm gonna look
into what the alternate ending is I have
no idea so uh thanks for joining me
tomorrow Resident Evil nightmare because
I was dared to do it and like always I
have no pre-planning I'm just playing
these games fresh cuz you know what's
the point of doing a live stream if you
don't do that
and it looks like the witness unless you
guys leave comments in the comment
section below telling me to play
something else basically you guys asked
me to play dark souls I'm actually going
to play a little bit of dark souls
before I do the thing because it's
ridiculously hard um whoops sorry um but
I think probably the witness will be
next and then whatever else you guys
want me to do so thanks a bunch and you
guys are super cool for joining me here
and just like always leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
