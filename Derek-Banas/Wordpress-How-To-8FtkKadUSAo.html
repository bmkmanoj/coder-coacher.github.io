a lot of requests and a lot of questions
in regards to how to do very specific
things in WordPress in this tutorial I'm
going to answer all of the questions
that I have recently received also on
the screen you see links to other
tutorials in which I answered your
WordPress questions one of the most
common questions I get is how to speed
up the process of posting inside of
wordpress now of course I'm sure you
know how to post a wordpress by just
clicking on add new in WordPress just
like that but there are other more
simplistic ways to upload articles
meeting other people's articles inside
WordPress like for example let's say I
wanted to copy this article right here
on to my wordpress site it's actually
very easy using a tool called press this
you can easily set up press this for
your use by just looking for tools in
your left side bar after you're logged
into WordPress and just clicking on the
tools link that's provided here and then
where it says press this right here
where this link is just right click on
it and say bookmark this link and of
course save it and after you do that
press this will be available in the
bookmark section where you just chose to
say if that bookmark all I would need to
do is to highlight the text that I want
to have saved to my website just like
that then jumping into the bookmarks
area where I have the press this
bookmark and click on it it's going to
automatically pull over the title and
all the text that i highlight it let's
just say obama / solar panels okay i'm
just putting some keywords in right here
i'm gonna select a category and i'm
going to hit publish that's all that's
to it and if i jump over to my website
and hit reload you'll see that it's
right there available for anybody to go
as my website to see but also this is a
legal way of copying other people's
content because press this automatically
puts a link back to the original article
right there and also if that website put
their address in the title it would also
be included there so that's a very quick
way of copying content but I'm going to
zoom over here again and just sort of
show you other things you can do I'm
going to act like I want to repost this
article which are not going to
but if you click up here next to the
word add you see insert image and if I
do that it's going to show me all the
different images that are available for
me to insert if I would so choose and of
course I could give a name to those
images as well and it would
automatically put them into the post
right down here and also if there were
any videos to embed it would also
provide that option but there are no
videos in this specific article another
thing that I've received requests on in
regards to press this is the fact that
there is no more tag now if you look at
the website here let's just jump back
you see here where it says read more
that's automatically built into this
theme but if you don't have a theme that
automatically will add this read more
tag it's gonna put the whole entire
article just going to make it very hard
for people who are going your website to
see exactly what content you have on it
this is just a test site by the way so
if I want to put the add more tag so
that it puts an abbreviated version if I
don't have that built into my theme and
by add more I mean this little guy right
here see normally if I would click on
add more see it's going to put a little
tag in here just like that I'm gonna
undo that why can still do that inside
of Preston to this by just clicking one
in the HTML tag right here and let's say
I wanted the add more tag to show up in
here I would just put a caret symbol and
I'm going to zoom in to make sure you
can see this fall going ! two dashes the
word more two dashes and closing caret
symbol and if I switch back over to
visual you can see that the more tag is
right there so that's how you use the
add more tag inside of precipice when an
even faster way to post inside of
wordpress you need to install a plug-in
called WP o matic and this provides for
the automation of posting inside of
wordpress and i'm going to show you
right here if I click on campaigns
inside a WP o matic it'll actually show
how to set up a campaign you just give
it a title I need to find what feeds you
want it to pull articles from just like
that and then it'll actually automate
the entire process this makes the
process of posting extremely easy all
you do is hit campaigns and then hit
fetch and it'll pull articles from all
of the different RSS feeds that you
defined that we r 0 posts available at
this time but normally it will say 10 or
two
six or whatever posts fetched and it
will automatically throw them on to your
website these are actually posts that
were sent over there from WP o matic so
that's another real easy way to post
inside of wordpress it's either in an
automated fashion or just simply by
clicking and opening up your dashboard
inside of wordpress clicking on WP
automatic and hitting fetch and it will
pull a whole bunch of articles so those
are the three different ways to post
inside WordPress also I've gotten a lot
of requests in regards to how to install
themes inside of wordpress like a theme
such as magazine is not available in the
normal location in WordPress where you
would post themes being appearance and
then clicking on themes and then
clicking on install themes and then
clicking on featured for example to see
all the different themes that are
commonly used inside of wordpress and of
course you could just click on preview
to see if that theme would look nice for
your current website and what it would
look like and so forth and if you decide
you like that theme just click on
install and then activate and boom the
themes in there but for themes such as
magazine which are not available in that
part of WordPress what you need to do is
I just went ahead and downloaded
magazine you can see it right here well
if you download it and unzip it and then
open that folder up and you see files
like this bunch of PHP files you know
that you can easily install this theme
inside of wordpress by just uploading
the zip file and how you would do that
is to jump inside WordPress click on
install themes and instead click on
upload and then browse to the location
of said zip file being my download area
and then finding the magazine theme zip
file I can double click on that and then
just hit install now and it will work
what happens if whenever you open this
guy up instead i'm going to show you
milano see Milano has two folders inside
of it that means you need to not only
upload the theme of mallanna but you
would also need to install these plugins
for it to work properly well you're
going to have to get yourself FTP
software this is filezilla in this
circumstance and then what you're going
to need to do is locate your wp-content
folder inside of wordpress as you can
see right right here double click on
that and you
see you would install the Milano theme
in this folder and then the Milano
plugins in this folder so I'm going to
jump over here click on mallanna open up
the themes folder and then upload Milano
and then jump out of this folder jump
into the plugins section open up the
plugins folder and then you would want
to install all of these folders into
your plugins section for those themes to
work properly so those are the three
different ways that you would install
themes inside of wordpress also go to
roll auto requests and regards to how to
upgrade wordpress basically what you
want to do is go to your web address
with a forward slash WP dash admin
forward slash upgrade dot PHP you want
to type in whatever your your web
address is followed by the rest of all
this stuff and if you get a message it
says no upgrade required that means you
do not need to upgrade WordPress but
what if you decide you want to if you
want to force an upgrade i'm going to
show you exactly how to do that inside
of godaddy it's obviously gonna be
slightly different depending upon who
hosts your wordpress website what you
simply want to do is log into wordpress
and then click on hosting and left side
bar and then click on launch next to the
web address that you want to force the
upgrade on then you want to click on
your applications right here and then
you want to click on manage my
applications the right sidebar opens up
here on the screen and then you would
want to click on update now these are
actually installed already and upgraded
but godaddy does not consider a
wordpress installation upgraded unless
it does it you just hit update now and
it would automatically upgrade your
wordpress installation for you another
question that I get often is how to back
up your database inside of wordpress
well again you're going to go through
the same process to you get right here
click on launch and this is inside of co
daddy and i would say you should
definitely backup your database however
your hosting plan tells you to do it and
not in any other ways because i saw a
lot of people mess up their sites
backing up the database on their own by
copying everything to the desktop or
into a folder what you want to do
instead is use
hosting companies way of backing you
know and then go daddy just go to
databases click on mysql then you want
to click on this little pencil icon it's
right here and then you want to hit back
up and then hit ok and it will back up
your database for you so that's how you
backup databases got a lot of questions
on how to install WordPress as well and
then I provide links to two different
ways to do that over here you're going
to see the quick and easy way to install
WordPress if you are hosting on godaddy
and over here you're going to see the
harder way if you are not hosted at
godaddy and that pretty much answers all
the questions that i've received that i
have not answered so far in regards to
how to use wordpress if you have any
other questions or comments leave
