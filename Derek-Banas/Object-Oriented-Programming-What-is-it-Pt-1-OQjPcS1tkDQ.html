completely through what exactly
object-oriented programming is what will
be covered
why has object-oriented programming
become the standard way to program
how does object-oriented programming
differ from procedural programming what
is an object what is a class what is
inheritance what is polymorphism and a
whole bunch more
first off object-oriented programming
makes your programs more flexible and
understandable that is why it is used
and in this presentation I am assuming
that you have at least a minor
understanding of programming in general
or you might get a little bit lost
please refer to the jobs for a tutorial
than is listed above first off with
procedural programming a programmer sits
down and asked themselves what does this
program have to do and then it lists out
all of those functions in a row
object-oriented programming instead asks
what things are in this program and what
functions must those things be able to
perform as well as what variables should
be associated with those things here's
an example of the procedural programming
that's trying to emulate a car all cars
drive forward so the procedural
programming goes in and creates a drive
forward function also all cars stopped
hopefully and also they honk their horn
so the procedural programming goes in
and creates these three functions to
emulate a car an object-oriented
programmer would instead go in and
define an object named car and then
afterwards define those functions that
object car should have just like the
procedural programming the ability to
drive forward stop and honk so what
happens whenever someone comes in and
says well I want my car to have a
different honking noise than this other
car well if you're a procedural
programmer you would go into your home
court function as you can see here and
the final a bunch of the ifs
so if car a is chosen you would honk a
certain way else you would go in and
honk differently for car B if you were
an object-oriented programming you would
just just simply define two new
objects of the type car what would
happen is all the functions and
variables you defined for your
superclass car would have automatically
become capabilities that car a and car P
could use but in this circumstance car a
and car B are going to override the honk
horn function described in car class and
honk differently let's say that after
you change your honk function you will
now have to go in and allow four
different cars to drive forward
differently for example if it was an old
terrain vehicle procedural programmer
would go in just like before and create
a whole bunch more if statements the
object-oriented program it doesn't need
to touch any of the working code just
like before and just simply goes in and
defines new functions that give the
all-terrain capabilities to those cars
that would happen object-oriented code
is a lot neater and organized as you can
see because if you want to add a new
capability you just create a new
function without touching any of the old
code so what is inheritance well you've
actually just used in hering's
object-oriented programming requires
less code to get things done because of
a concept called inheritance in the
example you first created a basic corner
object then the objects car and car B
were able to inherit all of the
capabilities that all cars have while
overriding those features that differ
the car object above is what we would
refer to as the superclass so what
specifically is a class a class is just
simply a blueprint that describes how to
build many objects here is an example of
a car class you can see here I defined
the class with the keyword class
followed by color then could have an
opening curly bracket followed by three
variables and gin gas tank and door
which all cars would have and then I
gave this car class five functions that
also every car would well what do you do
with this class well you would use this
class then to create additional objects
each object will have all of the
variables that you define in superclass
car as well would have all the functions
that you
find in the superclass car and in
circumstance in which a function that's
defined in the class car would not work
for your specific object you would could
just simply go in just like we did
before and override all those functions
so how do you create an object
specifically most programming languages
create objects in much the same way as I
have described here they first list out
the name of the class followed by the
name of the object you want to create
followed by the equals sign the keyword
new then the class name followed by two
brackets and a semicolon or a more
specific example let's say we wanted to
create an object named Dodge of type car
class you would you simply follow the
example I have here on the screen settle
how do you access those variables or
methods within your class you would just
simply use the dot operator so how do
you access to those variables and
functions within your object well you
would use the dot operator as you can
see here in this example I'm able to
access the variable engine by putting
the dot operator between the word engine
and the class name College and then I
also am able to access the function get
gas of object type Dodge by putting the
same dot operator in there what you have
to understand is it's good practice to
not allow somebody to directly be able
to access your variable values in this
case engine gas tank and door so
object-oriented programming believes
that you should actually create
functions that would allow you in this
specific example to access the gas tank
you would use the function get gas tank
anytime you would want to be able to
access and receive the actual value
stored in variable gas tank with this
function as you can see here on the
right side of the screen I've created a
new object called Dodge just as I showed
you know in the previous slide I'm then
able to use object dodge followed by the
dot operator and the function get gas
tank to access the value within the
variable gas tank and then assign it to
the word fuel in tank as
this is what we refer to as
encapsulation with encapsulation you
create two methods for each variable
that you define one of those methods
returns the value and this function is
normally started off with the word get
the other changes the value of that
variable and that function is normally
begun with the word set what you have to
understand is encapsulation may not be
enforceable in your chosen
object-oriented programming language but
I'm not going to get into the difference
between public and private in this
presentation I may cover that in a
future presentation well that's
basically all I'm able to fit into the
presentation here I look forward to part
2 of the object-oriented programming
presentation and if you have any
questions leave them below thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
