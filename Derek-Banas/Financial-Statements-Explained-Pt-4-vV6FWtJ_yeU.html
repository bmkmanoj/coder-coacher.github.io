four of my financial statements tutorial
this is the final tutorial if you didn't
watch one two or three there are links
to them on the screen you should
definitely watch them otherwise you're
gonna be completely confused here
specifically I'm gonna go over how your
books or financial statements are gonna
change when the cost of your inventory
changes as well as first-in first-out
last in first out the cash flow
statement which is the only financial
statement we have not covered so far
fixed assets and how they affect your
balance sheet and depreciation so let's
say the price of your paper goes from
$35 to $40 for the same 50 sheets you
previously were purchasing let's also
say you have a hundred and fifty dollars
in inventory at the previous prices how
do you decide which inventory to use
next and how does that affect your
financial statements well there's two
ways of handling inventory changes such
as this you can either handle that
inventory as a first-in first-out
which is easier to keep track of because
you can quickly get rid of your old
inventory and also provides tax benefits
if your inventory is generally falling
in price and if you want an example of
an industry where this occurs that would
be the technology industry where micah
trips are constantly falling in price or
you can handle this inventory change
with last in first out this is harder to
keep track of because you more than
likely are gonna continue purchasing
that inventory and you're gonna have
inventory sitting around that you
purchased at a lower price meaning with
$35 as we mentioned before however last
in first out provides tax benefits if
your inventory is generally rising in
price and this is most businesses so
just remember first-in first-out that
means you're gonna get rid of your cheap
$35 paper first and then move on to the
$40 paper last in first out you're gonna
need to get rid of the new paper at $40
you purchased first and then eventually
get to the $35 paper so that's the
differences in regards to how you can
handle this inventory change and you can
see here I gave an example of first-in
first-out selling three hundred
caricatures remember we had 150 in
inventory leftover previously and here I
purchased enough paper and markers to
make the 300k
caricatures which I'm demonstrating here
and you can see that you would use
lastin first-out in this search
situation to lower your overall tax
basis so we have 150 in inventory we
bought $300 additional in inventory and
here we're going to be selling 150 from
here and then 150 from here which is
going to leave an additional ending
inventory of 165 dollars because of the
pricing changes and our total cost of
goods sold is gonna be three hundred and
fifteen dollars because we are only
going to leave behind the more expensive
inventory here and we're going to be
using the cheaper inventory first that
means that your overall gross profit is
going to be larger with first-in
first-out than it is over here with
lastin first-out
and you can see here here's the $150 in
inventory in ending inventory the least
expensive inventory and that came from
up here because we did not use it and if
we take out the same amount for rent you
can see right here now this is a small
purchase small money sort of situation
but you could see if you were spending
hundreds of thousands of dollars how
this discrepancy or this change in
overall net profit that would be created
here would grow quite large so again
what we're doing with lastin first-out
it was we're making our net profit or
our earnings look smaller but as I
mentioned in previous tutorial ventually
that catches up to the company so that's
the difference between first-in
first-out and you can see here again I'm
going to go very specifically through a
first-in first-out financial statement
over here we have our income statement
over here we have our balance sheet so
how did we calculate cash in this
situation well we took our previous cash
amount which was four hundred ninety
dollars we took out our raw materials
which was three hundred and thirty
dollars that we purchased take out our
rent and we add back in our net profit
which comes from the income statement
right here and that gives us our final
cash amount of eight hundred sixty-five
dollars and our remaining raw materials
of one hundred and sixty-five dollars
which we take from ending inventory so
that's how you move things from the
income statement over to a balance sheet
well you can also see here how raw
materials were affected remember we had
150 in raw materials we purchased three
hundred thirty dollars of additional raw
materials and we subtract out costs of
goods sold to get our fine
raw material amount or you could just
pull this off of ending inventory and
slap that in right there and finally
earnings week to date was found by
subtracting out our rent adding in our
net profit 945 which came from right
here and our cost of goods sold which
comes from right here and that is how
you get the 390 dollars in earnings week
ending for a first-in first-out
financial statement meaning an income
statement and a balance sheet when you
add all these up of course this is a
balance sheet so everything balances and
you have last in first out here again
same sort of process or just pulling the
information from the income statement
over to the balance sheet and this is
how we're able to keep our earnings
straight remember most of the mistakes
made by people who are just starting in
accounting is in earnings week ending
that's why we use the income statement
again previous cash four hundred ninety
dollars raw materials three hundred
thirty dollars which we get right here
from our cost of goods sold - our rent
plus our net profit nine hundred thirty
dollars that's how we get our final cash
amount and you have raw material 150
dollars again you can just pull this
$150 right here from ending inventory
and slap that in there but this is how
it's calculated right here nrm means raw
materials and C OGS means cost of goods
sold and then again you create earnings
week ending by subtracting out rent
adding in net profit from down here and
then subtracting out cost of goods sold
which is right here on the income
statement to get your final amount of
three hundred sixty dollars and again
add all these up you get a thousand
dollars as you can see right here and
here are the final balance sheets and
you can see the differences between
first in first out and last in first out
and how it affects as the earnings and
how it affects everything right here
which would be a difference of thirty
dollars that you wouldn't have to pay
taxes on now I'm gonna get into the
final statement which is the cash flow
statement I'm going to take you through
this bit by bit by bit so here is our
beginning balance sheet that we have
from previous and what I'm gonna do is
this is what it's called a cash flow
statement now cash flow statements all
look different I don't have anything in
here in regards to dividends and so
forth and so on but this is the basics
of what a cash flow statement looks like
and how it will affect your balance
sheet and cash flow statements are used
just like income statements are used to
keep your earnings week-ending straight
cash flow statements are you
use to keep your cash straight so I'm
gonna skip the earnings here first and
I'm gonna jump down here to accounts
receivable collection meaning that you
receive $50 cash from a previous
accounts receivable right here which was
$50 owed to you on credit well that
person paid you the full $50 or you
processed the credit card or whatever so
what happens here we're gonna add $50 to
cash which I did 915 and we're gonna
delete out the amount in accounts
receivable and because all the
transactions were only done on the left
side and nothing really changed we just
move this number from here up to there
everything is still in balance then you
see on the next screen now we're going
to take both an inventory investment
means that we purchased $150 in
additional inventory and we subtracted
out our rent for $240 I'm gonna do this
all in one fell swoop what I did was I
deleted $150 from cash as you can see
here as well as deleted $240 from cash
so I added those two numbers together
deleted them from cash and then I
increased my inventory level right here
from $165 to 315 by adding in 150
dollars and that's where that is and
then I deleted 200 for $40 which was for
my rent from both my cash as well as my
earnings we tending to get a final
balance of $840 here I'm going to
purchase a fixed asset whenever you
purchase any fixed asset all you do is
delete the amount of the fixed asset
being $120 from your cash amount as I
did right here and then put in the value
of said fixed asset which we're going to
depreciate here in a couple slides and
then we come down here and we come to an
Accounts Payable which is a short-term
loan for $200 whenever we do get this
loan all we're going to do is put $200
over here into accounts payable and then
increase your cash amount by said $200
and then after you do that you can now
or at least this is the way I'm
demonstrating this jump up into earnings
take the $600 that you have up here in
net earnings because you subtracted out
everything else here and you want to add
that $600 to both cash which I did here
as well as to the earnings weekend and
see this one's from 202
800 whenever you balance everything out
it comes to 1640 so that's a basic
walkthrough of a cash flow statement and
how it affects your overall balance
sheet and in regards to fixed asset you
have to understand the following when
you purchase a fixed asset you decrease
cash and create a fixed asset on your
balance sheet that's all you do whenever
it comes to depreciation which is the
reduction of cost of a fixed asset over
a period of time now you depreciate an
item because it either becomes useless
because of wear and tear or it just
becomes useless because it's old
technology either way what I'm gonna do
is I purchased a $120 easel and I'm
going to depreciate that by 10 dollars
each month and it will be fully
depreciated within one year so I'm going
to take $10 off of the fixed asset on
the Left if we jump over here I'm gonna
take $10 off of here and I'm gonna
subtract earnings week-ending over here
by $10 each month so that is how you
depreciate fixed assets you take them
out of
earnings you do not touch cash so this
will go down $10 every month and this
will go down $10 every month until this
no longer exists so was that easy to
understand is there anything
specifically I should go over again
leave comments below I will answer any
questions that you have and if there's
anything else you want me to cover in
regards to financial statements or
investing more or whatever I can provide
my opinion remember I'm not an
accountant I'm just a former stockbroker
but I'm willing to help and I do have
that knowledge so hope this was helpful
to you and until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
