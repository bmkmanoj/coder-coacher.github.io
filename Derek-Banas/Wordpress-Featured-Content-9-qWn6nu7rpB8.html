9 of my wordpress featured content
tutorial this is the final part by the
end of this tutorial everything will be
done and you'll be able to use this
featured content tool that you see here
on the right side of the screen right
now hold your breath this is what it
looks like right now from all the code
that we did but by the end of this
tutorial it's going to look like this
and it's not going to take too long to
actually create it so the first thing
I'm going to do is I'm going to jump
into index dot PHP because I want this
to show up in the blog section of my
wordpress file but I don't want to show
up anywhere else and I'm just going to
put in some code and this is going to
have to be typed in every single time
somebody wants this featured content
tool to show up inside of their website
so I'm going to just create a variable
here and i'm going to say git log info
if you haven't watch previous parts this
tutorial definitely check that out
otherwise mass confusion it's actually
be a very fun tutorial create what i'm
doing here is i'm just getting the
actual location for the WordPress
directory so whatever that's being
stored and I'm going to be doing a lot
of really neat kind of things here that
I haven't done previously with WordPress
I'm just going to add to this variable
and put on the end here the location of
my plug-in and again this is just going
to be copied and pasted every single
time if somebody wants to use this or of
course if you want to use this plug-in
and we're going to create a new variable
again page and this is going to link to
all the PHP code that automatically
dynamically is created each time a new
file is created where a new featured
content post is created and there is the
location for it one dot just a simple
text file and then again linked to my
style sheet so that that's all
automatically pulled into you can see
I'm just using that plug-in folder again
and I'm just accessing other folders
inside of it or other files in this
situation and then we close off our PHP
code and make sure there's no whitespace
before this or after that otherwise
WordPress has a fit wank each reference
is equal to Coulson PHP code echo out
screen MTT plugin style this is the
location for the stylesheet blows off
the PHP section stylesheet type equal to
text
CSS if you've stuck in there through
this entire tutorial I'm absolutely
amazed and leave a message below
wherever you're at so I like to read
your messages it's really the main
reason why do this now I'm going to link
out to my JavaScript code which we're
going to be making a couple minor
changes PHP echo I'm just going out to
screen the directories that I created
before plug-in folder close the PHP j/s
/b turd content dot j s and then closed
off that script if there's anything this
tutorial you haven't understood
definitely tell me because a tutorial
this big and this complicated might be
worth doing another explanation of the
run-through so that you guys completely
get exactly what I'm doing here this is
quite a lot of work and if you know how
to do this and you've understood what
I've done all along chances are you're
going to be able to pretty much do
anything you want with WordPress that's
really cool well here what I'm doing is
I'm going to actually jump out and get
this file up here meet your data one dot
txt that's what I'm going to do here in
the previous tutorial we created that
file dynamically well now we got to jump
out there and get it and display it on
the screen this is just basic PHP code
page and then echo TT stored FC like I
said this is going to be the same every
single time and we're done that's all
you got to do with index dot PHP and
actually all that you would normally
would have to do if you want to use this
plugin is just copy and paste this exact
stuff right here right into index PHP
and it's automatically going to show up
so now we're going to go into the actual
PHP file now that we have that saved
make couple changes inside of here so
this is where we began this is where it
all started and there's a link in the
underbar if i haven't mentioned that now
the first thing we're going to do you
remember previously i had a whole bunch
of information that was printed out to
screen whenever the person loaded the
featured content tool inside of
wordpress in the dashboard area and it
starts right here we no longer need all
of that garbled up math so I'm going to
just select it and i'm gonna scroll the
whole way down cuz this was mainly for
testing purposes i also scrapped 10th um
i decided not to use tim thumb and we
can come the whole way down to this and
delete that whole entire thing so that's
all going that was there for testing
purposes it fulfilled its duty but it's
worthless we don't need it anymore so
like a told you we got rid of Tim thumb
so I'm going to have to scroll down
through here to NT t make FC pages which
is this guy right here rule down until
we get right here where we were coming
in and messing around with Tim thumb
well I decided not to use Tim thumb so I
don't need to do any of these things
anymore this is all kind of convoluted
anyway I'm going to leave this the same
but I'm going to come in here and i'm
going to delete everything else and then
i'm going to make a couple changes so
ntt featured image so this is just a URL
for the featured image close that off
alt is equal to close that off and TT
use your content info bracket TT post
number 0 close that off so what we're
going to do is we're going to get the
URL for that featured content and if you
look right here on the same screen right
here is the title so that's what's being
stored in that part of the array so
we're going to make the alt the title &amp;amp;
M this is going to be the URL then we're
going to come in here ntt featured
content info comma what the heck let's
just copy this paste it inside of there
I'm just going to add on to this guy
let's scroll up so you can see this a
little bit better so then we're also
going to link out to the title so space
title info so i'm doing is assigning the
titles and the alt tags and all those
different things nothing that crazy goes
off that bracket get the title glass is
going to be equal to n TT featured thumb
clothes off that guy clothes off the div
and there you go so that's all the
changes i need to make now we don't have
to worry about Tim thumb I figured it a
much more interesting in a way of
figuring out how to scroll and create
thumbnails some point in the future I
might go back to Tim thumb then what we
need to do is I had to figure out a way
to be able to pass over there not only
the total number of featured pages but
also pass over the WordPress URL folder
directory to my JavaScript files so what
I decided to do is actually to create
hidden input tags and pass all that
information that way cuz I kind of
thought I thought it was a interesting
way of doing it so I'm going to come
down here where I define my right arrow
I'm going to create a couple more of
these guys and in the link to the code
that's in the underbar is much better
calm in it so to the end of this
featured content page i'm going to
create those hidden inputs tight was
equal to
giving us a name of total FC pages these
are just going to be values that's it
they're going to be passed in this guy
just the first way I could think of to
be able to pass that information over to
my javascript file we get a class name
equal to n 2 t total FC ages if you
don't remember from before what i mean
by the FC pages is this is a page right
here with five featured contents this is
another page and this is another page
there's three of them so I want to be
able to track how many of those there
are and like I said before this is just
the first easiest way I could think of
to actually be able to do that well I'm
also going to pass over the directory
for WordPress so I have to go get that
you can't do this with JavaScript so I'm
gonna have to get PHP to do it for me
and how you get the directory for
WordPress is git log info I just did
this little bit ago URL and there you go
now you have that information so we want
to pass over this information in another
hidden file so we just copy this save
ourselves a little bit of time paste it
inside of there and then we're going to
just change this name right here to WP
underscore you are l underscore dir and
then after value we want to change this
to this right here so let's just copy
this and paste that in so now all that
information is going to be available
over in my javascript and i'm also going
to give this the same class name so copy
and paste inside of there and i just
want to draw a special notice to this on
whenever you're programming on a local
host with wordpress you have to directly
point at the location for your files
however if you created this inside of an
actually hosting company on a server you
would use this so this is used on
hosting company and this is used
whenever you're developing on localhost
so i just want to point that out it's
kind of important and that's all that
you need to do for the PHP code to
perfectly work so now we'll jump over
into featured content the javascript
code and like i said before how we were
able to pass over that information and
from PHP well now we're going to
actually grab it from the hidden file
let me use some jQuery code here and i
called it ntt total FC pages so that was
the name for that guy or the class that
was associated with that
hidden input box and then if I want to
get the value that I assigned to it I
just go Val right like that so now I'm
able to get that again this is going to
make everything much more dynamic well
later on I'm going to want to actually
get a hold of the WordPress directory
inside here so I'm going to much like I
just did click create another variable
this is in javascript jquery or we want
to call it using a little bit jquery a
little bit of javascript and TT i called
it WP URL directories are there and now
i just type in val again and that gets
me all the information that was stored
over here so see antiquey total FC pages
NT TWP URL directory these hidden things
i want to jump over here and i'm getting
them right like that so that's how I'm
able to pull all that information over
then I'm going to make a couple changes
to the function called change feature
content so let's just scroll down
through here and find that and this is
the function it's going to be called any
time there's a change to the featured
content tool in any way we just got to
scroll down inside of here till we find
picked full size we're going to do is
we're going to do some other really kind
of neat things first I'm going to
retrieve the alt for the thumbnail
that's clicked so the alternative that
is assigned to each one of these little
thumbnails over here so how do I do that
you alt thumb clicked so what I'm doing
is I'm going to change dynamically so
that whenever the featured image is
clicked on see if i click on it now
nothing happens what I want to do is
there is a link that surrounds it so I
want to dynamically change that link
that's what I'm working on here and I
also want to dynamically change the link
for read more so that's what I'm working
on that's what I'm going to do here so I
go equal to this is a reference to
whatever triggered the event so whenever
the thumbnail over here was click that
triggered an event so what do I want to
do and when I jump in here and I want to
go i want it whatever alt is equal to to
be saved to that that's all I did there
they don't want to retrieve the URL for
the anchor that surrounds the featured
picture up here there's anchor tags it's
around out so that whenever they're
clicked on you get sent to the proper
post so ntt a link to post so that is
the anchor tag that surrounds this
featured post here has a class name of
an TT link to post and I want to make
sure I put a dot in there to reference
that it is a class
then I want to say that I want to
specifically target the anchor tag that
surrounds this featured pick up here
based off of whatever the value of alt
was for the thumb click below so how do
I do that well if you want to reference
variables that are inside the JavaScript
code inside of jQuery you have to put a
single quote followed by plus and then
type in whatever this guy is equal to
seriously if you guys are getting this
what I'm talking about right here you
are really a pretty good programmer I
mean it hope you understand what I'm
doing here then what I'm saying is the
anchor that surrounds this featured pic
i pasted off of the alt tag for the
thumb that was clicked that made the
future pick up here a change what I want
you to return is the link associated
with it I'm actually going to jump in
here and grab this this is the div
called ntt featured pic that surrounds
the featured image that you see right
here so then there is an anchor tag that
surrounds the actual image which is
right here so what I'm saying is when
somebody clicks on the thumbnail I say
what is the alt tag for that thumbnail I
want to find the featured pic that has
the same alt tag so if i click on ghazal
regards to thumbnails it's going to
change the featured picture to whatever
alt matches gazelle and then it's also
going to change or grab this H reference
to the actual post for gazelle and it's
going to make that be the page that is
opened when somebody clicked on the
featured image like I said I'm doing
some things here that are absolutely
insane so that's what I'm doing there
i'm getting the source for the anchor
tag that surrounds the featured image so
hopefully that makes sense again if it
doesn't leave a comment and i will go
deeper into this then what i'm going to
do is I'm going to hide all of the other
anchor tags link to post and this is an
anchor tag ntt link to post so this
class is in reference to all of the
anchor tags all the anchor tags have the
same thing then what I'm going to say is
if the alt tag does not equal the alt
tag for the thumb that was clicked on
alt underscore thumb clicked
I want to hide all the other anchor tags
so the only anchor tag is going to show
up on the screen is going to be the one
where it equals that guy then I'm just
going to copy this because I want to
show the anchor tags that are equal or
have the same alt as the thumbnail that
was clicked down here so I basically
just got rid of that ! making this equal
and then instead of hiding I'm going to
show it and then down here because I got
rid of Tim thumb going to come in here
create a regular expression Don I'm
going to say that I want to get rid of
any characters as well as source and
equal for whatever this featured image
is going to be right here ok so I got
rid of that as well and I'm pretty much
done I just have to come down to the
next function get featured content and
what I'm going to do here is link out
and automatically dynamically grab all
the featured pages that were dynamically
created basically going to be copied and
pasted and a whole bunch of things so
remember whenever I had my PHP code jump
out there and grab the wordpress folder
URL well that is stored in this variable
so to make this all dynamic so people
don't have to change the folder they're
going to be retrieving this information
from because they're obviously going to
be in a different website than I am in
I'm going to go to WP content forward
slash plugins or H last NT t featured
content to /j s and then featured
underscore data one text which I
actually could have just left from right
there but either way there you go so I
got that all set up and now I'm just
going to have to copy and paste this a
whole bunch of times so here's featured
data 6 i'll paste that in there and just
change this to six down here change this
is six it's right here i'm not going to
have to change to anything still one
change this to feature data 11 and then
down here change this guy and now all of
that is done all the javascript is all
set up perfectly so now i basically just
have to jump in here and change some of
the CSS code and then I am all done ok
so I saved all the changes that we made
before you can now see the featured
content tool starting to look more like
what we want this is exactly what we
wanted to look like
and now i'm going to change this guy
with CSS and get it perfect so over here
is the one we're going to be editing or
this and on the right side of the screen
is a CSS code for this so I just got to
come in here and change a couple things
really simple stuff so if I want to make
it larger just type in 1000 this can
stay the same just can stay the same
that's actually go away then relative
this is going to have to change the 424
so I'm just positioning everything this
can stay the same this I'm going to
change to a background color instead of
an image so that that works a little bit
nicer so I'm just going to copy what i
have on the left side of the screen
again absolute 40 pixels that to that
that i'm just looking through here to
see what's different so on color i have
white so change that the white here i'm
going to have to move the title over to
the right a little bit since i made this
guy larger so just change that to 345
we're basically just copy what's on the
right side of the screen that's all I'm
Dylan here here's the horizontal rule
absoluta you can see here the only thing
that changes there is white again so
change that to white and also i guess
the width is going to be a little bit
bigger again I'm just copying from the
right side over to the left side
everything else is going to be the same
here for this excerpt except I want the
color to be white so change that the
white change this to 385 scroll up the
article excerpt again copy from right to
left so this has to be white just change
the text color and then the width is
going to be 385 this right here 285 265
this is going to have to change the 285
everything else is the same then we get
to the featured pick absolute it's going
to have to move over 400 24 pixels so
that it fits because again this is wider
or just copying this thumb box absolute
top that's the same this is going to be
for 24 though 576 86 background color is
going to be different so let's just copy
this paste that into their keep on
scrolling thumbnail frame relative
relative 5858 da da da da here I'm using
overflow hidden because this is going to
actually contain all my thumbnail images
so what i did was i pasted them into
this div right here
here and then I said any overflow or
since the thumbnails are going to be
bigger than this actual frame that's
only 58 x 58 we're going to hide all of
the difference that's going to be the
only thing that's going to be different
on the left side versus the right side
and I can actually come in here and get
rid of that guy now for this featured
thumb I'm actually going to leave this
on the left side of the screen because
again I'm positioning it inside of this
div so I'm going to let everything else
here be the same and let's scroll up to
the very bottom here ntt left button ntt
right button I'm going to be 438 pixels
from left side of screen and then I want
to make the opacity a little bit
different for this so that it fades into
the background color I'm going to be
doing the same thing here for the right
button so let's just change it right now
and then this is going to be 9 71 and
that is all of the changes so if I file
save that and then we reload this guy
you can see now that the featured
content tool that we just created in
this series of tutorials is identical to
the one we have over here in future
tutorials I am going to continue
creating this news theme which actually
isn't going to be that many more videos
leave any questions or comments below I
like reading your comments otherwise ill
