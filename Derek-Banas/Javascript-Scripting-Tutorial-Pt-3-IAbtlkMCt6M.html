JavaScript scripting tutorial today I am
going to actually redo the last part of
the tutorial to see if you guys like
this format better so please comment
below and that will influence the way I
do tutorials in the future well I'm
gonna teach a whole bunch of things
about JavaScript today this is the file
you're gonna be working with I know it
looks really simple but it actually does
some pretty complicated things and it
uses a ton of different tools in
JavaScript that's why I'm using it what
I'm gonna teach you specifically in this
tutorial is exactly how to make this
line of text when clicked not only
perform a whole bunch of actions in the
background without reloading the browser
but also change the line of text as you
saw I just did right there okay how did
I do it well let's start at the
beginning first off to insert a script a
JavaScript file or code into your HTML
page you can either link to an outside
javascript file or embed the script
directly into the page itself I chose to
actually embed it which I normally never
do but I did it this way just so I can
explain everything to you now you don't
actually have to define the type tag
here because browsers in general think
everything between script tags is
JavaScript but it's considered good form
and you can see it's not gonna take that
long to type that in then what am I
doing here with this line well you if
you some HTML tutorial you know that
this is a HTML comment meaning that
everything that lies between this tag
right here and this tag down here is
gonna be ignored by HTML why did I do
that
well some browsers do not allow for
JavaScript to run on it and some people
have JavaScript shut off because they
think it's a security threat so what
this comment is gonna do and this
comment down here is block all the
JavaScript code from being seen at all
for those browsers that do not record
recognized JavaScript okay so you
started off with this bracket
exclamation point two negative signs and
to close it all off put two forward
slashes a space two negative signs and
this closing bracket right here so
that's how you would hide all of your
JavaScript
then what did we do we understand that
this line of text right here is actually
right here
as you can see here's the HTML tag which
lies inside of the body while the
JavaScript code would lie between the
heading tags in your formatting of your
web page so what does this guy do well
here I'm defining a span which is an
inline version of a div and if you don't
know what a spanner div mean you should
watch HTML tutorial it's free okay so
what i'm doing here is i'm giving this
span an identification name of if span
e^x and then on click what it's going to
do is it's gonna send the value 1 and 4
to a function named testing if value and
that guy lies here but a full version of
them lies down below here's the full
version of the testing if value as i
said i pass the values 1 and 4 to this
function and this is how you create a
function you started off with the
keyword function the name of the
function the name you want to give it
you can give it anything and then I'm
going to accept two variables what am I
doing here creating a variable in
JavaScript start off with the keyword
var followed by whatever name you want
to give it equals sign it's gonna take
the value passed here and assign it to
this variable same things being done
here here I'm creating a new variable
called value to return and it is
actually a string and I'm assigning it
between these two quotes a blank space
as a value and remember you have to end
all of your actions within JavaScript
with a semicolon and here I'm creating a
variable and not assigning an ax value
then we come down here to an
if-then-else statement if you don't know
what that is
what it does is it checks for a true
value meaning in this case that value
passed 1 would be greater than value
pass 2 and by you passed 1 is not equal
exclamation point equal sign to value
pass 2 if that is true what would happen
is all of these actions here would be
performed meaning value to return would
be assigned to the beginning of its
string of text the
whatever value is held in value past one
then what you would do to add this
string right here to this value is put
in addition sign then we have the double
quotes here and here and then I attach
the end of that string value pass to
whatever the value of that is and then I
have signed this whole entire line of
text to this string value to return if
this was not true
what would happen is you'd skip all this
code here whole way down to this curly
bracket bracket and jump to the else
statement then we would perform another
if then else statement and if that
wasn't true we jumped out of this else
statement and perform this statement
right here by default then what are we
gonna do we're gonna send this value
this identification number and whatever
the value of value to return is to the
function and edit noted text but before
we do that I need to explain you what
the document object model is to
understand this code you have to
understand what the document object
model is or Dom the Dom allows you to
access all of the objects that lie in
your HTML code every web page is
considered to be a document object so if
the browser considers the whole webpage
to be a document object how can we work
with an edit the HTML by manipulating
the document object well HTML documents
contain text images links CSS style tags
form elements etc these tags are
referred to as nodes in the Dom
JavaScript can be used to manipulate
these HTML elements by referring to them
by their defined HTML ID name so knowing
that now we can see here that I'm
passing the ID name to this function for
processing let's take a look at that
spam code again you can see here's the
span code and here's the ID name that I
passed whenever we performed a click on
this span and this is the function that
that information was sent to so here's
the identification number which is going
to be if span e^x and here's the new
text that I am going to be working with
well remember everything in HTML and the
document is referred to as a note well
here I actually called the variable node
but this variable name could be anything
you want but how you access that node
and perform actions on it is you refer
to the document the whole HTML page
followed by a dot operator then the
function get element by ID and then
input the identification number for
whatever node or span in this case that
you want to edit then what am i doing on
these two lines of text this is a while
loop which I'm going to explain a little
bit later basically all you need to know
about a while loop is it performs an
action over and over and over again
until whatever is in here returns a
value of false what we're doing here is
we're referring to the node followed by
the dot operator and then this value
first child this is also another node
but just to make it simple just think of
a node as a box and the first child is
the first box inside of that node what
I'm doing here is I'm checking to see if
there's any other boxes of data inside
of the area where I'm gonna paste my new
text that was sent over here and what
this while statements going to do is
it's gonna say is there any boxes inside
of this node right here meaning is all
of this text broken up into individual
notes or is it just one big giant node
it's gonna come here and it's gonna go
through and look for nodes of this big
node each time it finds text inside of
this it's going to use the remove child
function to delete any children or boxes
that would lie in this area after it's
performed these actions and will then
come down here and use the function
append child and it's going to take the
new text that was passed over to it and
using the create text node is going to
create a new node inside of this span so
that whenever somebody clicks on this
guy
it goes through and processes all the
information and rewrites to the screen
without calling a new page it just does
all of this on the fly so how do we go
from clicking on here to having all this
stuff change
basically what happens here is I have
this set up within of what is called an
event handler what an event handler does
is it says when somebody does something
on my web page I want to be notified so
that I can run some functions well the
event handler used here is the on click
event handler and you can see that by
looking right here on click is equal to
followed by a double quote there's a
double quote and what it's gonna do here
is and whenever I click on this span or
a visitor your website does it's gonna
call this function testing if value and
it's gonna pass the variables 1 and 4
and this here is just the text that lies
between the span tag which you see right
there so you might be asking yourself
are there other ways that I can compare
data most definitely god right here here
are all of the comparison operators that
are available to you in JavaScript and
that is basically everything I'm going
to cover here today if you have any
questions leave them in the comments
