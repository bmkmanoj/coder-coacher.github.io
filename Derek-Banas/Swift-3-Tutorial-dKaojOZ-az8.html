updated Swift 3 video tutorial in this
one video tutorial you're going to learn
the core syntax of the Swift 3 language
through a ton of example code basically
it's like seeing a 300 page book in one
video and like always in the description
I have a link to all the code as well as
a transcript of this video and also
you'll find there timestamps to all the
individual things that I'm covering so
there's no need to watch the entire
video all at one time you can watch up
to a certain point and then go back
click on a timestamp and learn
everything you want to know and I have a
lot to do so let's get into it alright
so probably one of the first things you
want to do is verify that you have an
updated version of Swift so one way you
can do that is just in your terminal you
can go x-c run swift and - version and
you can see right there I have Apple
Swift version 3.0 point - there's no
difference between 3.1 or any of these
other different things so I have an
updated version of Swift if you do not
you're going to want to open up the App
Store and go and download Xcode for free
or update it or whatever and then you
will be all set and ready to program
with Swift once you do what you're going
to want to do if you want to do what I'm
doing is go file and new and then come
down here and click on playground and
specifically we're going to be
developing for Mac OS but Swift is the
same everywhere and then give a name to
your playground and click on next after
you do that you're going to see a screen
that looks like this right here is we're
going to put all your code over here is
the playground area that's going to
output data as you are placing it in
there and then down here is going to be
the console just to get some things out
of the way this is a comment and this is
a multi-line comments and like that and
now let's start writing some real code
so the very first thing I want to do is
import coca and this is going to give us
access to the coca framework that we're
going to be using here and also I am
going to import Darwin and this is going
to provide a whole bunch of random
functions going to look that I'm going
to need whenever I'm written code here
bar is going to be used it's
to declare all of your different
variables that the value could
potentially change so what I'm going to
do here is just define hello which is a
string of course you could also come in
here and define that in fact it is a
string just by putting a colon in there
and string but otherwise it's going to
know that just from based off of the
data that you provide of course you're
going to be able to come in here and
easily combine strings so let's go hello
plus world and you're going to be able
to print to the screen just by coming in
here and you go hello and backslash and
whatever variable you want to print out
you can see over here on the right side
of the screen everything's printing out
and over here at the bottom
everything's printing out all at the
same time and now that I got the basics
out of the way I'd like to talk about
datatypes now let is going to allow you
to define a constants so let's come in
here and define a constants right like
that you're also going to be able to
declare integers and I'm going to get
into all the different data types here
so let's say my age colon and int that
just means it's an integer you're going
to be able to see the minimum and
maximum values you're going to be able
to store inside of here so I'm going to
say min int and I'm going to be working
with 64-bit ents so let's go and get to
the minimum value and then let's also go
you can see right there that value and
let's also come in here and let's get
the maximum value so we'll just put max
in there and then max right there there
you go
now you have the minimum value for
integers as well as the maximum values
now let's come in and define a float I'm
just going to use PI again here and
float there we are
and likewise you're going to be able to
define doubles so come in there like
that's a double is equal to three point
four one five just keep it the same
let's go and get the minimum max for our
doubles so let's just grab this guy
right here paste that inside of there
and let's change this to max double or
min double let's do min so min double
and then to get that you're just going
to replace that guy right there with dbl
and then
have to replace this all together so
just put underscore and min and then
we're going to also get the maximum
double so maximum double and max so
there you go now you can see the minimum
Devils as well as the maximum doubles if
you want to get the maximum float you
have to do something a little bit weird
I'm going to show you how to do it so
max float backslash once again if you
want to put anything inside of there so
you go float and then you're going to
say greatest finite magnitude and there
you go now you're going to be able to
figure out the greatest or the largest
float that you can use inside of Swift
and let's talk about some bullying's
here next bullying's of course are going
to be able to hold only true or false
values so let's go and have canned votes
and boolean is equal to true you're also
going to be able have characters so
let's go my grade and character is equal
to a you're going to be able to cast
different values so let's go and have
three and define it as a double 2.0 and
then have var two and have it be an
integer equal to two and then we'll go
and create five equal to three plus and
I'm going to do it the wrong way without
the casting just to show you that there
is an error so three plus two is equal
to five and you can see everything went
haywire down here reason why those do
two different data types if you want to
fix that just come in here and go double
like that and there you go now you're
going to be able to work with those and
likewise you're going to be able to cast
two integers so we'll go prints and I'm
going to go throw three inside of there
like that
and backslash and convert it to an
integer of course and it will throw 3.14
inside of there and you can say that
that all worked all right so there's
just a rough overview of using variables
and different datatypes and I'll be
covering a lot more in multiple
different examples and now I want to
talk about conditionals so you're going
to have a bunch of comparison operators
I'm sure you're aware of you're going to
have greater than you're going to have
great less than you're going
greater than or equal to less than or
equal to equal to and not equal to
likewise there are two additional ones
you can have three equals and this is
going to check if the two things being
compared are pointing to the same
reference and then this is going to
check if they are not pointing at the
same reference okay now let's talk about
if so let's go to create a age variable
and it'll be int and give it a value of
eight and then what I'm going to do is
depending upon different conditions I'm
going to come in here and do different
things so I'm going to say if the age is
a less than five in that situation I
want to print to go to preschool all
right got all that set up else if and
here we're going to check if the age is
equal to five in that situation once
again we're going to print out go to
kindergarten all right and likewise else
if and here I'm going to use a logical
operator called an x' and I'm going to
say if the age is greater than five and
both of these have to be true for this
condition to pass on age is less than or
equal to 18 and you can see the curly
brackets are just in surrounding all the
code that is going to go along with that
condition and then going to come in here
and calculate grade so go integer is
equal to age minus five and then we'll
come in and print out that information
so we'll say go to grade and then go and
get whatever the value is that is stored
inside of grade and then we will have
our final defaults and in this one I
will just say everybody else go to
college all right and you can see the
answer is actually go to grade three
already put it down there and there it
is down there all right so just to run
down to those guys let's go and talk
also about the or logical operator so
I'm going to say that I want to
if somebody is going to qualify for a
college grant so I'm going to create a
double here and I'm going to put in
12,000 and I'm also going to put in a
GPA and make that a double
also and we'll just have it be 3.7 and
then we're going to say if this person
qualifies for a grant so we're going to
say get grants and throw that in there
and put this in here and put that the
air and we're going to say income less
than 15,000 or so either of these can be
true GPA greater than or equal to three
point eight and once again you can look
over here to see the output as well as
at the bottom alright so that's how the
logical or operator works and let's also
talk about the not operator basically
the not logical operator is just going
to turn all trues and falses and all
false is in truth so I'm going to say
not true and we will throw naught inside
there and there we go so there we are
now you can see all of the different
ways of working with both the comparison
operators and the logical operators now
let's take a look at the ternary
operator
we keep age inside of there for a couple
examples so I'm going to go in here and
say can drive and what the ternary
operator is going to do it is going to
assign one or another value is depending
upon a condition I'm going to say if the
age is greater than or equal to 16 and a
question mark if that condition is true
then can drive is going to be assigned a
value of true and you can use things
other than true and false of course you
can have these be numbers or whatever
you want you can see there the answer is
false
so that is a basic ternary operator so
now let's look at the switch operator
which is basically used to match a
limited number of values and one thing
that is important to understand is if
you do get a match that doesn't mean
that it's going to fall through after
that match you're only going to have one
match unless you use something called
the fall through which I'm going to show
you here in a second so let's say we
of an application that is going to allow
you to define that you have an
ingredient and then it's going to give
you recommendations on the type of
things you can eat with that ingredient
so we'll go to switch and it's going to
check for the values of ingredient and
here what we're going to do is we're
going to say that in the situation in
which they say they have tomatoes or
they have pasta we are going to say
that's a match
so that basically works that way let's
get rid of that oops let's put the
double quotes around that okay there we
are now I got that set so what we're
going to do here is just print out a
recommendation for something they can
eat so I'm going to say spaghetti and
there we go
so they got a recommendation if you
would want it to continue not only check
it's not even going to verify well let
me do this first so let's come back here
and we'll say case beans maybe I'll just
show you an example rather than talking
about it so in this situation we're
going to come in and say burrito is an
option in that situation and I'll hold
off on the fall through until I get all
this done likewise you could say potato
potatoes whatever and print out mashed
potatoes and then finally you're going
to have a default that is going to run
if nothing else runs and in this
situation a person doesn't have any of
these things we're going to say go drink
a glass of water all right
now you can see spaghetti comes in right
there if I wanted it to fall through and
execute the next thing in line even if
the condition isn't true I would type
fall through inside of there fall
through and you can see burrito went in
there even though my ingredient is not
equal to beans okay don't tell me you
use all the time but something I want to
cover just so that I could say that I
covered everything let's get rid of all
this you're also going to be able to use
switch to match ranges of different
values so let's come in here and let's
go test score and int equal to 89 and
then it is going to go and score this so
we can say check the values of test
score and here we'll say okay
case and we'll say 93 1 2 3 and 100 so
in the situation which is equal to 93
through the value of 100 we're going to
come in and go prints you got an a all
right and then likewise you could do
similar things with all of the other
different values
that's no point we really doing that in
otherwise we'll come in here and we'll
say default and we'll say print you've
got an F when I sent a nod for happy it
actually goes back as you got an F but
whatever I'm going to change this to 93
so that everybody can get in there all
right that makes everybody feel better
all right now today all right so of
course you can come in here and do case
through all the other different ranges
but in one waste time on that so now
what we're going to do is we're going to
go in and talk about some math functions
now there are all of the basic math
functions that you're probably aware of
so we can do addition of course and
likewise we're able to do subtraction
multiplication division and modulus if
you ever heard of modulus it is going to
return the remainder of a division you
can see all of the output that we have
over here okay very important however if
you do not do division with doubles
which means if you just put 5 &amp;amp; 4 inside
of there it's going to give you an
integer result so you get a value of 1
back there so just something to be aware
of so make sure that you do that now the
thing that's important is order of
operations so I'm just going to show you
exactly how the program figures this out
so let's say you have 4 plus 5 times 10
is equal to and let's figure out how the
computer figures this out so we'll go 4
plus 5 times 10 all right and that gives
us a value of 54 well that doesn't make
any sense unless you understand the
computers are going to give more weight
to multiplication than addition so
instead of adding 4 plus 5 to get a
value of 9 and then multiplying that
times 10 what it does instead is
multiply 5 times 10 and then add 4 on
Deloitte's quarters if you want to fix
that and have it work in a different way
you just put parentheses around it so
throw our parentheses like that
like that and like that and there you go
now you will get the results that you
were expecting and 90 shows up over
there so real quick thing another thing
that's important is there are different
shortcuts available for you for adding
so let's go and go random an AMA and
make it an integer equal to five you're
going to be able to come in here and go
random num plus equal to one which is
exactly the same as if you would type
out random number is equal to random
number plus five plus one okay so just a
shortcut that's available for you and
likewise you would be able to come in
here and do subtraction and so forth and
so on you can see the results over there
for some reason you used to be able to
come in in Swift and go plus plus to
increment a value for some reason they
got rid of that don't know why so that's
gone on an option anymore likewise there
are a whole bunch of built in different
functions inside here you can find the
absolute value floor which is
automatically going to round down
ceiling it's going to round up no matter
what the decimal is if you pass in two
values Max is going to give you the
maximum min is going to give you the
minimum you're going to be able to find
five to the power of two or
what-have-you
you can also calculate square roots and
logs and a whole bunch of other
different things and of course there's
all of these guys down here if you'd
like to use those functions okay so
quick rundown of a whole bunch of math
functions now I want to talk about
strings
okay so strings are a little bit weird
inside of Swift but I'm going to try to
clear everything up very first I want to
cover though is there are certain escape
characters so you're going to have two
backslashes if you want your but your
back slashes are show up in a string
you're going to have to do that this is
a tab this is a newline which you've
been seeing double quotes and then
you're going to have single quotes okay
so there's just a couple examples of
some escape characters that you'll have
to use in your strings let's go and
create some strings so I'm going to go
random string equal two and then I'm
going to say this is a random string
let's go and create some more so I'm
going to go and create another random
string and I'll show you some different
operations you can perform
and we'll say and here is another
alright so there we go I've got two
strings to work with now of course I
talked about before how you can join
strings so let's create another one
let's go random string three is equal to
and then we'll go random string plus
random string two and there you go
you're able to join two strings out
easily and if you wanted to get the
string length it's pretty easy just go
linked like this and we do our little
back slash and then we put in whatever
we want to measure so we'll go random
string three and then you're going to
say characters and then you're going to
say counts and that's how you can get
the link to the string going to be able
to get the first character in a string
let's go this just call this first back
slash and we'll do in string three once
again and get the first character you're
going to say random string three and
start index say it's a little bit weird
but we'll get used to it you're also
going to be able to get let's say you
want to get a very specific index say we
want to get index five whatever stored
in index five let's go and create that
guy how are you going to get it is go
random string three followed by index
and then you're going to say where we
are starting from when we are searching
through this string so we're going to
start at the start index and then offset
by and five and that will get you to the
fifth index and then we can go and print
it out so let's just go fifth and
Wrentham string three it is very common
for people to go in and write their own
ways of operating with strings inside of
Swift so that you don't have to type all
that out you know kind of a little bit
crazy
oops I have to surround this otherwise
it's all going give me what I want all
right there we go and it comes back his
eye alright so that's how we would get
like a specific index in
of a string we could also check if a
string is empty or not so we'll go empty
and just do a back slash and let's work
with random string just a random string
doesn't matter which one I use so empty
that's going to give me a true or false
value you're going to be able to insert
characters out of specific index let's
go and work with random string too now
and you're going to say insert and let's
say I want to put capital letter A
inside of there I'm going to define what
I want to put and I'm going to say at
and random string too and let's put it
at the very beginning so start index
there we go we're going to be able to
replace that string or the very
beginning of it if I spell insert right
that is insert okay you're also going to
be able to insert a string add an index
so let's go random string to insert and
then you're going to type in contents of
and this is going to be what you want to
insert so I'm going to say just to put a
space and string inside of there and
then throw another space there then
we're going to follow that up with dot
characters comma and then I'm going to
say at and then you're going to define
your string so let's just go down to the
next line so we'll go like this string 2
or you wanted to find your index so
we're going to index once again you're
going to do pretty much the same thing
string to start where you want to start
which is going to be the sort index
that's normally the easiest offset by
and let's put this in be index 2 and
there we go and now we're going to be
able to go prints and random string 2
and there you can see a string and here
is another okay and I put an extra
column or an extra space and I didn't
need to whatever doesn't really matter
and there you can see we got the proper
results you're also going to be able to
come in and get sub strings so I'm going
to go let's start index where I want to
start getting my data from now let's use
string two again you can go index random
string two and start and
X and this is going to define where I'm
going to start defining this string that
I want to work with we get a substring
off
offset by and then in this situation
I'll say two and then you need to define
your ending index for your substring so
I'm going to go and index and let's just
go copy this and paste that inside of
there and then everything else will be
fun and I'm going to say nine is the
ending part where I want to grab from
and then we can go it's called a string
range so it seems good and go start
index is into space dot dot lessons on
the ending index and that's going to
pull all that in I don't think I know
that I said this or not but you know you
don't need to use semicolons inside of
Swift so then we'll go let substring
equal to random string to substring
you'll say with string range and there
you can grab your different sub strings
of chaff and you can see that it grabs
string out of that string that we
defined right there you're also going to
be able to replace a string so what you
want to do first is check if there is a
match so we're going to go if let's here
match I'm going to call this equal to
random string two and range and what I'm
going to look for is the word here so
what I'm doing is checking if there is a
match for the word here inside of that
string and in the situation in which
there is I'm going to go random string
to replace sub range and I can say here
match and it's going to match that guy
and it's going to replace it with there
let put it inside a quote so write like
that
and you can see up let's move us over
here a string and there is another okay
so you can see that it went in there and
replace that value okay so there's a
rundown of a whole bunch of different
things we can do with strings now let's
talk about arrays now of course arrays
are going to store values of the same
type so let's go into find an empty
array here just to show you that you can
do that so just go like this and we're
going to
mind that this is an integer array okay
so there you go you got an empty array
you can check if the array is empty just
by going in here and empty like that and
backslash and then whatever your array
name is followed by is empty and of
course put these parentheses around this
guy I like that and you will get your
results that you expected and there you
can see that it shows that it's empty
you're also going to be able to append
values to your array just by using a pen
and there's five you're going to be able
to add multiple items so let's go array
one and go plus equal to you can add one
or you can add a whole bunch so seven
and nine there you go of course you're
going to need to be able to get the
different indexed values so let's say we
want whatever is in index one we can get
that as well array one just by using
this notation you're going to be able to
change values inside of the different
indexes so let's just have 0 right there
and change it to 4 you can also insert
at a specific index so let's say that we
want to put 10 and the index of 3 just
go at 3 and of course you can remove
items as well so remove at and then
let's just get rid of what we just put
inside of there it's also very easy to
change multiple different values so
let's say array 1 and we want to change
the 0 index through the second index and
put these new values inside of there
when you can do so we can get the length
or the number of items inside of our
racks just by let's go lengths and
whatever your array name is and use
counts you could fill your array with a
specific value so let's go alright let's
go and create a brand new array is equal
to array and repeating and whatever you
want to be put in there and then follow
that up with how many times you want it
repeated
put five zeros inside of our ready to
start off course you're going to be able
to combine arrays just like did with
strings previously so a 1 plus array 2
and this is a for loop here that we're
going to use to iterate through an array
what you're going to do is item is
temporarily going to hold each value of
the array and it's going to do something
with it
in this situation it's just going to
print that item out and you could also
get the index and the value if you would
so like let's put index inside of there
as the name for that and value and then
follow that up with array 3 and
enumerated and now we'll get both of
those guys so let's just keep this
simple
and we will just put it inside of here
index with a colon and then go and get
the value as well and there you go
you can see here whenever you're doing
looping inside of swift over here in the
playground area it's telling you how
many times it's looping and over here at
the bottom it is actually outputting all
of your data ok so I'm talking a lot
about lupine won't we go and do some
more specific example problems using
looping alright so we were working with
arrays let's go and create another array
and let's just get this value of 1 2 and
3 just to keep it nice and simple now of
course you're going to be able to
iterate through your array I'm going to
do it again here just in case somebody
skip to this so we'll go array for and
then we'll print out all of the
different values for our a we're also
going to be able to iterate with a range
so we'll say for I in and then whatever
your range is 1 2 3 and let's go and
print it all of that out we can also use
the where clause to get different
results so we'll say for I in and we'll
use a range here once again 1 through 10
and I'm going to set the condition that
the only thing that's going to print out
or eyes in which we take the modulus of
2 and get a value of 0 so what this is
going to do is print out all
even numbers you can throw any condition
in there that you would like so we go
even and then get the matches for that
and you can see it only printed out the
even values and that's a pretty good run
down a four we're going to do more with
four is a tutorial continues but now I
might as well take a look at the while
loops now with while loops you're going
to come in here and you're going to have
to define whatever you're going to be
iterating over outside of the while loop
and then you're going to follow that up
with Wow and whatever your condition is
so I'm going to say as long as I is less
than 10 I want to continue looping here
I want to show you how continue works
let's come in here and check to see if
this is an even number or not so we'll
say I modulus two is equal to zero in
that condition what we're going to do is
increment the value of I and then say
continue and we'll continue is going to
do is it's going to skip the rest of the
stuff that is inside of the loop and
come up here and start looping again
okay so let's continue likewise let's
say if we want to check if I is equal to
seven and in the situation in which I is
equal to seven we want to jump
completely out of the loop down to here
whatever code follows after this we
would just type in break on track break
alright so there you go and of course to
make this work and actually do something
we'll say print I and then we will also
increment the values of I and there we
are now we're able to go through and it
prints out only the odd numbers and
whenever it gets seven it breaks out of
the loop that's the reason why you don't
see seven there all right so rundown of
while loops why don't we take a look at
repeat Wiles alright so let's do
something a little bit more interesting
let's generate a random number how you
do that is we go I'm going to call this
magic number and this has to be an
unsigned 32-bit integer and we're going
to call arc for random and uniform
1 through 10 is what we're going to be
searching through and then we're going
to say guess and this is going to be an
unsigned integer as well 32 and I'm
going to say our first guess of what
this random number is is zero and now
let's get to the main part we're going
to say repeat and what this is going to
guarantee is we're going to go through
the loop at least one time before the
condition is checked so we're going to
go through and we're going to put down
our guess
whatever that guess well it's going to
start off at zero and it's going to
increment from there so there is our
guess and then we will go and get our
guests and increment it by 1 and then
after this we're going to put our
condition we're going to say wow the
magic num is not equal to the guess we
want to continue a looping forever and
then we can come out of here and it will
say magic number was and we'll put in
the magic number just to show that they
guessed it and you can see right here it
went in and guessed and it came back
with a value of its check for 0 1 and we
found out the value was actually 2 and
now let's take a look at dictionaries
now basically dictionaries store
unordered lists of key value pairs and
let's come in here and let's create a
dictionary here first just going to be
an empty dictionary and we're going to
define that the key is going to be an
integer and the value is going to be a
string now we're going to be able to
check if it's empty of course and pretty
much exactly the same way we've always
checked if things are empty dictionary 1
+ is empty whoops make sure you put in
your backslash and there we go now we
got that back as true we're going to be
able to create an item and let's say we
want to assign the index of 1 to it do
so let's go or the key of 1 we'll just
go dictionary 1 and put that key inside
of there is equal to and then we'll put
something like Paul Smith inside of
there so you have an integer and you
have a string you're also going to be
able to create a dictionary with a
string key so we'll go
customer : and we will go string and
string and define all this and so these
have to be strings now :
and then we'll say something like Sally
marks and then what's going on the next
line and - and then let's have this
person be Paul marks okay so there you
are it doesn't matter what your keys are
your values or anything like that we can
get the size or the number of items that
are stored inside of here exactly like
we did previously
so we'll go customer and count and
that's going to give us that result that
we're looking for you're going to be
able to come in and add different values
so we'll go customer and here we'll say
that the key is going to be equal to
three and let's change this to Doug Marx
you're going to be able to change values
exactly the same way just go like that
and let's change this to Doug the Holmes
you're going to be able to get values so
we're going to do is say if let's name
and we're going to verify that the key
exists so customer and three so if that
exists then we're going to print out
some information on it so we'll go
prints and here we'll change this to
index three and go and get the name out
of there whoops
put a little error inside here change
that comm up there into a colon all
right got that fixed you're also going
to be able to remove a key value pair
just by assigning a value of nil to it
just go and whatever you want removed
all together just put nil inside of
there and of course we could iterate
through a dictionary so let's go for and
let's say we want the key and the value
of course you can get that customer and
then let's just output them on the
screen so there that is let's go and get
our key and get our value and there you
can see it went and outputted those so
there's a rundown a bunch of things we
can do with dictionaries now I want to
take a look at tuples
so let's come in here and basically
tuples are a finite group of values that
it's the values are going to be related
in some ways so let's go and let's
define a constant height and say it's a
double and put 6.25 inside of there and
then we go to find another one for
weights and we'll say this is an integer
you can use different values different
data types and let's create a tuple so
I'm going to call this my data is equal
to and throw height and weight inside of
there but we have to surround this with
parentheses and there's that and there's
that okay so we have that set up
there's tuple we're going to be able to
access these values of course so let's
go get heights and let's get my data out
of there my data and 0 is going to get
you your height change that the
uppercase of course you'll also be able
to name values so let's go let's my data
2 is equal to and throw height inside of
there and then 6.25 and weight inside of
there that is and just to verify that
that works you can go prints and weights
and there this is and we'll go and get
my data too and now you can use weight
instead of an index all right so just a
very brief overview of tuples didn't
want to do too much with them and now
we'll go in and talk about optional now
basically optionals are used to indicate
that there may not be a value so
everything that can have a value of nil
should basically be declared an optional
and this is a great way to avoid a whole
bunch of different errors so how you
declare an optional let's say save our
political party all right this is
something that somebody may or may not
have and how you define this as an
optional is you put a question mark at
the end of it now we can come in here
and go political party and we'll say
that this person decides to say that
they're independent all right so there's
independence assigned to that doesn't
have to have a value could have a value
so if we want to check to see if it has
a value of nil
go if political party is not equal to no
well in that situation we want to get
the value and this is called forced
unwrapping so how we get the value let's
call this party as we go equal to
political party and then to unwrap it to
get the value you put an exclamation
mark at the end and after you do that
you're going to be able to come in here
and actually print this in or print this
out
so we'll just go and get the value of
party and there you can see independent
showed up but it wouldn't cause any
havoc if anything wasn't in there it
would have just been caught right here
we'll we checked if it has a value of no
now you also have optional binding and
it is used to check if an optional has a
value so what we're going to do is go if
let's party equal to political party why
Sarah could have picked something a
little bit easier to type take it away
political party and then we can say
print party and go and get that value
and there that is otherwise we will say
else and just print no party that's that
and you can see independent once again
it gets printed out on the screen
another thing you can do is if a value
is set for nil you can use what's called
a coalescing operator to assign a value
so we'll say let's party equal to
political party and then throw two
exclamation marks inside of there and in
that situation if it does have a value
of nil it will assign the value of no
party otherwise we'll just be ignored so
there's optionals and now I'd like to
talk about functions now whenever you
define your functions let's call this
one get some you're going to have to
define whatever the data types are for
your parameters or a pass inside of here
let's go num2 and then define this as an
integer and then what this guy can do
whenever it's called is output some and
some whatever values were put inside of
it so we'll go number one plus number
two now of course to call the function
all you got to do is go get some like
this and then you go and
sign whatever you want inside of there
so I'm just going to go like this
and I'm going to change this to a value
of five and then I'm going to change
this to a value of six and you can see
it printed all that out on the screen
you can also define your return type and
even define default values so let's go
function let's just use get some two and
then we're going to define this you can
use the same names inside of the
functions they're self-contained
so let's have this be an integer and
then num2 and have it be an integer and
let's give it a default value of one if
nothing is put inside of there if we
want to define that we return an integer
that's how we do that and then in this
situation we can just go in here and go
return num1 plus num2 all right so now
that function is all set up and then we
can come in here and go and get this guy
so there we are you can see it gives it
optional whether I put both of them in
there or not I'm going to say that I
want both of them in there though and
then I am going lips it's just returning
a value so what I should do here is
print this out of course so I'm going to
say sum and it will copy this right here
so we go there throw that in there like
that paste that in there like this and
then change this to a value of 8 in
there and 6 inside of there and in close
that parentheses and there you can see
we've got our result
another thing that's neat is we have
things called muriatic parameters and
what they're going to allow us to do is
to receive an unknown number of
parameters they always have to be last
however in the list it's very important
the last parameter passed so we're going
to do is go function and get some three
and here I'm going to define nomes and
int and if we're going to get it a whole
number we'll just throw it inside of
there like that and then we're going to
return an int here we'll go and define
some and integer is equal to zero and
then will cycle through our results so
we'll go for Nome in norms and get some
and add on whatever the value of Nome is
and then after we're done with all that
we will return the some pop out here and
let's call our functions so I'll go
prints and some and gets some three and
then to define which passing a whole
bunch of different values you're going
to go nomes like that and they go one
two three and four and five seems to be
good enough and there you can see we got
our results so that works off good can
also nest functions however it's
important to remember that the function
that is inside a function can only be
callable by the function that surrounds
it so I'm going to go function to math
and number one and this receives a
double and number two also a double and
this guys are going to return anything
and then I can put another function or
nest another function inside of it let's
call this mult and it is going to return
a double and we can just go return let's
just do divide instead there we are
there's divide and then we'll just go
number one divided by number two works
good enough and then we'll go print
inside of this function outside of the
enclosing function and divide and then
we will call it so divide throw that
right there and it's also going to be
able to access num1 and num2 of course
and close that guy off then outside of
this guy we're going to go do math and
then pass in these different values so
I'm going to say that I want to put in
here a 5.0 and I want to put 6.0 inside
of there and there you can see we've got
our results all right
there's more to do with functions you
can also return multiple values so I'm
going to show you a demonstration of
that let's go to moult's and this is
going to receive an integer and then
after that it is going to return
multiple values so we're going to get
two which is going to be an integer and
three which is also going to be an
integer we will define those so two is
going to
in its equal to number that's passed
inside of it multiplied times two
likewise we're going to do a similar
thing with three you can see it just
this goes a little bit haywire down here
while you're typing ain't good and just
ignore it it is equal to and this is
going to be whatever the number is
multiplied times three and then to
return both of those values we just go
like this and like this now to verify
that that actually works way that we
think it works let's go let's multi
quily
to molt's and the number we're going to
pass in is going to be a gnome and to
demonstrate how that operates and then
we will output it and we go to moult's
and get the value for that and how you
get it is go moult's followed by two and
we'll throw a coma inside of there and
let's go and just output the other one
so malts and free whoops got a little
error there change that the upper case
and there you can say all right so
pretty cool stuff now I'm going to talk
about closures
okay now closures are pretty cool they
are functions basically however they
don't require a name or function
definition so that's great when it's
interesting so I'm going to create one
called square and it is going to accept
and return an int so I'm going to define
it and you can see there's no name
assigned to that and it's going to
return an it and we go equals to and I'm
going to say num in return num times
none so it's just going to multiply a
number times a number and now we come
down here and play around with it so we
can go print and five squared
and call it so we'll say Square and
throw five inside of there and there you
can see went and perform that do
something a little bit more interesting
let's say sign a closure to another
variable and it's also possible now to
assign this closure to another variable
so
say square coffee is equal to square and
it's going to work in exactly the same
way let's just go and copy this guy
right here just to show that it is the
same so square coffee and there you go
you get exactly the same results and
let's do another one
create ourselves a list of numbers and
let's unorder them so we're going to go
eight nine two four one zero and seven
and you're going to be able to access
these values outside of the closure so
let's go and create a function it's
basically going to return a boolean
that's going to state if one value is
greater than another value so we'll go
sorted nomes equal to numbers followed
by sorted and then we can go by and then
go X Y and X less than Y now what we're
going to be able to do with this is come
in here and that's going to
automatically sort all of the values for
us so let's go in here and prove that
that works so sorted nomes I'll give you
more examples here and print out those
values so it whoops just throw odds out
of there and there you can say it went
and sorted all those values for us all
right so really cool stuff let's do more
let's say we want to square every item
in an array you can do that with
something called the map function which
works with arrays so we're going to go 2
squared Nam's is equal to numbers map
and then we'll go numb
int string in and then we will return
that let's get rid of that what does it
do that for string in and return that
value as a string so you just get a num
x num exactly like that and then we can
come down here and go squared nomes and
there it is and there it went and
multiplied all those values times
themselves all right let's do more I
actually just thought of something did
you know you could also return a
function from a function let's call this
function maker value integer it
good enough and it's going to return an
integer int okay so we're going to
create a function inside of here call
this add values and it's going to get
number one int and return an INT return
num1 plus whatever the value is and now
what we're going to be able to do down
here is return add vows so what we're in
essence doing now I don't need to do
that get rid of that Xcode gets ahead of
itself here a little bit what this is is
a function generator let me show you the
example it will make more sense so we're
going to go to let ad for equal to
function maker and then val and for so
what it's going to do is basically
create a function inside of here that is
going to add whatever to before in this
situation to whatever other values are
inside of there so let's go and give you
an example here so you can see exactly
how it works so we can say print and
four plus five is equal to and add four
to five and you can see that it went and
got that result
so it basically generates a function
inside of a function and returns that
function and this function we told it to
generate for us was a function that
automatically adds four to whatever is
passed inside of it now of course you
could change that five and it would add
five you know whatever just something
came to mind something kind of neat so
that's how you return functions you
could also pass a function as a
parameter so we're going to go function
let's call this do math too and I'm
going to put it underscore inside of
there so we go the math func gets an
integer and an integer and returns an
integer oops get rid of parentheses and
this also receives a value that is an
integer we can then go print and some
and call the math function that was
passed inside of it and go value and
value alright we'll run it down here and
it will make a lot more sense so I'm
going to go function ad gnomes and
integer another integer and returns an
integer and all this does is add those
two values together there we are and
we're going to pass those into the
function and then have them work with it
to do that we go do math too and pass in
add nums followed by a value and five
and you can see comes back with the
value of ten
all right so neat neat stuff let's go
and talk I talked about map and how you
can perform same type of calculation on
multiple different values now I want to
talk about filter which is used to
filter out values in anorak so let's go
nomes 2 is equal 2 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 4 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp;
6 alright so there you got it alright
basically what I want to do here is only
get even numbers using filter so let me
go even nomes equal to and nums 2 and
filter and then define the filter so
we're going to go gnome integer boolean
N and then we'll define how we're going
to condition that's going to be met and
of course to check that there you go got
it and now we can come in and just print
out those even numbers so even numbers
there they go and you can see it
filtered out only the events alright so
pretty cool stuff
hey when we talk about reduce also
reduce is going to reduce an array of
values into one value so let's just have
it some all the values in on the rack so
some two and we'll go and perform this
operation on numbers two and reduce and
this is going to be the starting value
for you know the final value so it's
going to start off at zero then we're
going to go X integer and Y is also an
integer and this is going to return an
integer N and then what we're going to
do is just lips what did it do and then
we can go return
Plus why it will cycle through all the
different values in the array and then
add them all together and then we can
come in and just go prints some too and
you can see it went and added all those
values
alright so pretty neat stuff we can do
there now I want to talk about
enumerations now enumerations allow you
to define types with a limited number of
cases so let's go and create one called
emotion and we just list all of your
different options so we could say
something like joy and anger and fear to
stick with the inside-out group here
disgust and sad alright there you go you
got now you can assign a feeling so
we'll go bar feeling is equal to emotion
and let's say we start off with joy all
right now we can of course change the
value so let's say we went from joy to
anger well there you go pretty simple
and you're going to be able to get the
value out of this also so go angry and
then go and get that feeling so just go
feeling equal to anger and you can see
it comes back as true okay it's a very
very brief example just one to cover
enumerations and now let's talk about
Struck's now basically Struck's
are a group of related data so let's
create one here let's call it rectangle
and a rectangle is going to have a
height and make this 0 0 by default and
a length let's also make that 0 0 and
you're going to be able to include
functions inside of it to perform on
here so we'll go let's say we want to
calculate the area we could do so and
this is going to return a double and
then we can go let Area equal to heights
times the length and then return our
area and then let's come down here and
start working with our brand new struct
create a rectangle I'll call this my
rectangle is equal to and then you go
rectangle and then
define your height let's make it 10 and
your link and let's make that 5 and then
we can come in and get the area for it
so let's go print and area and let's
also I'll show you how to get the values
out of it pretty simple just go my rect
height and multiply that times my rect
and get the length is equal to and then
we will get the area from it and you can
just go my rect area and call that
function and it's going to automatically
calculate that for you and there you can
see it went now put it all that okay so
there you go example of structs now
let's take a look at classes and I'm
free no classes or they allow you to try
to simulate real-world things inside of
your applications so let's say we are
trying to define an animal well let's
say that every animal is going to have a
name and we're going to start off with
no name by default and every animal is
going to have a height and we'll have
this be a double and give it a value of
zero point zero by default and a weight
also a double once again zero point zero
and every animal is going to make a
sound of some sort or another and there
that is and we'll get that a value of no
sound at the beginning all right so
we're going to be able to assign those
default values and now to define those
values each time a new animal is created
you're going to do that inside of a knit
so it's going to receive a name string
and a height and a weight and a sound
and then we are going to define those
things so sounds that it is and it's a
string of course then we can assign
those values by using self because we
have no name no way of knowing what the
name of the object is
and you know inside of the class of self
as a way of referring to it so height is
going to be whatever the height was they
passed in and the same for the weights
and the same for the sounds so sound is
equal to whatever the sound was all
right course real-world objects have
more than just attributes they also have
capabilities and those are defined by
our functions this one here is just
going to provide some information on our
animal so I'm going to say prints and
let's go and get whatever the name is
how you do that is go self name is and
then let's go get to the height for it
so once again self height and let's have
this be centimeters tall and weighs and
go get the weights for it well make sure
to put self inside of there got ahead of
myself a little bit and we'll say
kilograms and likes to say and let's go
and get whatever the sound is that we
assigned to us and there that is okay so
there's get info another thing that is
useful this doesn't anything to do with
the animals but I'm just going to cover
it here you can use overloaded methods
and they allow you to basically perform
different actions depending upon the
different parameters that are passed in
so let's just do a simple one here
that's called get some and number one is
an integer and this is going to perform
addition operations on integers and
return an integer and of course to have
it work all it is is return whatever
num1 plus num2 is equal to well just by
changing the datatype of the parameters
we're going to be able to keep the get
some name but we'll change this to
double and now be able to perform
actions on doubles as well using the
same function name
as doubles whoops picture that's global
and there we are and now let's go down
here and let's test all this stuff so
let's create a function or a animal
object called Rover and to do so you go
animal and then you pass in things like
the name which is Rover
and the heights which is I'm going to
say 38 and the weights is twelve point
seven and the favorite sound full Rover
is going to be roof there we are now we
have a Rover animal object whoops I
spelled the name wrong what is wrong
with me and there we go
alright so now that we went and created
that we can then go Rover and get info
like that and it's going to output all
of that information wait a minute let it
do all get info there we are now it's
right and you can see Rover 38
centimeter solvable blah blah blah blah
blah alright so there isn't a very quick
example of how we can use classes and
now I'd like to provide more information
by covering inheritance basically with
inheritance we are going to be able to
define a class that is going to inherit
all of the fields as well as methods
defined by another class so we're going
to use animal of course and you're going
to be able to create brand-new functions
inside of your new class or override
functions also if however you would like
to define a function that cannot be over
in you mark it as final so let's say
that we demand that every single dog be
able to dig a hole in a certain way well
we're going to do it that way and so
forth and so on
so let's come in and we'll just go like
this and self name and then we'll say
digs a hole there we go we defined
exactly how that's going to operate and
let's go in and override our function
this is how you do that
so we're going to override a get info
function and you're going to be able to
call
a method in the superclass so we're
going to be able to go super and call
the get info function in the animal
class just like that but then let's say
we want to provide additional
information like we want to print and
digs holes we could do so all right so
that's just a very simple thing now
let's test out this stuff and show you
how it works so we're going to create
another animal object and let's just go
and copy this on it to type all that out
again so we're going to just do the
whole thing yeah so I'll go like this
paste that inside of there and we'll
just call this spot here this is going
to be a dog instead of an animal and
we'll change the name to spot whoops
what I do and we'll change the name to
spots there it is and let's just leave
everything else exactly the way actually
exactly the same way and now you'll see
if we type in spot here for get info
however it's also going to print out and
digs hole all right so you're also going
to be able to pass subclass types
another thing that is interesting is
this is referenced as polymorphism which
allows you to pass in a subclass type as
if it was the superclass and have the
right method automatically called so
let's go and create a function that does
this
we'll say print get info and it's going
to receive an animal oops
animal type and then it's going to call
get info on that animal type what we're
going to be able to do now is come up
here and is go prints get info and
animal Rover and then we'll do exactly
the same thing for spot and you're going
to say that the correct version of get
info is automatically called say Rover
and spot both of those work out
perfectly all right you're also going to
be able to come in here and change
different values weeks go spot name is
equal to let's say spots now known as
Doug well there you go you were able to
change that easily and
I have to prove it but I think you trust
me oh and I was also going to talk about
being able to use these functions up
here to get sums so that we'll be able
to add integers and doubles let's go and
do a simple little rundown of that now
that is we're calling both of these on
spot you can see here get some get some
except we're using integers here and
doubles here and you can see that those
both work out so it's an example of
overloading and the final thing I'm
going to talk about what classes is how
to check the class type so is spot a dog
and let's go find out if spot is a dog
you can do that just by going spots is
whoops dog right like that and you see
it comes back is true and also you could
come in here and go is spot and an
animal and it also comes back as true so
just some things we can do with classes
now let's talk about protocols now
protocols are kind of like interfaces in
other languages and basically when you
adopt a protocol you agree to define the
potat the different behavior that the
protocol describes so let's go and
create one probably the easiest way so
we're going to call this flyable here
I'm going to define if the getters and
setters are going to be available for
this let me go
flies and boolean and get and set and
then we can define the header for the
function but nothing else okay so this
is fly and we'll say distance miles and
this is a double and it's going to
return a string now let's go and adopt
multiple different protocols so we're
going to create a new class called
vehicle and it is going to be flyable
going to inherit that and this is
yelling at me that's no big deal
and then what we're going to do inside
of it is go var flies boolean and we're
going to say that it is false that this
vehicle is not going to fly then we go
and define name string and have this be
no name whoops
make sure you put quotes around that no
name now we can come in and go function
fly and receive the distance miles which
are going to be doubles and turn a
string of course just like we defined
both and we'll say if self flies return
self name flies and we'll throw in the
distance miles as well
distance miles and then throw in miles
all right else we're going to come in
and say return and so name can't fly all
right so now that we have all that set
up what we're going to be able to do is
let's go and create a Ford f-150 vehicle
and then we can go Ford f-150 whoops
f-150 and define the name for it which
is going to be forward whoops
f-150 and then define if it flies or not
flies and I never saw one fly so I'm
going to have it be false and then we
can call print Ford f-150 and fly and
distance miles and set that to 10 and
you can see no matter what happens it
comes back as can't fly and you can go
in there and play around with that and
check it out see how you can work with
protocols on your own but I'm going to
talk more about error handling
now basically error handling is just
going to be used to handle errors
gracefully so what we want to do here is
I want to define an error by defining a
type of the error protocol as an enum so
I'm going to show you how to create your
own division error and there is the
error and then we can define all the
different potential errors that can show
up I'm just going to have division by
zero be the only one inside error you
can have multiple ones also just by
adding more cases so then on what I want
to do here
is defined that we want the error to get
thrown from a function and how you do
that is you know when I'm gonna have
this be divided this is going to be num1
which is going to be a float and num2
which is also going to be a floats and
then you're going to have to say throws
if it throws an error and then it also
returns a value now inside of it I'm
going to put guard num2 is not equal to
zero point zero else and then i can
throw an error or throw an error so
throw division error and divide by zero
otherwise we're going to say return the
division so there it is and there it is
okay so that guy is going to throw that
here and now what we can do is try to
trigger it now if you want to protect
from errors you want to wrap your code
in what is called a do try block so I'm
going to go do and then I'm going to
call try and call our divide function
and throw in here num1 for number one
i'm going to put a value of four and for
num2
i'm going to throw a value of zero
inside of there then after this we can
catch our error swing code catch
division error which is the custom error
that we created and then what we're
looking for is divide by zero
specifically and if we catch that error
we want to say that we can't divide by
zero and have that output on the screen
and you can say can't divide by zero
shows up all right so there is a quick
example of error handling inside of
Swift now I want to talk about
extensions
now basically extensions are going to
add new functionality to existing
classes trucks and other different types
and how you define them is you go
extension and what I want to do here is
extend a double to work with different
distance units so I'm just going to go
extension and double I'm going to set it
up so that basically the double is by
default going to be
looked upon as meters and then we're
going to be able to convert to other
different distance types using a dots
index so I'm going to also have
kilometers inside of here and we'll go
double you'll see how it works pretty
neat self multiply times 1,000 and close
that off and let's go and get this like
this and create a couple more of them
just for the heck of it let's also do
conversion for meters which is basically
just going to return itself because
remember I said we want to have meters
be the defaults and then we'll also have
feet and in that situation we will
multiply whatever the value is times
3.28 and then we'll also have inches and
we will multiply whatever that is times
thirty nine point three seven I think
I'm going on or not right doesn't really
matter all right so we're also going to
be able to come in here and add a method
so that we can add additional
functionality to double so what I'm
going to do is go mutating function
square and this is going to return a
double I can just go and calculate the
square for this so multiply the time
swell ourself and return the square and
now I'll go and show you some examples
to make more sense so let's say I want
to convert one meter into inches I can
do so let's go and have this be one
meter is equal to and 1.0 point
inch and then I can come down inside of
here and go prints one meter is and get
that guy one whoops meter it's not on
its upper case 1 1 meter inches whoops
let's change this into inch messed that
up
now I'll fix it you see 1 meter is 39
point 37 inches and let's also go in
here and use our square function so go
bar random number 2 is a devil equal to
5 and then we can just come in and go
prints and go square of
five random number two and call square
on it and it's going to automatically
calculate that which is also very cool
all right so here you go guys that is an
immense amount of information about
Swift three hope you guys enjoyed that
and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
