elixir video tutorial in this one to
tour I'm going to cover pretty much what
you would learn about a lick sir and a
standard 300 page book I'm going to
cover the core syntax in a language from
which everything else is built in the
description underneath the video you'll
find timestamps - all of the different
parts of what I cover in this tutorial
so you don't need to watch it all at one
time you could watch it and then come
back to it and take your time also in
the description is a link to all of the
code in this video as well as a cheat
sheet and it is heavily commented and
you should get it and take notes as you
go through it to properly learn this
language and also inside of there is a
link to a tutorial on how to install
elixir on both Mac OS and on windows and
I have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so I'm using atom just like I
showed you how to use whenever I showed
you how to install elixir and I have
either the terminal or the command line
if you're on Windows everything works
exactly the same and I have a file here
I called it a lick sir touch dot e^x I
don't know if I put this over there you
can see elixir TX and I'm just going to
start writing code so the very first
thing you're going to do is you're going
to create your module which is going to
hold all of your functions and to do so
you just go define module and see
everything popped in there I'm just
going to call this M just to keep this
nice and short now functions that you're
going to define are going to start off
with DES and then you're going to have
your function name now you normally
don't have a main function in elixir I'm
setting it up this way however to make
it easy to work with now what I want to
do is I want to ask the user for their
name and then I'm going to output it and
how we receive input from our user as we
go
iö gets and then you can put either
parentheses inside here or not put
parentheses I'll use parentheses
sometimes I'll use them sometimes I want
so I'm going to say what is your name
and put a question mark in a space and
then outside of this I am then going to
trim off the newline and to do that you
just go like this and you go string and
trim and I'll get rid of that newline so
now we have there
am and it's stored inside of the
variable name and basically variables
are going to start with lowercase
letters or underscores and then they're
going to contain uppercase letters
underscores or numbers so if I want to
now output this information I go IO puts
and here I won't use parentheses and
I'll go hello then I can use string
interpolation or just it just provides a
way for me to take the variable name and
insert it inside of the string that I'm
going to output on the screen I'm going
to put name inside there and as you can
see there are no semicolons no periods
no nothing and if we save this now we're
going to go over into the terminal or
command line I'm going to type in ie X
and you can see everything loaded up
there nicely for me also look - well
I'll cover this you can if you want to
abort or get out of this you just tick
control C and then a and you're out of
it obviously you want to make sure
you're in the directory where you have
your file so there that is and you would
type in dir on Windows if you're using
Windows instead and what I want to do
here is clear that out again so I'm
going to go ie X so we can execute this
then we're going to put in a sea with a
quotes around the elixir cut part here
and then we're going to come in and go
module name followed by the function we
want to execute which is main it says
what is your name and I type in Derek
and then it says hello Derek okay so
really nice simple little application we
can run here so now let's go and do
something a little bit more complicated
I'm going to call another function I'm
gonna call this a data stuff and call
this function and then we're going to
create it down below let's get rid of
this so we don't junk up our screen with
all this extra code so come down here
and create a new one and what we're
going to talk about now are the
different data types
now basically you're going to use the
different data types such as integers
floats atoms ranges binaries lists maps
to bulls and a couple other different
ones I'm going to cover all of them in
its tutorial and once you set a
variables value that value cannot change
so let's first stop start with an int
well first off let's create our function
so I'm going to go define and I'm going
to call this data stuff and do and then
inside of it we'll go
and create an integer I'll call this my
n is equal to one two three and if you
want to find out what type of data it is
you just go IO and puts this is going to
output it and we'll say integer and then
we will go and check if it is an integer
and throw my int inside of there and I'm
just going to compile this it gave me a
silly warning don't worry about it right
now and then I'm going to come in and
execute it and you can see integer true
comes back right like that let's go and
do a similar thing with floats and it's
also important to understand that with
integers there is no maximum integer
size so let's create a float here
instead and 3.14159
and we'll check if this is a floats and
you can do this with all the different
data types here I'll just go is float
and I'll go my float and execute this
guy will save it first and put her here
compile and run and you can see that
float true comes back you're also going
to be able to work with atoms and an
atom's name is going to be the same as
its value so let's just come in here and
let's just create and add them directly
inside of here
so I'm going to say atom and I'll say is
atom guessing you probably was guessing
and this is an atom right here so
Pittsburgh is an example of an atom the
name for it is exactly the same as the
value and I'm going to show you a whole
bunch of examples here that are going to
make all of this make a lot more sense
let's come in here and do that and you
can see atom true comes back also it's
important to know that if you want to
use spaces inside of your atoms you're
going to put a colon like this and then
double quotes and let's say you want to
use New York there you go
once again the name is the same as the
value and likewise you're going to be
able to define ranges and here I'll just
define one but I'll show you later on
how to use them so you go to 210 is
going to be equal to and you go one and
then two dots and ten alright so that's
the basics of the most basic different
data types that are available to you and
now I'm going to talk about strings
all right so I'm going to change
this function named do stuff and do
stuff just to keep it generic now
basically strings are going to be
defined with double quotes so wills go
and create one call this my string is
equal to and my sentence and there you
go you got yourself a string now you're
going to be able to get the length or
number of characters inside of your
string just by using length so I'm going
to go I owe puts and I'll put length
inside of here and then I'll go and get
that length and to do that you have to
type in string followed by length and
then you throw in whatever your string
name is and I'm going to execute these
I'm going to do a bunch of these in
animal executed all ones we're also
going to be able to compare strings or
actually I'm going to show you how to
combine strings first so let's go and
let's create another string let's call
this longer string Antibes on it we're
going to go my string and this is how we
combine or concatenate strings put a
space inside of there two more of those
brackets and then I'm going to say is
longer there you go now you have a
longer string let's also come in here
and let's compare string so we'll say
that the throw let's see if these are
equal to each other
aimes you can do all sorts of things
inside of here with string interpolation
you can execute different things and so
forth so I'm going to have an uppercase
a version of egg and then I'm going to
use three equals what that does is it
checks to see if the value as well as
the datatype or equal whenever you use
three equals you just have to it's going
to check if the value is equal and
ignore the datatype so I'm going to use
lowercase egg here in that situation and
we'll run this and let's check out
what's going on that the duh once again
don't pay attention to little warnings
and I'm getting and you can see here the
length comes back is 11 and the equality
comes back is false why because that's
an uppercase e this is lowercase e all
right we're also going to be able to
come in here and check if a string
contains another string so let's output
this on screen again so I'm going to say
my is my contained inside of here and
let's go and verify and check that we're
going to use string again and we're
going to say
contains and you're going to put a
question mark here at the end and you're
going to say does my string contain the
word my and we'll execute that in a
second here and you'll be able to see
exactly how that works for us
you could also return the very first
character inside of here
so we'll say first character is what
we're looking for and we'll say called a
string and we'll say first and my string
once again we're going to be able to get
a character at a specified index so
we'll say what is that index for to get
that we go string at and then you pass
in the string you want to search through
and the index specifically that you're
looking for you're going to be able to
get sub strings so go to substring and
then inside of this again we're going to
use the string library here or string
module and its name is slice and to get
it you go my string the string you want
to work with the index you want to start
at and the number of characters after
which that you would like to work with
and come in here and we'll execute it
and you could see is mine the string
true yes it is what is the very first
character M what is that index for E and
you can see here we started at the third
index n this is zero-based so this is
going to be zero one two three and then
we want to get eight characters one two
three four five six seven eight
okay so pretty neat stuff we're also
going to be able to come in here and
split a string into a list and what
we're going to use here is inspect and
what inspect does is it prints the
internal representation of a value so
what we're going to do is we are going
to split the long string with at the
point in which there are spaces inside
of it and we're going to convert it into
a list more unlist later on but inspect
is going to allow us to sort of see what
that internal representation of a list
looks like we're going to go a longer
string and then we're going to define
what is going to split all of those guys
and
second here get a couple more things
going and then look at that output
you're going to be able to reverse
strings so let's go and reverse this guy
I'm going to go
string and reverse and we'll throw a
longer string inside of there we're
going to also be able to use uppercase
so let's do that this is going to be
just all we need to do is come in here
and get this and change this to up case
we're also going to make all the
characters lowercase and to do that we
type in down case we're going to be able
to capitalize just the very first
character and have everything else be
lowercase so capitalized and that gets
you that and also something else that's
kind of neat to be able to do is to know
that you're going to be able to pipe a
values from one thing to another so
let's say I want to multiply four times
10 and then I want to pipe it to a
different function we'll do more
examples of this later on but basically
go like this and let's say I wanted to
perform this this Megan you know this
code I want to execute this code and I
want to pass it to puts so that it
outputs it on the screen I can do that
and this very functional language and
we'll run it and it will execute it and
you can see all the different things we
did here this is the string the list
representation inside of elixir you can
see that was printed because we used
inspect you can see here we went and
reverse everything uppercase lowercase
capitalized and then 40 comes back
because we went and perform this
calculation and passed it to puts okay
so that's a one down a lot of the things
we can do with strings now I want to
show you briefly with some of the things
we can do mathematically and there you
go I went and put these in here a little
bit to save some time we're going to be
able to add values of course subtract
multiply divide this is going to be
division integer division so it's going
to get rid of any decimals and REM is
the same as modulus it's going to
basically give you the remainder of a
division so if we come in here and we
execute that and we run it you're going
to see all of the output right there for
the math functions and there are tons of
math functions logs and power functions
and E and
all of different cosine signs and all
those other different things I'll leave
that to you to go and look up on your
own and now what I want to do is jump in
and talk about how we can compare values
using a lick sir all right so what we're
going to do here is we're going to well
I'll show you whenever we use just
double equal signs and what we're going
to do is compare integers to floats and
whoops let's get rid of that guy right
whoops all right and then what we're
going to do without they're like this
and then let's compare these different
values to each other so I'm going to say
for equal to 4.0 and we're going to be
able to see the difference between
equals and three equals all right so
they're like this and it will throw
three equals inside of there and then
we're going to do a similar thing with
not equals not equals has a similar way
of doing comparisons so throw that
inside of there and then we will do
another one not equals with the two
equal signs and we'll say that let's
come over here compile it and let's run
it and you can see right here whenever
we use just the two equals sign this
comes back as true why it's comparing
the values and not the data types and
here we are going to be whoops I'm win
10 I have to go in here and do this
obviously
let's go like that and for that new line
inside of there there we go now we're
going to get the proper output that
we're expecting got ahead of myself a
little bit let's run it all right so now
you can see we were here just comparing
the values and not paying attention the
data types that comes back is true here
we were comparing the values and the
data types well this is an integer this
is a float that's what comes back is
false here we are just comparing again
the values and this is not equals to and
here we were comparing the data type as
well as the values and that's the reason
why that comes back is true all right so
pretty neat stuff let's do some more
advanced stuff we can also come in here
of course and check for greater than and
less than and equal to and all those
other different things let's change this
a little bit let's change this to a 5
and to a 4 and we'll check if this is
greater than so come in again 5 greater
than 4 and
go and check a whole bunch of different
things so ducted uh and greater than or
equal to of course sub greater than or
equal to and here we'll check less than
and less than and here we'll check less
than or equal to and less than or equal
to the disses mobile here executes its
run its and there you can see exactly
how all those work and I'm doing some
more examples here of course let's go
get rid of all that we'll talk about
logical operators I'm going to create a
function here called age sixteen and
what I'm going to check for is if this
person is going to be able to vote and
drive so I'll say votes and drive and
inside of here we'll get rid of this and
we're going to say if age is greater
than or equal to sixteen and I know this
is bad logic what I'm doing here I'm
just trying to demonstrate our logical
operators work and the logical operator
we're using here is and so I'm going to
go in I'm going to go age is greater
than or equal to eighteen and let's do
another one it's similar sort of
function so we'll go like this and here
what we're going to do is we'll do
exactly the same thing and it will put
or inside of there or and we'll say
votes or drive okay so what I'm doing is
just providing two ways of checking
different values this is going to come
back as true if this is true and this is
true and this is going to come back as
true if either one of them are true so
we're going to man here and we'll
execute it and we'll run it and you can
see indeed how the output works out for
those guys and of course the other
logical operator that is going to be
available to us is not and basically
ought not is just going to take whatever
is true and turn it into false and
whatever is false and turn it into true
the and there you can see turned the
true into a false alright so there is a
whole bunch of different things in
regards to how we can compare values now
I want to talk about decision making now
there are many different ways
that we can perform certain actions
depending upon different comparisons and
so forth and so on I'm going to show you
a whole bunch of them here so of course
we have if so what we're going to do
here is I'm going to say if age is
greater than or equal to 18 well then do
whatever is inside of these brackets and
what we specifically want them to do is
to go and output can vote on the screen
now let's say we want to check another
condition how can we do that well we can
just come in here and we can come back
out to the side and we'll say else if
that's not true in that situation what
are we going to do we are going to
output that they can't vote all right so
that's the ifs and else statements and
exactly how they work let's do a couple
more here
there's also unless within less the code
is going to execute unless the age is
going to be equal to 18 and we'll do
this paste this inside of here and in
this situation I'll just say you are not
18 and we'll come in and we'll do an
else statements and in this situation
we'll say you are 18 and let's do
another one
we'll do the conditional basically the
conditionals going to work like else if
and it's very important to understand
however that it is only going to hit or
produce output on the very first match
so what we're going to do here is we're
going to say condition du and then we're
going to list a whole bunch of different
conditions we want to check for so if
the age is greater than or equal to 14
then we want to execute specific code
and the specific code we want to say is
in this situation I'm going to say you
can wait let's put that in there and
then what's throw it in another
condition so we'll say age is greater
than or equal to 16 in this situation
we'll say you can drive you can drive
and then we'll throw in another
condition
and this is going to be age is greater
than or equal to 18 just know that when
it hits one of these it so it's going to
output this so whenever it hits this guy
is going to say you can wait even though
the age is set as 16 so putting these in
the proper order is very very important
so actually I should have put the 18 up
here in data but I'm just going to do it
this way so yeah let's just come in here
and do it this way you can vote and then
if you want to have a default action
that is always going to be true you just
put true inside of there exactly like
that and then we'll say default inside
of here so we'll say defaults and while
we go and run this because we have a
whole bunch of different things to check
out it throws up all kinds of warnings
so don't don't worry about it and
execute and you'll see right here for
this if-else statement it's going to say
you can't vote the age of 16 all right
down here for the unless unless it is 18
you're going to see you're not 18 here
you're going to see you can wait and the
reason why is because this is 16 like I
said in actuality let's fix it let's
just do it the right way
throw that there and then we'll throw I
did it that way just so you can see that
it will foul up if you don't put these
in the proper order so let's go and get
rid of that tip data and now we can run
it again and you'll see that it does it
the right way and you can see here it
comes back as you can drive all right so
there's even more I'm going to show you
more so let's go in here let's get rid
of this many different ways to perform
actions depending upon conditions there
is also going to be the case statements
which are going to work like switch in
other programming languages or here what
we're going to do is we're going to say
case two you could have a variable
inside of there but I'm just going to
put the value of two inside of there
just keep it simple here I'm going to
say if that value is equal to one in
that situation let's go get rid of that
I'm going to say entered one and if
otherwise it is 2 I'm going to come in
and I'm going to say enter 2 and then
once again if you want to have a default
what we're going to do is just put an
underscore inside of there
and then we'll go and put something
inside of here like default default okay
so there are case statements and the
very final one is the ternary operator
I'm going to show you how to setup a
ternary operator inside of a lik sir so
what we're going to do is I'm going to
say ternary and then inside of here I'm
going to say if age is greater than 18
and then I'm going to put a column
inside of there then do and you're going
to define what you want to be done and
otherwise I can put an else statement
directly inside of here in that
situation I'm going to put can't vote
inside of there as the other option
that's available to us and we'll come in
here and we'll run it and we'll execute
it and you can see the ternary operator
worked can't vote comes back and you
also saw entered to comes back with the
case statement okay so a whole bunch of
different decision-making tools
available for us inside of elixir and
now I'm going to take a look at the
tuples now normally tuples have two to
four values inside of them and they can
hold any value however they are not for
enumerated through and what I mean the
numerating through I mean that you're
not supposed to cycle through tuples or
go and check for values one by one by
one here I'll just show you examples so
I'm going to come in here and I'm going
to create my stats is equal to I'm going
to say 175 and 6.25 and then I'm going
to throw an atom inside of here that is
Derk now I'm going to output some
information on the screen let's say well
first off let's check if this is a tuple
and to do so we go to pull and then I'm
going to check if it's a tuple how do
you do that see if you remember is to
pull pretty easy to remember and I'm
gonna save my stats inside of there and
we'll do a couple more things you can
also append values to a tuple but
remember every time you go and make a
change you have to change it and save it
to a new
variable so I have to go my stats
because once a variable receives a value
it stays its permanent for forever so
you can add these functions you can you
can go and add on or append values
however you need to create a new storage
area for it so I'm going to go my stats
and let's say I want to throw 42 into
that tuple as well well with append we
can do that you can also retrieve values
by index so let's say I want to go and
get age from it I can get age and to do
so you go elements and you pass in my
stats to look let's go and throw this in
here like that
my stats too and I want to get whatever
is in the third index again this is
going to be 0 1 2 3 this is the one that
I append it on there we're going to be
able to get the tuple size let's go and
get our tuple size size and here you
just go to pull once again size you pass
in whatever tuple you want to work with
inside of there you're also going to be
able to come in and delete an index
inside of a tuple but once again you're
going to have to store it in a new snute
on data area so my stats 3 is going to
be equal to we're going to say to pull
delete at and you're going to pass in
whatever tuple you want to work with so
this is going to be my stats 2 and I'm
going to say that I want to delete the
whatever is at the zero index and we can
also go and insert at an index we're
going to do almost exactly the same
thing once again go to create a new
storage area so I'm going to go my stats
for and it's going to be instead of
delete at it's going to be insert at and
I'm going to go and have my stats let's
change this to my stats
3 and what you need to do here is to
find the index you want to work with I'm
going to say it's the zero index and
then I'm going to say the data that I
actually want to input inside of it and
we're also going to be able to create a
tuple with the
values duplicated a certain number of
times so let's go and create something
called many zeros and do this we'll go
to pull and duplicate zero and zero five
times so it's going to create a tuple
that's going to have five zeros inside
of it and finally you're also going to
be able to use tuples for pattern
matching so I'm going to be able to do
something like type in weight and height
and name and pull out that data some ago
one seventy five and six point two five
and Derrick the atom and then we can go
don't want to do that I want to get this
guy right here yeah just grab that throw
that inside of there and we'll change
this from size to weights and then we'll
just throw a weight inside of there just
so you can see how that works
so there's weight and we can come over
and we can execute it and duck the death
and here you can see whoop spelled tuple
wrong that's alright you can see up here
let's go get rid of that right there of
it matters all right so here we're
checking is it a tuple yes it comes back
it's true
here we are appending the age of 42 to
it we're then checking the age see it 42
comes back we are then checking the size
of our tuple you can see there's four
pieces of data inside of it and then
down here we went and pulled or assigned
a 175 to the weights and then output
that on the screen okay so a whole bunch
of things we can do with tuples and now
we're going to talk about lists all
right so lists are going to contain
lists of data of any different data type
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create two lists here and you just go
and surround the data or whatever values
you want inside brackets so I'm going to
go list one and list two four five and
six and if you'd like to combine two
different lists you can do so just go
list one then you go put two plus signs
and list two there you go now you have a
bigger list you could also go and
tract a list from the list so we'll go
list three and put two minus signs and
list one you can verify if an item is
inside or list so let's check if there
is a six in list for you can separate
the head which is the very first item
inside a list from the tail which are
all the other different items just by
going like this so it's a head and tail
put some spaces inside there so it's a
little bit easier to read and we'll say
we're going to perform this operation on
list three and let's go in here and
let's output the head for this guy so go
ahead or the very first item in the list
that's what the head is you're going to
using this a lot so let's go and get
that guy and then let's go and I didn't
cover this yet so I'm going to use it
you can also output data using right and
how right works is it doesn't put a new
line after it outputs the data like puts
does so that's also something nice to
know you can also come in and use
inspect to output tail which is going to
show a representation of the list inside
of here let's go run that and here you
can see we come back as true and where
that comes from is we checked if there
was a six and list for we went and
grabbed the very first item out of the
list that's the one tail is all the
other different items that we have
inside there and then here we printed
out the tail on the screen I've been
using inspect here and want to point
something out it is possible you know
like I said inspectors going to print
the internal representation of a value
but it's important to understand that it
may give you odd results so let's come
in here we'll throw 97 and 98 inside of
there and let's see what happens so
basically we run it and you're going to
see that we get to a B okay it printed
character codes inside of there if you
want to guarantee that is going to print
the list and not character codes we're
going to do is put a comments are there
character lists and then we say as lists
if you do that then you
to worry about it outputting bad data
and you can see that it printed 97-98
the a B part there is just going to be
basically what happens with elixir like
our length is whatever the last value
inside of the function is is going to
pronounce green okay so there's that
alright just in case you come across
some problems within specs and you want
to fix it you're also going to be with
lists be able to enumerate over lists
and to do so we go Enuma
and each I'm going to say tail FN item
and we can come in here and output the
individual items as we come across them
item and then close that off with ends
if we run that you're going to see it
goes and prints out all those different
items let's go and create another list
of words so I'm just going to call this
words I'm gonna say random words in a
list and then let's enumerate through
these again cycle through them so I'm
gonna go words is going to be what we're
cycling through and then we go FN and
word and then what I want to do with
them as I cycle through them so let's go
and output them so I'm just go word and
then end that and you can see it goes
and outputs all those ok so you can
cycle through numbers words doesn't
really matter
other things kind of neat is we're going
to be able to use recursion to loop as
well so I'm going to create a function
and it's going to be called display list
and I'm going to pass it my words list
and have it cycle through all this and
whenever we're talking about recursion
what we basically just mean is we're
going to be calling the function from
inside of itself so let's go I'm going
to show you a whole bunch of examples of
recursion I'm just going to give you a
brief example here just to show you how
to use recursion to cycle through a list
so this is display list to make sure you
do this you create this new function
outside of that area and this guy is
going to be passed in the words the
whole entire list and what it's going to
do is it's going to actually break the
head and
I'll part right here inside of there I'm
going to go do an IO puts and word so
it's going to break off the head and
it's going to out put it on the screen
and then it's going to call itself to
display a list again pass in word it's
going to break off the head but I output
it and so forth and so on
one thing is you're going to have to
whenever you're using recursion always
have an ending a situation in which it
no longer calls itself and we're going
to be able we're going to give this the
same name it's going to be like if the
display list is called
with a an ability to break off the word
like we did here and I put it well then
we're going to call this function if
however it has ever passed an empty list
well then in that situation we're going
to use this display list and under that
situation what we're going to do is
nothing so how do we do nothing well to
do nothing you're just going to put a
calm inside of there and then we're
going to go into and we're going to go
nil
all right so here we're calling display
list passing it inside there and we're
going to cycle through a break off the
heads pronoun tada rid of that let's run
it whoops
gave me an error with it's what's the
problem here it's saying there's an
error on 45 unexpected token and AH
whenever I originally created the
display list down here the second one it
threw another end inside there so we got
rid of that and run it and now you can
see it also is another way for us to
print out all of those different words
in the list and we'll do more for
Kuragin as a tutorial continues now
we're also going to be able to come in
here and delete given items from a list
so I'm just going to go I Oh puts and
show you what it looks like so we'll say
display list and then I'm going to go
list delete words and I'm going to
delete random out of our list and then
pass it in to display it on the screen
you'll see how that changed and here you
can see it doesn't show random in that
situation okay so good stuff you can
also delete an item at a specific index
and to do that you go delete at once
again we're going to pass our list
inside of here but I'm then going to
pass in an index and here I'll say that
I want to delete whatever
is in the one index and there you can
see random analysts say it got rid of
the words we can also insert an item at
a list and to do that we go insert at
words and we'll change this to four and
that's going to be at the end of the
list
and then we'll say we want to put the
word gay or something like that and run
that and you can see yay shows up there
we're also going to be able to get the
very first item inside of our list so
let's change this a little bit just get
rid of that altogether type in list and
first and what we're specifically
searching for we can also get the last
item inside of there so we're going to
do pretty much exactly the same thing
right there and we'll change this to
blast instead of first and the final
thing is you can actually create a list
of key value tuples so to do that you
can say something like name and then
Derek put a coma height and 6.25 and
look 6.25 and whatever okay so you can
go and experiment with that on your own
so there's a rundown of lists now I'm
going to jump over and talk about maps
now a map is going to hold a collection
of key value pairs so let's say we want
to do something like create a map called
capitols what we're going to do here is
put a percent sign and then we're going
to define our keys and our values so I'm
going to say that Alabama is going to be
my key and the value assigned to that
key is going to be Montgomery okay which
is the capital of Alabama and we can go
down here to different lines it doesn't
matter you can indent whatever
everything still works let's go and
create another one we'll say Alaska and
we'll say Juneau and why don't we go and
create another one we'll put the column
inside of there and then we'll go
Arizona and then let's go and create a
value assigned for that and that's going
to be Phoenix alright so there you go
you just created on map now you're going
to be able to retrieve values using a
key so we'll say let's say we want to
get the capital of
Alaska and out put that on our screen
we'll say is well we can just go
capitals like that and then pass in
whatever your key is like do some more
stuff let's say you can also use atoms
as keys which is nice to know now let's
go and copy this and just use atoms
instead of strings so we will be able to
come in here and we'll change this to
capitals too and let's change this to
Alabama and then what we're going to do
is we're going to put a colon inside of
there get rid of this guy all together
and we would do that for all of these
different guys and let's go and just do
it
so we'll say Alaska that in there and
Arizona : inside of there and now what
we'll do is we'll actually access these
in a slightly different way so here you
go
puts and we'll say capital of Arizona is
and we'll go and get it like I said
you're going to do this in a slightly
different way you're going to go
capitals too and then follow that with
the key so dot Arizona and also you'll
be able to insert key values inside of
here but once again you have to create
brand-new maps so we'll call this
capital story and to do so you go
dictionary put new and capitals and
let's say you want to throw Arkansas
inside of here you can do that like this
and then follow it up with whatever the
value is a little rock alright so got
that so out of there and welcome and run
it and there we go and you can see how
all that information printed out on our
screen
okay so pretty neat stuff so there's a
rundown of maps and now I want to talk
about pattern matching
now I already talked about pattern
matching a little bit I just want to
give a brief example here so basically
with pattern matching we're going to be
able retrieve data from different types
of data structures so let's say we want
to go lengths like this and then with
we're going to be able to sign those to
whatever is inside of the data
structure which in this situation is a
list and then we're going to be able to
automatically go and print out the
design information just by referencing
the variable that we put it inside of
you saw this before but not with lists
it's also important to know that you're
going to be able to work with more
complicated systems and what we're going
to do whenever we don't care about the
data is we're going to put an underscore
inside of it and actually what we're
going to do here is try to match up a
list inside of a list so we're going to
have a list that is also going to have a
list inside of it so how we match those
different guys is we just basically copy
exactly what's there so let's say we
don't care about what the first item in
the list is well there that is but we do
care about that item so we throw that
inside of there and what we're going to
be able to do is go and get that value
so we'll just say get numb and come in
here and we run it you're going to be
able to see there's width as the value
of 30 and get numb is 40 which is what
it grabbed there okay so neat stuff more
with pattern matching as the tutorial
continues but I want to also talk about
anonymous functions right now now
basically an anonymous function has no
name and it can be passed to another
function which is extremely useful so
let's go and create an anonymous
function and we'll have it assigned to
the variable get some and get some then
could be passed into a function and what
it's going to receive is an x and y
value and what it's going to do is it's
going to add x and Y to gather all right
that's all yeah now you got an anonymous
function now what you're going to be
able to do is throw it around just like
it is any type of variable so what we're
going to do here is we're going to go I
uh puts I'm going to say 5 plus 5 is
equal to and then we'll be able to
reference that we'll go get some and
then you're going to put a dot like that
and then you're going to pass in
whatever the parameters are you want
pass to that function
oops two of these extra things slipped
inside of there so get rid of that and
there you go and we're going to do a
couple more here so you can see them all
X
at the same time there is also a
shorthand of the above so let's go and
create another one of these let's call
it get less and what you're going to be
able to do here I'm going to model it in
much the same way you're going to be
able to go like that and then one and
negative throw another and sign inside
of there and two and that is exactly the
same as if you typed all of this stuff
out and basically if you wanted to
subtract another value you just put in
there and go three okay but I just want
to keep this - so this is just going to
track those values and just provides
another different way to see the same
thing and a shorthand notation it might
not be so obvious so in this situation
what we're going to do is we're going to
go seven minus six and we'll go call get
less and then we're going to pass seven
and six inside of it so there seven and
there six and we'll save that and let's
do another one here I think you can see
what's going on here you can also have
functions except different numbers of
parameters which is very very useful so
let's say that we wanted to have a
function called add some however it is
going to receive an unknown number of
attributes passed inside of it
so what we want to do is we want to have
this work so what I want to do is come
down here and type and and what I'm
going to define is with the function add
some what are we going to do if we
receive two values well in that
situation what we're going to do is
we're going to call IO puts and we are
going to add those values together so
we're going to go and throw X inside of
here plus and then we'll throw a Y
inside of there like that is equal to
and X plus y alright and in the
situation in which we receive three
values well we're going to have a
solution for that as well we're going to
have XY and Z and we're just going to
change this to plus and throw the Z
inside of there and then let's throw the
Z inside of there and we can come down
here and we will be able to work with
those so to call those functions you
just go
some like that and then a period and
then you're going to throw in whatever
your attributes are and then likewise
you're going to do exactly the same
thing but here we're going to call add
some and we're all the only thing when
it needs change is the additional value
we throw inside of there and you can
also set the fault for your parameters
let's go and save this and let's execute
it
and there you can see how all of those
out put it on the screen and everything
works just perfectly fine one other
thing I just want to demonstrate here
real quick is you can also set defaults
for your parameters for all of your
different functions you work with so I'm
going to go I'm an output here first a
function called do it and I then have to
create do it and we'll come down here
we'll just create do it
so we go define and do it and if you
want to have default values of all
you're going to do is go X which is
going to be your attribute that's passed
inside of here two backslashes in a one
that's going to give X a default value
of one it's going throw another one
inside of here let's go and give Y
default value of one and then we'll go
do and then in this situation we go X
plus y and we'll come over here and we
will execute this guy and there you can
see the two comes back all right so a
rundown of how we can use default values
how we can use anonymous functions and a
whole bunch of our different things and
now I'd like to talk about recursion all
right so as you saw previously recursion
is just a situation in which a function
is going to call itself so how we
normally demonstrate recursion is
through the use of factorials so here
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
call a factorial function that we're
going to create here in a second so we
go to factorial of 3 and then we're
going to call our function which we're
going to create here in a moment I
already showed you how to use recursion
to loop through different lists and
things like that but let's go and create
some more things so how we're going to
demonstrate let's go and put the
factorial function right here we're
going to create a new function obviously
and we're going to
it's factorial and it's we're going to
receive a number and throw the do inside
of there and what it's going to do is we
have to have a situation in which we're
going to end the calling of our function
and to do that I'm going to say if the
number is less than or equal to 1
well then I'm going to return a value of
1 otherwise go through an else inside of
there I'm going to calculate our
factorial so we'll go results is equal
to num times and then we'll call
factorial which is the function call in
itself and that's going to be num minus
1
as you can see eventually num is going
to get a value of 1 because we were
subtracting it no matter how big we may
get and then if we want to return a
value we just put the value itself
inside of there that's it very very
simple factorial now let's run it and
then I'll explain exactly what's going
on so this let's run that and there you
can see factorial of 3 is going to be 24
oh I died put 4 there and input by put
this right here let's save it and let's
run again all right so where we go and
factorial 3 is going to be equal to 6
now let's do 4 instead because I think
will just give us a little bit better
idea what's going on throw it in run it
and run it ok so how did it calculate
that well basically what happens here is
we call our factorial function and we
have a value of 4 inside of here so you
get a value of 4 right here times
factorial 3 this is it so 4 comes in the
4 goes down to here and we multiply that
times factorial of 3 what's that what
then happens will we jump down to this
line we take 3 times factorial 2
factorial 2 jumps us down here 2 times
the factorial of 1 well there's a value
of 1 it says if number is less than or
equal to 1 return a 1 okay so this is 1
so here what we're calculating is 2
times 1 2 times 1 is equal to 2 this 2
jumps up here jumps there 3 times 2 is
equal to 6 we take this 6 throw it up
here then we take 4 times 6 is equal to
24 and that is an example of how we can
calculate a factorial using recursion
and now what I'd like to do is
is demonstrate how looping works inside
of a lik sir okay so with most languages
we loop by incrementing or decrementing
a valuable
however since all variables are
immutable inside of a lik cert we're
going to use recursion to loop and I'm
going to give you a demonstration how
this works so I put and I'm going to say
some and what I want to do is I want to
sum all of the different values that are
inside of a list how do we do that well
we can show you right here so I'm going
to go and get one two and three and
using recursion Aleks or I'm going to
show you how to easily sum all of these
values and then after that I'd also like
to show you how to create a loop in lick
sir so I'm just going to call this
function loop that is my name it is a
built-in thing inside of elixir and now
I'm going to jump down here and create
both those functions so let's come down
inside of here outside of our main
little function and we'll go and sum all
the values so what we need to do any
time we use recursion is we need a
situation in which we will no longer
continue calling a function and we're
going to define that if our sum function
receives an empty list in that situation
it is going to cease to call itself and
instead it's going to return a value of
zero now we will create our sum function
that is going to work for all their
situations and we're going to say if we
get a list inside of here that is not
empty we want to get to the head and the
tail and then what we want to do with it
is we want to go to do and we want to
say H plus and then we want to call the
function back again passing in the tail
and we'll continue doing that until the
list is empty and in that situation once
we will return a zero ok so you see up
here we passed in the values of one two
and three come up here well get me in
here ignore all the red stuff just jump
up here and says there's an error at ten
oh it's giving it all right so let's go
and create our loop function or better
yet did I tell you what comments are
that's how you use comments you throw in
a hash symbol
all right so let's give in here run it
again and there you can see the sum is
equal to six okay so the sum functions
work all right pretty neat stuff so now
what we're going to do is have a little
loop work there and come down here and
we'll leave some in there looks nice now
to create a loop what we're going to do
once again is we are going to say when
we are going to leave or loop recursion
calling functions and when that's going
to happen is when a value of zero gets
passed inside of here I don't care about
what the other thing is some throwing
underscore inside of there and I'm going
to go do and then whenever this I'm
going to return and nil now I'm going to
create the meet of our loop function
that is going to loop through what it's
going to do is it's going to receive a
max value and a minimum value we're
going to be doing some really neat
things with this later on whenever we
talk about concurrency all right so then
what I'm going to do inside here is I'm
going to say if max ever reaches a
situation in which it is a lesser than
men well in that situation I am going to
come in here and I'm going to say loop
call the loop function and pass in a
zero that's going to call this guy and
that's going to end everything it
doesn't matter what I put inside here
but I'm gonna put min inside of there
just to do something otherwise I'm going
to say else and in that situation I'm
going to output whatever is inside of
there so this function is basically
going to receive a maximum value and a
minimum value and it's going to little
go and count through those until there's
nothing more to do so I'm gonna get numb
and you're gonna be able to cycle
through the lists or do whatever you'd
like I'm going to talk about more about
a numeral so here in a moment so I'm
going to go max and then I'm going to
call the loop function again and take
max minus 1 and pass in min once again
so what's this saying it's saying it
once account from 1 to 5 maximum number
minimum number so let's save that over
here and we'll run it and there you can
see it goes and starts out of 5 and
decrements down until it gets a value of
1 and then it leaves ok so an example of
how we can a loop with a lick sir and
now what I want to do is talk more about
enumerables
ok so now let's talk about enumerables
and what we mean by enumerable
is a data type that is going to allow
its items to be counted off so what
we're going to do here is we're going to
check if all values are even inside of a
list sounds like something would be
pretty complicated but it's pretty not
propagated so what we're going to do is
I'm going to go even lists and lists are
going to be a situation a data type that
is going to be able to be cycled through
so to do so what we need to do is go
eeen um all make sure you put a dot
inside of there all in question mark and
then we're going to throw in a list it's
going to be one two and three and then
after that this lets go down in the next
line we need to define what we're going
to do inside of here so you know FN
there we go N and for each of these
different items inside of our list we're
going to go with the remainder N and two
so we're going to take the value of each
of the list values and we're going to
use the remainder function on them
versus two and we're going to check if
they are equal to zero if they are if
this condition right here is true then
they're going to go in our new list and
print them out if not they're going to
just simply be disregarded and then what
we need to do here is throw an end in
there to end or function it's a pretty
simple straightforward to run it and you
can see even list comes back as false
and what we're doing here is just
checking whether all of the values
inside of our list are even or they're
not we'll get into how we can actually
output the actual items we could also
let's go and check let's do a copy of
this now let's just change it so let's
check if any of them are even okay all
we needed to do there was just change
that to any and we can run this and
there you can see it comes back is true
we could then go in and print out each
of those different items if we would
like so it's going to do this and when
you go a gnome each and we will throw in
our list one two and three and then we
define what we want to do with them we
go and say each of the items inside of
our list we
you want to come in here and output so
we're going to call puts so we'll just
pass that over into the puts function
and end and then throw end inside of
there that's how easy it is to cycle
through all those different guys and
print them out on the screen
you can see nice neat let's say we
wanted to double each value in a list we
could do that as well let's go double
list is equal to we're going to call
enum and map and pass in one two and
three our list that we're going to work
with here jump outside of there we're
going to define F n and each of the
individual items in our list and then
we're going to define what exactly we
want to do with each of those items
inside of our list and let's say let's
do something even more complicated let's
say we wanted to reduce down to a single
value so in this situation we want to
add all of these values together we can
do that so let's say when let's call
this some values equal to e num and
reduce and we'll pass in the same
function here again one two and three
after that we then want to define what's
going on so we're going to sum all the
values and store them in the variable
sum as we cycle through so we'll go n
plus sum and end you can see just how
quickly you can do things here an elixir
that are kind of complicated in other
languages and let's go an output or some
and that's going to be some values and
then let's also come in here and you'd
also be able to use a function called
unique in the enumerable module that's
going to spit back a list that is only
going to contain one of or no duplicates
inside the list so we'll go you know and
unique and then we'll throw some
duplications inside of there just so you
can see what that looks like one two and
two all right
and we do this and we'll do this and
we'll come in and we'll run it and you
can see right here we were able to print
out all this different items that's done
with this guy you can see we were able
to cycle through
and some all those different values
together or actually I didn't print that
out let's go and print that out so I
don't want to use puts here I want to
use inspect or yes inspect with this one
so I'll go I Oh inspect and double list
and we'll run out again and there you
can say went and doubled all the values
in the list you can see reduced was used
here to add all those values and
condense them down into one value and
you can see unique was used here to get
rid of any duplication inside of our
list okay so there is an example of
enumerables and some of the neat things
you do with them I'm going to show you
even more neat things whenever we talk
about the list comprehensions okay list
comprehensions are going to provide us
with an additional way to perform
actions on lists so let's say we want to
do what we did previously we want to
double every list item so we're going to
go and create a double list and to do so
we're going to go for and and then we'll
throw in whatever our list is obviously
the list could be a variable name and we
go do and then we're going to say what
we want to do with each of the items we
want to multiply times two that's just
what we want to do all right we can go
and I'll put this on our screen and
there's our double list let's go and do
a couple left let's go and see what that
looks like
and there you can see doubled all that
for us pretty neat let's say we wanted
to create a list of even values do that
and somewhat easier way so we'll go in
and then we're going to pass in the
let's get one two three and four this is
going to spit out only evens
so here's going to be our condition
we're going to say the remainder of n
each of the list items divided by two is
going to be equal to zero so if it meets
that condition it goes in our new list
if it doesn't well it doesn't so we'll
do like that and we'll go I own spooked
again and we'll spit that guy out and
that's going to be our even list there
is and we can run it and we can see
there's our evens only and I think
that's actually probably enough list
comprehensions just play around with it
you'll get it and they are very very
awful and very very useful all right
let's talk about something else that's
useful exception handling
now exception handling is just going to
allow us to handle errors and what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to do a
very very simple example you can go on
your own and experiment and test some
other things out now anytime you think
you're going to do something it could
potentially cause an error what you're
going to use is a try block inside of it
and I'm going to store the error inside
of here so that we can output some
information about what went wrong I'm
going to force a division by zero now
that is going to cause an error so if I
want to rescue myself from that
potential error what I'm going to do is
throw rescue inside of there and I'm
going to put the exception that is going
to be triggered whenever that occurs I
leave that to you to go and look up all
those different potential exceptions and
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to say that if we hit this I want to go
and put an error on the screen but not
crash the rest of my program so I'm
going to do that and then we're going to
end we're going to get out of there and
then I am going to output that error
message on our screen and then we'll
move on in our program won't crash
so just output that to do here we'll run
it and there you can see can't divide by
zero and however we would be able to
continue going on and outputting
additional information okay I know very
very brief explanation exception
handling deserves more time but I'm
trying to keep this short and I want to
jump over now and talk about concurrency
now concurrency is extremely powerful
basically it is going to allow us to run
multiple blocks of code at once and how
you do it is you call a function called
spawn which is going to start a new
process that runs the code specified at
an undefined time so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to use our loop function
down here to create two separate
processes that are run at the same exact
time and output information on our
screen and this is how easy it is to do
to create a new process you just go
spawn I'm going to go function like that
and then we go draw an arrow and I'm
going to define what I want to occur in
this process
on account from fifty to one and then
that is going to end that now if I want
to create a whole new process I can
create thousands of processes and elixir
is very very good at splitting up this
time so I'm going to go and spawn
another process this guy is instead
going to count from 100 down to 50
circular we are going to be able to see
how these are going to work so I'm going
to save that and let's come over here
okay let's run it and you're going to
see now what happens is each of these
processes gets a paid number or a
process ID so we're calling this guy 50
it's counting from 50 to 1 this one's
counting from 1 to 50 and you can see
how they jump back and forth sharing
time each giving each other time to do
all of their work all on the screen so
these processes are working at the same
time and taking turns and doing
everything that you could ever want them
to do without causing any problems Lix
ER is fantastic doing this we're also
going to be able to send messages
between processes so what I want to do
here is I want to actually send a match
a message to this process to this do
stuff process how can I do that we could
send you know messages done anything so
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to say send self so I'm sending this
message to myself and what I want to do
here is I want to pass in French and add
them and I'm going to pass in the word
bulb you're going to see what happens
here I'm going to be able in all my
processes I'm going to be able to
receive different messages so we can
communicate back and forth between
processes and I could do an entire
tutorial on how we can do awesome things
with this but like I said this is just a
very very brief explanation so I'm going
to say if they receive the atom of
German in that situation what we're
going to do is we're going to go I owe
puts and we are going to go gutentag and
we are going to output whatever they
passed in for our name and now what I
want to do is I want to and this is
exactly how it works you have a normally
a key here and then values that are
passed inside
so let's go and do a couple more of
these we'll say if they pass in French
inside of there we're going to do the
same thing except we're going to change
this to Bonjour and there that is and if
they pass in English we are going to
respond with hello
so there's hello whoops Bell hello right
and there that is and let's do one more
thing here before we finish up the
entire tutorial if there is no matching
message what we're going to be able to
do is issue a timeout let's say we
wanted to do a timeout for say 500
milliseconds we could do that and we
just want to come down here or go before
the ends and outside of here let's go
down the next line and I'm going to say
after 500 milliseconds if there is no
response well in that situation I'm
going to say puts and whoops time up and
that's going to handle that condition
and what you didn't understand what was
going on all right so let's run that
whoops hit run button run that and run
that and where to go oh I know it went
and actually executed ahead of time so
here you can see
Bonjour Bob comes through we actually
passed a message inside of there and
randomly you know this could be down
here a couple more lines or whatever but
you can see exactly how concurrency
works and I think that is a pretty good
jumping-off point for you to go in there
and explore with elixir more about
concurrency and all of the other
different things that I covered in this
tutorial so hopefully you guys enjoyed
that that is a lot of information and
like always please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
