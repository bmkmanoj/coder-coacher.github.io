I'm going to show you how to make three
staples of Latin cuisine being salsa
guacamole refried beans and flour
tortillas and then I'm going to combine
all of those ingredients along with a
whole bunch more to make the most
amazing latin taco salad or whatever you
want to call it it's delicious that's
all it matters first what you need to do
to make refried beans you need to get
yourself some dried black beans and you
need to soak them in warm water for
about three hours and then you can see
the dark liquid you want to drain all of
that off into a strainer and then you
want to throw them back into the pot
right like that and then to this pot you
want to add ten cups of water or enough
depending upon your size of your pot to
make sure that you completely cover the
black beans once again that's two cups
of black beans there's ten cups of water
now here you're gonna see all of the
other ingredients i'm going to use all
together I'm gonna get myself about
three-fourths of a cup of chopped onions
you don't need to worry about them being
chopped up too much and just set that
aside then you're going to take your
black beans you're going to turn this on
high and you're gonna add like I said
approximately three-fourths of a cup of
just regular white onions to that then
you're gonna get yourself some vegetable
shortening and you're going to put three
tablespoons of vegetable shortening into
this guy we can use lard I guess or
butter if you don't have either of those
then you're going to bring this to a
boil and then you're going to cover it
and let it cook on medium or right
around sixty percent of your stovetop
cooking surface for two hours that's
covered now we're going to jump into the
flour tortillas so basically what you
need for the flour tortillas I'm using a
food processor here you can definitely
do this by hand but this is a lot easier
and by the end of course you just mix
the stuff together we're going to put
inside of here two cups of flour I'm
using a half cup measure then to this
you're going to add a half
teaspoon of regular old salt don't use
the kosher salt and you're going to use
another half teaspoon of baking powder
not baking soda and then to that you're
going to add in one fourth cup of
vegetable shortening once again this
isn't like cooking by the way there you
go about a fourth of a cup of vegetable
shortening and then to that you're going
to add in two tablespoons of butter and
then I'm going to pulse this while
turning it over and over and over again
and to know when this is right if you're
doing it by hand you're gonna see that
all of these turn into like little
clumps meaning that the shortening as
well as the butter is going to be
thoroughly mixed into your flour mixture
I'm just stick my hand in there mix it
around I could feel a little clumps all
throughout it and then to this mixture
you're gonna get hot water not boiling
water but hot water you're gonna get
three fourths of a cup of hot water mix
that together I have no idea why that
matters but it definitely does because I
did it without hot water one time then
turn out well when you're just going to
blend it and I got the dough hook on
this guy it's not regular blender and
you're going to see immediately that the
dough starts to form right inside of
this guy reach down in here yep that
looks just about perfect I'm gonna let
it go a little bit longer them and
basically I know it's done when most of
the flower has formed into a ball and
then you're going to transfer this over
you're going to start kneading this guy
so I want to put my hands under some hot
water so that I can work with it very
easily this part of the tutorial I'm
going to show you how to make salsa
guacamole then combine everything into
an awesome Latin salad well first thing
I do is I have a cast iron skillet right
here and I'm gonna go and I'm gonna
throw some tomatoes on this cast iron
skillet as well as a jalapeno pepper
these are kind of mild and I'm going to
roast these guys and I'll be back in a
second to show you what it looks like
when they're done it's gonna take about
five minutes just rolling them around
okay so basically after Owen
found in that cast-iron skillet for a
little bit you know you have them the
right way whenever they start to peel
what you basically want to do is just
peel off the skins on your tomatoes as
well as your jalapeno peppers and I'm
doing this under cold water so right
after they come off of that hot range
you can see there's a little scarf scour
marks and that took probably about three
minutes just depends upon how hot here
Oh biz but that's what you're looking
for throw them around the cast iron
skillet and if you don't feel like put
yourself through that just skip it use
regular Tomatoes I just like the extra
flavor that you get whenever you're
roasting these guys I just think it
comes off a little bit better then after
I get all the skins peeled off of it I'm
gonna go over and chop them up and make
my salsa okay after you've gotten as
much skin off of these tomatoes and how
pain use as possible and of course
potato peeler will help you along with
that if you have any trouble you're
going to want it core these Tomatoes now
quarter quarter take all the seeds out
just chop up the nasty bits off the top
of that tomato and then you either
chopping by hand or if you have a food
processor you know throw all these guys
into food processor course you don't
want to throw them in hold so I'm gonna
handle it too well but just simply
throwing them in the quarters will
definitely work or of course you can
chop my hand so you got three tomatoes
right here got one jalapeno pepper
that's been roasted and we got a half a
cup of onions a third of a cup of
cilantro that's what this guy is right
here and a half a teaspoon of salt okay
over its food processor got all those
guys that just talked about and I'm
gonna throw them all in the food
processor and get just about a half a
teaspoon of salt don't overdo it it's
amazing how salt will just completely
destroy this salsa and then what we
gonna do we don't blend it but not much
just enough to make sure that everything
is pretty much same consistency if I
want tomato sauce here though looking
good looking good looking good then go
and touch and that is a doggone good
salsa set that aside and let's get into
the guacamole okay now that you have
your salsa ready that's going to make
making your guacamole extremely easy
basically you just want to pee
ill these avocados two avocados
regular-sized whatever and again if
you're having any trouble just use a
potato peeler and then to make life
extremely simple you're going to take a
third of a cup of your soul so that you
just made pop that in there and then to
that you're going to add about half a
tablespoon of lime juice put on the lid
and blend and that is it so if you make
salsa at the same time you make yourself
some guacamole mm-hmm so so good ok so
the beans have been cooking for two
hours and to that we're just going to
get ourselves a normal-size sort of
jalapeno and chop this guy up again it
doesn't have to be real real small
because we're going to be blending this
in a second so just throw those how
things in there and throw this on high
and then you're going to put in a
tablespoon of time that's fresh thyme
right like that and then to that you're
gonna add 2 teaspoons of salt just
regular granulated salt and you know let
that boil stirring occasionally for 20
minutes ok after cooking on high for 20
minutes what we're gonna do is we're
going to strain out most of the liquid
from the beans that's the vast majority
of it and then we're gonna take the rest
of the beans grow them in the food
processor then get the beans that you
strained out and also throw those in the
food processor and then there's another
step now you're going to want to get
yourself a pan on high and you're gonna
want to add a half a cup of oil to that
hand then you're gonna want to get
yourself a cup of onions and shock those
up but again don't worry about chopping
them or dice number anything like that
just make sure you don't have any big
clumps then you're gonna take all those
onions and throw them in your pan and
you're gonna stir those around for right
about two minutes until they're
thoroughly cooked through and
transparent now you're going to take
your onion mixture
just cooked for like I said on high with
the oil and everything else for about
two minutes spoon this over top of your
bean mixture into the food brazos or put
the top on and blend it until it is a
pace and there you go that's about as
tasty as you can get then in the pan
that you just cook your onions in you're
gonna take your bean mixture and dump
that into that guy easy enough it's
currently on high but I'm going to turn
this down to a medium heat and then
basically I'm going to let it cook for
about 10 minutes Wow I make my tortillas
and of course wats on the stove you're
going to want to stir it so that it
doesn't burn turn it down to a medium
heat basically you just want to get some
more of that water out of this bean
mixture that you have here now back to
the salsa I'm basically going to drain
out the liquid from this that has
coalesced over the period of time when I
was making everything else and then to
that I'm just feeling some chives so I'm
gonna throw in him just a about a half
tablespoon of chives and then to that
I'm gonna add just a regular old can of
tomato sauce just sweeten it up a little
bit and make it a little bit tangy a
little bit sweet pretty much what you're
looking for whenever you would go to a
restaurant and that's done of course
throughout refrigerator okay now back to
the flour tortillas don't expect us to
be raised too much it's perfect you want
it to be kind of elastic basically you
want to pull off a piece is roughly the
size of a golf ball that big you can
knead it of course basically just wanted
to be in a shape of the ball no flour
knead it and then you want a rolling pin
and you just want to roll this guy out
if it's not a perfect circle just tell
people of course it's not makes it more
authentic as far as I'm concerned that's
just about perfect that's what I'm
looking for a nice thin piece of dough
then I got a pan over here and this is
on sixty percent I'm just gonna throw
this inside of here no oil no nothing
and what I do is I count right around 20
seconds get underneath there flip it
over and that's just about perfect i
just counted my head 20 seconds 25
seconds all depends on your oven there
you go another
seconds flip it over and that is perfect
so now it's time to plate everything up
plate everything up just flop a tortilla
down get yourself some refried beans
flop that on a tortilla smooth that out
get yourself a good handful of chopped
lettuce throw that down there on top of
it I like to get a couple pieces about
chopped chicken it's just a simple
regular old roasted chicken get yourself
a little bit of guacamole spread that
around real nice light and then on top
of that lay in some nice also that we
cook there you go that's an awesome way
to make a nice latin salad I have no
idea what this name would be in other
South American countries if you know
please tell let me know below leave any
questions of calm-eze bhutto otherwise
