1 of what will be a massive web design
and programming tutorial I'm going to
try to combine all of the requests that
I have received from you from you guys
into one massive tutorial we're going to
very very specifically cover PHP SQL
MySQL jQuery JavaScript obviously and
finally we're going to create WordPress
themes and WordPress plugins and along
the way you guys tell me what you want
to see programmed and I will create it
but to start off I've already done a PHP
tutorial but I didn't really like the
way that it came out you guys told me
you like this format better where I have
the code on the left I want to write the
output so I'm going to follow that
general guideline here as well but we're
going to first focus in and I'm going to
guess that you understand the basics of
HTML here's our HTML code just starting
off here and I'm going to focus in on
PHP if you do not know HTML I'll provide
a link to a tutorial on it to start
using PHP it's quite simple you just go
right into your HTML code the only
difference is this file is going to end
with PHP instead of HTML like you would
normally end it if you want to insert
some PHP code in here all you do is have
this opening bracket just like any other
tag followed by a question mark followed
by PHP and then here what I'm going to
do is I'm going to echo or print to the
screen the words website title and it is
going to get inserted directly right
into your HTML code and it with a
semicolon and then a question mark and
then a closing bracket now whenever this
is loaded it's automatically going to
put this up in here for the website
title so if I save it jump over here and
reload this page you see website title
now shows up here so this is the echo
command this is what you will for the
most part used to print to screen now
you can use what are called short codes
and I'm going to show you what that
means like this and skip putting in the
PHP right there however I would not do
this and in fact if you're using an
up-to-date PHP 6 interpreter this short
code used to work and it no longer works
with the % that's actually normally used
with a other programming language called
ASP so whenever you're using PHP is
preferable to start off your code and
your code is going to lie between this
opening tag and this closing tag with
PHP instead of without it if you want to
put a comment inside of here it's first
off define our body and close it so
let's say inside of the body you want to
again create an area where you're going
to have PHP code just do it just like
that and if you wanted to have a single
line comment you could use these two
forward slashes or you could use a hash
tag or going to have a multi-line
comment you would do it just like that
with forward slash star and in a star
and the forward slash I actually prefer
to never use this one but for the most
part I actually use multi-line comments
a lot but I leave that to you to print
the screen you can use a couple
different commands here's echo and see
I'm inserting the HTML directly right
inside of this it's just going to print
this right to screen automatically
nobody's even going to see it whenever
they go to your web page even if they
hit view source they're going to see
this HTML because PHP operates and does
all of this code back on the server not
in the actual browser and then of course
you have to put your closing tag inside
of here and if I save it and jump over
here you can see random text pops up
here on the screen well there's other
different ways you for the most part
you're going to use echo to print the
screen but you could also use the print
command you can see here specifically
I'm using braces and you always want to
end any of your statements with a
semicolon
you could also print on multiple lines
and it's going to work okay and even
though there is no space here it
automatically as you can see even though
I jump to a new line it's going to print
them there if with that one string if
you wanted to create a variable say
random variable call it whenever you're
creating variables and member semicolon
if you're creating a variable every
single variable name starts off with a
dollar sign and then either starts with
an underscore or a letter every single
time after that point you can use under
scores other letters or numbers in your
variable names but understand that this
variable here is not equal and you're
going to see this is not equal that's a
not equal sign inside of PHP that is not
equal to this because PHP is
case-sensitive so there's another thing
to know about variables now let's say
you created this variable and you wanted
to be able to print this to screen how
would you do that I'll use the echo
command and you could combine these in
multiple different ways here I'm going
to put a colon Brand variable comma if I
save that jump over here you can see it
put cats or funny in here automatically
pulled that stuck it right there but you
could also do this by putting a period
this is actually called string
concatenation which is just a fancy word
for combining strings and if you save
that and then reload the page you're
going to see it's still prints
identically the same exact thing well if
you want to do special formatting inside
of PHP that's easy as well so let's say
I'll introduce here another function
called print F remember you're going to
latch onto one or another of these guys
I'm just sort of combining them all and
showing you all of them so that you can
then make a decision on your own here
what you're going to do is define much
like another language that I taught
about called Python you're going to find
where you want your variables to show up
or where you want values to show up
inside of your text and again this only
works with print F all of the print echo
and printf are all completely different
and here I'm defining that this is going
to be a number and that here I'm
defining this is going to be a string
that is going to get stuck in that area
years old and come down here pi is equal
to in here I'm going to define that I
want a floating-point number or a number
with a decimal place it has two decimal
places and I'm going to put an F in
there for float comma and then here I
can say my name which is a string that's
why that is an S it's very important get
these right 35 is a number like here
just think digit 3.14 close that off
close that off save it and you can see
that it printed it out my name is there
35 years old and pi is equal to 3.14 the
reason why it shows two digits doesn't
have anything to do with this being two
digits long you can see I make it I'll
make it even longer control s say it
still is only showing 3.14 because I put
point two between the percent sign and
the F now in regards to actual variable
types and names there are boolean and a
boolean is going to be equal to false or
zero another meaning the only other
boolean that's available to you is true
true
unlike false is going to be equal to any
number so b23 5445 doesn't matter
they're all considered true values
inside of PHP and also most languages
then you have integers which are just
numbers that do not have a decimal place
234 for example and the maximum size
that you're going to have for your
integers in most PHP previous to 6 is 2
to the power of 31 with PHP 6 you can
actually go to the power of 63 but
that's probably not going to be
important to you and then you have
floats example 1 3 5 it's just a number
with a decimal place and if you wanted
to print this float the screen using
echo cost : and I'm putting a dollar
sign there and then let's say I wanted
to make this two decimal places just to
mess us up let's go 4 3 2 okay I could
use the number format function dollar
sign float ex1 and then say that I want
it to be two decimal places comma jump
over here you can see chopped off the
remaining digits because I said that I
want it to print the screen with just
two decimal places and whenever you're
operating on numbers inside of PHP you
can of course use plus/minus division
multiplication modulus which is going to
return the remainder of a division you
can increment by one with two plus signs
or decrement or
are decreased by one with two minus
signs but we're going to get into a ton
more examples with these so if some of
those don't make sense to you don't
worry about it
and there's also strings so let's say I
want to create a first name doctor and
I've never watched Doctor Who by the way
I don't even know why I'm typing this in
and you can bind strings with the
concatenation tool which I showed you
just a little bit ago which is just a
period and let's say I want to put a
space between there just want to put two
quotes inside of their last name don't
forget to semicolon and here I'm going
to show you something else with PHP it's
kind of neat depending upon which quote
you use whether it's a single quote or a
double quote you're going to get totally
different results so let's call echo and
I don't do quotes different I'm going to
put in here whole name and here I'm
going to use the break symbol instead
which we don't know what HTML is it's
going to skip to the next line and you
see these are double quoted what would
happen if I single quote them you're
going to see it's like that and you can
see exactly what is the difference
between double quotes double quotes will
automatically pull in whatever the value
for this variable is Wow if you use
single quotes you're going to get
printed out exactly what lies between
those single quotes and if you're
wondering why the break statement didn't
show up it's because it's recognizing it
this is a browser remember it is
recognizing this as a tag to skip to a
new line so that's the reason why that
is showing like it is if you'd like to
create a constant variable inside of PHP
meaning a variable that is not going to
change you use the defined function and
this is normally almost always done at
the very beginning and I'm just going to
call it a constant and you have to
surround it with quotes let's just say 2
3 4 5 is a very important thing to me
now this value can never change or throw
out the rest of your PHP code and if I
wanted to print it out the screen equals
I would just put a period because there
are no dollar signs in front of
constants a constant it's a string
concatenation again just combining some
strings that's all and there it is a
constant equals 2 3 4 5 and you may ask
yourself well what do I do if I actually
want to you
double quotes inside of PHP because they
are surrounded like you see here with
double quotes well you could either just
simply use single quotes obviously or
you backslash escape those quotes just
like this and you can see those quotes
went right inside of there just like I
asked it to and there are a whole bunch
of other different escape characters
like you're probably guessing you can
escape single quotes you can escape the
backslash itself a newline return tab
dollar sign obviously since it's used
for variables and that's for the most
part all of the different escape codes
that are available inside of PHP I'm
going to come in here and delete some of
this so I stopped jumping up the screen
to a certain extent PHP will
automatically convert any of your
variables to a needed variable so like
variable types so let's say for example
you have a string that contains the
value of 28 what would happen if you
would come in here and multiply that
string which is a string of characters
times a float which we have up here to
top the screen it's automatically going
to convert it into a number and then
perform the multiplication of course
it's not going to change it's not going
to be a number afterwards though it's
going to remain a string so PHP is smart
in regards to recognizing that you would
want to multiply those digits out
however if you would actually want to
convert or what they call cast one
variable type into another variable type
so let's say we want to do load example
2 is equal to you surround so here I
want to turn this float into an integer
you put those two braces there with int
in the middle and float example 1 and if
I echo to screen and I'm going to come
in here put a break you can see that
automatically changed it from a float to
an integer now if you would want to
convert anything else for example if you
wanted to turn one variable type into an
array you would use these braces ahead
of it if you'd like to turn it into a
boolean remember only thing it's going
to become false is if you pass it a
value of 0 inside of Python
there are 64-bit integers available want
to convert it into an object you just do
that float double which is very similar
to a float we use that and if you wanted
to convert something into a string you
would precede it with these this code
right here and remember that is called
casting if you actually wanted to find
out what type of variable you're working
with you would use a function called get
type here I'm going to pass it string
num and if you reload it's a string
shows up right there throw this in here
so it's a little bit easier to say and
string pops up right there and the final
thing I'm going to show you is a whole
bunch of other different ways of finding
out if something is a string or not or
is any type of variable once again pass
in is this copy the whole thing paste
that in there
here I'm using a function called is
string and you're going to see one comes
back which is equal to true and again
you can check what type of variable
you're using if you would use the
function is array is underscore bowl is
underscore float is underscore integer
spelled out is null and we're going to
get a lot more into that later or is
object so there's a whole bunch of
basics mainly focused on variables
inside of PHP believing this tutorial is
going to get a lot more complicated
really fast if you have any other
questions or comments leave them down
