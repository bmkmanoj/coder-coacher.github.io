21 of my java video tutorial series
today I'm going to talk about GUI event
handling including action listeners key
listeners Mouse listeners window
listeners and I'm going to show you a
bunch of shortcut way is to use
interfaces among numerous other
different things if you didn't watch our
20 of this tutorial definitely watch it
because I'm going to use parts of that
tutorial here I'm not going to
completely explain what they do because
I expect you to have seen it now if
you're going to be tracking events
inside of your GUI interface you need
this events library inside of Java so
we're going to throw that in there and
then what we're going to do is we're
going to create all of our buttons
there's but one inside of this main Java
lesson 20 class so they'll be accessible
by all of the inner classes inside of it
I want to put jtextfield
text field one J text area so any text
area one and then I'm going to put an
integer in here that's going to be
button clicked ok and then I'm going to
go through here and explain some of the
things so that you understand what's
going on but I'm not going to get into
massive detail like I said before
because I covered it before here I'm
making a call to the constructor file
that's going to create this whole entire
interface for me and then here is the
constructor file itself down here I'm
setting the size for my frame or my
window that's going to appear on the
screen here I'm creating a toolkit
object and what this is going to allow
me to do is get the width and height of
the screen this dimension is going to
allow me to store Heights and widths
Here I am figuring out the exposition
upper left-hand corner for my window by
taking the dam which is the width of the
screen divided by two then taking the
width of my actual window or frame and
dividing it by two that's how I'm
figuring out the X&amp;amp;Y position set
location is going to actually define
what X&amp;amp;Y position for my frame I'm going
to be creating set default close
operation is going to say that
everything should close down whenever
they hit the close button or exit button
set title is going to define the title
for my frame this is going to create a
panel that's going to be inside of the
frame or window and it's going to hold
all my components and here is where I'm
actually creating the button and here's
where I'm defining what the button text
will
so I'm sort of caught up there now and
exactly what we changed from the last
part of the tutorial
now I need to come in here and actually
create an instance that's going to
listen for events on my button so I'm
going to call this listen for button I'm
gonna go L for button is the name of
this listener and it's just listening
for events to occur on my button that's
what does don't just created that guy
then make sure of course you spell
everything right and all the code is
underneath this video and you should
definitely look at it because it's
heavily commented and it will help you
learn this stuff instead of just hearing
me talk about it then what I need to do
is go button one and go add action
listener and then I got to put L for
button inside of that guy now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to come down
here and actually create this class
called listen for button so let's scroll
way down here where it says implement
listeners alright now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to create a private
class it'll be called listen for button
like you saw above say scroll back up
here align 44 say listen for button this
is the class object we're going to be
creating here so I got to create the
class floor then if I want it to act
like an action listener or an event
listener or whatever you want to call
these things to think of them as anyway
I have to go implements action listener
right like that
okay now that I have that action
listener set up inside of this guy since
it is an interface I need to define a
method called action performed and later
on I'm going to show you a shortcut way
to be able to pull all these guys into
here for free without having to think
about what they are meaning the methods
that are needed for the interface and
then what I'm going to do inside of this
guy's I'm going to put an if statement
I'm going to say event that's what II
stand for I'm going to say get source
I'm going to say if it's equal to button
one meaning the button one had an event
occur on it well I want to do some
things so I'm going to say button
clicked plus plus it's going to add one
to the number of times the button was
clicked and then I'm going to go text
area one dot append which means I'm just
going to add to the text area I'm gonna
say button clicked and I'm going to
define how many times the button has
been
lect I'm going to put it in times and
then I'm going to put in a new line
statement then close that guy off I'm
just real quick if you would want to
return information regards to the button
itself and all the different events that
occurred you could also put a dot get
source like that and then follow that
with two string and that's going to put
out all kinds of information you can
consider that homework if you want try
typing that in and see exactly the type
of information it comes out but for
right now that's all we need to do to
implement this guy it's going to be able
to track how many times the buttons been
clicked so let's go back up into our
code and continue adding to it so we
come down here you can see right here
where it says the panel add that means
I'm going to add this button to the
panel that's going to go inside of the
frame and then here I'm also going to
create a text field and this is the text
that's going in there by default I'm
actually going to leave this blank
because I think it'll work better that
way and n15 is going to be roughly the
size of it now I'm going to put a
listener inside of this guy it's going
to be called listen for Keys L or keys
like that is equal to new listen for
keys and this is going to track keys
being clicked on I'm going to show you
for a second here how to run that guy
then I'm going to go text field one dot
add key listener
say before we had add action listener of
saying hey I want you to listen for any
actions this is saying I want you to
listen for any key presses that's all
it's doing then all I need to do is say
L four keys for this guy that I defined
right here for the class that I'm going
to create down below then I'm gonna
scroll down here and actually start
creating this guy so right after this
I'm going to go private class listen for
keys implements using an interface here
key listener and here I'm going to show
you a shortcut to be able to bring in
all of the required methods that are
needed for this class since I'm
implementing the key listener interface
I'm just going to come over here where
this little error mark is and then this
little thing pops up where it says add
unimplemented methods and I'm going to
click on that it's going to fill in all
of the different methods that are
required to use this key listener
interface right inside of there it's
going to save me a lot of time it's
going to keep me from a fan
memorize all this stuff this is built
into eclipse which is free then I can
come right down here and here is where
you would want to type in any comments
that would be specific to the changes
you're making one thing I'm going to do
is come in here to where it says key
event change that to E and basically
this method is going to be called any
time a key is clicked on so what I'm
going to tell it to do is I'm going to
say I want you to take text area one and
I want you to append to it key hit colon
plus and then I'm going to call e to get
key character what this is going to
output is the character that was clicked
on inside of that text field and it's
going to put it in my text area so all
it's going to do and then this guy would
be called if a key was pressed and then
released and this would be called
whenever a key was just simply hit so I
see no reason implement these but I do
need to define even though I'm not going
to put any code in there because that's
just a role for using this interface so
now I'm going to scroll back up here
again and I'm going to start making some
ditional changes to this text area that
I defined inside of here and you can see
right here this is where I added the
text field to the panel which we have to
do here I'm defining my new text area
where I'm going to be dumping all kinds
of information into it here is going to
be the default text I'm going to say I'm
gonna say tracking events I'm going to
put a new line inside of there set line
rap is saying that whenever we get to
the end of the text area on the right
side I want it to wrap down to the next
line set wrap style word is saying that
I don't want to split words this defines
a scroll pane if it's needed which is
just little scroll bars and this is
saying as needed so it's not going to
show up unless it's needed here we added
the scroll bars and here we added the
panel itself to our frame so now I'm
going to come down here and I'm going to
do some listening events for the window
or the frame but it's kind of funny
because Java will refer to frames as
frames and sometimes refer to them as
windows either way now I'm doing exactly
the same thing is equal to new listen
for window it's just the same thing over
and over again then I'm going to say
this add window listener this being a
reference to the frame or the window
that's going to be on the screen I'm
going to say L for window now we can
come down here and actually create
listen for window copy that let's scroll
down here come down here paste in that
and again I'm going to go private class
listen for window and this guy's gonna
implement the window listener so it's
going to track events that occur on our
window and then what are we going to do
we're going to save ourselves time again
come in here I'm gonna come up here and
click on import window listener and then
come over here click on it again and say
add unimplemented methods there you go
now I don't have to type all those out
or memorize them I'll go through and
explain what this means window activated
means this is called whenever the window
is the active window and I'm gonna make
a change here I'm going to put an e
inside of here and I'm going to print
out a message based off of the fact that
that is active and I'm just going to say
app end and I'm going to say window is
active close that off and I'm going to
copy this because I'm going to use it
again window closed this is called
whenever the window is closed using the
dispose function and the way that works
show you real quick if this which is
reference to the frame or the window
itself disposed is called
inside of our java code this guy right
here will be called so I see no reason
to do anything with that since I'm not
going to be using it window closing is
called whenever the window is closed
from the menu window deactivated is
called when the window is no longer the
active window that means like if you
click on some other window maybe I'll do
something with that pasted inside of
there window is not active window D I
quantified what that means is it's gone
from it's minimized forms to its normal
state and I can come in here put
something in there for that window I
quantified that just means that it's
been minimized and I could come in here
and do this input is minimized and
window opened is called whenever the
window is first created like originally
created we come in here and make some
changes to that create it so those are
all the different things you can do
inside of here in regards to tracking
window events let's jump back up into
our code and just keep adding stuff to
this let's say we wanted to track mouse
movements inside of our little
application we create again I'm going to
do the same thing when we go listen for
Mouse to find the class that I'm going
to need to
all this stuff inside here listen for
mouse is equal to new listen for mouse
and then I'm going to go the panel so
this is going to track all mouse
movements on the panel add mouse
listener L for Mouse see same thing over
and over and over again so I just need
to define this class so I'm going to be
doing that down below and guess what
we're going to do drive it class just
like we did before listen for mouse
implements Mouse listener we click over
here on the left side going to click on
import Mouse listener click back over
here on the left side and have it add
all my unimplemented methods there you
are
I'm going to scroll up here and I'm
going to grab this little text area
thing we created before come back down
inside of here
this is called whatever the mouse is
clicked obviously and let's change this
to e I'm going to do a little bit more
interesting things here I'm going to say
mouse panel position this is going to
give me the XY position inside of the
panel get X plus e get Y then I go to
plus and I'm going to throw a new line
in there just keep everything consistent
I'm actually going to copy this it's not
only am I going to get the x and y
position inside of the panel but I also
want to get the X and y position on the
screen and you can get both and it's
just get X on screen say it totally
makes sense let it have that name and
this is the same on screen not much
difference make sure we have a semicolon
at the end there and we could also do
some other things like get the mouse
button that was clicked and how we do
that is go e get button like that
pretty simple outside of there throw
this down here let's say we want the
number of clicks the number of times a
person clicked if you want to track if
it was a double click or not we're just
going to go get click count and for
everything else I'm just going to leave
those default just empty of course mouse
entered means that the mouse is entered
wherever you put your mouse listener
which would be on your panel mouse
exited means that left that area
mousepressed means the mouse buttons
pressed and mouse released means of
course the mouse buttons been released
so we added all this crazy stuff to it
let's execute it and see what happens
there he goes you can see here if you
can't see this click full screen this is
an HD video you can see it this tracking
events we
doh activated window created and if I
click here you can see the buttons been
clicked on if I click up here you can
see I hit a letter a I hit a letter G
that's all that stuff's being clicked on
come in here click with a mouse button
I'm getting the position inside of my
panel as well as my position on my
screen mouse button one was clicked and
the number of clicks here I double
clicked with my right mouse button you
can see all that informations been
tracked so there's a whole bunch of
different things you can do in regards
to tracking events on GUI interfaces in
Java leave any questions or comments
below we're talking you want me to cover
in the future the next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
