how to get the new facebook timeline
profile like you see here on the screen
so you can be the coolest guy on
facebook it's actually really really
really easy all you basically have to do
sign up to be a Facebook Developer so
let's jump in first thing you want to do
is go to developers book.com and you
want to come up here and click on apps
and here you've got to give Facebook
permission to access your information
basically if you want to proceed you
have to click oh wow they already got
your information anyway and then you
want to come up here and go to create
new app click on that and then you have
to give it a name clicking agree of
course and I'm just gonna say messing
with profile and then you have to give
it a name space which is basically with
profile without any spaces inside of it
then after you're done with that you
just click on continue and then it's
going to load for a little while because
I think a lot of people are just
starting to figure out how to do this
then you have to type in security code
and hit submit and then it's going to
require you to verify your account with
either a credit card or a mobile phone
i'm going to use mobile phone and
facebook is going to send you a code
through a text message and then you hit
confirm and then you close out of that
and you agree and you hit continue and
then you have type in includes or
whatever it says on screen it's MIT type
in something people can see for example
a I understand say profile get started
and in further tutorials I'm going to
get into a lot of this cool stuff but
for right now set this up just go to
save changes and next and see it Save
Changes on next the corner and it is
scroll down to bottom of the screen and
hit Save Changes and next mmm scroll
down to the screen and say save and
finish and whenever you see this on your
screen you know you set up everything
properly so just go to Facebook and now
you can see here introducing timeline
that means you said everything up
properly click on get it now and there's
my daughter and you want to click on add
a cover and choose from photos if you
have a photo that is 120 x 3 75 or you
just go upload a photo and this is the
one that i'm going to upload as my cover
photo select it hit open and you can
either drag it around to reposition
just hit save changes in there you go
you have the brand-new cool facebook
timeline profile it published now and
everyone else that knows about this is
now going to see your new profile the
way that it's set up currently the only
people that get to see it or actually
people who already know about it so hope
that helps leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
