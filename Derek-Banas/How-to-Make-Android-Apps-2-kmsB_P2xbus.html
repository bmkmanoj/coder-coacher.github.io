2 of my tutorial series on how to make
Android apps today we're going to focus
in on linear layouts responding to user
input and creating toasts so I have a
lot to do so let's get into it alright
so here is Android studio and I'm going
to go new project and this is gonna be a
really fun tutorial for me to make so
I'm going to call this messing around
and everything else is going to stay
exactly the same as in the last tutorial
which if you didn't see it you probably
should watch that and we're going to
click on next and I'm going to have this
be a blank activity and I'm going to
click on next and then I'm going to come
up here I'm gonna leave the main Java
class named main activity and the layout
to be activity main and we're also going
to cover translation and things like
that so that will be able to also handle
or our app will automatically adjust and
be able to work with different languages
forgot to say I was going to cover that
and I'm going to cover a whole bunch of
other different things I didn't mention
so let's just wait for Gradle to build
and then we'll be able to get into it ok
so here is everything hopefully you can
see it and the very first I'm going to
do is I'm going to change relative
layout to linear layout and to do sewing
just type in linear layout and just get
the shortcut there I'm going to come
down here and click on linear layout as
well all right there we go and that was
pretty simple now whenever we go and set
this to a linear layout remember we're
also going to have to set the
orientation so I'm just going to come in
here and I'm going to type in
orientation and it's going to pop up for
me and then I'm going to set this to
horizontal and we're going to be playing
around with horizontal and vertical and
everything else and you can see
everything is all set up there now I'm
also going to want to add another text
view inside of here and I'm going to
zoom in and it's pretty much going to do
everything for you just type in T and
it's going to come up here you can see
text view is already highlighted you
just did enter and it creates the text
view for you and you can come over here
and we're going to say wrap content and
you can see wrap content is right there
so I can just type in a W hit that type
in another W hit that now basically what
wrap content means is it's going to
cause the widgets on the screen to
become either shorter or longer
pending upon whether the content is
longer than the screen width and then if
it is longer a new line is going to be
added and if it does take up all the
space or Rosanna Lee and a new widget is
added that new widget may or may not
show up on your screen so that's how
that is all set up and if you want to
add some text into this try to zoom out
so you can see and at the same time
we'll be able to fit everything on the
screen in our text view just come in
here and type in text and then hit enter
and you can see it's already showing up
inside of there and then I'm just going
to type something random here goodbye
you crazy
Android app it has in I don't know I'm
just getting this out of my head knowing
you okay good bye you crazy Android app
it has been nice knowing you and let's
live in you there we go so I just wanted
to type in something really really long
inside of the screen right there oh and
make sure this is text not text size and
there you go and everything's all fixed
and you can see here whenever we have
this set for wrap content that is going
to wrap it down it's going to keep it
inside of this enclosing box but it's
going to wrap it down now what happens
if we go in and we add another text view
again text view there it is wrap
contents fun wrap contents fun there we
go then here we're just going to say
more well text select the top option and
then inside of that we could say just
more random text and you can see over
here that more random text is not
showing up on our screen say I like that
now however if we would come up here and
change this to vertical you can now see
that everything is showing up there's
hello world there's a goodbye crazy word
ba-da-da and more random text everything
shows up in that situation it's change
back to horizontal now
layout weight is going to consider the
amount of space that's needed for each
element and then divide up the space on
our screen now since the second widget
is so much bigger than the other two
this is going to cause some different
problems for us and we're just going to
come in here and we'll explore that so
I'm going to go into the very first
hello we're alt text for you that we
have here and I'm going to type out
lay out wait there it is and we'll type
in a 1 for that here gonna do the same
thing for this other guy that's down
here really long lay out wait there we
go and let's say 1 for that now
basically what we're doing here is we're
saying that everything should divide up
everything into threes but as you can
see sometimes that gets crazy and there
it is so what it's trying to do is
divide everything up between the total
available space but since this is taking
up so much space it's sort of getting
confused and like I said what lay out
wait tries to do is divide up everything
equally in this situation because
everything has the same layout wait
don't worry if that doesn't make sense
I'm going to show you another example it
will make sense if we just decided to
change this from goodbye you crazy
Android app this gigantic long thing
right here down to the smaller size
you're going to see that everything
divides up a lot more equally so
everything looks a little bit more
normal in that situation and again you
have to sort of move your ideas into the
constraints of the system but really
there aren't that many constraints and
this constraint pretty much lies in the
idea that we're trying to use a linear
layout because other layouts would work
better in this situation but I
definitely want to show you that another
thing we can do here is we can set what
is called gravity for our linear layout
the whole entire layout and all the
components inside of it and how we do
that is we just come in here and we type
in gravity like that and it's this
second one like this and you can see
here we can either align to the bottom
center Center horizontal Center vertical
cliff horizontal da-da-da-da-da there's
a whole bunch of different options but
for the most part you're going to stick
with left right top and bottom you're
also going to see start which is going
to be the beginning depending upon which
direction the letters are going because
some languages go from left to right and
some go for right to left
that's how start and end are going to
fill in there and
that hopefully makes sense but another
thing it's kind of cool is you can also
use multiple so let's say you want it to
be centered but you also want it to be
at the top you just put it or sign
inside of there and type in Center top
and everything is going to be centered
that way and with the button example
going to show you here in a second
that's going to look a lot better and
make a lot more sense now of course if
we come down here into the design
section and click on that we're also
going to be able to change all of these
guys in multiple different ways for
example we'll be able to come in here
and define our height and our width and
we can use DPS which is just going to
scale pixels based off of the screen
density or the resolution or however you
want to look at it and we're also going
to be able to define gravity which you
already saw before for all these
different guys I went over here and I
clicked on it text you that's just going
to old text that's all it's going to do
there you can see weight styling we're
going to get into later alpha we'll get
into later you can also define the
background you use colors you can use
images you can use all kinds of
different things you can find if it's
clickable if you want to be able to
catch that if it's editable whether it's
focusable which basically means if
they're going to be able to focus on it
or select the text or highlight or copy
it change the font family you can see
gravity there again and a whole other
bunch of different things here that I'm
going to get into later whenever you get
into styles I want to keep everything
simple here in the beginning so
everything makes a hundred percent of
sense now what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to commit here and select all
these guys and delete them and I'm going
to go in and throw a couple buttons
around I'm going to go back into the
text box right here and I pretty much
consider it just as easy to drag and
drop with a GUI interface it's just come
in here and type because there's so much
code completion involved so first I'm
going to do is I'm going to define a
button and I can just hit that and it
does everything for me I'm going to have
this be wrapped content I'm going to
have this be wrapped content and then if
I want text inside of my button just go
down to the next line type in text there
we are and to keep this nice and short
I'm just going to say first button and
then let's make a cup of coffees and
then this one's going to be second
button and this is going to be third
button there now that we have all this
set up you can see there they are on our
screen now I could come in here
and make these buttons fit a little bit
better just by changing the font size on
them and to change that font size again
we're going to use SPS for fonts DPS for
everything else and this is just going
by using SP going to scale the pixels
based on preferred font size which is
going to work out a lot better for us so
if I want to change my text size I just
come in here and type in text size there
you go now let's say I want to do
something like 15 SP and let's just do
that for everything there we go and then
do the same thing for this guy there we
go there you can see they're a little
bit smaller on our screen now before I
go into talking about padding and
margins and borders and content I
thought it would make sense to review it
very quickly now if this is the content
right here on our screen right here this
is actually going to be the text in this
situation where we have our button now
the padding is going to be everything
between that text and the border
so that's padding it's inside up to the
border and then everything spacing wise
outside of the border is going to be
margin so padding's inside margins on
the outside so let's come in here and
let's play around with those things so
let's say that we want to do padding
inside of it just type in padding and
you can see that you can add padding
everywhere top right left and bottom or
you can add padding on just the
individual pieces like this and
hopefully you remember what I'm saying
about the start in the top well I'm just
going to keep this simple and I'm going
to add padding everywhere so I'm just
hit this like this I'm going to go 15
and where you use DP because we use DP
everywhere except for fonts and I can
also come in here and do exactly the
same thing for all of our other buttons
go and there we go and you can see over
here how things have changed basically
all I did was I put spacing between the
text here and the outside border if Oh
ever let's go and see if you can see
this over here if you can't this is a HD
video give you a full-screen let's
change this to 25 instead EPS see how
big the button got bigger all right now
I could come in here and let's change
this to 15 and if I come in and do
something like play with the margins now
which I can just go layout margin that's
what
working with right there and here you're
going to define either layout margin
well let's go in here and undo that
first so let's type in margin again
there you can see this is going to be
the margin on the top bottom right left
this is going to be margin bottom and
left right and start and top okay so
that's all of the different margin
options that we have available to us I'm
going to stick with the regular old
margin and let's say that I do 20 DP on
this look how dramatically that change
see it started moving and things got
warped and everything else to be able to
fit in that margin that we said that we
wanted I'm going to do away with the
margins for now margins are very useful
I'm not saying they're not I'm just
saying in this situation they are not so
I'm just going to keep everything like
that another thing not certain that a
cover enough up here where we are
defining our layouts width and I have
match parent well actually let's go and
actually do a match parent so for the
very first button what I'm going to do
I'm going to change this from wrap
content to match parent and you're gonna
see what happens boom now you only see
one button on our screen basically what
match parent is going to do is if the
first widget has match parent it will
push all the other widgets off the
screen if instead we would use match
parent with the last component it will
take up all of the additional space that
wasn't needed by all the previous
widgets so let's change that back to
wrap content right like this and it will
come down here to the last one just to
prove that that's correct and match
parent so match parent also be good in
situation see how the third button is
slightly bigger than the first in a
second what it's doing since the last
widget that we have here on our screen
has match parent it's saying I want to
take up all the space not required by
second button and first button okay so
that's how that's operating we're going
to change that back to wrap content
again again with our buttons we're also
going to be able to use layout weight to
define how much the extra space that is
available that is not needed by the
other components goes automatically and
resizes the largest component or the
component that has the highest layout
weight so in this situation for our
third button we're going to come in here
and we're going to go layout weight
first thing selected and we're going to
change this to two and you're going to
say that the third
button automatically resized and took up
the rest of the weight that was there we
could also come in here and do layout
weight won and so forth and so on
but basically it's saying that third
button is going to take up everything so
let's just do a out weight and let's say
1 and then layout weight and we'll do 1
again but you can see nothing really
changed because layout weight is taking
up additional space that is its purpose
in this situation now I'm going to get
rid of all these buttons and do a
completely different layout here and I'm
going to demonstrate another way to
catch events that occur with our buttons
and so forth and so on so I'm going to
come in here and I'm going to create
another text view this is going to allow
us to interact with the user so text
view there it is I'm going to have this
be wrapped content this be wrapped
content then I'm going to come in here
and throw some text inside of it jump up
to the next one and I'm going to have
are you happy let's say also that I want
to increase my text size a little bit
here text size there we go and let's
change it to 20 SP and now it's a little
bit bigger you can actually see it on
our screen what we're going to do here
is we're going to create what's called a
nested linear layout that's going to
have not only a text view but it's also
going to have two buttons underneath of
it and to create another linear layout
you just type in linear layout just like
that you just created one right like
that here we're going to go wrap content
again and here we're going to wrap
content again and don't forget to also
come in here and set the orientation and
you can see that this guy doesn't end
with the forward slash and that closing
bracket here we're going to be putting
things in between the linear layout so
it's going to actually end like this but
we have to do the orientation first
rotation and let's also have this be
horizontal so it's a linear layout
inside of a linear layout it's not that
odd I have to decide what I want to put
inside of it let's say we want to put
another button inside of it there's a
button and let's just have it be wrapped
content again because that works fine
put some text inside of it one's going
to be yes and the other one's going to
be no so let's just go text there we go
and the first one is going to be yes
we're also going to be able to add a
hint if the user may be confused by what
the component does I think they'd
understand this component but either way
we can type that in a hint just to show
you
how to do that because they pick me and
then we're also going to give them the
option to say that they're not happy
hopefully they are and here we'll just
say no and we could say no pick me
whatever for the hint on top of that I
want to have a way for them to enter
their name underneath of this we come up
here first though and changes the
vertical there we go now you can see
it's going to say are you happy and then
in the other linear layout that's
horizontal it's going to have two
buttons underneath of it now if I want
to put an editable text area that's
going to allow them to edit the text and
enter their name I could go over into
the GUI layout or I could just come
inside of here and just go like this
well first off I'm gonna create another
linear layout just to make this more
complicated here we are
linear layout I'm gonna have it be
wrapped content I think again know what
the heck might as well come in here and
also cover the fact that if yes indeed
you could also set the width
specifically so let's say you wanted
this to be 200 DP and then for our
height we wanted this to be 50 DP you
can also define very specific things
like that and then for our width we're
going to have it be wrap content again
and then for our height we're also going
to have it be wrap content and this is
actually underneath here right now and
in this situation I'm going to have the
orientation be horizontal now inside of
this I'm going to create an editable
text area that's going to allow the user
to enter their name and to do that just
type in edit text and I'm going to this
time to find a very specific size for
the width so we can also do this way
let's say 200 DP and then for this let's
say 50 DP hi we could also define very
specific type of data we expect to
receive so that it can handle things
like automatically capitalizing in a
normal way and to do that we'll go input
type and then you can see there are
numerous different ways date date time
none number number decimal number
password numerous different types of
data that it will be able to receive but
in this situation since I want to name
I'm a type in text person name it's
going to automatically switch to capital
whenever eight hits of space you know
that's basically it's going to do a
little thing but whenever
doesn't do that for you kind of irritate
you so we're going to cover that and I
could also come in here and add a hint
there's a hint and in this situation
type in your name but remember last time
I said you know all these things that we
have here everywhere we have text we
should actually save those in the
strings.xml file so that we'll be able
to easily translate to other languages
well how hard is that to do after you've
went and did all this mess here on your
screen it's actually pretty easy just
highlight everything and whenever you do
you're going to see a little light bulb
pop up you're going to click on that and
then go to extract string resource and
click on that and then a little window
is going to pop up here on our screen
and in this situation I'm going to type
in users underscore name edit text you
can type in anything you want and click
on values that your values folder click
ok now what you're going to see is if
you come over here and open up your
strings dot XML file which is in the
values folder double click on it there
it is right there it automatically added
that for you which is very cool jump
back over into activity dot XML and
let's come in here and do a couple other
different things let's slowly close that
again I'm going to go in here and I'm
going to change all of the text into
text that is stored in strings.xml so
you know are you happy select that come
over here extract string resource there
it is
type in happy question boom and we know
it's in there automatically which is
really really great don't have anything
for the layout so you need to worry
about that right here we have yes so
let's just put our mouse there there's
light bulb that pops up click on that
extract string resource opens up again
call this answer yes button click ok go
down to the no click there over here
click on light bulb extract string
resource answer no button ok and this
guy down here we already have it set up
and then we're also going to want to get
this linear layout we have right here
cut that out of there and put it inside
of there and there you can see the name
went underneath the buttons which looks
a little bit better ok so now that we
have all of these guys set up so that
they actually refer to the strings dot
XML file how hard is it for us to
translate these into different languages
not that hard well we're going to need
to do is go into the resources folder
select this and I'm going to go
and I'm going to go directory so click
on directory and then what you need to
do is define a different what I'm going
to use here is Spanish so I have values
es so I'm going to type inside of there
so we have values which works as the
default and values es if the person's
phone is set to Spanish and if you want
to find what all the different country
codes are just go to Wikipedia org wiki
list of ISO 639 - 1 codes okay and here
you're going to see every single code
specifically I'm looking at these codes
right here and if we go down further
enough it's going to show a s is indeed
Spanish so jump back over and keep
setting it up alright so now we have
values dot es now I'm going to right
click on that and I'm going to go new
and I'm going to go file and I'm going
to call this exactly the same
strings.xml except it's going to be in
the values des folder created that right
there I'm going to go into the
strings.xml file that we have right here
open that default it up I'm going to
select it copy that and I can close it
and jump over here there's nothing there
pasted in this one and then translate it
and through the power of video editing I
just translated everything then I'm just
going to save it then automatically if
the person goes and they have a phone
set to Spanish it's automatically going
to translate it and that is all that's
into translating the different languages
now of course you can have to set up
folder for each language you want to be
able to support but that's not that hard
now previously I showed you a way to
catch events with our buttons I'm going
to show you a brand new way to do that
this time if I want a specific function
inside of mainactivity.java to execute
when one of these buttons is clicked on
it's very easy I just go into the button
that I have right here and I'm just
going to type in on click alright like
that then I'm going to type in the name
of the function that I want executed
whenever our button is clicked on so it
doesn't have to even exist I can say on
yes button click is what I want that
function to be called and look at this
little light bulb pops up click on it
it's going to say create on yes button
click view in main activity yes do that
for me if I jump over in the main
activity look at that it created it for
me in that cool so I'm going to do
exactly the same thing
my no button click here I'm going to say
on click write that in this situation we
call this on no button click pretty
simple now I can jump over into
mainactivity.java right like this and
set up all those guys whoops I forgot to
go and have it set up over here never
want to avoid a situation which I can
avoid clicking so there we go or typing
anyway and there you go both of them are
set up now if I want to be able to
interact with these different components
inside of my code I'm going to have to
create them over in main activity so I'm
just going to type in private and I'm
going to have two buttons I can put them
both in here at the same time so I'm
going to have my answer yes button and
I'm also going to have my answer no
button both of those are defined inside
of there I also have the editable text
area that I want to be able to pull
their name from and I'm going to call
this user's name edit text there you go
and I probably want to go in here and
also initialize them inside of oncreate
so this is the guy that it's called
whenever the activity first starts up so
to initialize them I'm going to
initialize the yes first right like this
you can see how little I have to type
there's button there we go and then here
I can type fine or I just typed in F I
find my ID but then I remember I forgot
to give them an ID so let's jump back
over into activity main.xml not a big
deal very simple to do so I need to do
this for my buttons and my editable text
area so to create an ID I'm just going
to go into my first button right here
type in ID there it is I'm going to
click on this because it's brand new
when I want added to the our dot Java
file and I'm going to call the very
first one answer yes button going to do
the same thing for the no button ID yes
I'm going to call this answer no button
and then I also want to do the editable
text area so I can get the name out of
here so give it an ID as well and I'll
call this users name edit text all right
pretty good save that jump over into
mainactivity.java now that they have IDs
I can come in here and type in our dot I
D and this is going to be specific for
the yes button so whenever I type in a
and answer yes button pops up there
is put my semicolon inside of there jump
down to the next line do this the proper
way this time so I should say answer no
button there it is equal and this is
going to be a button automatically going
to fill that in for me fi I know that's
going to work and once you start getting
used to how the shortcuts work it's
gonna be so easy and here I'm just going
to answer no button there we are
jump to the end put a semicolon and jump
back over here and I also want to
initialize the editable text area and
we'll just call this users name edit
text is equal to this is going to be an
editable text area there we go if I
there it is five you by ID r dot ID dot
user's name did it editor put that there
semicolon and everything's been
initialized so that's great no well I
got to do is come down here inside of
here and open up what is called a toast
it's just a little popup window that
shows up on your screen to give a little
notification to the user you can send
them a little note very useful if you've
ever used Android you've seen the little
grey things that pop up near the bottom
of the screen with a little note inside
of them first thing I'm going to do
though is I'm going to go string and I'm
going to get the user's name and store
it inside of here and I'm going to cast
this into a string so I'm gonna have to
go string value of like that and I'm
going to say user's name editable text
there it is and I put a dot at the end
of that I can say get text and there
that is don't have to put anymore put a
semicolon now I got the user's name
hopefully they entered and I'm not going
to check right now to verify that they
did we'll get into handling conflicts
later on and then I'm going to come in
here and go your yes response because
they wouldn't have gotten to this
function if they didn't enter yes and
just to keep this simple I'm going to
say that is great remember I asked them
if they had a good day and I'll print
out the user's name now to create the
toast like I said it just displays a
little pop-up on a screen very simple
just go toast make text and you have to
pass this which is our activity and you
have to pass what you want to show up on
the screen which is the string that's
right
and then you have to tell it how long
you want this little message to show up
on the screen and you can either have it
be length long or short I'm just going
to have it be short and at the end I'm
going to say show want this to display
as soon as possible and there it is
that's how you make a little message pop
up on the screen and then for the no
button it's basically going to be
exactly the same
sewing lens will just copy it in this
situation we're going to say too bad
users name and everything else is going
to stay exactly the same well we could
come in here and go length and we could
change the short into long if we want it
to make it show on the screen longer and
it would probably also be nice just to
change us to no even though you don't
have to your no response and that we
could change this to yes response makes
better sense all right guys so that is
how to play around linear layouts I work
with toes how to take user input and a
whole bunch of your different things
please leave your questions and comments
