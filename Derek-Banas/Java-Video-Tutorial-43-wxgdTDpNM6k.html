43 of my Java video tutorial series
today we're going to learn all about
Java server pages however if you haven't
watched my Java servlet tutorial there's
links above you should definitely watch
that because we're gonna use some of
that code alright so let's just get into
it now this is my servlet that we made
before and if you see down here lists
where we had to print out HTML and body
and all this nonsense
well in this tutorial I'm gonna show you
how to get around that and of course
we're gonna do that with Java server
pages so let's get into the code if you
can't see this just view it fullscreen
it's an HD video we're gonna click on
web content and then we're gonna go new
and then we're gonna go JSP file and I'm
gonna call this calculate ASP because
that's kind of what I'm gonna do and it
ends with dot JSP and then I just click
on next
make sure you have new JSP HTML file
selected and then click finish
alright so that's now opened up your own
screen and now a Java server page is
just an HTML file with Java embedded
using really cool little tags and of
course it ends with JSP instead of HTML
this guy right up here what we have to
do is you need to learn what all these
little tags are it's real simple there's
only for Allah so this guy right up here
where we're defining the language and
the content type and the character set
and all that is what is known as a JSP
directive and you use it to set options
and as well import libraries which I'm
gonna show you here in a second so let's
just jump down here right before the
HTML area and let's say there's a
library that you need to use well we're
just gonna use the directive to be able
to come in here and set that all up so
if you want to import a library you just
type in page followed by import equal to
whatever library you want to bring in
here there's the math library and make
sure you surround it with quotes but in
this situation we do not need to put a
semicolon in there and we're gonna jump
down into the body section and the next
thing I'm going to talk about is what is
called a scriptlet what we're gonna do
with this is you just make a little mark
in there with that little % and ass
triplet is going to allow you to just
basically enter any type of Java code
directly right into the HTML so let's
say I wanted to go out say I'm just
gonna go out print just like we did
before and say today's date and put a
colon inside of there and
in this situation with scriptlets you
need to put a semicolon in there as
you're gonna see here in a minute you're
also going to be able to stretch this
across multiple lines so you don't have
to keep typing this little bracket in
here with the percent sign then the next
type of code that you have in Java
server pages are what are called
expression codes with that you're just
gonna come in there put the little
bracket parentheses and equal to let's
say I wanted to say new Java util date I
want my date to show up in there
remember I don't need a semicolon with
this guy and that is going to
automatically just shoot out the current
date and time and all that other
information and an expression evaluates
to a string that's what it does so
basically whatever you would put inside
of here
this guy right here whatever you have in
here in regards to code asked to output
a string and then that string is going
to pop on the screen wherever you have
this all set up up next we're going to
get into declarations and let's say for
example you wanted to declare some type
of method or some type of field or
variable whatever you want to call it
inside of a Java server page you just
put these little brackets with the
percent sign followed by an exclamation
point and then you could go int number
one for example and number two and with
this guy you do have to put a semicolon
in as well like I said any variable or
field or method or anything that you
create on this page is going to be
accessible to all the other code as long
as it is set up here inside of a
declaration I'm gonna throw some break
statements in here see just basic HTML
or easy to work with let's say I wanted
to create a form and then have whatever
the result of the information that is
sent into the form is automatically shot
back to this same Java server page and
processed what I'm gonna do is just
basically come in here and go create a
form and I'm gonna say that my action is
going to be equal to whatever the name
of this is and this is called oculi JSP
all right
JSP so basically whatever is sent inside
of here is going to be shot back to this
and then processed
I'm gonna go method and I'm gonna go
post like that and then let's say that I
want to have the person enter two
numbers like that and then throw in an
input box type is equal to text and then
name is equal to and I'm just going to
call this number one close off that
input and I'm going
select this guy here I'm gonna have
another input and I'm just gonna call
this number to just make this nice and
simple and then of course I'm also gonna
have to come in here let's just go like
this and then type in submit put in a
submit button inside of there and let's
change the value equal to calculate and
then I need to of course close off my
form which is right there now what is
really neat is I'm gonna say then the
answer and I'm gonna use a JSP
expression again remember that evaluates
to a string so we just put our percent
signs falls by equals and then if I say
request get parameter just like we did
whenever we were messing around with
scriptlets and I say that I want
whatever the value of number 1 is to
show up inside of there and then
remember we don't need to come in here
and put a semicolon a step there and I'm
also going to shoot out whatever number
two is equal to and then down here I'm
going to create a block of code that I'm
gonna be playing around with and this is
a scriptlet area for us to write our
code now if I want to be able to process
all this I need to throw everything
inside of a try block see just like
regular Java and then I'm gonna
reference that field or variable I
created above now remember we're gonna
have to turn this into an integer if we
want to perform an addition here because
requests get parameter always returns a
string and I'm gonna say whatever num1
is in this situation you got to close
that off and then I'm gonna go to num2
and change this to num2 create an
integer I go some of nums is equal to
number 1 plus number 2 and then if I
want to print out the screen and just go
out print and then let's say I want to
go equals to get rid of that and go sum
of gnomes and that's going to print out
that result out to my screen and because
I have a try block of course I'm gonna
have to have a catch block and the error
that it's gonna throw is number format
exception and I'm just gonna call this
e^x and in this situation you know to
stuff whatever that stuff might be that
you'd like to do and if we file save
this guy it's gonna be real simple we
just go calculate JSP right click on it
and inside of here you're just gonna
have to go run ass run on server go next
make sure that less than 41 sat over
there and hit finish and there it is and
this guy will add numbers for
and do all kinds other things you also
see the date shows up in there and if I
hit calculate it's gonna go four or five
is equal to not and of course I could
just come in here and correct that quite
easily by coming in here between these
two guys and throwing a plus sign in
there saving it again and right click
run as run on server and they got four
or five calculate now we have that right
oh the code in this tutorial is
underneath of the video you can also
vote on whatever my next big tutorial is
gonna be leave any questions or comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
