presentation on gestures and body
language Kelley b23 wrote me and asked
do you know how to read gestures and
body language if so teach me in this
presentation I will do just that
what I did was I studied over 25
psychology and law enforcement training
manuals I discovered what they all
agreed with and put it all into this one
presentation I want to start off first
with the eyes a person's eyes dilate
strongly when they are very stimulated
and in a problem-solving mode at maximum
dilation the person is ready to make a
decision which is most likely going to
be positive an eyebrow raises a sign
that a person isn't threatening when you
actually raise your eyebrows to somebody
even if they're a complete stranger
they'll often smile this is a very
submissive sign or at least it's
perceived that way whenever you're first
meet somebody the first person to look
away is considered to be the most
submissive if a person is maintained a
strong eye contact they are either one
interested in you if their eyes are
dilated or challenging you if their eyes
are constricted the most threatening
look is achieved by moving narrowed eyes
towards a person with little to no body
movement the speed of this head movement
will demonstrate how angry that person
is Liars maintain strong eye contact
with people it should actually become
uncomfortable at some point if someone
gives you a sideways glance look at
their eyebrows if they're raised they
like you if not they don't if a person's
blink rate increases this is considered
a sure sign line if a person's eyes are
darting around they're either getting
bored or nervous when first meeting a
person shake hands with strong eye
contact and then give them at least
three seconds to look at you
uninterrupted to generate the best
rapport to build strong rapport you
should look them in the eyes somewhere
between 60 to 70 percent of the time
this is a really interesting chart a lot
of people don't know this but whenever
people are trying to remember something
they'll look in certain directions so
for example if a person looks upwards
and to your right they're trying to
remember something they visually saw and
if they look sideways in to the right to
try and remember something they heard
down and to the right is whenever there
a person is talking to themselves and if
they're either trying to construct
something that they've never seen or
they're planning on lying to you they
will look up and to the left down and to
the left is where a person looks
whenever they are feeling something or
remembering an action you might be
asking yourself or you might be thinking
to yourself right now well I just feel
more comfortable with my arms crossed in
front of me for example or some other
what you have to understand is if you
feel
comfortable with a specific body
position it is because you're feeling a
certain way ask yourself for example
when would you feel comfortable with
your arms crossed while enjoying
yourself with a loved one or even better
yet have you ever seen anyone cross
their arms in excitement now on to
handshaking when shaking someone's hand
if their hand is on top they're trying
to dominate you which means that they
literally take your hand and flip it so
that your palm is facing towards the
ceiling also if they grip it like a vise
that also means they're trying to
dominate you an equal handshake in which
both people shake in a vertical manner
with equal pressure is the best way to
generate good rapport do not shake with
both hands to touch any other part of
the body unless you have an intimate
relationship with this person at most a
brief touch to the elbow which is
considered a non intimate part of the
body during a handshake has been shown
to generate very good feelings and
generate very good rapport a valuable
clue to whether a person is being open
and honest is whether it's showing their
palms or not so to elaborate honesty
equals palm displays if a person says
they can't do something and they show
you their hands they're telling you the
truth and what's better yet if you talk
with a lot of palm displays you'll
actually force the people you're talking
to to be more truthful hands clenched in
front of a person means they're holding
back a negative reaction holding one's
wrist behind their back is an attempt at
self control and if a person places
their head on their open hands as if on
a platter they're saying that they
admire you this by the way is the best
body position if you want to attract
people to yourself if a person's picking
imaginary the length they have a secret
opinion more than likely that they don't
want to tell you hands folding them
front hand and hand shows that you are
feeling vulnerable pointing at a person
is one of the most annoying gestures you
should also never rub your thumb to your
forefinger around people this is
considered the symbol for money rubbing
the hands together shows that you are
expecting something positive and it has
been shown that speed at which a person
rubs their hands will demonstrate how
good they expect the results today the
steeple hand gesture represents that you
are confident and self-assured this
gesture should be used sparingly however
if you want to guarantee a look of
confidence this is the look by pressing
your forefinger to your thumb you will
come off as Authority but not aggressive
what I mean by this is instead of
pointing with one finger instead take
your pointer finger place it on your
thumb and point in that way instead you
actually see a President Obama do this
very often only hands behind your back
shows that you're confident but you feel
superior the reason why is your
exposing all the delicate parts of your
body being the groin stomach and throat
all at the same time hands on hips show
that you're preparing to dominate unless
the elbows are held close to the body in
this case it would be a submissive
position if a person tucks their thumbs
in their pants rather than rest their
hands on their hips they're being very
aggressive thumbs protruding from pocket
shows that the person feels their
superior view we fold our arms in front
of ourselves when we feel either
threatened don't like or trust something
when you fold your arms you lose
credibility with people if you're
folding your arms while grasping your
biceps it shows that you're feeling very
insecure if you clench your fists while
folding your arms people will see you as
being hostile and arms crossed with
thumbs turned up shows that person is
warming up to you I'd like to go into
invisible walls a woman who often create
an invisible wall with a purse by
placing that purse between them and the
person that they do not trust if a
person puts a drink on the opposite side
of the hand in which they're drinking
that also creates an invisible wall
because they have to continually keep
reaching across their chest to get the
drink you can gain a lot of information
by studying people's legs the reason why
is information you gain by studying leg
and feet positions is extremely useful
because people have little control over
them this is why most meetings feel only
comfortable if two people have their
legs hidden by a table or desk if you
want to appear young and vibrant
you should always walk quickly while
swinging your arms also it has been
shown that people's feet will point
towards that which they want always
offer people a hot cup of coffee the
hotter the better
this makes it difficult to remain
crossed up without burning themselves I
know this kind of sadistic but another
tip to get a person unlock themselves in
vast and positive questions to get them
to tell you what they're feeling never
crush your legs and then have both hands
cradled behind your head this is an
extremely off-putting especially to
women here are some additional negative
leg positions jiggling of the feet is a
sign that the person wants to get away
from a situation open and uncross legs
show you are prepared to dominate while
cross legs show that you're closed off
or uncertain if legs across the knee
points towards that which you prefer and
you should never ask a person to make a
decision if their legs and arms are both
crossed at the same time if a person has
the legs crossed then they're holding
them in place with their hands they are
feeling very stubborn and a person that
locks their ankles together is
essentially biting their lip if a person
locks one foot around their calf or
thigh they're showing signs of timidness
and if a person sits oddly in a chair
they're showing that
don't see you as being important if
however they flip the chair around and
place the back of the chair towards you
they're using the back of the chair as a
shield and again plan on dominating you
or strongly disagree with what you're
saying here are some positive leg
positions women's specific cross and
uncross their legs around people that
they like more specifically they cross
their legs in a parallel manner when
they really like someone if as you speak
to somebody that one on their feet
continually keeps moving closer and
closer to you that means that they are
feeling a strong connection to you you
can check to see that a smile is sincere
by checking for wrinkles at the eyes if
you smile at a person they will return
the favor more than likely and people
that smile a lot often will receive very
positive reactions from others when a
person is smiling they're often more
likely to be telling the truth as well
and a false smile will often appear
stronger on one side of the face versus
the other tight lip smiles on the other
hand in which teeth are not shown tell
you that the person is trying to keep a
secret and a smile on which the person
has their head turned down and their
eyes aimed upward is used to show that
the person is attracted to you laughing
is very attractive and makes you as well
as others feel comfortable laughter has
more to do with bonding than humor
though however as many people know
yawning is used by people to build
rapport and avoid aggression well that's
the end of the presentation hope you
liked that if you have any questions or
you have a question you'd like me to
research leave it in the comment section
