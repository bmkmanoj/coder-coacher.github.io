continue with part three of the complete
CSS tutorial now where I cover every
property and every change you can make
with cascading style sheets now on to
the background property like with the
font property there is also a background
property that allows you to change
multiple things in regards to the
background of your web page all on one
line as you can see here defining when
the background color is red I am
defining what the background image is
I'm defining that i do not want that
image to repeat now I want it to start
off in the top left-hand corner so let's
go forward to explain all the other
different properties than regards
background you can define the background
image with this property right here
followed by URL and location of the
image you can define how a background
will repeat main a background image with
a background dash repeat proper here are
some possible values first repeat what
this does if this is chosen like I did
here this background image is going to
repeat itself both horizontally and
vertically the no-repeat option will not
repeat the image at all or just show it
one time repeat act will repeat the
background image horizontally and the
repeat y will repeat the image
vertically the background position
property is going to tell the browser
when where you want your background
image to be located in this case left
right center bottom top either a
percentage or a length then you have
background attachment normally a
background image will scroll with the
rest of your page but if this property
is set to fix then the image will stay
in the same position as the user Scrolls
the following example would force the
image to remain fixed while scrolling so
if you want that option meaning that
this image over this is my background if
I had it set for fixed as I was
scrolling this would not move as you can
see it's moving if it was set to fixed
it
move so that's the background attachment
property it's one of the most confusing
properties and it's almost never used
here you by selecting the list dash
style property you can change what you
want your bullets to look like and here
are all the options that would be
available for you in regards to styling
bullets within Liss then you have your
list style image property here what
you're able to do is define a image that
you want to use for your bullets in your
list items now I'm going to go on to all
the table properties border collapse
property tells the browser which border
model should be used in a table you
choose the border collapse and the
property collapse underneath of it what
this does is it collapses the borders
around table cells so that there's only
one line between table cells versus if
you had separate which is the default
where every cell has its own or the
borders facing properties next for
defacing property can have one value to
specify spacing on all sides or two
values to specify the horizontal being
the first value and vertical the second
value then we have captions side
properties if you do not know what a
caption is in the table that probably
means you haven't seen my HTML tutorial
you click up here you'll be able to see
that with this you decide on what side
of the table you want your caption to
show up there was just one final
property left and that is the cursor
property for you use the cursor property
and then follow it up with and for
example help or crosshair or default you
can see how my cat cursor is changing
whenever somebody puts the mouse over
top of anything and this is every
property that's available to you in
regards to changing your cursor now you
understand all there is to know in
regards to changing properties and
property values and everything there is
in regards to cascading style sheets
except for the layout and positioning
properties
in the next presentation I'm going to go
completely through the box properties
and explain layout and positioning until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
