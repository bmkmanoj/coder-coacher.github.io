35 of my java video tutorial series this
time I'm actually going to take a
request from somebody out there and do a
whole entire tutorial on nothing but
common Java errors that I see
well one common job error that I see and
I'm just going to keep going through
these as I'm typing here I just have a
list and I'm going to keep punching them
out till I cover them all let's say you
need to use math library there's a
common job error the need for a library
that you do not import there's the first
one then you have the actual class
definition well it's perfectly legal to
go public class Java lesson 35 in this
situation and here's another error you
do not have your curly braces properly
closed one way to solve that as you're
programming is to say and of monk-like
that now you know what each curly brace
is associated with another common error
that I see is you guys for some reason
are calling these classes private that
you cannot do that the only thing you
can have a class B is either public
abstract or final I'm gonna slow down on
some of these but I think some are
pretty easy to catch pretty much
immediately and then on top of that you
can only have one public class per file
something else that I see that isn't
quite so common is an error that says
cannot make a static reference to a
non-static method what that means is you
go in and you type in private void and
then let's say this says print something
and then you call for said method from
the public static void main function and
you cannot do that and as you can see
here eclipse is sort of like helping me
out here
it'll also teach you exactly what's
going on that's why you should get
eclipse because eclipse is free now this
is very easy to fix just go in here and
just type in static and if you don't
remember you use static whenever you
want to be able to execute a method that
isn't part of the class definition and
if you forgot private means that this is
a method that is not visible outside of
the class all right so let's go on to
unresolved compilation problem basically
what that means is eclipse told you you
screwed up along the way and you ignored
Eclipse so let's say you also make a
column and air
like you put in a capitalization where
you're not supposed to and we except in
a number like that is equal to blah blah
blah blah blah
well clips is going to flip out here to
put a red line here and put a little
error message over here and it's going
to tell you exactly how to fix it which
is great give you all kinds of different
little things you can do here in this
situation not only going to work though
but you can just simply go in there and
put regular lowercase I in there and
then your problems are going to be
solved so unresolved compilation problem
means that Eclipse told you that you
messed up and you did not fix the
problem and this code is all available
underneath this video and everything's
heavily commented if you get the air as
string literal isn't properly closed
that probably means you're not using the
clips first off because it's kind of
hard to even do this so that means that
you went in here and you tried to create
a string and then store to type in a
string error and then you hit Enter
but you see that's the problem because
the clips actually just fix this for you
but either way and then if you will go
up here and erase that it'll actually
put a plus sign into here on top of that
to try and force you to do this right
we'll just go is a current so this is
what that means if I then you in here
like this and then go like that
obviously this is an error that's only
going to occur in a text editor this
right here is an error and you can see
it's underlined there you cannot break
strings off across multiple different
lines and it will get to one of the most
popular errors will go public static
void main string brackets args the main
function is messed up sometimes not used
at all many times in a lot of the
problems that I received from you guys
so make sure that it's public static
void main all right uppercase letters or
lowercase letters whenever they're
supposed to be don't forget the brackets
then don't forget args very very very
common error that I see and the area
you're going to see is exception in
thread in main no such method error and
then say : main you'll use it all the
time at least for now until you start
doing some things on the web so just
memorize it it's easier memorized let's
just imagine that I didn't elite that
method up here just put it in here
properly private static would print
something so it's back there again even
though it doesn't technically print
anything another error that I see all
the time is people call for the
method up here by going like this and
then putting a semicolon
that's another error and you need to put
these little brackets in there so little
error I want to whack always have to put
those brackets in there whenever you're
using any type of method and basically
the area you're going to get is can't be
resolved to variable because it assumes
that it's a variable and not a method
now you know how to fix that another
thing that I see all the time is
somebody will type in int I'm just going
to say number in this situation is equal
to 12 and then they'll go string another
number and they'll type in number
they'll try to take this integer and
turn it into a string that is not
possible that is not the way you do it
anyway one way that you can do it though
is to type in integer to string an input
little brackets around this guy and
there you go all the errors go away so
that's how you would turn an integer
into a string and then save it as a
string you can't do it in a very direct
format and another thing just so if you
wanted to know this you type in in
number is equal to integer parse int and
then you wanted to change that string
back into a number again well that's
exactly how you're going to do that with
parse int there's another error type it
in something
another num and then typing in another
number say there's another error that's
just naming things incorrectly so that's
something else you wouldn't want to do
and then trying to use variables
multiple different times meaning
declaring int number and int number
again well you can get rid of that
problem by just typing it number two and
there you go so a whole bunch of other
different hairs that I see all the time
another thing that might be confusing
because the error might not be
immediately apparent let's say that you
tried to create a dimension which is an
object and I've used in many many past
tutorials so if you type this in here
without bringing in the dimension
library it's going to hit you with an
error that doesn't make any sense it's
going to say can't be resolved to a type
that's it that doesn't really tell you
anything but actually this little popup
box here and if you can't see this you
can view this as a HD video fullscreen
one of the options under here it says
for quick fixes available one of them is
to import dimension if you double click
on that say there it is just imported
that library for you so
klipsch is smart enough to catch that as
well even in situations where the error
is kind of hard to make sense of another
thing I see all the time is you guys try
to call methods that aren't in a class
so let's say you go long
random long equal to lesson 34 dot
and this is all part of learning a
programming language you can see here
I'm calling a class that I did create
called less than 34 but I'm calling for
a method that doesn't exist inside of it
called round and I'm going to just throw
this in here real quick let's just say
double I is equal to 3.14 now you're
going to see that round says the method
round is undefined for the type less
than 34 there's another thing it's
calling a method that doesn't exist
and normally this isn't done this way
where it's blatantly you just mess up
this badly it's normally a
capitalization error or some other
misspelling or whatever is the reason
why that sort of stuff pops up just to
stick with that I'm just sort of like
improving a lot of this stuff here let's
say that you did actually want to use
the round function well a lot of you
guys get into the habit of going pi
which is this double right here and you
get into a habit mainly if you've worked
in other programming languages into
thinking that you can go pi which is the
variable here of the field and then call
the round method on it and that does not
work if you want to actually round pi
you have to go math dot round like that
and then throw PI inside of it and that
I said that's an error actually
experienced programmers have a tendency
to make no other thing that I see a lot
is let's jump out of here actually for a
second create another method I sort of
broke my own rule didn't I say main so
I'm going to go in here and go end of
main take the extra couple seconds it'll
save you a lot of time it's especially
good writing big programs public static
void get stuff and let's say I go in
here and I type in number one and number
two there's my method oh another error
why is there an error here because
whenever you define a method you need to
also tell it what type you are working
with the type of these variables that
are inside here and another error is the
calling of this method so let's say if I
go get stuff and I put in here one point
two three four
or and then I type in for inside of
there well why am I getting an error
here the method you're actually going to
see is the method is not applicable for
the arguments and that is indeed true
what's this a double what's this an
integer what's this an integer what's
this a double see these have to match up
whenever you call these different
methods another error that I see a lot
is syntax error on token and then it's
normally followed with a quote accom
it's basically doesn't know what you
want to do is what just sort of throws
up random things all over the screen
trying to figure out what you missed and
this could be caused in multiple
different ways one of the most common
ways that I say is let's say somebody
goes double some num and then they go
add them so they're calling a method and
then they go lesson five and then they
pass it variables again this is a thing
that experienced programmers sometimes
do because this is a normal common way
to be able to call different methods and
other programming languages but it
doesn't work that way in Java you want
to do pretty much this exact same thing
in Java you need to cut that out of
there and put class first and then
follow that up with your actual class
you can see again that that error also
is going to go away another thing that
I've seen a lot is let's say you're
trying to come in here and create an
integer and again this is something that
comes along with programmers that have
used other languages let's say you want
to create an integer array and you type
in new and then you say well I want to
have ten spaces I this is going to be a
multi-dimensional array and it's going
to be like that followed by int that's
completely not right it's so am i right
in other languages though and that's the
reason why people do it if you wanted to
find a multi-dimensional array in Java
need to go like this and then go int
array is equal to new int this and then
go ten and then go tone and there you go
the world is all happy because you
defined your multi-dimensional array the
job away so again there's another common
error that I see back in lesson 33 of
this tutorial series
I created a private method and it was
called get file info and this is lesson
33 and you go get file info and there
are no arguments or anything here but if
you put your little mouse over top of
this what you're going to see is the
method is not visible the reason why is
get file
phoE inside of the class lesson 33 is a
private method you cannot access private
methods even if you put the class name
before the method and another common
thing is local variable may not have
been initialized how you get that error
is you create a string for example like
this and this is all perfectly fine and
legal the only problem is if you then go
in here and let's say in a situation
like in your code for some reason or
another
how many never gets a value well there
is your problem that's whenever you're
going to get the local variable may not
have been initialized so how do you
solve that problem well you could do
something like just coming in here like
that throw an equal sign and then you
solve that problem because you basically
put nothing inside of this string rather
than just leaving it that way I mean it
integers it's very common to have zero
inside of them and so forth and so on
it's always a good idea to give default
values another thing that I saw actually
yesterday was caused because of a
misunderstanding of the method length in
regards to how length works with arrays
versus how length works with strings
they're completely different and the
error that you get is cannot be resolved
so that doesn't really help very much
I'm going to show you here exactly what
I mean so let's say we go
system.out.print line and then inside of
this we go how many which is a string
and we follow that with dot length you
cannot do that that is an error however
you can see up here with the int array
you could come in here and go int array
and that error is going to go away
however you could not do int array
followed by these two brackets here but
you could go in here and type in how
many with those brackets inside of it so
this is how you get the length for a
string versus how you get the length for
an array and then this is a weird one
I've only seen this a couple times but
it's a misunderstanding of what prefix
operators do versus what a postfix
operator does so let's say if you go in
or create an integer and you go int 1 is
equal to 1 and then you go Y int is
equal to 1 then what we're going to do
inside of this is we're going to go X
int is equal to
why ants and we're going to go plus plus
this is what we call a post fix now you
might be surprised if both of these are
equal to one you would think that the
value of x in tis going to be equal to
two right well let's come in here and
see if you're right
X and put that in there and then just go
X int I'm also going to have to call get
stuff I'm just going to put one inside
of there on one point two all right
execute it again and here you can see X
int is equal to one so that doesn't make
sense but it does because the way that
post fix works is it actually assigns
the value to X int of Y int and then
adds one to y int this variable right
here however if you would come in here
and get rid of this and put the plus
signs ahead of time and execute it
you're going to see that the value is 2
and there it is so that explains sort of
the differences between prefix versus
postfix and then the last thing I'm
going to cover
I also see a lot it's a misunderstanding
of how switch works so let's say you go
int J is equal to 1 like that and then
you type in switch and you type in DES
and then you do something like case the
value of de is equal to 1 and then you
want to print something out on-screen
this now let's say you want to do a
Monday when an will come in here and
then we just change this to 2 and this
is the 3 and this to 4 and this to
default like that and then this is
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday what
we're doing here is we're checking if
that value is equal to 1 and if that
occurs well we want to print Monday out
on the screen so let's see what actually
happens as you can see it prints Monday
Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and
the reason why is if you do not put a
break statement after each one of these
guys if any of them are true everything
that proceeds it will also be true so
definitely make sure that you put those
break statements there and if you
execute it now you're gonna see that
only Monday shows up so I think I
covered almost all the most common Java
errors if there's anything that I messed
leave a comment below or if you have any
questions leave a comment below the last
