2 of my how to create a wordpress theme
from scratch tutorial that was a long
man whenever we're all done with this
this is what the theme is going to look
like it's gonna be very very very
dynamic this is currently what it looks
like kind of a hot mess but you can see
that the middle bar part is all set up
properly and if you didn't watch part 1
of this tutorial you should definitely
do that and you should also watch how to
lay out a website and in that tutorial
we created this guy right here it's
actually pretty easy to make wordpress
themes you just have to understand a
couple core concepts on this part of the
tutorial i want to make both of the
sidebars and if you look here you can
see that there's only one sidebar widget
i'm going to correct that right now so
i'm going to go into functions dot PHP
inside of the theme and there's a link
to all of this code underneath this
video and you can see right here if
function exists register sidebar this is
the guy that we're going to be making
two copies of because we have both a
left sidebar as you can see here this is
the left sidebar and this is the right
sidebar and I should take a second here
and explain some things the left sidebar
is going to be able to be changed but
for the most part it is set in stone
however on the right sidebar I'm setting
it up specifically to allow the person
to put in any widgets that they want so
you're going to see both a very hard and
stuck sort of sidebar as well as an
extremely dynamic sidebar in both of
these situations one to show you how all
of its done so basically what i'm going
to do is I'm going to use this code
that's already provided in here to make
both of my side bars and what I'm going
to do here first is I'm going to create
a name this is going to be the left
widgets and i'm going to call this left
sidebar widgets these are widgets for
the sidebar is perfectly okay however
what we're going to want to do here is
to find everything that's going to go
around all the widgets inside of here
now what I decided to do is to use the
right sidebar content always remember I
said the left sidebar is going to be
stuck and it's always going to be the
same so what I want to do is scroll the
whole way down here until I get to the
right sidebar information and you can
see right here this is where the right
sidebar begins what I want to do here is
define what I want to go before the
widget is put in twice
so what I want to do is I want to put in
div class right container because that
is going to surround everything it's
going to allow me to use all the styling
from whenever I created it in the
previous tutorial so I'm going to paste
that guy inside of this area and then
I'm just simply going to close that div
whenever the widget is playing put in
place then what I want to do is look
over here and see exactly what I'm using
using banner title so I want to define
what code or what elements are going to
surround my titles for all of my widget
items well I want the title for the
widget to be contained in banner title
and this is banner title so i can use
this cool styling to make this guy set
itself apart from all the rest what i'm
going to do is I'm just going to select
this up through the h4 tag and paste it
inside of there alright so that's simple
and then what I'm going to do is close
off each for tank and close off the div
and that's all I need to do to make a
customized left sidebar widget and I
said I wanted two of them right well I'm
just going to copy this and paste it
inside of there and really the only
thing is going to change here as i'm
going to call this right widgets and i'm
going to change this from left to right
and everything else is going to stay the
same so i can file save the
functions.php file and if we jump into
the widget section and reload this
you're going to see that now to widgets
show up instead of one this is for the
left one this is for the right one ok so
that's cool well now I after Lee
actually create all of these sidebar
items so how am I going to do that I'm
going to click on here and I'm going to
go to file open and I'm going to look
for sidebar PHP I'm going to open that
inside of here and then what I'm going
to do is I'm going to file save as and
I'm going to call this sidebar dash
first and hit save and then I'm gonna go
file open and I'm just going to open up
sidebar again and I'm going to call this
one file save as sidebar dash second and
then save that so the first one's going
to be the left sidebar and sidebar dash
seconds going to be the right sidebar so
I have these guys opened up and I'm
going to jump in and just start changing
everything here just so you knew this is
the left sidebar so I'm going to be
copying and pasting a lot of code from
our original tutorial and into this guy
to make it all work ok so this R up here
where it says if function exists dynamic
sidebar this is
already in this blank theme that I'm
used to create my own custom theme what
it's going to allow them to do is place
widgets in there without messing
everything else up I'm going to come in
after where it says all this stuff here
only shows up if you don't have any
widgets active in this zone I'm going to
coffee all this or I'm going to select
at all and i'm going to lead it and then
i'm going to start putting in my real
code all right so this is where i define
the left sidebar so i'm going to be
doing a lot of cut and paste in here
first thing what i'm going to do is
where it says ID sidebar i'm going to
change this to first sidebar and then
i'm going to look over here what exactly
we got well i got div class left
container so i want to copy that and
paste that inside of there then what do
we have well we have banner title so
let's select that copy it paste that
inside of there and I'm going to leave
everything exactly the same in this
situation and then we have our paragraph
here remember this is not going to be
dynamic I'm just going to copy I could
have just copied us all at one time
paste that inside of there now I'm going
to do a couple things here I want to
pull in an image of the person that's
represented with this blog so i have to
actually tell wordpress exactly where
this image is located so just put a
little PHP code and then go blog info
I'm just pointing it to the directory
for my theme underscore directory and if
you can't see this just click full
screen this is an HD video and then
closed off f PHP code block and that's
going to take me to the theme directory
and look for the paying file named Cindy
inside of the images folder I'm going to
leave everything else here the same
whatever right after this I'm going to
put a link a each reference is equal to
and in this situation this is just going
to be a solid link social voice
marketing contact us and i'm going to
call this class is equal to click for
more close that off and say contact me
all right so simple enough they can
click on that and be able to contact the
person you can also see here is the end
of the left container well then i have
my featured items say i'm using
everything here from the left side let's
just copy that and this is where i'm
going to be pulling in for videos and
for articles and slapping them in there
this is going to be dynamic just paste
div class featured and let's just go in
here and close at all and
featured div just so it's easier to see
the beginnings and the ends of this guy
give myself some space all right so I'm
going to want to put videos inside of
here just like we have on this guy
videos and then articles for my banner
titles and it's always going to be that
way so I'm just going to select this tab
paste that inside of that okay so that's
going to show up real nice and easy now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to do
a custom quarry and to save myself a ton
of time I'm gonna jump over into this
guy and I'm going to select it this is
from the last tutorial so coffee this is
where I am taking over WP query inside
of wordpress alright so pasted that
inside of there jump back over into
index and this is all the part that
pertains to the other guy so the copies
of getting and the ends of it alright so
this is where we create our temporary
holding cell for WP query this is where
we nullify the values of WP query we
create a new WP query object all this
stuff I explained in the last tutorial
this time what I'm going to do is say
post per page I still want for because
that's what we had before however I want
to offset meaning i want to skip the
first four because i am showing those in
the middle bar say these are the first
four videos or the last four videos that
were created and then these are the next
four so that's why i have offset now i'm
skipping the first four and then here in
category name i'm going to change this
to video alright so it's going to pull
in anything in the category video it's
going to pull four of those in and
there's going to be an offset or it's
going to skip the first four okay so
that's cool and down here in my while
loop meaning as it's cycling through all
the posts there's going to be
information I want to shoot out to the
screen what information do I want to
shoot to the screen well I want to shoot
stuff like this stuff right here copy
this paste that inside of there now we
just have to make this guy more dynamic
straighten out the spacing on this a
little bit so we have article title well
there it's not always going to be
facebook marketing obviously so I'm
going to come in here and make this
dynamic and on top of that i'm going to
make the article title clickable so that
when a person clicks on it they get sent
to the main article so just create a
link inside of this guy that and we're
going to be calling PHP and if I want to
get the link to the actual article
inside of wordpress I just call a
function called the permalink like that
close off my PHP section it's
automatically insert that inside of
there and don't
get the clothes off the a tag and then I
want to put the actual title for the
article so I just create another PHP tag
and here i'm going to call it ntt the
title is equal to and i'm going to say i
want to call the post and i want to get
the post title and return it to myself
store it in TT title and then I'm going
to echo out to screen substring I'm
gonna call the substring function inside
of PHP and what I'm going to do here is
take the value of n TT title copy paste
it inside of there and I'm going to
shorten it to 30 characters so that the
titles if they are a really really long
and will fit into my design won't break
the whole entire design they'll just be
shortened okay so that's going to pull
in the title and also attached a link to
it then we have our article excerpt
we're going to do again in here select
all this and we're going to call PHP and
then I go ntt the excerpt i'm going to
call post dash and a little bracket and
post excerpt close that on and then i'm
going to go echo and i guess i'm going
to do I call the substring function
again I'm a shorten the excerpt so that
I make sure it sticks in this situation
of course I'm going to use this guy that
I just created right here paste that in
there and I want from the 02 the 60th
character goes off to that close off the
PHP section now what I got to do is is
also provide them with another option to
click for more information so inside of
here which I even worry about that let's
just copy this because that's what this
guy returns it returns the actual
address for the article so if they click
on it it's got to go in there it's gonna
be beautiful and then I can leave
everything else here exactly the same
and I can leave for is on a roll exactly
the same then we come down to the end
Wow which is going to end after four
articles are pulled in that are all in
that video category as we defined right
upside here and then this guy right here
is going to end the featured div which
is going to surround all of that
information so this is the feature div
here's all the articles that are pulled
dynamically all right so guess what i'm
going to do after that I mean essence
going to copy everything I'm going to
select this go to the whole way back up
into where we define featured because I
have all this laid out nicely it was
really easy to do so I'm just going to
copy it if you want to put a call men
inside of here
and featured div here I don't know
whatever you want to call it I mean we
can scroll up here and see what we got
well here this is going to be called
articles instead of videos because I'm
going to be pulling those in don't have
to change anything here i'm going to
change this to article i wasn't very
hard in nothing else here needs to
change we can come down here to end if
and if we want to put in one more
comment here so everybody knows what did
this is going to be closing off just
scroll back up here first sidebar end of
first sidebar do one thing I slipped up
here after ntt or before this I could of
course put a dollar sign in there to
denote that that's a variable inside of
PHP in there put that inside of there
then if we file save this and reload it
you're going to see that everything is
automatically being updated inside of
here so that's real nice one thing we
have to correct in the next tutorial
whenever I get into the styling of this
guy is to make these underlines go away
and all these other different things but
aside from that side bar is in there
okay so now we're gonna make the right
sidebar which looks like this and this
is going to be extremely simple because
we're not going to be forcing a lot of
things remember we want this to be
highly editable okay so we have to
actually scroll down here and see what
we got in the right sidebar in the
original website that we created here
you see right here beginning of right
sidebar so I'm going to jump over in
sidebar dash second dot PHP and in this
situation I decided that I want these
social icons to always be here no matter
what so what I'm going to do if you want
to make sure stuff like that sticks well
I usually come over here and I'm going
to select this guy right here this whole
entire div with all those icons in place
and before the dynamic sidebar call that
we have right here if you want something
to always show up even if widgets are
put in place you just put that ahead of
that guy so that's real simple and then
if we want these to be clickable so that
they actually takes someone to the
social network sites millio aah
reference HTTP and I'm just going to
type in the RSS feed and then I want to
actually point at the location for all
these images so I'm going to save myself
some time jump back over into this guy
and I'm going to copy this piece of code
right here it does just that it accesses
my theme directory and I'm going
replace all these dots with that bit of
code and then even though I originally
had this that 40 pixels i'm going to
take down the 30 because decided that we
wanted to put a link to youtube inside
of this so that changes my dimensions so
paste that side of that i pasted that
their pace that there and then in this
situation we're just going to put exact
locations for facebook so i'm gonna type
in a facebook down here going to put a
link to twitter i think like that and
then i'm going to put a link in here to
linkedin and these would be over
whatever you'd want them to be then of
course we want to close off all of these
a tags let's surround these images face
paced and remember i said i also have a
link to youtube that i want to put
inside there so copy that paste that
there and then we're going to say
youtube we're going to change this to
youtube logo and don't forget to make
these 30 by 30 pixels I like that okay
so we don't need any of this other stuff
here actually might get rid of this well
I'll leave it in there so let's select
all this guy down here to that lead it
out and then up here change this to
second sidebar that's file save it see
what happened and you can see here is
the second side bar it's down here in
the lower left-hand corner but in the
next part of the tutorial I'm going to
straighten out all of the mess ups in
regards to the CSS that you see here on
the screen and next time at least the
blog page is going to look identical to
this because I'm going to correct all
the CSS mistakes that are in there leave
any questions or comments below
otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
