two of my TV video tutorial in this part
of the tutorial I'm going to show you
five different TV layouts I'm also going
to create custom widgets and how to set
default widget attributes if you missed
part 1 of this tutorial series in which
I showed you how to install everything
there is a link to that in the
description along with all the code from
this video and everything in this video
is going to work exactly the same on
Windows as well as on Macintosh and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
alright so here I am inside a pie charm
and we're going to import TV require
this version of keavy and also get our
TV app methods and fields and everything
else and I'm going to create a custom
widget here first off and do that so I'm
going to have to go and get the widget
object and don't worry about these
errors they will everything is going to
work here so just ignore them and I'm
going to create a custom widget and I'm
just going to call it custom widget and
pass in the widget and then pass is
going to be used as a placeholder here
for that class and then I'm going to
actually create the app part that we are
then going to tie in to our TV file and
I'm going to call for this to be built
and pass self inside of here and close
that off whoops there we are and then we
just go just like we did previously and
just go custom widget and then we're
going to define that and I'm going to
keep everything roughly the same for all
these different layouts and everything
that I show you here just so that it's
nice and easy to use and we need a
custom widget app and then we are going
to call for this guy to run and execute
on our screen all right so that is all
we're going to need to do now we're
going to jump over into our Kiwi file
and just so you can see here I've keavy
tut py and custom widget kV and now I'm
going to jump over into the kV file or
key V file all right so what we're going
to do here is I'm going to show you how
to set default attributes that are going
to be shared by all of our widgets and
to do that I'm going to call
this guy custom button and at button
that's what we're going to be modeling
everything after and so this only to be
our own custom button here and with this
guy you're going to be able to define a
whole bunch of different things so one
of the things is going to be your font
size so I'll make that 32 you're going
to define the color this is going to be
the text color and the numbers you put
inside here are going to be a percentage
of 255 that's the way our that's the way
our GB colors work is it's 0 to 255 so
if it's 0 0 0 that means black and then
you're going to have alpha here at the
end so these guys are going to be
percentages so it's going to be 0 to 1
and then 1 would be 255 so hopefully
that makes sense and let's go in and
mark the size for our button so it's
going to be a 150 pixels wide and 50
pixels deeper and height and here also
I'm going to show you another thing we
can have our backgrounds be well this is
background normal and what background
normal means is this is going to be the
state of the button when it's not being
pressed and then we're also let's put
that make sure you put those quotes in
there and nothing inside of it and
basically by doing that that means that
you want the background color for your
button to be white and then we're going
to color that also I'm also going to
define background whenever the button is
in the down position and here you can
actually throw a ping file inside of
here and what I did was I just got a
gray button here I'll show it to you
this guy right here background down
color so it's just a gray color that's
all it is and I'm going to use that as
the background whenever the button is in
the down position we're just going to
paste that inside of there
just make sure I get that name right and
then on top of that what you're going to
be able to do is set the background
color for both the well it's going to be
just for this background normal port
right here and like I said it's going to
be a percentage of 255 so here I'm just
going to put 88 and then I'll have my
alpha be 1 which means that it's not
going to be opaque at all and then I'm
on my custom widget area and then inside
of here we're going to use our custom
buttons so previously we would put
button inside of here and then define
the button now we're going to use our
custom button with all of these
attributes that we have set up inside of
here so I'm going to come in and define
text like we did previously and I'm just
going to say something like random and
then I'm going to position this guy I'm
going to position in a couple different
ways here we are going to be positioning
with exact positioning that means in the
X&amp;amp;Y position now with key V the 0 0 for
x and y on the x and y access is
actually going to be in the lower left
hand corner most programs it's in the
upper left hand corner I don't know why
but they put it in the bottom left hand
corner and what I'm going to do here is
if I want it to be on the farthest left
position I can say something like root X
and then put 200 inside of there and
that is going to put it the farthest
left it can possibly put it and then 200
up from the bottom of the screen so up
like that alright and what else can we
put inside of there I think that's
enough so let's go and create two more
custom buttons just to show you exactly
how these are going to work for us taste
that inside of there and there we go and
let's just come in for this custom
button and just call it buttons I don't
know you're also going to be able to go
and use routes Y so let's put this 200
from the left side of the screen and
then have this be route Y and then the
more common this is going to be absolute
positioning this is another layout
actually I said there's going to be five
layout options in this tutorial there's
actually going to be six so I just
figured that out so let's just leave
that be random because it really doesn't
matter so this is going to be exact
positioning so this is going to say 200
from the left side of the screen and 400
pixels up from the bottom of the screen
okay so we're going to save that and
then inside of the terminal if you're on
Mac you're going to call for this to
execute and what I do made a little
an error let's fix that okay so I change
this to cost button and cost button and
cost button and cost button and I
indented everything properly and let's
save it and let's call this God run over
here and there you can see how we went
and positioned all those different
buttons inside of our window and that is
how we would use exact positioning
inside of QB so now I'm going to jump
over and show you a floating layout so
we're going to come in here and we're
just going to change a couple little
things I'm just going to change this to
float layout and import float layout
we're going to get rid of this this time
and just use one class just to keep it
nice and simple I'm going to call this
floating app this is going to return a
float layout and let's call this float
layout app and floating app and then
we'll change this to FL app like that
and everything else we're going to do
layout wise is going to be based off of
this idea so let's come back over inside
of here and we get rid of all this stuff
here as well
and if floating layout is going to
position and size objects as a
percentage of our window size so what
we're going to do is we're going to well
you know what let's keep our custom
button that we created inside of here
just so we can keep that all exactly the
same and to this I'm going to add size
hint and size hint is going to define
the widget width again from 0 to 1 and
that's going to represent a percentage
of 100% of the height of the window so
I'm going to say that I want this to be
40% and I want it to be 30% so this is
going to be 40 percent of the total
width of the available window and it's
going to be 30% of the total height for
a window now we're going to come down
here and inside of float layout and that
float layout part is going to come from
this guy so this guy right here and
we'll jump back over here and then we'll
create a custom button and we'll do
something like I'll show you how to put
different buttons in the different
corners as well as in the center of our
screen so I'm going to call this top
left
then I'm going to call positioning here
so instead of position this is going to
be position hint am position hint is
going to represent the position using
either XY left right top bottom center
Center act or Center X or Center Y and
I'm going to demonstrate every single
one of those so if I want to have this
be in the top left corner I'm going to
say that X is going to be 0 and then I'm
going to put top is going to be equal to
1 and then close off that curly bracket
we have right there and let's just copy
this because we're going to do the same
thing for all of the different buttons
we're going to be put in here on our
screen create some more here I'm going
to create five of these guys so I can
show you how to put in all of the
corners as well as the center of the
screen so if we want something in the
bottom left just call this bottom left
what we're going to do is we're going to
use right here and you can use x and y
right and all these other different
things I'm just trying to show you all
the different options that are available
and we can use Y here as well and we'll
change that to zero in that situation
because we want that at the bottom of
the screen remember everything in key v
is based off of the lower left-hand
corner then with this guy we're going to
have him be in the top right-hand corner
and I'm going to change right here to
one and top is also going to be equal to
one create another button and this guy
right here is going to be in the bottom
left-hand corner of our screen and we'll
set let's go and use left here this time
and we'll change this to one and then
we'll put bottom inside of here and
we'll change that to zero and it's very
common in TV to mix and match a whole
bunch of different layouts and let's say
that we want this guy to be in the
center of the screen we're going to say
center X and let's put that at 50%
that's how we can put it in the center
and then this is going to be Center Y
and we'll put that
50% and we'll save it and we'll come
over here once again and clear that and
you can see right here what I'm doing is
just key V key B type P Y and we'll
execute it and there you can see that we
were able to position all those
different guys using the float layout so
now I'm going to jump over and show you
the grid layout okay so what are we
going to have to change here we're going
to have to change this to grid
so there's grid layout and then the next
part of the tutorial I'm going to create
some apps using all these different
things I just needed to get this out of
the way before I could do that so with
this guy I'm going to call this grid
layout app and this is going to return a
grid layout of course and we'll call
this grid layout app and this grid
layout app and this guy right here is
going to be grid layout app as well so
we'll save that and then jump into our
keavy file once again let's go and get
rid of all this stuff source sort of
cluttering things up here a little bit
too much now of course we are going to
be creating a grid layout so let's go
grid layout and then inside of here what
we're going to do is a grid is going to
basically put different widgets in a
table format that's going to have rows
and columns inside of it so let's go
columns and say that we want two of
those let's say rows and say we want two
of those spacing is going to be the
spacing between the widgets padding is
going to be spacing between the widgets
and the outside window let's have that
be ten as well and then we're going to
come in and create a button and for this
guy
let's have text whoops is going to be
first and then we're going to define
size hint X and let's set that for none
and then we're going to pass in the
width of this button which is going to
be 200 and then we're going to create a
couple more of these different guys and
put them into our grid it's just going
to be a simple grid with four buttons
inside of it and you're not going to be
able with this grid layout to be able to
have widgets
multiple different spaces I'm going to
talk about the box layout later on that
might work better in that situation
you're going to have to decide though as
the designer so we'll just have that
these seconds and then this will be
third and we'll keep that the same and
change this to fourth and get rid of
this all together and save it and run it
and there you can say that we were able
to come in here and you find the width
for these different guys and you can see
right here how we said here we want the
first button to be 200 and width and
then automatically the second button
that goes inside of there is going to
take up the other 80% or whatever the
other available space that's available
inside of there and we did that also for
the third and the fourth and we can play
around with that use percentages to
divide that up and that is how we use a
grid layout that's pretty much the
basics of the grid layout of course
we're going to be getting more into it
later on whenever we create more of
these guys but now I want to jump over
and show you a box layout all right so
what are we going to do we're going to
call this box layout instead of grid
layouts and box layout and basically
with a box layout we're going to arrange
widgets in a horizontal or a vertical
box so everything is basically going to
be the same just going to change that to
that let's call this PL app and call
this Bo app and we'll call this one box
layout out just to keep it nice and
simple and that's all we're going to do
there save it jump over here and then
we're going to change this to box layout
and of course there's going to be some
things that are different now remember I
said that a box layout is going to rain
arrange widgets in a horizontal or
vertical box so what we're going to do
is we're going to have to define the
orientation that we want to use and I am
going to use a vertical and I leave it
to you to use check out horizontal and
see how that works for once again
spacing is going to be the different
distance between the widgets padding is
going to be the distance between the
widgets and the outer window and then
we're just going to create some of these
guys
so I'll have this just be button one
first that's perfectly fine here we're
going to define size hint ensign is hint
is going to define the percentage of
space taken on the x-axis and the
percentage of space left over by our
other widgets that we have on our screen
so I'm going to have this be seven
seventy percent and then the next one
I'm going to have it be 0.5 of course
you're going to have to play around with
that to figure out what works best for
your specific design here I'm just going
to leave this be second and then for
this last one I'm just going to leave
this be third and we can go in here and
save it and run it and got a little bit
of a bug let's bounce over here up
forgot to change this to box layout you
should have told me about that and we'll
save that and run it and there you can
see exactly how that works out let's
open up the TV file here though and
check it out and there you can see here
that I said that I want this take up 70%
of the available space and then 50% of
the space that would be allocated if we
were equally dividing between these
three widgets and you can see exactly
how that works and there is the basics
of the box layout and now what I'm going
to do is jump over and show you the
stack layout alright stack layout guess
what we have to do we have to change
this to stack and we have to change this
to stack and we'll call this stack
layout app and we'll call this stack
layout and basically a stack layout is
going to arrange widgets vertically or
horizontally as they best fit onto our
screen and we'll call this SL app and
we'll call this stack layout app of
course and stack layout app and we'll
save that jump over into our key V file
of course we're going to change this to
a stack layout orientation in this
situation is going to be a whole bunch
of different things what I'm going to
say is I want the orientation to be left
to right whenever it's laying out the
widgets and then top to bottom it's also
going to be possible for you to say top
to bottom left to right right the left
top to bottom top to bottom right to
left left the
bottom of the top and so forth and so on
if you want to see all the different
options I have one like I said in the
description underneath the video you can
take a look at all those let's just
leave spacing and padding be equal to
ten in this situation and then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create
ever-increasing sizes of buttons and
show how they are going to lay
themselves out on the screen you already
know it's going to start off left or
right and it's going to go top to bottom
all right play with these and you'll see
how they all work out for each other
pretty cool stuff all right so we're
going to just put Q inside of here
size hint like I said before we're going
to put none inside of there and then
we're going to put 0.15 so it's going to
take up 15% of the available space and
then like I said I'm going to increase
the size of our buttons as I put more on
the screen so that you can see how they
all basically effect each other with
their ever increasing changes so we're
going to change this to W leave this be
exactly the same and we'll take this up
to 120 paste that in there we'll change
this to e we'll change this to 140 let's
copy this again paste that in there and
we'll change this to our take this up to
160 change this to T we'll take this up
to 180 and Y and we'll take this up to
200 all right so that's all we did
changes there and run it and there you
can see how they were stretching out on
the screen and you can also see as the
window is resized that it's
automatically going to fill the
available space and then move everything
left to right top the bottom until
everything is on the screen okay so it's
a nice take on how to use the stack
layout and now I'm going to show you
something pretty cool which is called
the page layout now our page layout is
used to create multi page layouts that
you're actually going to be able to flip
through back and forth between all the
different options and of course this is
going to be page layouts and
age layups and then we're going to
change this the page layout as well and
we're going to return a page layout
obviously page layout page layout and
this is going to be page layout app and
then we'll be doing the heavy lifting
over here inside of our key V file and
this is going to be page layout and I'll
just keep this extremely simple I'm just
going to throw a whole bunch of buttons
inside of here so let's go oh that guy
right there and then of course of course
we can use things other than buttons I'm
sure that makes sense
let's get rid of that and then we'll
just keep it nice and simple we'll just
call this page one and get rid of all
this extraneous things here and this is
going to be a page 2 and this will be
page 3 and there we are
if we save it and run it you're going to
say there is our page layout and what
it's going to allow us to do is just
click on this guy here and drag it back
and forth and look at all of the
different things that are stored inside
of that layout tool ok so pretty cool
guys and in the next part of the
tutorial we're going to start making
some real world apps and like always
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
