eight of my wordpress news themed
tutorial while we've come a long way
from this original HTML CSS a little
template that we created to what we have
right here which is the finished blog
part of our theme only problem is
whenever you click on a page like that
you get this mess so in this part of the
tutorial I am going to fix all the other
individual pages it sounds like a lot of
work but it's not gonna be okay over
into our code first thing I'm gonna do
is I'm going to open up my archive dot
PHP page my index dot PHP page because I
may be pulling a lot of information from
there my search dot PHP page and my
single dot PHP page we are going to edit
all those files so I decided that I
wanted to have the featured content tool
on every one of these pages cuz I just
thought it looked nice I want this on
every single one of those pages knowing
that I have a bunch of code that I need
to copy and put on each of those pages
so I'm just gonna jump into index dot
PHP and I'm gonna start right there and
I'm gonna scroll down until I get to
main content and all this codes
available on the link underneath of this
video so you can get it so I'm an
indexed our PHP and I just copied that
now I'm gonna jump into single dot PHP
and right after get header I'm gonna
paste that inside of there then I'm
gonna jump over into search dot PHP and
again right after get header I'm gonna
paste that inside of there gonna open up
page dot PHP again right after header
and paste that inside of there and then
I'm gonna jump into archive dot PHP go
right after get header paste that inside
of there and while I'm inside of this
guy I'm gonna scroll way down here to
the bottom and just get rid of get
sidebar because I'm gonna be bringing in
my own sidebar for all this information
and again I'm gonna do the same thing
for page.php
jump in here get rid of get side or cuz
remember I have my own moon sidebar jump
into search dot PHP get sidebar at the
very bottom the page need to get rid of
it also and then single dot PHP it's not
bar get rid of that make sure you keep
getting footer though now that I'm in
single dot PHP I have to make a couple
other different changes here so I'm just
gonna scroll here and then right here
where the beginning of the loop starts
I'm gonna come after there and I'm gonna
put a div inside
up here and it's gonna be class type
equal to article content and just leave
that exactly like that then I'm gonna
come down here where it says template
path meta and all that I decided I don't
want that so that's gone and on top of
that I have to come in here where the
titles going to be displayed and change
it to what I've used in the past so I'm
gonna go class as equal to or cool oh
you don't and close that off and then
I'm gonna be copying and pasting this a
bunch of times later on throughout this
tutorial and to really simplify this I'm
just gonna get rid of that and again
this is an h3 tag so we want to close
off that tag and what I'm gonna do is
create a link reference is gonna be
equal to PHP the permalink which if you
can't remember that is going to get me
the link to the original article easy
enough closed off that tag open up the
PHP again and then I'm gonna set once
the title close that off and jump up in
here close that off then I'm gonna close
off my PHP close off my link the closing
link tag got h3 inside of there and then
I'm gonna put a break statement inside
of here alright so that's gonna Prem out
both the title as well as the link to
the actual content so I'm gonna copy
that cuz that's gonna get pasted and all
the other files so jump over into search
dot PHP and I want to get rid of this
right here that's gonna bring in
navigation for search what its gonna do
is it would output older posts newer
posts at the very top of screen I find
that to be kind of irritating so I got
rid of that I'm gonna replace the title
with my code and then of course I don't
want to forget put my div that's gonna
wrap everything up here so I'm gonna put
in div ID is equal to post lists then
I'm gonna jump into page dot PHP again
look for where this code right here the
beginning of the loop begins right after
that guy I'm gonna come in here and type
in div ID is equal to post lists and
then down here where the title is that's
not gonna work I got a copy and paste in
what I need there and then jump over
into archive we're gonna do pretty much
the same thing here we're gonna look at
down here for the beginning of the loop
I'm gonna come in here my div for my
post list again just to get my styling
right and right after it says post class
right here I'm gonna come
get rid of that title and all that
information and paste in my article
title that I had before now let's jump
back and continue doing it alright so
now I'm back into single dot PHP and I'm
gonna come down here to where it says
entry and I'm gonna take this out
because I have to put my own custom code
now create a paragraph class is equal to
and I'm just input in post excerpt
because this is previously what I used
before I could be copying and pasting
all this from the index dot PHP page
kind of thought that was a little bit
irritating then what you're gonna want
to do put in PHP the content get you the
content for that huh close off the PHP
code and then close the paragraph tag
and I'm actually going to copy all this
code this is gonna be real easy
now I'm gonna jump into search dot PHP
and I'm gonna look for entry and then
right here where entry is entry goink
got that inside of there straighten that
up a little bit jump into page dot PHP
again look for the entry part I'm in
here where it has content and replace it
with your own code and then we're gonna
jump over into archive again look for
entry there it is paste it in now you
got your own stuff again then just to
finish off archive here all together
because it's almost done right after
these two divs here we need to close off
post lists so I'm gonna come in here and
put div put that inside of there and
then you might want to put yourself a
little comment that says ends
post lists just so you know in the
future if you ever see it like what div
specifically is being closed there and
then after and while you're gonna do
pretty much the same thing I'm in here
put div and then again put a little
comment maybe ends main content all
right now archive is completely done so
let's file save archive and there we got
done what's archive we don't need that
anymore now we're gonna fix up
everything else here individually
actually before we leave I'm gonna grab
this template path Metta blah blah blah
thing here copy that and then jump over
into single dot PHP right here where it
has tags and then div and then nothing
I'm gonna put this inside of here just
gonna put some metadata inside of there
then after the comments template I'm
gonna close off the div this is actually
gonna be for post list I'm not gonna put
it in this time the call
that is and then right after the end
while we have to close the main content
and there you go single dot PHP is
finished so let's file save that jump
into surged dot PHP here again after
these two closing divs I got a close off
post lists the day of there and then
guess what right after the end Wow
I'm gonna close off main content div
file save it now search is fixed jump
into page doc PHP and this time we're
gonna close both of those divs off right
after the end while and if part put in
div that's gonna close off post lists
and then put in another div that's my
photos off main content and if we file
save that and reopen our website and
here we are on the blog page but but if
we would click over and say we want to
look at an individual post you can see
now that that's all nice and neat and as
well if we would look at the search bar
they've been invest for example you can
see the end of the search results are
coming out really nice of course we just
click on this sample page which doesn't
really have anything on it you can see
that everything lines up nicely there
I'm gonna continue to add some plugins
here based off of the requests I've
received from you guys if there are any
other additional requests leave them in
the comment section below otherwise
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
