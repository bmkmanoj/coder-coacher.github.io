10 of my C video tutorial today I'm
going to continue covering struct linked
lists and in this part of the tutorial
I'm going to answer the homework
questions from part 9 of this tutorial
series if you didn't watch it I provide
a link in the upper right hand corner
basically I told you to program out
functions that are going to allow you to
search through the products delete
certain products and also remove those
products from memory when they are
deleted like I said before in this part
of the tutorial I'm going to show you
exactly how to do all that now basically
all the answers that you need are right
here on this screen if we're going to be
searching for specific products all we
need to do is bounce through the linked
list just like we did previously and all
we're going to do along the way is check
to see if the product name entered
matches if it does then we'll print some
information out on the screen if it
doesn't then jump to the next one using
the next pointer until you get to the
end of the list if you get the end of
the list then say couldn't find it
pretty simple to delete products are
pretty much going to do exactly the same
thing we're going to search through the
list if we find a match we're going to
delete so let's say we're trying to get
rid of potato we'll get rid of potato
we'll change the value for next to
instead point to lemon and let
everything else be exactly the same so
that is precisely what we're gonna do in
this tutorial so let's get into it okay
so here's the code from the last part of
our tutorial and I'm just gonna continue
writing outside code so I'm gonna come
right down here and the guy that I'm
going to create first is going to be
search for product and it's going to
return a struct because I'm then going
to also use search for product to find
and delete said products so it's going
to receive a named product name and I'm
just going to open this up the whole way
so you can see it then I need to create
another struck that's gonna hold the
current struck that we're cycling
through as we're going through and
looking for whatever we're looking for B
product I'm just going to call it
iterate or even though it's not really
that the name sort of works and we're
going to start at our first node and if
you're at all confused it's cause you
didn't watch part 9 so go watch that
then all we need to do is cycle through
the Struck's in the list until next
the value of null that's it so we're
just going to take this guy right here
until for as long as it's not equal to
null we're going to cycle then what I'm
going to do is create an int so I'm
going to call it are they equal and then
I'm going to compare the first 30
characters of the two different product
names that I have available using STR
and compare and I'm just going to take
the iterator guy that I have right here
and point to the product name and then
the product name that was passed into
this function and then I'm going to say
I want to check the first 30 characters
and that's all coming from this guy up
here see product name 30 characters so
that's where that's coming from come
back down inside of here then we're
gonna say well just in case you don't
know this string compare function what
it's going to do is if the strings are
equal to each other it's going to return
a value of zero otherwise it's not going
to return a value of zero so what I'm
going to say is I'm going to put a knot
in front of that it's going to turn the
zero into a one and in this situation we
know that we have two strings that are
equal to each other so I'm going to say
something like printf was found and it
costs and then just throw in here a
float and print out the cost for it and
then we can just go and get that product
iterator again throw it inside of here
and we'll print out our product name and
we'll also print out our price and
that's how easy that is there we go done
and then if I get to this point I know
that I can return the match I actually
found a match and I'm going to return it
which is what was going on up here
okay now outside of this if statement we
have a situation which we did not find a
match so what are we going to do we're
just going to take the product iterator
and change its value or change its
reference to the next pointer in our
list and then we know if we get the
whole way through the whole entire list
well that means we didn't get a match so
we're going to come in here and we'll
say wasn't found like that and we'll
put product name because that's what was
passed in and then in this situation we
still have to return something so we'll
just say return null then we can check
to see if there was a match based off of
the fact if this returned all or not and
that's it it's all we need to do so
except for use the function so we can go
search for product come down here inside
of main doesn't really matter where and
then inside of here I'm going to say
tomato of course you could create a menu
system very very easy with this bouncing
here compile execute enter product name
well I'm going to say tomato first off
and I'm gonna say dollar fifty and then
I'll say egg fifty I don't know
and then I'll say pickle and whatever
products enter tomato cost or fifty blah
blah blah blah blah tomato was found in
the system and it costs dollar fifty so
that's how easy it is to search and find
products now let's go and show you how
to remove products so I'm going to come
up here again because I'm actually going
to be using search for product to find
the product and then delete it this guy
isn't going to return anything I decided
so I'm just gonna go void and we're
going to say remove product and we're
also going to just accept a string that
we're going to need to call product name
and again I'm going to create a
temporary holding cell call this product
of type product and I'm going to call
this product to delete give it a null
value like always and then I'm going to
use my other function here we go P
product to delete is equal to search for
product and I'm going to pass it the
product name pretty nice well then what
happens if we do not find it well we
return null so what are we gonna do
we're gonna say if P product to delete
is not equal to null that means we found
it now we can do some stuff in here we
know we found it so we know we'll be
able to delete it so let's just get this
out of the way and we know that if we
want to delete the first product we must
assign the next product in the list to
the first node so we're going to go P
product to delete and check if it is
equal to the first node and if so we're
going to make the first node equal to P
product to delete next else we're going
to need to get the product to delete and
assign its neck
to the product before the product that
is deleted well how are we going to get
the product that exists in the linked
list prior to the product that we want
to ultimately delete well in this
situation just to make it simple I'm
actually going to create that product as
a global and I'm actually going to put
it before search for product and I'm
just going to go right here struct
product and we call this P product
before product to delete okay little
long-winded but whatever of course you
would heavenly want to comment this
because it's a little odd okay so this
guy is ultimately going to store the
product that comes before the product
that is found by search for product so
that means we're going to need to have
to assign this a value inside of search
for product where would be a good place
to do that well down here around this
area would be a good place to do that
and the reason why as we know we're
going to have a match here and we want
to keep this out of this area so we're
just going to assign this value outside
of it because we know at this point in
time this guy is going to be assigned
the previous product pointer reference
every single time so what we're going to
do is we're going to say P product like
this that's going to get the previous
and then it's going to be changed
immediately out of there after and then
whenever this gets its return meaning
there was a match then this guy right
here is going to have the pointer that
was previous to the match hopefully that
makes sense it doesn't leave a comment
below and now that we have that set up
we can come back down inside of remove
product throw this guy inside of there
get its next and P product two deletes
next is going to be stored inside of
that okay you don't understand what was
going on let's say we're getting rid of
potato just like before so what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to say I
want the tomato reference that is what
was stored inside of product before
product to delete because it's before
potato so this is the product before
product to delete what we're saying is
we want to get then
next value for potato and we want to
store it in product before product to
delete so this is going in there that is
all that is going on with that bit of
code so feel that clears that up and
then after that if we want to free up
memory well right here we go and we know
that product to delete is the guy that
went on free up so we just throw that
inside of free and then we get to this
situation which is that we didn't find
the product to delete it we say was not
found and just throw in product name
because that's the only way we're going
to find it
file save that and then we can say
remove product this is going to output
it we don't need search for product in
this situation instead we're going to
say get rid of tomato remove product and
I had one little bug here right here
remove product I put two seasons out of
there sorry about that file safe open up
the terminal compile execute tomato egg
fish products enter tomato cost blah
blah blah blah blah tomato was found
cost dollar 50 tomato was deleted whoops
I should have gone in here reowww put
the data just to prove that it's going
made a dollar 50 big fish and there you
can see egg cost dollar 50 fish cost $11
and tomato is delete it's not in the
list so there you go that is how to
cycle through and search through a
struct linked list find that information
delete it you already know how to enter
it you already know how to create the
linked list so that pretty much covers
pretty much anything you'd want to do
with a struct linked list hope that was
fun with the homework you guys always
ask for please leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
