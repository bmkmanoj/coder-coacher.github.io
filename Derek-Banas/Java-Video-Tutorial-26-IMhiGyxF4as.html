of my java video tutorial series today
I'm going to cover one of the last
components I'm going to cover in this
tutorial series and it is called a
spinner I'm actually going to show you
four different types of spinners so
you'll have a complete grasp on exactly
how they work and be able to do pretty
much anything you can imagine and as
well I'm also going to show you how to
do a bunch of things with dates and
whole bunch of other different things so
let's just jump right into it now we're
going to need a whole bunch of libraries
for this tutorial because it's a little
bit more advanced and this tutorials to
a certain extent is going to be kind of
a review because I also want you to
really get this stuff ingrained well one
thing I need to be able to do here is to
be able to easily store widths and
Heights and I'd like to use this
dimension library to do that and that's
all it's going to do it's going to store
different heights and widths for me but
it keeps everything all nicely packaged
up I'm also going to work with dates in
this tutorial and you want to be able to
get today's date you're going to have to
bring in the date library and then for
the J spinner if you want to be able to
use dates you need to pull in what's
called an editor for the J spinner
that's going to allow you to easily
increment through dates and it's going
to handle a lot of different things for
you so I'm going to go Java X swing
spinner date model and there is a link
to all this code it's heavily commented
and you should definitely get it because
it's going to help you learn this stuff
much better it's underneath the video
it's free of course and I'm also going
to be working with calendar which
provides a bunch of methods that's going
to make it really easy for me to work
with dates so got all my libraries going
to I'm going to need here and of course
since I'm going to be working with
frames I need to extend that class and
here I have a button and to create
spinners it's real easy J spinner and
then I'm going to create four of them so
spinner one enter two and spinner four
and then I'm also going to throw in a
string here it's going to just output
some information for me and there you go
so I got all of my different fields
available for me and then this guy of
course is going to create my frame for
me on the window here we're defining our
size just like before here we're going
to set everything in the middle of the
window here we're going to handle
using here we're going to give it a name
here we're going to create our panel
here we created a button here we added a
listener that's going to fire the listen
for button method whenever the buttons
clicked on I'm adding that little action
here on button 1 and here is where I'm
putting my button on my panel that goes
inside of my frame all right so you've
seen all that stuff before it's no
reason for me to go over it again
alright so the first I'm going to show
you here is how to create just a
extremely basic spinner enter one like
we have here and let's say that we don't
really want to do anything with it that
fancy well just type in J new spinner
just like we've done with all the other
different components and whenever you
use the default spinner what it's going
to allow you to do is increment through
the numbers 1 through 9 that's all it's
going to do and you're going to see here
in a second exactly how that works and
we just go like this and add it to the
panel and you're ready to go that's it
it's all you need to do if you want to
be able to just allow the person to
either pick two numbers 1 through 9
that's how you do it let's say you
wanted to create a spinner that's a
little bit more advanced like you wanted
to be able to create a multiple number
spinner how would you do that it's
pretty simple also spinner 2 is equal to
new a spinner and then inside of it
you're gonna have to go new spinner
number model this is going to allow you
to model exactly what types of numbers
are going to go in there and then here
you're going to put the initial number
which I'm going to put is 1 and then I
have to define my minimum number which
is going to be 1 I'm going to define my
maximum number which is going to be 100
and then how much is this number going
to increment each time somebody hits a
button I'm going to put 1 inside of
there so you can see it has a lot of
different functionality and again you
can see if you want to add this to the
panel it's very simple like this and
spinner too now you have the second
spinner that's all you need to do and
it's kind of advanced here let's say you
wanted to create a spinner that uses a
bunch of different default values like
days of the week for example we're just
going to create ourselves a string array
I'm gonna call it weekdays and then I'm
gonna go Monday Tuesday Wednesday
Thursday Friday just to keep it simple
so there we are we created our array and
then if we want to throw those into the
spinner I'm just going to say spinner 3
is equal to nu J spinner nu spinner then
I'm going to say list
model instead of number model and then I
get a tell it what array to use
and then I can go the panel dot ad and
spinner three so you can see that's all
pretty simple let's run this just to
show you something here though here you
can see my spinner that's all defined
there's the first three spinners that
I've created here inside here alright so
they all seem like they work and if you
can't see this view at fullscreen this
is an HD video however if you look here
for the month it's going to
automatically size this guy based off of
the initial value which means Tuesday is
not going to fit Wednesday's not going
to fit
Thursdays isn't going to fit so we're
going to fix that so how exactly do you
fix it it's actually pretty easy we're
going to bounce back up here again and
this is where I'm going to use dimension
so I'm going to sa dimension D is equal
to and I'm gonna say spinner three and
I'm going to say get preferred size and
this is going to allow me to access and
change dimensions on this spinner so
that it's big enough and then I'm just
going to come in here and say D width is
equal to and I'm going to put eighty
inside here because that seems to work
and I can go to spinner three and I can
set preferred size for my spinner to
make sure it is big enough and then just
put the inside there again and now if we
execute it you can see that I have
plenty of room so that everything fits
inside of my spinner that's how you're
able to go in there and just roundabout
way and create that guy last thing I'm
going to show you this is going to be a
little bit more complicated is how to
work with dates well let's say we want
to get today's date just going to go
date today's date is equal to new I'm
going to go date this is automatically
going to get me today's date and I'm
going to define my spinner for it's
equal to new I'm gonna go J spinner
I'm gonna go new spinner date models
either I'm using all these different
little models and what did I have to do
here with this guy is define again what
I want to have is a default value so I'm
going to say today's date is my default
value and if I don't want a minimum I
can just put null inside of there if I
don't want a maximum I can just put in
all inside of there and at this point I
need to figure out okay well how do I
want to increment because it's going to
automatically based off how I increment
going to change the month or the day or
the year or whatever we just type in
calendar and in this situation day of
month makes the most sense I mean why
else would you increment in any other
different way whatever if you
would want to increment in different
ways using this guy you could also just
type in year or you can type in month so
I just created this new guy and it's
going to allow me to just have
everything work then I'm gonna go into J
spinner and go date editor and type in
date editor and what the state editor is
going to do is it's going to handle
displaying and editing dates based off
of the interaction with the user
automatically for me so I don't have to
worry about anything
I'm gonna go new J spinner and then go
date editor type in spinner for and then
I need to tell it exactly how I want the
dates to be displayed so I'm going to
say day month year and then close that
off and then I need to set the editor on
it so I'm going to go to spinner for
died set editor to the date editor just
like that and boom this guy's gonna go
in there and automatically handle all
that for me I just have to come up here
to the panel again and then change this
spinner for and now you're gonna see all
the dates are perfectly handled for me
and there they are
as I'm increment in my days the months
automatically change and eventually the
years would also automatically change
that's very very useful to be able to
pull something like that together in a
couple lines of code it's really cool
actually now I could also come in here
and use listeners and so forth I'm not
going to get into this if you guys want
to do it but like I could say listen for
spinner and then go l4
spinner is equal to new listen for
spinner if you want to do this as
homework here this would allow you to go
in there and create different listeners
for the different spinners and then you
can just type in spinner for dot add
change listener for this guy and then go
l4 spinner and then what this will just
simply do is call listens for spinner
every single time any interaction is
done with any of these different
spinners like I said if you want
homework there you can do it I
personally hate homework but some of you
guys seem to love it so now I'm going to
show you the last thing you do with
spinners I'm going to get the output
string and then I'm going to use a
little shortcut and I'm going to go to
spinner one value plus and if you want
to get the value for a spinner just type
in whatever its name is and go get value
plus and throw that on the end of it of
course I force better so of course I
want to have for these guys and then
quarters change that to two three and
four and then all we need to do let's
figure out how we're going to output it
and I'm going to use Jane option pain a
little pop-up message along and then
type in the name of this program so it's
going to be Java lesson 26 dot this and
then I'm going to take output string is
going to be what gets printed out on the
screen give it a title a option pane
give it a little information icon and
then finish it off I'm going to go
output string and set it back to nothing
after it ends if we execute it you can
see now you have another set of
different tools that you'll be able to
play with using your GUI interface and
it's pretty neat play around with dates
and do whatever you want and then click
get answer and you can see that it
prints out really really nice
information regards to dates and all the
other information that's entered so in
the next part of the tutorial I'm going
to cover what are called trees it's
going to be one of the last components I
cover in this tutorial and then we're
going to go into some of the other
different interfaces that are available
to you again the codes underneath the
video work with it you'll learn this
stuff that's the goal
learn it not just sit here and watch me
make videos leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
