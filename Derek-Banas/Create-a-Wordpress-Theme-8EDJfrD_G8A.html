my tutorial on how to create a wordpress
theme there is a prerequisite to this
actual tutorial and it's called how to
layout a website in that tutorial which
I have a link above to we created this
opening index or blog page and these
individual pages that you see right here
in this tutorial I'm going to create
this finalized piece that you see right
here as well as these individual pages
as you see right here and you can
actually see this at social voice
marketing com if you want to play around
with a theme and check it out and see
how it's going to look whenever this
tutorial is completely done but the
first thing that we're going to do is
we're going to go and download what's
called the blank theme and underneath of
this video you'll find a link to the
blank theme and then after you download
the blank theme you want to copy it and
then paste it into your WP dash content
folder inside of WordPress which is
located in your main WordPress directory
just go down until you see WP content
which is right here go inside of there
go inside of themes and this is where
you're going to put the blank theme and
then what we're going to do is we're
going to change the name of this and I'm
going to call it MTT - Cindy - - theme
and now that is already installed and
ready for you to use and if you log into
WordPress wherever you have it installed
whether it's on a localhost or on a
hosting company somewhere and if you
come down into appearance and themes
click on that you're going to be able to
see the theme right here and the blank
theme was created by Chris coiour and
basically what it is is it's a
stripped-down theme that has almost
nothing in it and you can see exactly
what it's going to look like right there
see totally totally totally stripped
well in this tutorial we're going to
turn that guy into this right here so
now that we have the blank theme all
installed we can start coding alright so
on the left side of the screen I have
all of the content that we created in
the how to layout a web site tutorial
all on the left side of the screen like
I said you can download it underneath
this video now in another window and I'm
using text or angular but you can use
any type of text editing tool that you
want to use we're gonna open up some
files so we're going to go open go into
my themes directory and I'm going to
find the NTT Cindy
to theme that I just created and I'm
going to open up a couple of these files
I'm going to open up header dot PHP I'm
going to open up index dot PHP I'm going
to open up functions dot PHP and style
dot CSS so let's open all those up in
this text editing that we have right
here the first thing we're going to do
is we're going to want to edit this so
we're going to call this and under theme
name I'm going to call it NTT Cindi -
theme ok so just do that and then theme
URI which is the location that the
person would go to if they want more
information about your theme I'm going
to type in new think-tank com forward
slash create a word grass thing all
right so that's where we're going to
have all that this is a sample aim to
teach how to make a wordpress theme
author I'm going to change this to my
name you can change it to your own I
don't care and then you're going to want
to put in whatever your website is and
I'm just going to leave this as version
1 and actually this is style dot CSS
what we're going to do is we're actually
going to delete everything out of here
but what we're going to do first is
we're going to select all the styling we
created in the how to layout a web site
tutorial there's all of it we're going
to paste in our own styling so that is
where all the changes we're going to
make to style dot CSS for now we got to
go in there make a couple other changes
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
jump into the header folder and I'm
going to fix the header file so that we
have everything in the right place now
for the most part not many things are
going to change inside of the header
section we're going to use the left side
as a guide and this is always the way I
do it as far as I know this is how most
people make themes they always make the
website first and then copy and paste
everything over well as we scroll down
here on the right side of the screen we
could see here that page wrap is being
used to surround all the text that's on
the screen well we're going to change
that to page wrapper because that's what
we used over here and we'll paste that
in there another thing that I'm going to
want to do here I'm actually going to
have to scroll up the screen to get it
is I want to get this specialized font
that I downloaded from Google and I want
to copy that it allows me to use
customized fonts then we'll jump over
here and again this is the header dot
PHP file that I'm working with on the
right side of the screen for our theme
and normally I put in any of my
additional
information that I need right under the
style part you don't really need to
worry this bright here what in essence
does is it locates your stylesheet but
as you can see I'm just using the theme
as it is I'm trying to make this as easy
to use as possible so for the most part
you're not going to need to change that
many different things here well then we
come down here and we see page wrapper
as I have page wrapper here and then we
see div ID is equal to header well on
the left side in my original guy that I
created that is identical so I don't
need to change any of that so I'm going
to jump inside of the header section and
start changing some of the code here
give myself some space okay so if we
look on the left side of the screen we
can see here that we are going to be
pulling in a logo that's going to be
used in the upper left hand corner so I
want to copy this guy jump over here
into the theme header dot PHP file paste
it right in there then we're going to
have to make a couple little changes I'm
going to have to tell it where to look
for this images folder now if we open up
this guy right here and locate our new
theme that we just created you can see
here is the images folder and there I
made it a little bit bigger if you can't
see this you can view this fullscreen HD
it's an HD video so here's the images
folder and you can see right here that
nothing is showing up that is because we
don't have the original logo and all the
things that we use previous someone have
to get those things okay so here are all
the images that I used whenever I
created the website in the how to lay
out a website tutorial so I'm just going
to copy all those and I'm going to jump
into the themes images folder I'm gonna
paste all those guys in there okay so
now I got all the images that I'm going
to need but like I said before we're
gonna have to tell WordPress exactly
what images folder to look in there's a
shortcut way to do that what we're going
to do is going to use some PHP code and
don't get nervous this is real simple I
want to type in blog info and I want to
type in template directory close off the
PHP section all the PHP code by putting
a question mark and in that closing
bracket then I'm going to leave images
and everything else here on the screen
exactly the same what blog info does is
it's going to go to my template or my
theme directory that I'm currently using
and it's going to go to the images
folder inside of there and then find
logo - except logo - is upper case
letters and it's going to be able to get
that image and throw it on to my new
feet alright so let's just keep working
through this guy
another thing we have over here is a
blog slogan I'm just going to copy that
I'm going to paste it inside of there
now WordPress is going to make my life
real easy because this part inside here
it's going to automatically pull out of
whatever slogan is defined inside of
WordPress however I have to take this
bit of code down here where it says
description and I need to copy it and
then paste it inside the paragraph tag
now what it's going to do is it's going
to automatically grab whatever slogan
the person to find inside of the
WordPress theme that they wanted to use
and in actuality I can delete all this
information because I no longer need it
leave the div there but everything else
goes now I also want to use a little
search tool here like you see here in
the upper right hand corner WordPress
also makes our life real easy there if
you want to throw in a search box well
I'm going to create a div I'm gonna give
it the ID of search box because that's
what I created over here and then I can
just call some PHP code and WordPress is
automatically going to insert a search
tool inside of there that's just going
to work beautifully we have to call a
function called get search form like
that and then close off the PHP block of
code and then we're going to close off
the div and another thing I want to use
is the new wordpress 3.0 version of a
menu bar if I want to use WordPress as
menu bar which is going to make the look
users of my theme very very happy I have
to just call another function it's going
to be called WP nav menu we're going to
call array and this is pretty much just
copy and paste code this is something
you can use over and over again you
don't have to think too much about this
we're going to say theme location and
I'm going to define it as main - menu
again you can just copy and paste this
code menu class like that and I'm going
to call it drop-down and this is
important container ID this is going to
be the ID for the menu that we're going
to be working with and type in
navigation because that's what I always
use then fallback Seabee this is if the
menu fails or WordPress can't get the
menu to work what it does is it calls a
function I'm going to type in fallback
CB it's going to throw up a can sort of
menu system just so that there's
something up there if something goes
wrong along the way it's kind of like an
error checker and then close that off
what do we have over here after the menu
system which I'm actually going to
delete this whole thing because
WordPress is going to be real nice and
created all for me as you scroll down
here you see div ID is equal to content
rapper we're going to use that again
that's going to surround all of the
content that's on the screen after the
menu then we can come inside of here and
clean that up now your header dot PHP
file is done that's all you needed to do
and you have a good part of your website
already all cleaned up and really really
nice but while we're in here let's go
because we just defined the menu inside
of this guy right here we're going to go
into the functions PHP file we're going
to save this header file because we know
it's right jump into functions dot PHP
and go down here to the bottom we're
going to come back to register sidebar
here later on in the tutorial whenever
we create all of the sidebars already
using custom WordPress sidebars they're
going to be really nice now what we're
going to do to make the menu work is
we're going to call function exists
register now menus what this is going to
do is check if we're going to be able to
use the WordPress to find menus
that's all copy and pasted code again
and if the answer to that is yes we're
going to call another function called
register nav menus and then we're going
to call array and we're going to go main
- menu little equal sign main navigation
and then close off that function and the
main menu part here actually came from
right here where we typed in theme
location main menu and that's all we
need to do inside of WordPress to make
that guy work for now so let's just save
the functions and then let's jump into
index.php because this is going to get a
little bit more interesting alright so
now we're in index dot PHP on the right
side of the steering for the theme that
we are going to be creating and one
thing that we're going to need to do is
create our sidebar that we're going to
be using a side of WordPress so I'm
actually going to come down here to the
very bottom of this guy I'm going to cut
that out of there then I'm going to jump
up here after get header we're going to
create our sidebar we just paste that
inside of there and our sidebar is going
to be called first sidebar so we're just
going to call it first we're just gonna
stick first inside of there and that's
going to grab all of the code that is
going to be used to generate this right
here this is what I mean by first
sidebar and that's going to all be
contained inside of another block of
code that we're going to get into later
on in this tutorial right now I'm going
to show you how to automatically pull in
all of this content right here in the
middle of the screen these two columns
and this is the sort of stuff
that they think is complicated we're
going to do is we're going to scroll
down until we get to beginning of middle
bar one then we're basically going to do
a lot of coffee and paste and so we
called in our sidebar code so what just
trust that that left sidebar is already
in there well we're going to be working
on the middle column so we're going to
come in here and we're going to just
copy and paste from the left to the
right of the side of the screen then
what I'm going to have to do is I want
all of the information that's on this to
automatically pull in articles and
display those on this column and then
also automatically pull in all of the
video articles and display those there
so I have to make some custom queries
inside of WordPress it's actually very
easy to do again this is copy and paste
code so what I need to do if I want to
make a query inside of WordPress I have
to hijack what's called the WP query
object now I'm going to want to use this
later on so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a temporary WP query
variable and I'm going to store the
values that are in the WP query object
inside of that make sure you type in
temp WP query and then I'm going to take
WP coronary and I'm going to delete
everything in this object by calling
null on it now I'm going to create a new
WP query object and again this is copy
and paste code I'm just sort of
explaining what's going on here that it
all confuses you just copy and paste it
it'll work so that creates a new object
called WP query and WordPress is going
to know what it is then WP query if I
want to query the database or ask the
database to return very specific
information I just put a dash in there
in that little bracket and I take the
inquiry and then how many posts I want
WordPress to returned to me which is
going to be four so post per page is
going to be equal to four but however I
only want it to return articles in the
first situation so I'm going to put an
and sign and type in category name is
equal to our death Col so it's going to
return all of the first four posts on to
that page that are in a category with
the name article and that's all defined
inside of WordPress so if they have it
in a category code article it's going to
pull them out well then what I got to do
is call a while loop and I'm going to
cycle through all of the results so I'm
going to say the WordPress Eowyn all
these results sent to me and how you do
that is you call
function called have hoes and put a
little bracket here I'm going to call WP
Corre
again the same guy over and over again
and I'm going to say that I want to get
all the information from the first post
that was received that is found that
fits our stipulations and I can actually
close off my PHP code and then if we
look over here we'll see first I defined
this div middle column well now I'm
going to create a new one each one of
these guys right here on the screen is
in something called middle container I'm
just going to go now that I know I got
my first post I need to put that in
there every single time to surround
every single one of those guys and then
I need to copy this guy right here jump
over into WordPress now because I know
it's going to be an article that is
returned because that's what I asked it
for I'm just going to put in this right
here article later on it's going to be
video instead then what I need to do if
you look over here on the right side of
the screen is I need to get the first
image that is inside of each article and
I need to paste it on the screen
well how I'm going to do that I did this
in a previous tutorial on how to create
WordPress themes is I'm going to call a
function called catch that image again
this is just copy and paste code let me
just jump into functions dot PHP and
create it alright so I'm in functions
dot PHP and I want to add some
additional functionality and what this
basically is going to do is it's going
to say what's the first image inside of
the article for this post
I want it received I want it sent back
over here and I want to display it on my
front page can either copy and paste
this code or try to understand what I'm
saying gets that image is the name of
the function and again you need to
define global for post which is all the
information posts so what we're doing
here is just defining variables that are
going to allow us to access information
in the post then create another variable
called first image and we're just going
to give it nothing as a value as we
first create it obese start this just
helps with some memory management it's a
little bit beyond this actual tutorial
now what I'm going to do is retrieve
some information from the actual content
of the post and this is regular
expressions again this is copy and paste
code for most of you guys out there
don't have to understand it so basically
what I'm doing here I'm going to try to
explain it to the best of my ability is
I'm
looking for the tag named image and then
what I want to try to receive is the
source meaning the location of that
image and I'm back slashing this
individual quote because I have a quote
here so that's why I'm putting that
inside of there and then with this
rounded-off bracket I'm saying that I
want to grab all of the information in
that source location for that image
however I do not want to grab anything
that is an individual quote or a double
quote because that's more than likely
the end of the source or location for
that image and I want to grab everything
the whole way down until I get to a
single quote or a double quote and
anything thereafter and I want to ignore
any type of capitalization again if you
don't understand that it's just copy and
paste code you can just paste it in
there and post /and little bracket post
content is the actual content of the
article and matches now what we're going
to do is go first image is equal to the
first match see this guy up here is
going to grab any source or any
locations of images in the entire
article now what we're going to do is
we're going to say we just want the
first one and you do that by putting
that code in right there if now we want
to check to make sure it's not empty so
if no images were found first image
we're going to define ourselves a
default image if there was nothing found
if there were no images found on that
post let's paste that in there it's
equal to log info we're gonna say look
in my template directory or my theme
directory and then images forward slash
default and I have an image called
default pane it's going to use that one
if it can find any additional ones close
that off and return first image which
will now either hold the location for
the first image in the post or it will
hold the default image that we're going
to be using then we can close off this
function right inside of there and get
rid of any additional whitespace that's
inside of there because WordPress does
not like whitespace after these brackets
and we're going to save functions dot
PHP and jump back over into Enda and now
we're actually going to call that
function that we just created well let's
come over here and let's copy this save
ourselves from typing so this is the
original way that we were grabbing
featured images but this is going to be
all dynamic now
be really cool how you make it dynamic
to get rid of this actually defined
image we're going to go PHP echo which
is going to print out whatever catch
that image returns which we know is
going to be the location or the source
for the dynamically loaded image like
that and then close off the PHP make
this even more dynamic alt is going to
get the title of whatever the article is
to make this a little bit more search
engine optimized and if you want to do
that just type in PHP and type in the
title right inside of there
and then close off the PHP code again
and we can leave everything else exactly
the same so that's going to grab these
images that's where this is coming from
dynamically these images are pulled in
from the article themselves that's
really cool now let's look over here we
also have middle or title middle our
date and horizontal rule let's just grab
those three right now get back over
inside of here because we're basically
just doing the same thing we're just
using WordPress to get us access to
information dynamically like images and
titles for articles all right so we have
middle or title and here I have
everything defined as Facebook marketing
and this time we're going to have it
actually be whatever it is the name for
the actual article that was created so
let's do that so let's go into middle
art title delete that out and we're
going to make this dynamic again and
also we're going to make it a link so
let's go a each reference is equal to
and if we want to get the actual
location for the article itself we're
going to type in PHP the permalink and
this is going to automatically kick out
whatever the location is for the article
don't forget put the double quotes here
and then the double quotes after this
blows off that a tag and then what we're
going to do is we may get the actual
title or the post so again call PHP I'm
going to define a variable it's going to
be called ntt the title and it's going
to be equal to post bracket and I'm
going to call a function called post but
you don't and then I'm going to grab a
variable called post title from inside
of that and it's going to contain the
title for the post and then I'm going to
call another function in PHP a called
substring what it's going to do is it's
going to shorten the length of the title
so in case the person using my theme
goes and types in something ridiculous
in regards to length it's going to make
sure that it's only 50 characters in
length and that's what I just defined
there and closed off the end of the PHP
code and then come in here
remember we created a link with
closed-off that link and everything else
there is perfectly fine so now we're
going to have to get middle or date so
we're going to come inside of this guy
right here
delete that out and call PHP the time
and upper case F J uppercase s uppercase
Y this is going to return my date for me
and I don't need to do anything else
with that and then horizontal midle rule
which is just that little line across
the screen could actually stay exactly
the way that it is so let's jump over
here and get the excerpt area which is
going to be just an abbreviated excerpt
of the article so paste the dot in there
and then I can get rid of all of this
crap right here because I don't need
that and grab the actual excerpt again
you're doing the same thing bracket PHP
and again I'm going to shorten it so
that it's not too long it overflows and
messes up everything that I'm doing here
on the screen I'm going to create a
variable called ntt the excerpt and it's
going to be equal to the value of post
if you want to get a variable inside of
here call post excerpt right like that
so that's going to grab the excerpt for
me and guess what I'm doing again when I
call substring and I'm gonna say that I
want it shrunk down and TT the excerpt
I'm gonna type in zero in a month I've
been 157 I already checked on this so I
know it works and then I want to close
off my PHP section well then I want to
put a little more button inside of here
I know the title is already set up to
work if they want to read but I'm going
to set it up so that if they click on
more they'll go and they'll read the
entire article so how I do that is
inside of a H reference I'm going to
call PHP again right like that and I'm
going to call the per my link and that's
going to give me the link to the full
article so that if they click on it
take some where they want to go and
everything else they're not leave
exactly as it is and that is going to
give me everything that I need for that
middle container this guy right here all
of that codes and automatically pull all
this in dynamically so I need to close
my div for middle container and I'm
going to put a little comment inside of
here that says end of little container
right like that then I have to call the
end while function and what that
going to do is we jumped up here while
there's a wild statement it's going to
pull back for posts that are all in the
category article so while there are four
posts not five four in the category
article it's going to continue to pull
them that's why the end while is there
that's going to end the while statement
well then what I going to do is I
actually have to reset my query that I
created above so WP query just so you
can see that to the default that's how
you create comments inside of PHP by the
way so I'm going to grab WP query right
here paste that side of there I'm going
to nullify it I'm delete everything
inside of it and then what I'm going to
do is I'm going to call temp WP query
and get all the values that were stored
in that temporary file and storm back
into WP query and then close off that
PHP code and actually close off the div
for the entire column because all of
that code right there is going to
automatically create the entire column
it'll come and all of this additional
code right here that was inside of the
blank theme we don't need it so I'm just
going to come down here and delete
everything down the whole way to where
it says get footer and then all of the
work that we just put in can be reused
to make the second column so let's just
copy that go the whole way up to where
it says middle column right there and
let's copy that scroll back down alright
pasted it in there so now pretty much
what we need to do and let me just go
full screen with this is before we were
pulling in articles now we need to pull
in videos that's all that's the only
difference between those two bars so
let's go fix that so let's scroll up
through here you can say this is the end
of the middle column right there all of
this is going to stay the same except
for category name is now going to be
video because we're going to be pulling
in posts through in the video category
this we're going to change to video
because that's what it is it's not an
article and the rest of this can all
stay exactly the same so let's go down
to end little column and the only thing
we got to do is pull in our second
sidebar and let's just save ourselves
from that so let's copy that come down
inside of here paste inside of here and
our second sidebar is going to be called
guess what second we paste that inside
