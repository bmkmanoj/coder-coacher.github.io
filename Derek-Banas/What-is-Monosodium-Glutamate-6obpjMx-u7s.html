accidentally became allergic to MSG and
now easily keep my weight off I
accidentally created a diet that not
only drops white but also keeps it off
you can follow the links to find the
dine at diet nutritional plan here all
over your screen I base my diet off of
about 14 nutritionist textbooks it is a
very simple diet just avoid food high in
fat cholesterol and salt and I go out of
my way to show you the exact foods that
you should eat that fit these guys low
in doing so I cut out a food additive
accidentally called msg by doing this I
now can't eat anything unhealthy for the
most part hence nearly permanent weight
loss
monosodium glutamate is a salt that is
not used to preserve food but instead to
flavor it inexpensively what it does is
it folds your taste buds in thinking
that the food you are eating is healthy
and rich in protein when it probably is
not protein rich foods are expensive so
how does a fast-food company give you
the protein your body desires for a buck
they load it up with MSG that folds your
body
another benefit for fast-food companies
is that MSG acts as an anti-oppression
that drops your blood sugar levels so
you feel hungry when you aren't later
MSG allows food companies to sell you
extremely cheap foodstuff that
stimulates your hunger by adding a cheap
additive that is the pure reason why MSG
is in food so what does MSG do diya
gives you high blood pressure migraines
are considered to be very closely
related to MSG consumption gallbladder
attacks inability to process certain
fat's in the body lower blood sugar
levels hypothyroidism onset of diabetes
and numerous other absolutely horrendous
things remember this was an accident but
I'm generally happy that it happened I
noticed that certain foods gave me
stomach cramps about two and a half
months into my diet the first thing that
made me sick was actually salad from a
salad bar I didn't know what was
happening or why but I received stomach
cramps that lasted about three hours
they weren't terrible but they weren't
fun either msg is found in
countless numbers of products I'll go
over just the most common ones here food
for McDonald's KFC Burger King
chick-fil-a Taco Bell Applebee's etc in
general fast-food pretty much every
fast-food place try to eat from
neighborhood restaurants hold hands and
join kirino's so far have passed the
test along with numerous mom-and-pop R
Us or some other foods that almost
always contain MSG ranch dressing
sausage gravy
snack chips Parmesan cheese deli meat
soy sauce Poulenc use powdered soup
mixes vegetable dips nutrasweet hot dogs
croutons mushroom soup hamburger al four
cup noodles ramen noodles gelatin if you
see any of these words in nutrition
labels you know that there is MSG in the
product msg obviously glutamate
hydrolyzed caseinate glutamic acid
textured protein yeast nutrient Otto
lies geez that's a non or at Jin Emoto
you can see here that if I'm forced to
avoid every item on this list it is
quite easy for me to keep my overall
weight off and really when you think
about it what are you giving up for the
most part chips powdered food stuff and
fast food don't worry you'll be very
happy you did accidentally I decreased
the stomach cramps by taking two
ibuprofens
this works pretty well as an antidote to
MSG sickness msg is known as glutamate
and it just so happens that ibuprofen is
a glutamate blocker the best results I
received came from drinking a can of
redbull oddly enough because I later
read redbull contains a large amount of
taurine and vitamin b6 which fight the
negative effects of MSG
msg also can trigger migraine headaches
there are some other things others have
found to help as antidotes to MSG
poisoning magnesium taurine which is in
Red Bull but also in pill form and
benadryl you don't need any of these
things if you just avoid msg altogether
though thank you for watching my
tutorial and you should most definitely
check out the diet nutritional plan it
is a hundred percent free and there are
no vitamin supplements or anything
needed till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
