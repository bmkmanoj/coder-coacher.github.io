accidentally became allergic to msg and
now easily keep my weight off I
accidentally created a diet that not
only drops white but also keeps it off
you can follow the links to find the
dine at diet nutritional plan here all
over your screen I base my diet off of
about 14 nutritionist textbooks it is a
very simple diet just avoid food high in
fat cholesterol and salt and I go out of
my way to show you the exact foods that
you should eat that fit these guys oh in
doing so I cut out a food additive
accidentally called msg by doing this I
now can't eat anything unhealthy for the
most part hence nearly permanent weight
loss monosodium glutamate is a salt that
is not used to preserve food but instead
to flavor it inexpensively what it does
is it folds your taste buds in thinking
that the food you are eating is healthy
and rich in protein when it probably is
not protein rich foods are expensive so
how does a fast food company give you
the protein your body desires for a buck
they load it up with msg that fold your
body another benefit for fast food
companies is that msg acts as an anti
appetite suppressant that drops your
blood sugar levels so you feel hungry
when you aren't later msg allows food
companies to sell you extremely cheap
food stuff that stimulates your hunger
by adding a cheap additive that is the
pure reason why msg is in food so what
does msg do tia gives you high blood
pressure migraines are considered to be
very closely related to msg consumption
gallbladder attacks inability to process
certain fats in the body lower blood
sugar levels hypothyroidism onset of
diabetes and numerous other absolutely
horrendous things remember this was an
accident but I'm generally happy that it
happened I noticed that certain foods
gave me stomach cramps about two and a
half months into my diet the first thing
that made me sick was actually salad
from a salad bar I didn't know what was
happening or why but I received stomach
cramps that lasted about three hours
they weren't terrible but they weren't
fun either MSG is found in
countless numbers of products I'll go
over just the most common ones here food
for McDonald's KFC burger king
chick-fil-a Taco Bell applebees etc in
general fast food pretty much every
fast-food place try to eat from
neighborhood restaurants whole hands and
johnny carinos so far have passed the
test along with numerous moment for us
or some other foods that almost always
contain msg ranch dressing sausage gravy
snack chips Parmesan cheese deli meat
soy sauce poulenc use powdered soup
mixes vegetable dips nutrasweet hotdogs
croutons mushroom soup amber grail for
cup noodles ramen noodles gelatin if you
see any of these words in nutrition
labels you know that there is msg in the
product msg obviously glutamate
hydrolyzed caseinate glutamic acid
textured protein yeast nutrient ought
alized geez that's anon or at jinnah
moto you can see here that if I'm forced
to avoid every item on this list it is
quite easy for me to keep my overall
weight off and really when you think
about it what are you giving up for the
most part chips powdered food stuff and
fast food don't worry you'll be very
happy you did accidentally I decrease
the stomach cramps by taking two
ibuprofens this works pretty well as an
antidote to msg sickness msg is known as
glutamate and it just so happens that
ibuprofen is a glutamate blocker the
best results I received came from
drinking a can of redbull oddly enough
because I later read redbull contains a
large amount of taurine and vitamin b6
which fight the negative effects of msg
msg also can trigger migraine headaches
there are some other things others have
found to help as antidotes to msg
poisoning magnesium taurine which is in
red bull but also in pill form and
benadryl you don't need any of these
things if you just avoid msg all
together though thank you for watching
my tutorial and you should most
definitely check out the diet
nutritional plan it is a hundred percent
free and there are no vitamin
supplements or anything needed till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
