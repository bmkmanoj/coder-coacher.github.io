one of my blender tutorial this is going
to be a multi-part tutorial in which I'm
going to cover the 3d design software
known as blender which is used to make
games 3d prints movies graphic design
product design pretty much anything you
want to be 3d and in this first part of
the tutorial I want to cover all of the
basics so that you will be very
comfortable to experiment with blender
and everything that I do here is going
to be available in a text document that
is in the description that is 100% free
you don't have to give me your email or
anything just download it or go look at
it or whatever and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it ok so to get blender
all you need to do is go to blender.org
and download it it is very easy to
install it looks and works exactly the
same on every single OS and I can trust
that you will be able to download it and
install it with no problem
and I'm gonna cover all the basics like
I said but I'm also going to teach you
how to use a bezzie a tool and a little
tool called spin to create this 3d
object right here and numerous other
objects like it so that's what we will
cover by the end of the tutorial
and whenever you start up blender you
can see I'm using the most recent
version blender 2.79 but if you have 2.8
or something like that chances are it's
exactly the same are very very similar
anyway and this is what it looks like
and if you can't see it view it
fullscreen I'm gonna try to zoom in on
everything that I talked about though
first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
open up in here and I am going to come
over here on the right side of the
screen and I'm gonna turn on my
screencast keys and what that's going to
do is it's going to allow you to see
what I do over here so whenever I go and
click on a for example to deselect
you're going to see over here some
information on what I'm going to do or
what I am doing and I went and Len large
dad a little bit so you can see it a
little bit better alright so first first
thing I want to cover are some
preferences that you may or may not
decide to use now I am using a three
button Mouse you don't need a three
button Mouse but it is very useful if
you want to use a 2 button Mouse
probably what you're going to want to do
is go to file user preferences and then
input and then click on emulate a three
button Mouse that will allow you to do
pretty much everything you can
and deal with a three-button Mouse on a
2 button Mouse another thing you might
want to do is in blender by default you
select everything with your right mouse
key a lot of people don't like that
they'd like to use the left so you could
switch that also um and that's basically
the main things that you might want to
change I am going to use the default
system though where I'm gonna select
with the right key just so you know and
like I said I'm using a 3 button mouse
I'll put a link to the mouse I'm using
but any three button Mouse will work ok
so here we are inside of blender I'm
gonna teach you the just basic stuff so
if you would want to say zoom in or out
what you're gonna do is you're gonna
hold down on control and everything's
the same on Windows and Mac and then
you're just going to move your mouse
forward as you're pressing your middle
mouse button and that is going to allow
you to zoom in and out once again ctrl +
middle mouse wheel you can also hold
down shift and that is going to allow
you to scroll up or down and move your
basic plane of your 3d geometry here on
your screen your mouse wheel is also
going to allow you to zoom in and out
just by rolling it like that and also
you're going to be able to go and select
with your middle mouse button and pan
around your 3d objects inside of the
screen just by holding down the middle
mouse button I am currently in object
mode and you can see what mode you're in
right here say it says object mode and
inside of object mode that's where
you're gonna move objects around now if
you would ever want to change to work
with your vertices the vertices are the
points I'm gonna switch into edit mode
how you do that is by going into tab ok
I just clicked on the tab key now I'm in
edit mode now if I would and if you want
to deselect everything you click on a
now if I would want to come in here and
I would want to select my vertices how I
would do that I'm gonna go here and pan
this down this is a vertice and you
select everything with your right mouse
button say that's a vertice this right
here is an edge and the interior this is
known as a face now you're gonna be able
to move these different things around
I'm gonna switch back into object mode
once again I'm gonna hit the tab key C C
tab right there now I want to select
everything here I'm gonna select it with
the right mouse button and I can zoom
out here
a little bit now you're gonna be able to
do a couple different things you're
going to be able to scale one of your or
move one of your objects on the X Y or Z
plane and this right here this red guy
right here is going to represent the
x-axis and the green is gonna represent
the y-axis and this is the Z now if I
would want to move my cube right here on
the x-axis once again that is going to
be your red you're gonna select that
with your left mouse button and you can
see this line pops out here and that is
going to allow you to move it only on
the x axis if we go and once again with
the left mouse button go and select the
green arrow it's only gonna move on the
Y and if we go and select once again
with the left mouse button on the blue
arrow that's gonna move it on the z axis
or z plane however you want to refer to
it you're also going to be able to move
objects by pressing shortcut keys and
the move key is gonna be G so if I have
this selected you can see there's a line
around the cube that tells you that it's
selected if I want to move it I can just
press on G and then it'll just be tied
or stuck to my mouse pointer and then if
I want to set it I just press the left
mouse button and it stops so once again
I go and I can select that item it's
highlighted press G and it moves and
another thing that's kind of useful to
be able to do is I could also select
this guy and press G and then hit on
plus and 5 and that's going to move it 5
blender units you're going to be able to
define how you move different items
later on I'll cover that in a later
tutorial and you could also press G and
negative 5 and move it back again so
just different things you can do with
all of these different shortcut keys
you're also going to have numerous
different views and ways to look at your
objects if you want to switch to your
front view you're gonna press on one and
that is your front view you're also
going to get a right view with a 3 and
you're going to get a top view within
the number 7 oh another thing that you
might want to do is I have I do not have
a number pad on my keyboard so I'm gonna
go into user preferences and I do indeed
have emulate number pad selected right
there so if you have that selected you
don't need to have a keyboard with a
number-pad all right so I want to cover
that also you're also gonna be able to
switch to the back view with control one
the left view with control 3 and the
bottom view with control 7 and these
things you don't have to memorize all of
them just over time you're gonna pick
them up
there's also possible to get a camera
view by pressing 0 and that is what your
camera is going to be recording or what
it's gonna be seeing and you're going to
be able to use your right mouse button
on the edge to move the camera so you
can see right there how I'm able to move
the camera and put it exactly where I
want it to go now you're gonna have a
perspective view and let's switch out of
this let's go back and I'm gonna press
the O key here to get rid of our camera
view and what I want to do now is I want
to talk about perspective view versus
orthographic view now perspective view
is basically just going to show
everything or this is actually
orthographic view perspective view is
going to show everything in perspective
so the farther away an object is the
smaller it's gonna be or the closer the
larger it's gonna be orthographic view
is going to represent objects as the
same size independent of the distance
from your camera and we'll get more into
that as the tutorial continues if you
would like to split your screen and show
multiple different things on the screen
at the same time you're gonna be able to
do that with your left mouse button just
come up here can see these little lines
up here you're going to select them and
then drag over and that is going to
allow you to display multiple different
views of your screen all at the same
time and if you want to get rid of them
you're going to put your mouse button
over that again and you're gonna see
that little arrow popped up there blink
and now you're back to just one view
there's also a shortcut to show multiple
different views it is called the quad
view and to show it you're gonna go ctrl
alt &amp;amp; Q for quad and there you can see
right there it gets kind of busy with
the shortcuts there but you're gonna see
that it is going to show you both the
top view and top perspective and
down here the front and the right of the
object since its cube looks kind of
boring but you know what have you you're
also going to be able to get rid of that
by going ctrl alt &amp;amp; Q and switch back to
just one view which is a little bit
easier to deal with here you're also
going to be able to pan your view by
going shift and F and then you're just
moving the mouse key around if you want
to do that and you can shut that off by
just clicking with your left mouse
button and that deactivates that I'm
gonna come in here and just grab it with
the center mouse button and put it back
into perspective mode so I can see it a
little bit easier you're going to be
able to both show and hide your priority
of your properties that's this is the
properties panel right here by pressing
n so there that's on and that's off this
is the tool menu you'll be able to turn
that on and off by just pressing the T
key down here you will see some
different operations that you're going
to be able to pull off and we're going
to be able to move with this arrow here
you're going to go and rotate an object
with this one and scale with that one so
move is what we've been using all along
and let's go and do a rotate so you're
going to be able to select this and then
we'll be able to click and drag with our
I'm using my left mouse button to rotate
this item around and you can see we're
gonna be able to use the x and y planes
just like we did previously likewise I'm
gonna go now and scale this I clicked on
the scale tool I'm gonna be able to
click on this with the left mouse button
and scale either on the X Y or z plane
and just like I talked about previously
so very very useful stuff also you're
gonna be able to go and make a lot of
those changes over here with the
transform tool so location rotation
scale all that stuff and as you get more
precise you're gonna be using this stuff
a lot more than you're gonna be using
the regular mouse movements another
thing that's good to know is your left
mouse button if you click and once again
we're in object mode that's very
important to understand if you go and
you click anywhere in your perspective
area that is going to create the 3d
cursor now this is going to define a lot
of different things but one thing it's
going to define is where a new object is
going to appear on our screen and to
make a new object appear on the screen
you're going to go shift and a and this
is going to show you a whole bunch of
different things I'm gonna
about the Bezier tool later but here is
a mesh so let's say I wanted to put in a
sphere or what have you there you go and
it appeared right in the center where I
put my 3d cursor if I would want to
duplicate this guy and put it somewhere
else on my screen I can just go Shift +
D and that's going to do a duplication
perfect duplication there you can see it
again another thing that's very
important to remember is if you ever do
add new objects always do it in the
object mode because if you do it over in
the edit mode objects that you are
adding to your scene are going to be
joined together and I'm gonna talk about
how two disjoint objects here in a
moment but just wanted to talk about
that we're also going to be able to view
our objects in numerous different ways
come down here you're going to see that
we have solid mode is what we're using
currently you're also gonna have
wireframe which is going to be very
common and rendered and all these other
different things so I might as well talk
about the shortcuts for switching
between those if you want to switch
between wireframe and solid remember
this is solid chain it's shading I'm
gonna press on Z there you go now you're
in wireframe you're also going to be
able to go shift in Z and it's going to
show you a rendered mode and you can
come in here and go and change to
different types of rendering modes and
the cycles renderer is a little bit
harder to pull off but whatever you can
go shift Z and switch back to your
regular solid mode once again z
wireframe like I said don't worry about
trying to memorize all these just
playing around and practicing using the
cheat sheet I have in the description is
gonna help you a ton another thing that
you have here on your screen is what is
called the outliner window and you can
see all the different objects that we
have here and it's going to allow you to
cycle down into all of the different
things that appear on with your object
so this is your cube in general and then
you're going to have the materials and
textures associated with it like I said
we'll get more into that later just
going to point out that this exists and
all of these different objects on your
screen are going to appear up there in
the outliner window didn't talk about
how you delete things let's say you
would really decide you don't like this
sphere you want to delete it just press
X this guy's gonna pop up click on
delete and there it goes away you're
also going to be able to define let's
say I want to select this guy right here
and
come down here and just click on this
guy right there to just do a regular
selection or let schnitz go and do that
selection right there that's the
translate selection or the move
selection would I switch to let's say
you would want to scale this guy let's
double it in size
there's shortcuts you could use so I
want to do a scale so I'm gonna say s
and I'm gonna go +2 and there you go it
automatically doubled in size and like I
said previously with G+ you're gonna be
able to move at a certain number of
units you're also going to be able to if
you want to set this just press with the
left mouse button everything goes back
and if you would like to rotate it let's
say 20 degrees it's selected you're
gonna press R + 20 degrees C tons of
little neat things you can do with this
another thing it's kind of useful is
we're gonna be able to hide selected
objects let's say we want to work with
one object and the other stuffs in a way
so let's go and I'm gonna hold down
let's go and hold down the middle area
let's say I want to work with a sphere
and I don't want to rotate this for some
reason I don't know I'm just making
something up and hoping to hide the cube
not show it on the screen I can just
select it and press H and then likewise
if I want to bring back all of my hidden
objects I can just go alt H and there it
is back again you're gonna be able to
come up here this guy right here is your
light and you're going to be able to
right-click on your light and move it
around wherever you would want I'm gonna
talk more about lights and in later
tutorials you're also gonna have
different types of shading so I'm gonna
hold down my middle mouse key once again
and let's say I want to look at
different types of shading I'll just
select this sphere right here and I can
come over here and select smooth or flat
and let's see what smooth looks like and
flat is what we have been using you're
gonna be able to group objects together
what I'm gonna do is do a B and a box
selection I'm gonna select both my cube
and my sphere I'm then gonna come over
here to this object right here this is
going to allow me to group objects
select that and there's layers and all
kinds other things and if I want to
create a new group I'm gonna press on
the plus key and I can go and give this
a name let's just call it Group one
that's perfectly fine and for an enter
and there you go now you got yourself a
group I'm also going to be able to come
in here and go let's say shift a
create another guy say we want a
cylinder for some reason and I want to
add this to our current group I can just
come over here click on add to group and
select Group 1 and now they are all
gonna be added to the same group ok so
useful ways to organize different
objects press a again to deselect I'm
also going to be able to join multiple
different objects so let's say I want to
select my cube I'm gonna hold down shift
and I'm gonna select the cylinder also
say I want to join them so that they
basically act like one thing I just go
ctrl + J and there you go now they will
act as one object when one selected the
other one will be selected now I'm gonna
be able to separate those in different
ways actually it's do something even
neater um I'm gonna select all of these
different objects I'm gonna get the
cylinder and all this stuff press X to
delete at all yeah X there we go delete
they're all going I'm gonna create
something that looks a little bit more
permanent somebody goes shift and a and
I'm gonna create a cube there's my cube
right there I'm gonna move it down here
and to position and then I'm going to go
and create shift a and I'm gonna get
myself a sphere grab it and I'm gonna
stick it inside of my cube and then I'm
gonna do a joint and then I'm gonna show
you how to go and unjoin I'm gonna grab
it on the X plane right here
with my left mouse button and you can
see I'm actually forcing it inside of
the cube and now what I'm gonna do is
with a box and ctrl J to join them so
ctrl J there they are
now when one selected they are both
selected now if I want to deselect them
I can go tab now I'm over inside of edit
mode they were both still selected and
I'm gonna be able to call for them to be
separated by pressing on P and you're
gonna see a whole bunch of different
options here loose parts is going to
allow me to drag out the sphere from
inside of the cube material is going to
separate based off of different colors
and selection is going to separate based
off of what I have selected so I'm gonna
say loose parts because I know the
sphere is going to be different from the
cube so I went and got rid of them right
like that now I can switch back into
object mode and come in here and grab
these sphere and pull it right out let's
go and stick it right back in there
again
now whatever let's just go switch back
to edit mode
I can go edit and I can go box and once
again with the left mouse button go and
select some of these different pieces go
P once again and this time I'm gonna go
selection and then jump back over an
object mode with tab and now I'm gonna
be able to grab this and pull the top
off of my sphere so kind of neat stuff
you can see it still maintains a 3d look
but I just yanked that off the top there
so if you want to do some brain surgery
there's one way to do that now let's
come in here and let's do a little bit
more with edit mode so I'm gonna go B
and I'm just gonna select some of this
stuff and I'm gonna go X and delete all
of its going let's go create a new
object I'm gonna go shift and mesh and
I'm just gonna pick on cube hold down
the middle mouse button move the cube
around here like I said before this is
if I were to see the point this is the
edge the face is surrounded by four
edges or multiple edges you're also
going to be able to define how you are
going to select these different things
I'm gonna go into edit mode by pressing
pressing on the tab button down here
you're going to be able to select based
off of vertices this is going to be
selection based off of an edge and this
is a face and this guy right here
whenever it is selected it is going to
limit selection to what is visible
whenever it's unselected it's going to
basically select throw and you're gonna
see that here in a second so I have this
selected currently and I'm gonna come
down here and select this if you can see
the back edges and vertices and faces
that means you can select them
I'm gonna go A to D unselect them go
into B come in here and you can see now
that I'm able to select all of those
vertices and or that that's actually
selecting a face and if we go like this
you're gonna see that C selected the
face and why did it select the face I'll
tell you why because I have select face
down here this is vertices and once
again we can zoom out and if I want if I
want to select vertices I just select
that and then with the right mouse
button I can come in and select all the
different vertices move them around do
whatever I want with them here if I want
to select edges I select the edge down
at the bottom with my right mouse button
I can come in here and select those I
can hold down the shift key of course
and select multiple different vertices
and once again I can come in and select
the different faces if I'd like to do
that as well now the box select is kind
of cool but you're also gonna be able to
do other different selection options
one of them is this circle select you
need to get to that with the C key and
if I want to come in here and select
this I just go and press C and then I
can go and select multiple different
parts let's go and actually just select
what is visible I'm gonna get out of the
circle selection tool with the Escape
key jump back in here now I'm just
selecting what's visible circle and
there you can say I can do that and
select the faces for example right like
that and then scape out alright and
deselect with a a once again another
thing you have able to do is draw
vertices and create faces and shapes and
so forth and so on this is normally done
in the front orthographic position and
how we're gonna get to that is we're
gonna go five and one and you can see up
here it says front orthographic right
like that and if I want to draw a
vertice once again we have to be in edit
mode for this I'm gonna hold down my
control key and I'm going to just come
in here and click with the left mouse
button and whoops it's actually
connected to that I need to deselect
that you could do undo just like
anything else I'm gonna go a and
deselect all all right so now I'm gonna
go control and I'm gonna click on
vertices and create whatever vertices
that I'd like to do and then close them
off and then I can go and select the
entire object and go F and there it is a
filled face alright so another way to
draw basically 2d vector graphic art
then of course we can turn into 3d
vector graphic art and now I want to
talk about our tool panel that we have
over here
talk about extrude and inset faces and
make edged faces subdivide loop cut
offsets slide edge duplicate well we
already covered and then spin to finish
off the entire tutorial so I'm gonna go
in here I'm gonna go X and vertices and
that's gonna delete that guy now let's
say that I would want to come in here
I'm gonna hold down the middle mouse
button get this guy right here hold down
the shift key and drag this over here so
I can look at this tube a little bit
different let's say I want to come in
here and grab these vertices I'm gonna
do it with a box and you can see those
right there and let's say I wanted to
extrude out another panel from that 2d
panel from it I could do that with
extrude so I can just go all to E or I
can click on extrude over there here I'm
just going to go alt + e
and edges only or vertices only I'm
gonna do edges only you can see I'm
gonna be able to basically create an
additional panel right like that so if
you wanted to have this look like a lid
on a box or something like that well
there you go okay so there that is and
of course you can then move these
extruded edges around I'm gonna show you
a more advanced extrude example here
later on the tutorial and you're also
going to be able to use extrude
individual to come in here and extrude
vertices edges faces and so forth I'm
gonna show you how subdivide works um
let's go and let's delete that all
together so we go X and vertices and
that's going
so let's come in and let's select this
guy so I'm going to right click on him
actually I'm gonna do a box select okay
so I got my whole entire cube selected
now subdivide what that's gonna do is
break it into additional cube so
subdivide see more cubes and there's
more cubes alright so kind of neat stuff
and you can see all the different cubes
there on your screen now I'm going to
hold down the middle mouse button with
shift and move this guy around because I
want to show you how inset faces works
so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna
select a whole bunch of different faces
and we come down here select face right
hold down the shift key select a whole
bunch of these you can do really neat
stuff here so select all these different
parts and I'm clicking on the right
mouse button if you can't see not what
I'm gonna be able to do is come in here
and inset those faces or basically move
this cube that I selected inwards and
have it still be tied in with the rest
of the cube that is part of it so really
cool stuff so I'm gonna go subdivide and
there it is
and now I'm gonna be able to come in
here and move everything around so I can
go and select it and move it in here on
the X plane or I'm gonna be able to move
it on the Y plane or on the z plane so
as you can see you can do all kinds of
really neat little selections with that
guy so pretty cool stuff and if you
would like to move around not on those
specific planes you can hold the control
key down you can press I once again and
then hold down your control key and that
would allow you to break it down even
further and do even cooler stuff okay so
pretty cool stuff and I'm pressing the
left mouse button to deselect that now
I'm going to do undo to walk myself back
out of this to the part
before I subdivided this whole entire
cube okay there we go
a to deselect it now let's say I would
want to make a face inside here
previously I wanted created three
vertices let's say that I would want to
go and make a face that goes from here
to here I can white once again I have
the versi selection tool down here
selected and I can go right click and
shift and right click and then shift and
right click and then press F and it's
gonna create a new face or I could have
came over here and clicked on make edge
face but I just pressed on F to do that
and that's another way to make a face
I'm also going to be able to use
subdivide so let's come in here and
let's go and select an edge right click
on that and subdivides gonna break it in
half
as you're gonna see right here press a
and there's going to be a vertice right
there inside of there and if I click on
diversity tool say there it is right
there
and I showed you subdivide before forgot
about that another thing that's neat is
you're gonna be able to use loop cut and
slide this guy over here loop cut and
slide and the shortcut is ctrl R on that
I'm usually gonna use that let's say
that I would want to put a bar or an
edge it goes the whole way around this I
can do that I'm first off going to
select a vertice so let's go and create
this guy right here and then going to go
ctrl R and that's going to create this
basically these edges you have right
here and I'm gonna click with the left
mouse button to set and then I can move
up and down inside of there and then
whenever I find a position where I want
it to go I press that button and it is
set and if I go and round about this
you're gonna see that the edge went the
whole way around that face messed the
other thing up but either way you can
see that that's a way that we can go in
there and create edges that go the whole
way around your three-dimensional object
so that's kind of cool and likewise
let's say we want to come in here and
grab this edge that we have right here
we're going to be able to go ctrl shift
our ctrl shift + R and that's going to
create a draggable edge that we're going
to be able to put here on our screen as
well and there we go click on left
button whenever we want to stop that + a
to deselect and the last thing I want to
do is I want to cover both spin as well
as the Bezier tool and also how to use
images
to be able to create shapes so I'm gonna
jump back over to object mode by
clicking on tab and I am going to just
delete this altogether somebody go X and
X and delete and that's going now what I
want to do if I want to draw a shape
using a reference photo I'm going to use
a glass what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to jump into front ortho so I'm gonna go
1 and I'm in front ortho right there if
I want to bring in some artwork I'm
gonna come over here to background
images open that up click on add image
and then open I'm gonna find the image I
want to use you can use pangs JPEGs
whatever just double-click on it
and you're gonna see it appears right
there I am going to hold down my shift
key and my middle mouse button and bring
that in there I'm gonna hold down
control and the middle mouse button to
zoom out and let's move it up a little
bit and shift and move it up a little
bit now that I have my glass inside of
here I'm going to go and use a Bezier
tool to draw the outline of it and then
spin it around and create the glass so I
am in object mode currently and I'm
gonna go shift and a and what I want is
a curve and a Bezier curve to be that's
what I'm looking for and how what I want
to do is it's like a flat line so to be
able to see it I'm gonna go R and X plus
90 and that's going to make it appear as
a curve on the screen that I can
actually see and move around and i'ma
press the left mouse button to sort of
lock it and now I'm gonna go over into
edit mode by clicking on tab and you're
going to see here the lines are going to
show you what direction the curves and
you go in I'm gonna grab the very end of
it here and drag it up here I'm going to
do this really quickly I'm going to left
to set it right to grab it left to set
it all right so let's just come down
inside of here and set it then I'm gonna
use the right mouse button to go in and
grab the handles to create the actual
curve and if I want to go and add
another curve to this I'm going to
select as a very last dot inside of the
curve and go e to extend and drag this
down here so let's say I want it to be
like right around here left to set it
once again grab the handle with the rice
Mouse but
and approximate whether I want that to
be left to set it come back up here drag
it back into position approximating
everything here trying to do it a little
bit quicker and if you don't like those
arrows you can come over here to where
it says normals check that and now
they're gone and you come in and do
another one so II let's go and create
another curve let's say like right like
that
and grab this guy right here and that
looks about good and then grab this last
curve here and extend it and let's bring
it down to right about there the bottom
of the glass and let's go and drag it
into place set with the left mouse
button
I'm gonna grab with the right set with
the left and there we go all right so
there we go as an outline of the outer
edge of our glass alright that looks
pretty good let's set it here with a
handle drag that inside of there alright
it's a pretty good okay so there's our
glass or our approximation of our glass
now what I want to do is I want to
select everything inside of here so I'm
gonna go a to select everything I'm
gonna go into object mode now so tab
once again what I want to do is turn the
curve into a mesh so I have everything
selected and I'm gonna go down here and
I'm gonna press Alt + C and that's going
to convert - you can see here mesh from
curve it's a curve now it's a mesh and
that's an object mode now I'm gonna go
back into edit mode with tab select
everything then we go e for extrude and
I'm going to create an extrusion so it's
gonna become 3-dimensional shape okay so
there that is I'm just gonna move it in
a little bit left to set it they don't
want to do a select all make sure I have
everything selected now I'm gonna switch
back into the top view so I'm gonna
press 7 to do that now I want to make
sure that I have everything so that it
will spin around a center point that
makes sense so I'm gonna come down here
where it says mesh click on mesh snap
and cursor to Center click on that once
again everything is selected and we come
down here to where it says spin click on
spin and when I say whenever I do that
you're gonna see that it went and
created it you're also going to see down
here that says 360 degree angle and step
is going to define
how rough it is so if I increase the
steps it's going to become less rough
and more round I'm then gonna be able to
come in here and with the middle mouse
button go and drag it and there you go
now it's a glass another thing you want
to do is let's select a to select all
and you want to get rid of any doubles
or overlays that you might have so with
everything selected you're going to go
double or W and then come down here
where it says remove doubles and click
on that and you can see it removed
ninety-eight vertices so there are a
whole bunch of different ways that we
can go and do all kinds of really cool
things in blender I think I taught
enough that you'll be able to go in
there and pretty comfortably be able to
mess around and create objects on your
own and of course this tutorial is gonna
continue into multiple different parts
until I've covered pretty much
everything you guys want to say so like
always please leave your questions and
comments below of the last till next
