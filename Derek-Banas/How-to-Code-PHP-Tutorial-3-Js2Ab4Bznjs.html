how to code PHP tutorial this is part 3
today I'm going to cover switch for
while do-while and how to include files
in your PHP code if you must perform
long if conditional tests you may prefer
to use a switch conditional test the
switch conditional test checks the value
it is passed for equality to predefined
values and then performs the most
appropriate set of statements here is
the basic format of PHP switch statement
here you pass the switch statement a
variable no condition is performed
within the brackets that perceive the
switch keyword then we check if the
value of that variable is equal to the
value that precedes the case statement
if it does then the actions that follow
are executed until the break statement
is executed the break statement moves
execution of statements out of whatever
loop that is currently executed so if
the above variable value equals value 1
then variable will never be checked for
equality to value to another concept you
have to understand about the switch
statement is the keyword default here
you are just defining the default action
if the variable that was passed didn't
equal any of the predefined values I
should note however you do not need to
have a default here's a real-world
example on how you would use the switch
statement you see here how you could
check for multiple values as well
through the use of stacking case
statements like I did above for values
of 2 or 3 every programming language
provides programmers with the ability to
perform tasks repetitively as long as
certain conditions are met the PHP
engine provides you with for looping
tools being the for while do Wow and for
each here's the basic structure of the
for loop this code would print numbers 1
through 20 to the browser to use a for
loop you first type the keyword for
inside of the brackets you first have to
create and assign a value to a variable
in this case I
this value will be manipulated in some
way to decide how long you will loop
through the statements that lie between
the curly braces you see that we are
going to add one to the variable I each
time we loop through with the iterator
shortcut after we assign an initial
value to I we define how long we will
loop with some conditional statement in
this case till the variable I is less
than or equal to 20 a while loop can be
used in much the same way as the for
loop here is its basic structure this
like the for loop prints the numbers 1
through 20 to the browser to create a
while loop you must define the
conditions under which you will perform
the actions between the curly braces you
can see the iterating statement is found
within the body of the loop you would
use a do-while loop when you want to
guarantee the statements within the
curly braces are executed at least one
time this is guaranteed because the
condition is checked after the first
iteration here is the structure of a
do-while loop here we will first run
through all the statements between curly
braces the last statement iterates the
variable I and we check if the required
conditions are being met and whether we
should continue looping with the
statement while followed by inside of
brackets the variable I followed by less
than or equal to 20 most of the time you
will pull PHP code into your web pages
instead of typing them indirectly the
reason why is because over time you will
reuse code you or others have written
and you also like to link to outside
code for security and organizational
reasons when you include this outside
code you are taking all the content of
the included code and dropping it
directly into your HTML code you can
include code with the following two
statements here I am going to use the
require once code and it grabs and
places the code into the web page and
then I'm using the include once function
and it'll make sure the code isn't
accidentally inserted more than one time
well that's the end of part three of my
how to code PHP tutorial join me next
time
I will go over functions to describe to
you what scope means cover date and time
functions built into PHP and cover a
whole bunch about databases until next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
