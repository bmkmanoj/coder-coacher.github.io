1 of my tutorial in which I will teach
you how to make an image gallery just
like you see right here on your screen
and this image gallery will hold nearly
any size of an image as you can see here
you can also click on the image to cycle
forward and there's a gigantic image you
may not necessarily ever use that but
either way it has that capability and it
also can embed movies which is really
cool and there's also a previous button
all these other things and of course a
close button this is part 4 of my from
scratch series in which I show you how
to do really cool things from scratch
that as far as I can tell no one has
ever done in a video tutorial I provide
on the screen part 1 2 and 3 of the from
scratch tutorials in which I show you
how to create a wordpress theme a
wordpress plugin a featured content
slider and today an image gallery so
let's jump right into the code in this
part of the tutorial I'm going to show
you all the HTML and the CSS code that
goes into creating this guy and then in
the next part of the tutorial I'm gonna
put all the jQuery code and JavaScript
code together and then by the end you
will have exactly what you saw
previously on the screen if you want all
of the code right now there's a link to
the code in the underbar and of course
it's 100% free so you see right here I
have just basic HTML I just put that in
there to save myself a little bit of
time then I'm gonna link out to my
stylesheet and just plug in the
reference to it and I'm calling it
lightbox style dot CSS and eventually
I'm going to turn this into a wordpress
plugin as well to really beef up the
capabilities of my featured content
slider that we made previously and then
I'm gonna link out to the jQuery
JavaScript code dot J yes it's in a
folder called J s slash there and I'm
gonna call this lightbox J s code dot KS
and then close that off and actually
before this guy I'm going to come in
here and I'm gonna put in my link to the
jQuery code and I'm just gonna copy this
and I'm gonna jump over and actually
grab this one I have to type it all out
and there is the actual location of the
jQuery library I'm gonna be using I'm
gonna be using the framework that is
provided by Google and then I'm going to
close off my
head section and jump into the body
section and the first thing I have to do
is create the length that's going to
open up the image or media library or
gallery whatever you want to call it so
I'm gonna give it a class of open
lightbox and then I'm just going to give
it an empty reference here because when
people choose to click on that it's
actually going to be handled by jQuery
and I'm gonna do is come in here and
create a div of class equal to lightbox
panel and lightbox panel is going to be
the guy that surrounds everything here
this ugly thing over here
this is lightbox panel right here and
then this background that's dark this is
called lightbox background and we're
gonna get into that a second let's give
myself some room and then right here
what we're gonna do is I'm gonna just
start coming in and defining everything
that I want to show up inside here and
this can be made dynamic so that these
images will be pulled based off of other
preferences that you might set so this
isn't set in stone this is what I'm
using here and it doesn't matter if it's
an image or what it is because I'm doing
all my jQuery changes based off of the
class name that's the reason why we can
use pretty much any type of thing in
here it's loading anything with ntt
media files all just for the heck of it
and then close that off and what you
want to do is make sure that you do have
this display whenever you first start
out this is gonna be your first image
that's going to show up inside of
lightbox panel whenever it is opened but
for everything that follows thereafter
like I have another one called shaking
hands I'm gonna define the style for
shaking hands is equal to display colon
and bow any fun so it's not going to be
displayed on the screen and then I'm
gonna change the alt text to shaking
hands and you can see exactly what's
going on here if I go back to the
original one there's the 8 and there
shaking hands so that's how those are
gonna operate and then for every other
image that I want to be displayed in
that light box I use exactly the same
layout display:none I don't want it to
show until I tell it to show I want the
class to stay the same and the alt
doesn't even matter you can have it be
anything you want it to be so I have
another file called penguin and I can
let everything else be precisely the
same penguin veggies and I think you get
the point you can
get all the code if you want it in the
underbar like I said before so I'm just
gonna proceed here and after all those
have been defined I have to come in and
place all of my buttons that I have at
the bottom of the screen like the
previous and next buttons and the close
buttons so I'm gonna create a new div
and I'm gonna call it NTT Greve yes
button and I'm actually gonna grab that
copy it and the source for my previous
button I'm actually using a file that I
used before in the future content tool
called FC left arrow the class name is
going to be changed to previews media
meaning I want to show the previous
media alt text is gonna say yes previous
media item and because I always want the
previous arrow to show up if the
lightbox panel is opened I want to take
style display:none out of there
that way it'll show if that ever shows
on the screen and then I just have to
come in here and close this div and then
I'm actually gonna copy this for my next
button if you don't know what I mean
this right here is the previous button
and this is the next button so this is
going to change to NTT next button this
is trying to change too right this is
going to change to next it next media
item everything else will stay the same
so then all I have to do is come in here
and create the close button and I'm
gonna call this NTT close and of course
make sure that I put ping inside of here
because it's a ping file this is called
NTT close button dot pane and this I
have assigned as an ID you use IDs when
you're 100% certain you're never gonna
have to define another button like this
and I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna need
another closed button so I put that in
there and I could technically do it for
all the other ones but I know it's good
practice to always use IDs whenever you
can either way and then you want to
close the div that's gonna surround
everything and whenever you have a big
deal like this it's always nice like
lightbox panel it's always nice to put a
little comment at the end so that you
know where that div ends exactly what I
did and then I need to define the
lightbox background that's the part
that's going to be dark and then close
that div and then close the body all
together and close HTML all together
that is all that is required to make
this guy work HTML wise so now I'll jump
over into the CSS code and right
all that out for you first thing I'm
going to do is remember I defined this
as an ID I'm gonna create light box
background and if you forgot ID means
there's only gonna be one of them ever
on the screen an ID you're not quite
certain if that's gonna be true well I
want to display none on this guy meaning
it's gonna be on the screen but it's not
gonna be displayed for anybody to see it
I want to give it a background color
black because I want it to be dark
otherwise why do it when it comes on the
screen I want the opacity to be 90% so
that you can kind of see the background
because that's just been the way that
people do light boxes I want to position
it absolutely meaning I'm gonna define
exactly where the potential position is
going to be so I'm going to have it
start off in the very very top left
corner and that's how you define that
and I'm gonna have the minimum width be
defined as a hundred percent meaning the
minimum width is going to be the whole
entire browser window I'm gonna have
this behind a percent and then the
z-index is going to say that I want this
guy to be at the very very very talk
that I wanted to go ahead of everything
else that's on the web page so I'm
defining it as 1001 and that's it that's
the background meaning this part right
here this dark part that covers the
entire window all right so I go to
create the panel the part that actually
holds all of our content and I called it
lightbox
panel again I want to display on don't
want it to show up I want to position it
absolutely I want to have it set at 22%
from the top which is just the way that
it ended up working you might decide you
want to change those that's fine change
anything you want I don't care I'm gonna
give it a default width of 425 pixels
background color again you can change
any of these things it's gonna be white
padding which you don't know is this
area inside of here this area is margin
this is padding so that's the difference
or clean that I'm gonna say that I want
that to be 15 pixels the whole way
around and then I'm gonna say that I
want the bottom padding to be 50 pixels
just so I have room for all the buttons
that I made and then I want to create a
border of two pixels and I want it to be
solid and I want it to be black and then
z-index if I want this to show up above
the light box background I got to make
it bigger than it so I'm gonna make it
one thousand two
and I set up text-align to be Center
yeah I'm gonna leave it that way
and I'm going to say overflow is going
to be equal to hidden that means that
it's not never gonna happen but it
basically means even though this image
right here is bigger than the
surrounding area I don't want to open up
a scrollbar so you can see the whole
image you might change your mind want to
do that
I'm basically saying that even though
the image continues I want it to end
down here and like I said you would
never put your ganic images in something
like this but I just set it up so that
it could handle that situation if it
came up and also I'm gonna define a max
height so that it always remains on the
screen of 500 pixels and a max width of
800 pixels and that just makes sure
everything stays on the screen and then
that's done that's all the CSS code you
need for that whole entire panel to
close that out myself some room and then
I have to define the CSS code for the
button the close button specifically and
this is gonna be real simple we're just
gonna say display:none I don't want it
to show up on the screen till I tell it
to and I want it to position absolutely
and I'm gonna say that I want it to be
from the bottom 10 pixels and from the
right 15 pixels a lot of people don't
know that you can actually define
bottoms and rights for absolute
positioning and then save himself some
time and a copy this paste it paste it
again and then I'm gonna define my next
button this is gonna say none this is
gonna be absolute
this is gonna be bottom I'm gonna change
this the left and I'm gonna have this be
50 pixels cuz I have to make room for
the previous button and that's it and
then I have to come in here and define
the previous button and it's gonna be 10
from the bottom and from the left it's
going to be 15 pixels and if you do all
that with all the jQuery code that's
going to be in the next tutorial you
will have this nice little image media
gallery that can do pretty much anything
you want even play movies give any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below if I already have
the next part of the tutorial there will
be a link provided above otherwise till
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
