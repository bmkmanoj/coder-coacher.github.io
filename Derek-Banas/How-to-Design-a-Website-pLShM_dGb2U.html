tutorial on how to design a website I've
gotten this request numerous times my
number one fan requests to it so I
figured I best do it what I'm gonna do
here is should start right here from
this rough sketch that took me about ten
minutes to throw together and by the end
show you a completed design all right
when I design a website basically what I
think about our features that are needed
not necessarily designed like a lot of
people do so whenever the client comes
to me and basically says okay well I
want the person to be able to easily
access about us contact us and all that
different information that means to me
basically separate it from all the other
menu items especially since it's going
to be a shopping cart application I want
this menu over here which is a vertical
menu to point to all of the individual
little quadrants the different types of
products that are sellable on this
website now in a previous tutorial I
showed you how to make this a vertical
menu and I'm going to use that in the
design here coming up then on top of
that when a client says they want to be
able to sell featured items which means
push of products that they have too many
of out the door well that immediately
tells me I need a featured content tool
well luckily I also showed you how to
create one of those guys and here it is
I'm going to use a different version of
this but this is basically what we're
going to be using then on top of that
they want to be able to show all the
products in the shopping cart that means
I need a bunch of boxes all over the
place to be able to show different
information this is going to act as a
search tool right here and you're very
often going to hear a client say they
don't want a lot of scrolling on the
website what that ends up meaning is if
you're going to be displaying a lot of
pictures you need to create a vertical
slider which is in essence what this is
and if there's going to be a lot of
pictures and text that means you're
gonna have to use a tabbed interface
well I also if you watch these videos
created a little tool here that allows
them to slide through numerous different
products and as well easily add them to
the court which is the reason why that
information is on there and of course
there's going to be more than just hands
for sale on this site when it's all
finished so that's basically what I was
thinking about with this overall design
and I just roughly sketch in everything
it's not meant to be anything finished
then what I used to do is I used to
collect pictures or little interfaces
from other websites in here or it's a
whole bunch of sites that I think look
really really nice and every time that I
saw like a little interface or a little
use of typography that
thought was especially nice what I would
do is I would throw it into illustrator
redraw it and then I would create
hundreds of these things well over time
it started become very very tedious and
then I found a tool called artist er now
everything I do in this tutorial you can
do with just the free downloadable trial
version of artistry which is basically
try to figure out what you find your
final design to look like that's what my
goal is and that's what I use artist er
for I don't use it for creating themes I
use it to design everything and then I
create the theme from scratch and
basically what I do is the client
basically said to me that they want the
header section to have the menu system
just like you see it on the left side
side of the screen and they want
everything to go off the screen so they
don't want everything to be contained so
that's under design layout I'm going to
create it so that the menu shows up on
top and then this guy fills in after
that and there you can see it did that
then the screen width is going to be a
thousand pixels but that's already set
if you can't see this what should full
screen then also in the footer section
I'm going to want everything defined as
page width so just like that now the
whole entire site just changed which is
really really cool and it's great to
just be able to tinker with this it's
sort of like a puzzle you can just put
together in regards to the background
you see I didn't do anything with a
background over here well you can click
inside of here and it'll show you
hundreds of potential backgrounds Oh
being that I understand how our store
works I kind of thought I wanted to do
something like a blueprint or something
along those lines so I'm just scrolling
through all the different potential
backgrounds that are available to me and
after I do this for a little bit I see
something that kind of looks like a
blueprint I don't want this to be really
obvious otherwise it just ends up being
in gaudy well then I'm going to come in
to fill colors and I because I have to
have the whole entire site be blue and
white because that's the way it's
supposed to be I'm just going to come in
and pick that and let's also come in
under gradient and say we like this idea
again I'm just playing around that's the
whole point of this alright and for now
that looks kind of good to me I could
lighten up but just to move this along
that so I'm going to leave it I'm going
to go into the menu section basically
everything here is looking pretty good
but under styling I'm going to want
everything to align to the right side of
the screen because that's what I did on
the left side design this over here and
there you see that goes in real nice and
why
here why don't I jump over into colors
and fonts and let's say that I want to
use a fancier font this is actually a
Google web font this is under font
sentence that I'm clicking on here
basically what I'm going to say is my
heading font I want to use PT sans it
allows you to use anything you want as
long as it's a web font it'll show up on
anybody's site as long as you set up
everything properly all right so let's
choose PT sans and my text font what the
heck I'm going to do the same thing with
it and there's PTC ends all right click
OK and across the whole entire design it
just changed everything for you looks a
little bit more interesting then we jump
back into the menu section I'm going to
fix up everything inside of here so
under fill' I don't want to use grey
because that's just horribly boring so
let's go in here for more colors and I'd
like to lean more towards a dark
whenever I'm using like a blue like this
let's go over here into that click OK
and then I'm going to come down here a
menu bar click on gradient and I like
the light glare sort of look there that
is then let's come over here into the
fill section and active I definitely do
not like this orange so we're going to
get rid of that and I like to lean more
towards subtlety so just come in here
again under active more colors let's
just make it a little bit lighter
nothing terrible because I want it to be
subtle I don't want a border on it cuz
that's just silly the border
there you guys there's a little tiny bit
of a highlight on it we got our blue
there hovered I really see no reason to
change it so I'm just going to leave it
that way then over here on the fill I
definitely don't want it to be orange so
let's just come in here to actually
choose the dark and then for hovered
let's use the lighter color and for the
overall border basically going to do the
same sort of thing over there we go and
for text make that a white X hovered I'm
also going to make that way there's
something else that you might want to do
I mean there's so many different things
you can play with inside of here under
submenu if you want to increase the
overall size of your menu making it
longer or taller or whatever you want to
do you can change the whole entire thing
that's simply and there you see this is
hovered and it's brown that's horrible
active let's just have everything be
white and you can see it's a pretty
classy looking overall design for a menu
system something else that I might want
to do just because I think it makes more
sense in this situation is under font
options I'm going to come in here and
I'm
to force everything to be all caps see
how that looks big for a menu system it
kind of looks a little bit better and I
think it does so let's do the same thing
for the sub menus again text on options
all caps and hit OK now I'm pretty happy
with the overall menu system song we'll
leave it the way it is again this is
just so I can do a mock-up so I'm going
to start jumping down into the header
section fixing everything in there now I
almost always want the headline to be
real text to be the website name but in
this situation is just knocking I work
for me so I'm going to get rid of it at
least for now who knows what I'll do
later on then if I have the actual logo
inside of here and I want to position it
I just go over here where it says photo
and from file by menu I always use ping
files and of course it's transparent
it's going to place it inside of there
then I'm going to click on position and
I'm just going to grab this I could just
do left the line but I'm gonna leave it
this way then shrink the overall size
because that's way too gaudy and it okay
there we are then we can go into
position again and we're going to do an
align left and it aligns it left so that
looks nice I'm going to come into the
fill color and I'm going to choose the
really dark blue like I had before all
right and then we'll come down into
effects and if I want to put those
little lines inside of there it's no
problem I just come down into a textures
then I search through all these
different available options until I find
design this sort of looks like what I'm
going for
drift my mouse over top of it see if
it's going to work might it might not
looking pretty good why don't we check
this one out over here and that right
there is pretty much exactly what I want
then of course you can change different
transparencies and other different
effects inside of here but for now I'm
kind of liking the way this is so now
we'll go back over into the vertical
menu want to start editing that I just
click on vertical menu again I'm not
going to use this when the final site
but I just want to get a rough idea what
I'm working with here and yet so then
you block let's come over here see what
the different looks would be an atom
liking okay so I'm going to leave it
that way then for fill I'm thinking that
I want this to be dark blue again I
think somebody'd have to be pretty much
be a simpleton to not understand that
this is a menu system so I'm going to
get rid of this vertical menu that's up
here okay so that's looking better back
over in the film active I definitely do
not want it to be that orange want it to
be that light blue again I try to keep
my palette very very limited I see no
reason to use 50 million different
colors
do the same thing for the
active text as well as the hover text
and come in here for border passive I'll
make it be white because that's what I
had an original idea over here on the
left side get active doing it same thing
that'd be white and then hovered have it
be white and I'm looking at this and
yeah submenus I definitely also want
those fills to change passive let's just
have it be a dark you can see I'm
basically doing the same thing active
I'm going to have that be the lighter
blue and then hovered let's have that be
actually its try this blue here okay so
basically that's coming together then
what I should have done originally was
for my overall layout I went this guy to
be three columns so I just click on
layout I'm going to click on columns and
I'm going to come down here and choose
the three columns so that there's a
column on the left side as well as it's
on the right side okay looks fine
let's scroll down to the footer see if
there's anything needs to be done down
here I don't normally worry that much
about the footer I basically just wanted
to not look horrible and it kind of
looks horrible okay so let's fix it so
I'm going to scroll down go into the
footer section and do a fill choose my
dark blue okay and my texture you can
insert textures from files and it's cool
that they allow you to do all this stuff
without actually purchasing it and there
is the simple diagonal that I used above
so I used it there again alright so in
general that's looking pretty good
alright so for my sidebar items I'm
going to divide them up I'm going to go
here on the screen and sort of keep
everything separate from each other this
is something again I might change later
but because I did it on the left side of
screen I like to stick to that sort of
idea so come in here under block Styles
pop this guy up and I'm looking for
something it's very close to what I have
on the left side of the screen it's
looking kind of sharp except for the
orange of course it's a little bit too
much I'm actually gonna go with this and
then for the Hatter the text is fine
however the fill is definitely going to
be the dark blue again and also I'm not
digging the border with a border color
anyway I'm gonna leave the border in
there but I'm gonna let it people oh I
kind of like that gray sort of idea
there and another things kind of neat I
can go in here to a sheet and go into
transparency and let's say I want some
of that background to show through on
this let's see what it looks like if I
take it to 40% and sheet being the whole
entire thing you see here on the screen
okay let's say 50%
thinking I'm gonna light in this
background that's what I'm digging here
alright so let's try that out and then
we'll jump into the background itself
and will lighten it but it's too dark so
color will get more colors and let's
lighten this guy up and see if it
doesn't look a little bit more like a
blueprint and also doesn't distract from
the text let's jump in here to the blue
a little bit more alright that's
starting to look a little bit more like
what I'm looking for
and then hit OK and of course I can come
in here and play around this all day and
night until I get it exactly the way I
want it but like I said I'm just trying
to get myself a really nice clean
looking mock-up as quickly as possible
so what I'm going to do now is I'm going
to do a screen grab and I can do capture
whatever it's up to you if you're on a
Mac or a PC I just trust you now to do a
screen grab if you guys are smart I'm
sure you do I'm going to copy this guy
and then I have illustrator setup in the
background like I've said numerous times
before Inkscape is very similar to
illustrator if you can't afford
illustrator and you can do all this in
inscape so let's jump into illustrator
and here I'm going to open up a new guy
here and it's a thousand pixels and wet
then I'm just going to show you roughly
how I everything together so let's size
this down so it is thousand in width and
all those little things that I showed
you previously I'm going to start using
them very least me use this guy okay so
I need to shrink it down to its actual
size grab capture copy that back in
Illustrator paste that inside of there
and I also want to come in here file
place put in an image in here
temporarily that's gonna be used to give
me an idea of where I want to put my
featured content and grab this stand-in
for the featured content part line it up
right there so basically the way it's
going to line up on the website of
course there's going to be a margin and
then I can throw in the scrolling part
of this give me a very very good idea of
what the site is going to look like when
it's all set up and I also can see
things that are going to be a problem if
the featured content is going to have to
be a little bit smaller than I
originally designed it and then of
course I'm going to want to make another
copy of this scroller and there you go
now that's a basic run-through of how I
would design a website and of course I'd
cut out this interior part here and all
that but with this I can now go in here
with my rulers and everything is lined
up to a thousand pixels and say I want
to figure out okay well when I design a
site how
why'd is the menu bar system and then I
can take these little rulers and drag
them out and they'll know exactly how
big to make that I come over here on the
left side of screen grab the measure
tool and I can measure all these
individual pieces and I know now that my
vertical menu is going to be right
around 185 pixels and then I can measure
all these other different things so
that's a basic run-through of how I
design websites leave any questions or
comments by the last till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
