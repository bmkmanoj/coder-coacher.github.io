14 of my android development tutorial
today we are going to completely finish
the Android address book app and on top
of that I'm going to show you how to
import Android packages which I probably
should have did in the past never
thought of it but you guys asked for it
so I'm going to show you that as well
also going to show you how to clean up
our layout a little bit by digging into
some of the functions available to us in
XML with Android and if you haven't seen
any of the previous tutorials I've read
a link to those in the upper right hand
corner and the code is available in the
description for this video and another
thing I wanted to address because it
comes up all the time is you guys asking
for homework one thing you could
definitely do especially in projects
like this where I create an address book
or create any app step by step video by
video is very often all of the
techniques you need to create the next
part of the app like we're going to do
here in Android part 14 are taught in
the previous tutorial so if you wanted
to practice you could definitely figure
out how to solve the problem of how to
edit contacts like we're gonna cover in
this part of the tutorial by referring
to techniques in part 13 so there's just
some ideas and some things that have
come up I have a lot to do so let's get
into it okay so here we are what we're
going to do in this tutorial is show you
how to make this guy right here fully
functional which is going to allow you
to edit your contacts and one problem we
have here is I don't know if you've
noticed or not but this button right
here is smaller than this button and
that just looks god-awful terrible so
what I'm going to show you is how easy
it is to fix that so we're going to go
down here into the actual XML file and
we're going to come down until we get to
the point where we find our buttons
which are way at the bottom then what
we're going to do is in the width area
right here we are going to change this
to zero
di P and what di P stands for is
density-independent pixels and basically
we use di P so that we were able to
allow automatic scaling regardless of
screen resolution or pixel density of
the device and the reason why we're
going to
change this to 0 D IP is because this is
going to force weight to determine the
width of our button in this situation so
we're going to come down here again to
this width area change this to d IP and
once again the weight that we have here
what that's going to define for us is
how much of the total width available
our little component is going to take up
so if we say this one gets a weight of 1
and this one gets a layout-- weight of 1
that means that they should receive
equal amounts of space so let's save
that go into the graphical layout and
now you can see that our buttons are
perfectly aligned so there's a little
trick now what we're going to do is go
into edit contact Java and finish this
application so here we are in edit
contact dot Java and I went and put the
package in there ahead of time and what
we're going to do is go public class and
this is going to be called edit contact
and it's going to extend activity
because it is an activity and then along
the way I'm just going to come in here
and get all the libraries that I'm going
to be needing import library and
hopefully if you've watched this far in
this tutorial you're really starting to
understand how things work then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to get all my
edit text components here so that I will
be able to go in and pull information
from them and add information to them
I'm gonna need 4 more of these guys and
of course we're going to have last name
phone number email address and home
address and now that we have those set
up we're going to have to go get all our
database tools that are available to us
because we created those previously so
we're going to go DB tools I'm just
going to call it DB tools as it with a
new DB tools and pass in to this and
then we have to come in here and define
oncreate which is going to set up
everything whenever the activity is
displayed public void on create saved
instance state and this guy is just
going to hold all of those different key
value pairs that we want to save in
situations in which our data may be
deleted in theirs
and of course we have to get that
library as well then we're going to call
the super to get to save data if there
is any and then we're going to set our
content view and it is going to be equal
to layout dot edit contact and that is
just a reference to this XML file that
we have up here say edit contact XML
that's what we're referring to and then
we need to actually get our edit text
objects from here I'm just going to copy
this and I'm just going to do it this
way and to get these we're going to go
edit text cast that and then we're going
to find view by ID and then we're going
to go r dot ID first name and that guy
right there is coming from this click on
this editable text area and if we come
over here you can see first name there
it is another thing keeps coming up and
people are getting our errors inside of
Eclipse just want to cover this all you
got to do is go into project like this
and then come down here and click on
clean and that should make that problem
go away
another there is another reason why you
get those though sometimes in layout if
you have anything in these files inside
of here that have uppercase letters for
the filenames that can sometimes cause
that air as well so those are just some
things to think about as well as inside
of values say these are all lowercase as
well so those are two reasons why you
might be getting those are errors that
I've been seeing a lot of that's why
it's good to ask me questions because I
try to address them in the tutorials
okay and then we'll go last name and
last name phone number phone number
email address email address and then
finally home address just referring to
the names that are in the XML file now
that I have that set up what I'm going
to do is create an intent and like I
said for an intent defines that an
operation is going to be preformed I'm
going to call this intent intent
get intent and get intent it's just
going to return the activity that
started this activity come in here
get those libraries again then we're
going to create a string and it's going
to be name contact ID and what we're
going to do is we're going to get the
extended data that was provided to this
activity whenever it was called and if
you don't remember that let's go back
over into main activity open that up and
we're specifically looking for put extra
see right here there it is and that's
the reason why we were getting the
previous intent that called this because
contact ID was stored inside of here and
if we come back over into here you can
see that's exactly what we're going to
be getting so to get that information
we're going to go the intent get string
extra and that's going to get us the
contact ID that was added on to that
whenever this activity was called so
that's another way of passing
information between activities and now
that we have that we're going to create
a hashmap string string and this is
going to be called contact list and to
get our contact list we're going to go
DB tools get contact info and to get it
we need to pass the contact ID inside of
it so let's come over here get contact
info and if we scroll down we can see
right here string being the contact ID
is passed in here and then we are going
to run in SQL query using that ID to get
all of that raw data from our database
so pretty cool so now we're back inside
of here first thing we want to do is
make sure there is something in our
contact list that was returned to us
inside of our hash map so we're going to
go contact list and check the size and
make sure it's not equal to zero
and if it wasn't equal to zero we want
to put the values that it returned into
our edit text boxes so we're going to go
first name set text contact list dot get
and their key value pairs so I have to
enter the specific key now I just gave
everything the same name because I
thought that would be easy so I just say
the key is first-name hey go get me
whatever the value is and of course this
needs to be uppercase and then we can I
need a whole bunch of these because
we're all Sunni at the last name last
name phone number phone number email
address
email address and home address and home
address there we go now we took all that
information and it was passed over in
hashmap and we are putting it into this
guy over here so these will all be
filled with the proper information and
that's all we're going to need to do
there we're gonna have to come in here
and actually edit these contacts so that
it contact and where this comes from
again let's go into edit contact XML
come into the actual XML data and you
can see right here where it says on
click Edit contact well this is going to
be the method that is going to be called
whenever this button is clicked and the
view is going to be passed inside of
there and we're gonna create another
hash map so I might as well just come up
here and get this guy right here so I'm
gonna type it out again and then this
guy is going to be called Quarry values
map new and then create that guy then
we're gonna have to get our edit text
objects again so I'm just gonna come up
here and get those guys right like this
and then paste those in they're going to
go and get that extra data that was
provided in regards to our contact ID
just like we did before so I'm going to
grab this guy paste that in there and
you know why we're getting that and then
what we're going to do is put the values
in the editable text boxes into our hash
map and to do that we're going to go put
contact ID and then the value that's
going to go inside of there well in this
situation we know what contact idea is
so we're going to throw that now like
that so we don't need to access that
editable text object here however first
name and to get the value in the
editable text area we're going to go
this first name dot get text and then
we're going to convert it into a string
and that's going to get that for us so
now all we have to do is do that for all
the editable text boxes so we're gonna
have to do it for last name as well
there we go
phone number email address and I
normally don't give everything exactly
the same name but in this situation it
just seemed to work so just remember
it's all up to you how you do this stuff
don't necessarily think there's always
an ironclad definite way of doing things
something makes more sense to you or if
you're working in a team and it makes
more sense to your team I say do
whatever
okay so database tools just make sure
that you comment heavily on what exactly
you're doing in case somebody else comes
along doesn't know what's going on
all right so update the contact pass in
query values map if we jump in the DB
tools da Java again can see update
contacts going to receive a hash map and
it's going to go through here and set
everything inside of our database which
is pretty cool
alright so we're back inside of here
again now after we've updated our
contact information we want to call for
the main activity to execute again so
we're just gonna go this call main
activity and pass in review and I'm
gonna create this guy call main activity
it's pretty much the same as you saw
before but I'm going to type it out
because there's been some questions
about things like intents and contexts
and things like that okay so this guy's
job all it is is to open up the main
activity that's it nothing else so to do
so we have to create an intent because
anytime we want to do something or have
the intention of doing something we have
to use an intent and then we're going to
pass into it get application now what
data application is going to do is it's
going to return an application object
which allows you to manage or allows
your program to manage your application
and respond to different actions and it
returns specifically the data type is an
application object which extends a
context object now a context is
important because it provides all kinds
of information on the environment your
application is currently running it and
it provides different services like how
to obtain access to a database which is
something that we're doing right here
and other different preferences that
would be usable and to really get into
it
Google says specifically that a context
which is what this guy is going to
ultimately return I know it's called
an application but it's ultimately a
context as well Google says a context is
an entity that represents various
environment data it provides access to
local files databases class loaders
associated the environment services
including system level services and more
so that is all the information on
context and specifically what is going
on here well
and we have to define the activity that
we want to actually execute and whenever
you want to do that if you want to
execute main activity like we did right
here if to follow that up with class and
that means that is what's going to
activate as long as you then follow that
up with start activity and then type in
object intent in this situation so that
is all it's doing it's saying hey go
start main activity and main activity is
this guy right here mainactivity.java
and that is what's going on okay so now
that we have that all settled the last
thing we're going to need to do is to
figure out how to remove contacts from
our address book database and I'm going
to call this remove contact and it's
also going to get a view view passed in
and of course that all comes from edit
contacts XML and specifically on click
remove contact okay so that's clicked
this is going to execute and then guess
what we're going to do we're going to
have to create ourselves another intent
and we're going to have to get the
contact ID just like that just like
before except this is pretty simple
paste that in there the whole goal here
is to get contact ID which is passed
along to this then we're going to go DB
tools dot delete contact and pass in our
contact ID and it will delete it from
our database and then what we're gonna
do is call main activity paste that in
there
file save everything's done let's
execute and here's Android all ready to
go and there you can see I already went
in here and put a couple different
contacts inside of here
but let's specifically test our guy
that's going to allow us to edit contact
and let's just call this guy face
instead of ACE face Adams and edit and
you can see change the face and let's
also come in here and delete Derek
delete and there you can see Derek's
going and just for the heck of it
because I never did this add and you can
put anything in here you'd like so let's
just say Pam Smith and I'm going to
provide the complete package for this
whole entire thing so you'll be able to
play around with it in a second here I'm
going to show you exactly how to load
the package I'll just say it's P at
aol.com and I'm just going to type in
main and save and there you can see Pam
Smith shows up inside of there so there
is everything that goes into making an
address book and also I think you can
pretty much do just about anything else
with SQL inside of Android now the final
thing I want to do for you is show you
how to import libraries because I get
this question all the time really simple
well first let's go get a library so I'm
just gonna go into my actual website I'm
gonna go download the Android stock
quote picker which we created earlier
and it's gonna download and then I'm
gonna go into my downloads and their
stock quotes zip and there that guy is
and here's stock quotes this folder over
here this is in my downloads folder now
if I want to import that information
inside of here I'm just going to close
all these windows all I need to do is go
into file and then I'm going to come
down to import click on import and then
this guy opens up here well then I'm
gonna go into general right here say
general and I'm going to click on
existing projects into workspace right
like that come down hit next and then
it's going to say select root directory
like it says right there and I'm gonna
click on browse I'm gonna find my
downloads folder so mine's Eric Bana say
Dada and there's downloads and there is
stuck loads that's the thing I just
downloaded the package I'm head open
then I'm gonna come down here make sure
this is checked right there and I hit
finish and there you go stock quotes
it's right there it's all ready to use
it's an Android project and everybody is
happy with that okay so there's a whole
bunch of different things we finish up
the address book
I'm actually not positive what the next
Android app will be but I'll do my best
to make it very nice it is probably
going to have something to do with
fragments because you guys have asked
for a fragment tutorials a bunch of
times so please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
