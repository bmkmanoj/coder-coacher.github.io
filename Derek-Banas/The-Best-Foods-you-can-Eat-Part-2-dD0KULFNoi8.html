of I'm not a nutritionist but I lost 35
pounds in two months however now the
diet is on its fourth month and I have
an actual reality loss 54 pounds today
what I'm gonna completely cover for you
is the precise foods that I have eaten I
think that I have completely honed this
diet and I now know precisely what to
eat and today I'm going to review an
infinitive list of the absolute best
foods period this was what my diet
consisted of before I started on my high
fiber low cholesterol low sodium diet on
average I consumed almost 3,000 calories
a day I was eating 32 percent more
calories than my body needed I was
eating 46 percent more fat than I should
I was eating three times the recommended
amount of sodium three times the amount
of cholesterol and nearly twice the
recommended amount of saturated fat
chances are your diet is very similar on
a percentage basis or maybe even worse
because I was a vegetarian on this diet
what I promise I can promise this
defendant definitely after losing 54
pounds you will lose weight on a
consistent basis you will eat food that
tastes great you'll be eating healthier
than you ever have you'll not have to
exercise I've not exercised over the
past four months unless you count me
following my wife around the mall you'll
be able to cook every meal in under 20
minutes I just want to briefly go over
this because I think it's extremely
important how do you make a healthy
recipe even healthier
first off replace oil with a third of a
second spray of Pam that's the only way
Pam is zero calories eliminate all the
salt and butter replace any meat cheese
grain pasta etc with a healthy one and
I'm gonna show you a whole bunch of them
so what is the absolute greatest after
searching through thousands of nutrition
labels the best high-fiber foods well
some of these technically aren't foods
or drink mixes number one on the list as
you can see here is all green raspberry
mix 15 calories 10 grams of fiber I'm
not going to go through
every single one of these if you want to
stop the video at any time and look at
them you could definitely do that here
are some additional high-fiber foods
that are the best and you can see here I
list the calorie count as well as the
overall fiber and the fiber is measured
in grams here's some more and some more
and all of this information is available
out on a website that I control called
new think-tank column which is 100% free
so if you want to get it there or you
could just pause the videos like I said
what are the best foods I went through
tons with your nutrition labels and here
are the best breads period do you wanted
to make your own bread what is the best
bread flour best cakes and bars went
through a ton of them this is what I
came up with and again this diet is
based off of maximizing fiber minimizing
calories and also of course lowering
sodium which is impossible to eliminate
or and as well eliminating cholesterol
and fat cookies I've tasted most things
on this list I'm not a particular cookie
guy kind of wiped that out of my diet
altogether crackers
and you can see here on the if you go
back to the previous videos that I have
had I tell you precisely how to figure
out how many calories you should be
consuming well right here I'm gonna have
a list for you with the calories you'll
know precisely how much to eat and how
many calories you'll be consuming each
time there's muffins and bagels drinks I
personally could not give up soda drinks
and Coke Zero is what I drink only thing
really bad about Coke Zero is well I
have no idea what those chemicals do to
you and the salt there it's the best
cereals best cheese most fast food
salads are okay obviously if the watch
out for what they put on and as well as
salad dressing fast food sandwiches to
shame Panera Bread and subway they've
gotten rid of a lot of these subway had
some fabulous wraps but they have ceased
to carry them our all oils the same
sorry to say yes they were all 100
percent of fact Pam spray is canola oil
and tamp spray it's only zero calories
if you spread it for one third of a
second the salad dressings and this is
based off of two tablespoons best fish
overall orange roughy is in my opinion
one of the most delicious fish you can
cook as well as being extremely healthy
fruit all nuts are bad almonds are the
best
but even almonds are 79 percent fat and
you can see here just from a copier
talking considerable number of calories
and they're almost all fat best poultry
some of these being the Morningstar
chicken strips
and the chicken burgers are actually not
real chicken but the chicken strips and
Winstar tastes to me exactly like
chicken chips condiments as you can see
there are zero calories for the eating
brown or yellow mustard apple cider soup
you have to only watch out really for
salt
that's why everything says no salt candy
and ice cream fruit blood poppelen are
kind of as a joke more than anything
else there are ice creams and they do
taste good pasta I have not had hospice
tofu shirataki spaghetti yet but I've
heard it's good and with the nutrition
label on it dynamite but I've eaten just
about everything else
grains egg substitutes I eat eggs
scrambled eggs with egg substitutes as
well as fiber-rich pancakes for dinner
all of the time
spices with fiber this is a place to get
fiber where he's probably never even
thought of it beef and pork i personally
don't eat it it's not for any reason
except i just don't have an inclination
to you want to eat beef and pork don't
like it i cut it out of my diet 100% you
can use eat it but you have to watch out
for fat cholesterol and sodium most meat
substitutes have considerable amounts of
sodium and i do have many recipes for
veggie burgers and tastes were really
good but they don't taste like me but
that guy's good here are the best beef
if you want to try and work that into
your diet best pork
what is the best for getting calcium
right here
orange juice fortified with calcium and
on and on what's the best way to put
protein eat your diet and not overwhelm
yourself with calories
soy protein spinach mushrooms artichokes
asparagus foods that make you feel full
went over this in a previous
presentation but I thought it'd be good
to included here my average meal bran
buds and fat-free skim milk high-fiber
slice of bread and blackberries I've
actually stopped eating the blackberries
just recently just gotten tired of them
then I have one cup of a healthy green
salad one cup each brussel sprouts
cauliflower broccoli squash
ba-da-da-da-da and then I have 707 our
free calories where I basically just eat
pretty much anything that's like high in
fat and it's low in sodium cholesterol
my average meal again here's some
statistics you can see and this is from
eating mostly what is on this list that
I just showed you how dramatically I've
lowered my fat cholesterol salt the only
thing I'm really going over on its carbs
and fiber and don't let anybody fully
into thinking carbs are bad those are
just people that don't know how to count
calories there's the rest of the
information problems with the diet you
will have a little bit of gas for first
couple weeks you really can't trust
restaurants I eat at restaurants though
have to go to health stores for a couple
things giving up frying is a little bit
of an issue I like fried food but don't
care anymore after four months care less
after about three weeks and of course
you're gonna have to continue to lower
your calories when I lose weight there's
a lot of other important information
especially on how to avoid starvation
and so forth which is extremely
important in other videos basically
comes down to how committed you are hope
that you enjoyed this video and pass it
along</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
