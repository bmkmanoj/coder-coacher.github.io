18 of my android development tutorial
today and over the course of the next
couple videos we're going to be building
a big application with a focus on
Android fragments now you guys seem to
be having some trouble with fragments so
I'm going to slowly build this app piece
by piece so that you completely
understand how they work now as I
mentioned before a fragment is a sort of
mini activity which you can add or
remove from another activity and what's
great about them is you'll be able to
use them to create reusable pieces that
you'll be able to add to your interface
and just like I demonstrated here what
we're going to be doing is making a
census app so what we're going to have
is a list of names we're going to be
entering as we add people to our little
database and then if you click on any of
those you're going to pull up all kinds
of information that you can change and
so forth as well as we're going to take
pictures of the people so that we have a
picture associated with the information
and we're going to use fragments in a
bunch of different ways but to start off
what we're going to try to do is change
the interface depending upon either the
screen size if we have a tablet or
what-have-you
or in the situation in which we have our
phone set to horizontal it will also
show all the information on one screen
but the very first thing I want to do is
create a custom icon and show you how
easy that is to do okay so whenever we
want to define a custom icon what we in
essence need to do is create a different
version for all of these different
folders so this would be a low or low
resolution version of our icon a medium
resolution higher definition extra high
definition and so forth and so on we're
basically going to ignore the low
resolution and just jump to mdpi which
is going to be defined as 48 by 48
pixels so if you want it your icon to
work in that situation you're going to
have to have it be 48 by 48 pixels the
hdpi folder is going to have a 72 by 72
version of your icon the X H dpi is
going to have a 96 by 96 pixel sized
icon and the extra extra H dpi is going
to have a
144 by 144 sighs pixeled icon so let's
go and create that icon so here I am
inside of Adobe Illustrator if you don't
have illustrator you could get in
Inkscape or GIMP or something like that
to create this and I just went and
plugged in this information here for us
and here I have a little Android EPS
file that I drew and I'm going to use
that as my icon so just to keep things
nice and simple I'm just going to come
over here and click in here and say that
I want to create a rectangle then I'm
going to click here and then inside of
these boxes well if I get that I'm going
to have to go up here and define pixels
there we go and now I'll be able to
define a pixel and there you can see I'm
going to just come in here and because I
want it to work for all of my different
resolutions I'm going to make this 144
and make this 144 and hit OK that's
going to create a little box here for us
and I'm just going to say that I'm not
really particularly interested in what's
going inside here I just want to
properly size my icon so I am going to
change this to black it doesn't really
matter and then change this to nothing
so that we don't have anything get in
the way and then I'm just going to grab
my little icon here and drag it over
inside of my box and make sure that it
is roughly the proper size and the
center and so forth and I'm gonna get it
approximately 144 in size inside of
there actually it's a little bit bigger
so Trinket down just slightly okay and
that's going to be our new icon that we
are going to use for our new app now as
I have it selected I know it's proper
size I'm just going to copy it then in
this situation I'm going to go inside a
Photoshop and I'm gonna go new and I'm
going to say that I want this to be 144
pixels in size honored 44 by 144 and hit
OK and that's going to create me a
little box I'm going to paste in my new
icon and properly resize it so that it
fits now that I have it resized to
pretty much the center of our screen
here flatten that and I have this blown
up that's why it's blurry and I'm just
going to save as and I find someplace I
want to save it and I'm going to create
a census app so let's just say census
app icon and I am going to save this guy
as a ping file and I'm doing that so
that I can have a
transparent background for it now I'm
just going to save it and now we're back
in Eclipse so now what I want to do is
create our brand new application I'm
just going to come in here and I'm going
to go new Android application project
that's going to open up this guy and I'm
going to call this census app and I'm
going to come down here and give it a
distinctive name so I don't have any
conflicts so I'm just going to type in
my website new think tank and let
everything else here be exactly the same
go down and hit next and in this
situation I'm going to let create custom
launcher icon checked come down here hit
next again and here you can see all the
default icons well I want to use my own
so I'm just going to go browse and you
can see right here since this app icon
dot Peng and use that and you can see it
automatically threw it in there now
again it's looking a little bit blurry
because I have my screen zoomed in and
I'm gonna hit next and I'm going to next
and then for the activity name I'm going
to call this census app and it's going
to create activity census app the
activity for me and then hit finish and
it's going to build up everything and
it's going to throw everything here into
our window now what I want to do is come
over here where we have values open that
up and I want to open up strings.xml I'm
also going to be using fragments of
course so I'm going to come down here
into the layout section and I'm going to
create something called fragment contact
so I'm just going to right click there
and we go to new and I'm going to come
down here and I'm going to find Android
XML file open that up and I'm just going
to leave this as linear layout and I'm
going to give it the name fragment
contact and all of your layout file
should be in lowercase letters and then
we're just going to hit finish there we
are I'm just slowly building up all the
different pieces I'm going to need I'm
going to want to change strings first so
that's why I move that over there I'm
going to worry about activity census and
finally the fragment box and then just
to keep things going I'm going to be
using a model view controller sort of
set up here just like I have with all
the other setups so I'm just going to go
ahead and create the classes and I want
to use right away so just come in here
new and then go class this guy is going
to
and I'm going to have a bunch of contact
information so I'm just going to call
this contact and then I'm going to hit
finish and then I'm going to pop over
here again select this and go new come
over here hit class again and then this
guy I'm going to call it contact
fragment all the different classes I'm
going to need and then come down here
and hit finish again sir we got we got
them all set up and the only thing not
showing over here is the census app da
job I'm going to open that up and then
I'm going to just walk right through
here and create everything that we need
before I do that though I want to get
rid of this menu because eventually
we're going to make a custom menu so
let's just get rid of that also so
that's gone and then the very first guy
we're going to be working with is
strings dot XML now I'm going to make
this very very very simple so let's just
come in here and I clicked on this
little tab down here so we could have
this little layout here I'm going to let
this set as since this app I'm going to
get rid of the hello world here so we
don't have any problems with that
settings I'm going to let be settings
just like before and basically just to
start off I think I'm going to
definitely well I'm definitely going to
want the name for my application and I'm
going to provide it as a hint so I'm
going to have the person get visited
with the hint in regards to what
information to enter and I'm going to
have this be contact name hint and it's
going to be really simple it's just
going to say enter name and I don't know
if I'm going to do it right now or not
but I let's say that I also want to ask
for a telephone number like I said in
the beginning this is going to be a very
very simple app so we'll just say phone
number hint and I'm going to use the
phone number as like an identification
for all the people I meet so let's just
say enter phone number alright so for
now those are going to be the only
changes I'm going to make to strings.xml
now I'm going to go into our activity
for our census app this is going to be
the main activity I'm going to make
quite a number of changes to this guy so
I'm going to go down here first to the
graphical layout this is the easiest way
I have found to be able to come in here
and make these changes
well actually it's bounced over here and
just get rid of this textview where it
says hello world to get rid of that
error okay good
now back into the graphical layout now
I'm going to come over here because I
don't want to use a relative layout for
this I prefer to use a frame layout and
all this activity is going to do for me
right now is
it's going to be a container for all of
my fragments that I'm going to be adding
so I'm going to come into relative
layout right click on it and then come
down here and click on change layout
this little box is going to pop up and
I'm going to change it to a frame layout
real simple and then hit OK alright so
it's going to automatically build
everything for me now that I have this
guy selected over here
I'm going to come down make a couple
little changes I'm going to change its
ID because it's going to be a container
for all of my fragments so I'm just
going to call it fragment container I
think that's a good name that's out of
here and it's going to say do you want
me to update all of our files I'm gonna
say yes and it's going to do that for me
and if you don't see that message it
just popped up I'm you can opt out of it
showing up but for some reason I always
leave it on here if you do not see that
there what you should do first off
because I get asked this question all
the time so I'm just going to deal with
it right now
since it's app if you have imports
inside of any of your Java files that
look like this import and then you see
our dot whatever you have to delete all
of those from your source folder in all
of your Java files otherwise it can
cause problems with this our dot Java
file which keeps track of all the
resources in your app so that's
something you definitely want to do
another thing you can do is go into
source and then go to cleanup and click
on that if that doesn't make the problem
go away well then go to help up here
and then come on down and do check for
updates ok so those are the three ways
we can get rid of any type of our file
errors and those come up constantly so
that's why I'm addressing them now also
I'm getting rid of the menu I deleted it
before so let's just get it out of there
and then let's jump back over into our
activity census apdex ml layout down
here open this guy up and there's all
these extra dimension things in here
which I don't want right now so let's
just get rid of them all so gonna get
rid of this line I'm going to keep this
nice and clean as you can see here this
is known as the fragment container
because it's going to contain all of my
fragments I don't need to change
anything else so let's just save it now
I need to actually create the fragment
itself so I'm going to go into fragment
underscore
contact XML and of course all this code
is available in a link in the
description for this video okay so I'm
going to keep the linear layout for this
guy right here and match parents going
to match and match parent again that's
all fine and vertical also works
perfectly fine so to start off what I'm
going to do is I'm going to put an
editable text area inside of here I'm
just going to jump into the graphical
layout come over here to text fields and
I'm just going to go plain text and I'm
going to drag it over and drop it inside
of there and this is whenever the app
gets going this is always going to be
open and ready for you to use so that
you can enter in a new person for our
census app well I got to give this a new
name because edit text 1 is a terrible
name and what I'm going to call it is
contact name edit text not much better
but it's a little bit better I'm then
going to come down to the hints area
when I click on that it's going to say
do you want me to update yes I do
ok go for it now I can come down into
the hints click on that and we already
created that remember we said contact
name hints so let's just select that and
now you can see in her name is showing
up inside of there then we're also going
to come over here so this is input type
is what this is say it's hiding a little
bit let's click on that and this guy
pops up inside of here so we're going to
come in here I'm going to go text first
and name because that's what it is I'm
gonna hit OK and then I'm going to go
down into the regular view for this XML
file and see if everything works I'm
just going to let this be set for 10
contact name hit that's all perfect text
person name that's going to be the type
of data we're going to be receiving
match parent rep contact and also
request focus so whenever they get to
that a part of our fragment inside of
the activity it's going to get focused
perfect love it now I'm going to go into
contact Java and I'm going to set up all
the information for each of our contacts
for now of course this is all going to
change all right so I'm going to
definitely have a string inside of here
and it's going to have the person's name
and like I said before I didn't put it
in yet
but I'm definitely gonna have a phone
number and have a whole bunch of other
things pictures and so forth so we're
going to define those inside of there
I'm also going to have a constructor
which for now isn't going to do anything
but as the tutorial continues it will
eventually do something sleep space in
there because I know I'm going to be
adding things to it and then inside of
this I'm going to go source and then I'm
going to come down here and go generate
getters and setters and then inside of
this I'm going to select both of these
guys up here name and phone number and
if you open this up it's going to be get
name and set name yes I want to be able
to do both those things
insertion last number I'm going to say
after contact in this situation and then
I'm just gonna let everything else be
there and then dot it out it out so
there we go now I am able to come in
here and both get my names and also get
my phone number whenever I get into that
and also set name and set phone number
don't need to do anything else with that
the contact or java files set up now i'm
going to go into contact fragment java
and set up all the information for our
fragments okay so this guy right here
it's going to extend fragment so that we
are able to access all the methods that
we're going to want save that it's going
to give me an error message that we need
to come in here and import some
libraries and we want to be backwards
compatible so we're going to use the
android support dot version four and
there you go then it didn't pop up the
information in regards to the common
methods that I'm going to want whenever
I extend fragments what I'm going to do
is I'm going to right click here and I'm
going to come in to source and then I'm
going to come over here to where it says
override implement methods and click on
that and then I just need to sort
through all these different things so
one thing I definitely want to show up
is oncreate which is going to be used to
initialize everything for this fragment
and I'm also going to want oncreateview
which is going to be used to inflate the
fragment onto the screen and that's it
I'm just going to get those two guys and
then I'm going to hit OK and there we go
now I got all those different methods
that I'm going to use everything here is
perfectly fine other thing I want to do
here is create a new contact for this
fragment
I'm going to call this contact well
first I'm going to need to come up here
and actually define it I'm going to go
private and type contact and I'm just
going to call it contact like that and
that of course is a reference to contact
Java which we just created and then
another thing I'm going to have is I'm
going to have an editable text box and
that's going to be contact named edit
text and I like to give them the same
name that I define inside of the actual
layout some people don't like that but
I'm making the program so that's what
I'm gonna do and I leave it up to you if
you guys know me at all you know that
I'm not big on telling you that things
have to be done a certain way
import my library for my edit text now I
can come down here and define that a new
contact needs to be created and the
constructor really doesn't do anything
so we're not going to worry about that
for now and then we have to define
exactly what's going to happen whenever
we want to inflate this fragment inside
of our main activity which is census
after Java I'm going to come in here
give myself a little bit of room and
what I'm going to do is define my view
and I'm just going to call it the view
for this fragment and what we need to do
to create this new fragment view is pass
in the layout that we want to inflate
and we're going to pass that into the
inflator which is the guy that's going
to inflate our fragment onto the screen
so we need to say okay this is the
layout that I want you to inflate and we
need to reference it using its ID
it's our ID so we're going to go our
layout and that's going to show us all
the layouts that we've created and then
the one ump specifically interested in
is fragment contact and there it is so
that's the guy we want and then what we
need to do is to find the views parent
that we are going to be inflating into
and that is going to be container this
guy right here and then after that we
have to define whether we want to add
the inflated view to our parent and in
this situation I'm going to say no I
don't want to let's actually take this
down to the next line so that's what
we're doing we actually want the parent
activity to inflate this so there we go
now what we need to do
is get a reference to the editable text
box and that's this guy right here so
we're just going to copy that come back
down here paste that in there and then
we need to cast what is return to an
editable text box and then we're going
to say the view and in our view we want
to find view by ID and then we're going
to say exactly what we're looking for
our dot ID and contact name edit text
that's why I like to use same name so I
don't get confused and there we go so
now we've got to reference that editable
text area now what we want to do is add
a text change listener to this editable
text box so that we will be able to
catch the changes in the names and then
update our contact objects so we're
going to go contact name edit text and
to add this we're going to edit text
changed listener go new when we go to
text watcher and handle that for us put
it in curly brace and then at the end of
this put a semicolon and then we have to
go get our libraries for our text
watcher it's gonna say hey you need to
add some unimplemented methods perfect
let's go get them it's going to throw
them all in there for me now I'm only
going to pay attention to a couple of
these but either way it's nice to have
us just generate some stuff for us we'll
have to think too much and I am
basically going to ignore after text
change and also before text change so
I'm just going to leave those as stubs
but on text changed what I'm going to do
is remember we're going to update our
contact object whenever the text is
changed inside the editable text area
and to do that I'm just going to say
contact dot set name and then I'm going
to go well this is the character
sequence that was passed in here so
throw that inside of there and then I
just need to convert that to a string to
save it inside of our object and there
we go
and then after all of this we don't have
to use this we can just go with all view
and return that view and that leaves us
with just Census app Java there we go
in here and get this guy working now it
automatically through in this activity
for me which I do not want to use I want
to be backwards compatible so delete
that change this into a fragment
activity there we go it's even better
and then it's going to say that wants me
to import some libraries and of course
I'm going to choose the ones that have
android support version 4 and there you
can say there that is then what i need
to do is come down here and create my
fragment manager which is going to allow
me to do things like add my custom
fragments to the activity views so I'm
going to go fragment manager and I'm
just going to call this frag manager is
equal to and then I need to go get
support fragment manager course import
my libraries and of course make sure
that I get the proper library Android
support version for now after I get the
fragment manager inside of here I went
to first check if our fragment manager
knows about the fragment ID that I want
to refer to and to do that I go fragment
the fragment is equal to frag manager
and then finds fragment by ID and then
I'm going to find it by its ad ID dot
and fragment container specifically what
I'm looking for
it's gonna need another library then I
want to check if that fragment was found
just goes off fragment and check if it
is coming back as null if it does come
back isn't all well that means I need to
create it and to create it I go to off
fragment is equal to new contact
fragment and then I'm going to go frag
manager dot begin transaction because
that's what it's called whenever we add
or remove or attach or detach or replace
or do whatever with fragments using the
fragment manager it's called a
transaction and then I'm going to say
add because that's what I want to do and
specifically I want to add fragment
container because we know that's not in
there and it needs to be there's a
fragment container and then we need to
say the off fragment this guy right here
that we created is specifically what
we'll add and then we're gonna say
commit because that's going to say do it
as soon as you can
we're done like I said this isn't
complicated we're going to come in here
and we're going to run configurations
and if I typed everything in right click
on new configuration come over here
their census out make sure I got that
set up come over here and hit run and
our n letter as opened up let's open up
our app and there you can see this is
the beginning of our census app and the
very first thing since we don't have any
names inside of your yet is going to ask
us to enter a new name and you can also
see there is our new icon that we
created there's a whole bunch of things
and the beginning of what I hope will be
a really good part of the Android
tutorial please leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
