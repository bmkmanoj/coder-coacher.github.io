my Python how to program tutorial today
we're going to talk about tuples lists
and dictionaries and you're probably
like what the heck is a tuple a tuple
quite simply is what is called an
immutable list now you're probably
saying what the hell is an immutable
list well I'm going to explain it to you
over here we have what you have to
understand is most variables inside of
Python are called immutables and I wrote
this code out here ahead of time just to
save some time integers for example are
immutable as are tuples and dictionaries
and floats and a whole bunch of other
things all immutable means is whenever
you change the value of the integer the
location in memory changes so if we run
this guy get a see over here in the
output whenever I first assign one to
the integer the location in memory is
right here and whenever I changed that
value to two and print it out in the
location ID number it changed mutable
means that no matter what I do to change
this list the identification number for
it in the location in memory is going to
stay the same so that is the differences
between immutable and mutable really
nothing you really need to memorize but
it is a jargon Python term that it comes
up so onto tuples again immutable lists
then I'm going to create a tuple here
just a list of data you'll see your own
creating it you can put different types
of variable or variable values inside of
a tuple and it doesn't care what I did
here is I created a tuple called tuple X
and I entered in a string my name my age
where I live
and state I live in now I want to print
this out using a for statement which I
have talked about previous tutorials and
if you haven't seen them you probably
stopped watching this video because
you're completely confused so what I'm
going to do remember this cycles through
all the values stored in this tuple
temporarily assigning them to this which
I call the cycler or everybody else
calls it an iterator call it whatever
you want and what I'm going to do is
just print out all these values I just
entered into it see them over here and
there they are there's all the values
that I entered in
the tuple now if I want to print just
one of those values I'm just going to
use the handy dandy print function put
in the function name and remember if I
want the first element I use element 0
and first element in tuple is my name
and that's it
because tuples don't have any other
methods so that is pretty much what
they're good for is temporarily storing
information you can throw anything you
want in there well remember I talked
about lists before they're basically
like tuples except they have methods and
they are mutable so let's create
ourselves a list and the real difference
here in creating it is use a bracket
instead of the smooth bracket whatever
it's called I guess you can see it here
if you missed it you rewind and I'm
going to enter the same exact values
into this guy but remember I'm going to
be able to change them and manipulate
them and do all kinds of things
now I'm gonna print them out in the same
way as I did before for you remember and
you don't need to use I all the time
somebody sent me an email has to me if
this needs always be I that's no it
doesn't you can see it did pretty much
exactly the same thing as the tuple did
before talking about lists now and this
is how you would append or add
additional information to your list as
you can see right here
I was able to add joy at the end of my
list quite easily and I can also pull
out values just like I did with the
tuple not that right doing this on the
fly so it's kind of crazy and you can
see it was able to pull that out
remember the first index value is 0 so
that's why I using 4 even though there's
5 elements in there and if I want to
remove things from my list it's real
easy to do as well with the remove
function and then I can remove in
different ways and you can see it took
that vow
you out of there but I can remove in
other ways as well so I can actually use
an index value again still using the
remove function here though except I'm
actually going to type in an index
location and we run it you can see I
knocked off the PA that was also in the
list remember this is a list not a tuple
and if I want to insert into a specific
index location I use the insert function
type in which index I want to insert
into and type in what information I want
to put there and if you look over here
you can see that I put it 0 1 2
it moved Pittsburgh over automatically
for me just example 2 and I'm going to
create myself another list again this is
some more additional functionality for
you what I'm doing here is just entering
in some values or some letters and close
that on and I can use the sort function
on this guy right here and if you look
over here it put everything in
alphabetical order for me even though it
was not inserted in alphabetical order
and if we want to actually list those in
opposite order just use the reverse
function run point to put them into
reverse order and you can also insert
multiple lists like you do with multiple
arrays if you know what those are in
other languages and I'm going to create
one here for you right now
and now skip the head there so you
didn't have to watch me printing all
that out I'm going to print out to the
screen a specific location this multiple
list printed it out with H see if we go
0 1 2 and n 0 1 that's where the letter
H is and that's the letter H down here
being highlighted so those are all the
different things you can do with lists
now I'm going to show you dictionaries
they're immutable variables that have a
key associated with each of the values
within and later on I'm going to go
through and actually create real
programs in Python pay attention to
these brackets there's curly brace
because that's really what changes so
and I said it's a have key values
age is the key value for the number 35
as I define it here height is the key
that is referenced to a strong weight is
the key that is referenced to 169 and
that's how you create a dictionary and
if we want to print dictionary like you
knew I was going to do that's what you
get prints everything out there on the
screen for you and if we want to get the
value that is associated with the key in
this circumstance I'm going to get the
value associated with the key height do
that and then I'll put it six foot three
right out on the screen there for me and
there's a bunch of other little crazy
functions available for dictionaries I'm
going to print out stating this as a
dictionary it's going to show my key
value pairs right there on the screen if
you'd like to.that
or we could just print out the values
that are stored inside of it with the
values function as you see right here
say it's printing out all the different
values that are associated in there and
we can also while we can't add we can
remove key value pairs from a dictionary
which is kind of weird you can see there
that it did indeed remove height now I'm
going to show you something I haven't
shown you before these are while loops
I'm going to create two variables and
this is sort of like a for loop in which
it performs the same action over and
over again based off of certain
conditions that you make so I'm going to
say I want everything that follows the
colon and continues to be spaced in
using four white spaces to be executed
over and over again as long as the value
for a is less than the value for B and
what am I going to do I'm going to print
a to the screen and then down here I'm
going to add a
the value of a currently to the value of
one and and reassign it back so if this
was equal to one originally this would
be one plus one in now is going to be
equal to two and their shorthand
notation for this and it looks like that
and we can run it right here you can see
it prints out all those numbers from one
to ten on to the screen so let's clear
this all off of here
and I'll show you a couple of things a
lot of times this is the for loop a lot
of people want to use a for loop like it
is traditionally used in other languages
now like let's say for example you want
to but pretty much you want to do
something four times what you're in
essence doing here is creating a list
that doesn't have a name that contains
values 1 2 3 4 and what we're going to
do is print out the value of x and if
you do it you can say 1 2 3 4 and that
is one way you can use for loops which
is a more traditional way that people
might like or you could assign 1 2 3 or
here we're actually creating a list and
you could put list cycle here instead of
that if you'd like and a shortcut way to
create iteration with for loops is what
I have right here on screen I'm really
worried about what this all means but
basically what this is is it's going to
automatically using the function range
going to create me a list automatically
that has the values 1 through 201 inside
of it so I can now go for I list cycle
this is a shorthand notation again where
if I wanted to print I could actually
have this for looking all on one line
and you can see it's printing like
traditional other languages 1 through
201 but you might ask yourself well what
if I want to do odd things with it like
for example I'm going to show you real
briefly the if statement here and a
couple other things that I'm going to
expand upon in the tutorial that follows
here but basically what I'm going to do
is print out only even numbers and I'm
going to skip the number 101 how am I
going to do that
for I in list cycle so what am i doing
using one through 201 again like I just
showed you previously but I'm going to
put an if statement in here which you
saw in the previous tutorials and this
is the modulus symbol colon and what
continue does is if this is true you're
going to drop down to continue and what
continue does is it said skip everything
that follows here and jump back up to
the first line of the for loop and
continue onwards
that's what continue does this is like
else if you haven't seen this guy before
like I said but basically this it's
called L if instead of LS F but that
basically what it means if it's just
provide you with another option to put
another conditional if statement in here
to check for something what I'm going to
check for is if the value of I as we're
cycling through is equal to 101 and if
it is I'm going to use the break
statement and what that says is jump
completely out of the loop stop doing
anything don't jump back to the
beginning like continue does but instead
jump completely out of the loop
altogether then what I'm going to do is
go to the else statement this is going
to be if none of the other conditions
are met this is where we're going to go
and this provides me with the option to
print out all of the odd numbers because
of this guy right here
skip the number 101 and everything else
that doesn't meet those conditions print
a screen and this is what happens
whenever I do it it's going really fast
and this is actually from the previous
one which you can see right here see
it's only printing every odd number it's
skipping the even numbers and it hit 101
and that is why you don't see that
printed here in the next tutorial I am
going to take you through a bunch more
Python things which I cannot remember
hurt is played in time you have any
questions leave them in the comment
section below I promise you it'll be
wonderful
the next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
