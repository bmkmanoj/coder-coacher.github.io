1 of my android development tutorial I'm
gonna do something really crazy in this
tutorial I am going to cover a vast
majority of all the different files and
all the different things that go into
creating an Android application and if
you don't have the Android development
kit installed I have a link to that in
the upper left hand corner and as this
tutorial continues in the upper right
hand corner I'm going to have a playlist
that's going to have all my android
tutorials available all in one space and
I'm going to cover this both in a
presentation format as well as writing a
ton of code and explaining everything
all along the way so I have a lot to do
so let's get into it now the very first
thing I'm going to do here is of course
I'm going to create a new Android
project and I'm just going to go new I'm
going to come over to Android
application project and if you don't see
that there you can scroll down come in
to other and I'll just do it this way
and then in the window that pops up you
can come here under the Android folder
and click on Android application project
and since this is our first app I'm
going to call this my first app and then
I'm going to come in here and give this
a name so we don't have any conflicts
I'm going to use my website of course
just like we did before click Next don't
have to worry about any of this stuff
click Next there's the icon click Next
just let it be blank activity again
click Next and we're going to talk about
main activity and activity main and all
the things they do and click finish and
that is going to build all these
different configuration files and set
everything up for you so that you will
be able to start writing some code now
I'm going to go step-by-step through
what all of these folders and all these
files do ok so the first thing you got
here is a source folder and this is just
going to hold all of the class files for
your app then you have your gender and
this is going to contain two
auto-generated files that you should
never touch this is a basic
configuration file and this is our Java
our Java provides access to all the
different resources that you need inside
of your application and in your
application each resource is going to
have a very specific ID and all those
IDs are going to be located here so
don't touch these two guys then we have
our assets folder it's going to contain
text files databases and all the other
different
of data files that you're going to need
for your application that brings us down
to the libs folder or library folder and
this is just going to have the android
support version v4 api available for us
so that we will be able to develop using
the newest api while remaining
completely backwards compatible to all
the other previous versions of android
and you're going to have your resources
folder which i'm going to cover on the
next couple slides jump over into Ben
it's going to contain all the files that
are going to be built by the ADT and
it's also going to contain your actual
apps stored as an apk file or an
application package file and this is
just the file format used for installing
apps on the Android OS then we're going
to get into the Android manifest XML
file which I'm going to cover in great
detail it's going to have the app name
the app icon activities that you're
going to use permissions they're going
to be required for your app to properly
operate and at some point inside of it
you're going to see Android intent
action main this is going to define the
entry point for your app and that brings
us into the resources folder all these
drawable folders that you see here
drawable drawable drawable drawable
they're going to store images that
you're going to need for different
resolutions depending upon if it's going
to show up on an Android phone and
Android tablet and Android TV or
whatever and you can also see here where
we're going to have small screens and
the resolution they're going to work on
normal screens and the resolutions
they're going to work on large screens
and extra-large screens and as you can
see here we even have extra extra-large
screens and the only thing that's in
here right now are all the different
icons that are going to be used to
represent your app on all these
different devices then we're going to
get into the layout folder that's going
to contain all the files that define the
apps user interface and there's mainly
going to be four different ways you're
going to be able to lay out your
application inside of activity main.xml
and like I said before this is just an
XML file that's going to allow you to
define layout you want to use and we're
going to have the relative layout which
is going to place elements relative to
uh
elements and you can just think of this
as left of whatever element or below
whatever element and you're also going
to be able to align to the parent
element such as align to the bottom of
the parent or right of center inside of
a parent then we're going to have our
linear layout and it's going to align
all elements in one direction either
vertically or horizontally and of course
a vertical list will have only one
element per row no matter how wide it
might be
while a horizontal list is only going to
have one element per column
we're going to be working a lot with
linear layout in this tutorial so you
can get to see that then you're going to
have the grid layout which lays out
elements in a series of rows and columns
and it's very flexible and if you plan
on using a grid layout of course you
should set it up using layout editor
rather than going in and trying to mess
around with XML and then finally we have
the absolute simplest layout manager
which is the frame layout and what it
basically does as new elements are added
they are basically just stacked on top
of each other so let's take a look at
activity main a little bit closer so you
can see inside of here activity main
opens up whenever you first create your
app and I'm just going to step through
here briefly and cover some of these
different things you're going to notice
inside of Android we're going to use
things like match parents for things
like width and things like height and
also wrap content down here for width
and height and we're going to do that
rather than using exact pixels so that
our interface is able to easily scale up
to fit the different types of devices we
want to run our app on now if we come
over here you're going to see a folder
called values and there's going to be a
whole bunch of important little files
inside of here one of which is going to
be dimensions and inside of dimensions
we're going to have things like padding
and DP 16 DP in this situation is going
to stand for density independent of
pixels again everything's built off the
idea of being able to properly scale up
the app regardless of the type of device
so that's going to be running on and in
this situation DP relative to a 160 dpi
dots per inch screen would equal one
density independent
pixal so don't worry about that and if I
haven't mentioned it before please don't
try to memorize all this stuff right now
this is meant to just sort of show you
everything allow you to digest as much
as you can possibly digest and then in
the following tutorials I'm going to
cover everything in much more detail I
just want to give you a brief
explanation of what's going on in all
these files then we're going to get into
strings.xml open that guy up right there
and all of the strings that you're going
to be storing to use inside of your app
are going to be both stored as well as
retrieved from strings.xml and you're
going to be able to define some simple
formatting inside of here such as if you
want the text to be bold or italic or
underlined just like HTML and the only
thing you really have to worry about
whenever you're defining these strings
is to make sure that you escape all your
apostrophes as well as your quotes and
you can see right here exactly how we're
going to define one of our strings we're
going to give it a name app name and
then here the actual string that we're
going to store inside of it and as
you're going to see here in a little bit
let me just give you a little bit of
space you're going to be able to pull
all of this information out of the
strings.xml file into your interface by
going Android text is equal to at symbol
string forward slash and then whatever
the name is for this string stored
inside of here and you're going to see a
bunch of examples of exactly how that's
going to operate here in a second and
then that brings us into styles.xml and
we're not going to do that much with
this part of this app but we'll
definitely be getting into it much later
on and inside of styles.xml you're going
to define the format basically for your
UI so you're going to be able to specify
properties such as height and padding
and font color font size background
color and a whole bunch of other
different things in a way that is very
similar to how you style things using
cascading style sheets and that is just
a basic run through of all the different
folders and all the different things
they contain and as you can see over
here inside the values you're going to
have different dimensions as well stored
inside of here and I'm going to get more
into androidmanifest here in a second
and all these other different guys as we
create a simple app the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to go into
activity underscore main
dot XML and start playing around inside
of here now by default this guy is going
to use a relative layout well I don't
want to use a relative layout so I'm
just going to come in here and I'm going
to delete that and I'm going to create
everything cost them and explain
everything as I go along instead we're
going to use a linear layout and like I
said before it's going to align elements
in one direction and we're going to be
able to find that by setting a value to
orientation to either horizontal or
vertical and whenever you define this
you are of course going to have to
define a route view and this route view
is going to fill the devices screen so
we're gonna go linear layout which is
what we want to use and actually
shouldn't delete it all that let's just
get back here getting a little bit crazy
and let's just get rid of relative and
go linear layout and you'll be able to
keep a lot of these things all exactly
the same except in this situation I'm
not going to worry about any of this
padding and I'm going to get rid of
tools down here and like we said before
width is going to be defined with match
parent and height is going to be defined
with match parent so that it properly
scales to different devices and the only
thing we're going to need to do here
with a linear layout is define the
orientation whether it's going to be
horizontal or vertical and to do that
we're going to go Android orientation so
I might as well just click on that save
ourselves some time and I'm going to go
horizontal right like that
and there we go now what we're going to
don't do with our app here is we're
going to want to define it you know of
course come down here and make sure this
is set for linear as well otherwise
that'll throw a hissy okay got that set
up what we're going to do here is this
is basically pulled from the Google
tutorial that is provided and I just
really liked it and no I'm not going to
be obsessing on only the Google tutorial
I'm going to be pulling on all kinds of
applications as we go along but what we
want to do is basically provide the
option for an editable text field to be
shot onto the screen the user is going
to be able to type in some sort of
information into that hit a button and
then that's going to trigger an intent
or an action to cause another activity
to be started when that other activity
is gonna be very simple it's just going
to print out on the screen whatever the
user typed into this text field but to
type something into the text field we're
going to actually have to create a text
field for them to be able to type into
and to create an editable
filled we're going to have to use a tag
called edit text and we're just going to
go Android and we're going to give this
an ID and whenever you are going to be
defining an ID for all of your different
elements which of course you're going to
always have to do because we're going to
need a way to be able to reference these
different elements inside of your app
code which is going to be in your source
folder you're going to have to put an @
symbol in here because that is always
going to be used to refer to an object
inside of XML then whenever you are
first creating a new resource you're
going to have to put a plus sign
followed by ID and you're only going to
use this plus sign whenever you first
create a resource of course and then
you're just going to put a slash and
whatever you want its name to be and I'm
just going to have it set for edit
message now let's say that we want our
app and the layout for our text field to
completely fill a row inside of it and
all we're going to have on this of
course is going to be a text field where
they're going to be able to enter
information and a button well let's say
that we want to have as much space
available given to our text field so
that they can type in a long message how
you would do that is you'd go Android
layout and give a value to wait now wait
by default is always going to be zero
for anything that you would create in
regards to a resource inside of an
Android app so by giving it a value of
one that means that this text field
you're going to create is going to take
up all the space that is not taken up by
the button if you actually created two
different elements and let's say we gave
our text field a value of two and then
whenever we created our button we gave
it a value of one it would actually give
2/3 of all the space to our text field
and then the one third remaining part to
our button but if we don't do anything
it's going to make the button as big as
it needs to be and give the text field
all the other different space that is
available to it now a very important
thing to do whenever you are trying to
get a text field to size itself properly
is whenever we're going to be defining
the width for our element
we're gonna go layout width and we want
to make sure that we set this to zero
dpi and the reason why we're doing that
is layout width is going to be
irrelevant because
the weight has already been set and
weight is going to fill all the space
that's available for this little text
box we're going to put in here so then
we're going to go Android layout height
and in this situation because we want
everything to just properly scale height
wise regardless of the type of device is
using we're going to just type in wrap
content and then finally we're going to
go Android hint is equal to string edit
message and this is going to pull a
string from strings.xml that is going to
be used by default and then of course
make sure that that's closed off let's
jump over into strings XML and actually
define edit message because it's gonna
say here there's an error because this
resource you're looking for doesn't
exist so I'm just gonna copy this guy
coffee jump over into strings.xml real
quick and you can see all these
different things here paste that in
there and then I'm just going to create
myself a new one of these guys throw
that there grab edit message throw that
right there and I'm gonna find the
default string that I want to be shown
inside of there let's just say it's
enter a message and there we go now
we're going to be able to pull these
directly out of here and the reason why
we're doing this aside from the fact
that we want to make everything scalable
and translatable and such is that it's
going to be really great to store all
the text for your user interface all in
one area and the reason why that's going
to be great is you're going to be able
to manage all of the text across your
entire app all in one place so that's
just a couple of different reasons why
we're actually using strings of XML and
that's the reason why Android setup that
way and of course there's no reason why
you can't come in here and change any of
these things so I can put first app
inside of here and another thing we're
going to do is to find the text that we
want to show up on our button so we're
going to come in here and go button send
for example and then type send in here
there we go
and for now we can basically just let
everything else stand so let's jump back
into activity main and continue playing
around with us so of course we're going
to need to create a button to use with
our interface and to create a button
you're just going to go button pretty
simple and then inside of this we're
also going to the
on our buttons so that it just fits
inside of here so we're going to go wrap
content for both of these guys both the
width as well as the height we're of
course going to want to get the text
from strings.xml so that we can put our
text on our button and to do that we're
just going to go text is equal to at
string and we call it button send so
that's going to do that and then the
final thing we're going to do is set it
up so that we can call an action to
occur whenever the button is clicked and
we're going to call a method that is
going to be named send message whenever
this button is indeed clicked then we
want to close that off of course so that
is how to set up strings that XML as
well as activity main so let's file save
all those different guys and I'm not
going to need dimensions dot XML so I'm
going to close that and I'm also not
going to need styles dot XML at this
time I'm going to cover those at a later
date now to actually start making this
app two things I'm going to go into
source and go into mainactivity.java and
there is this guy there's all the
different things we need to import to
make it work properly now the very first
thing I'm going to want to do inside
here is because we're going to be
sending a message from one of our
activities or screens that we're going
to be working with into another activity
or screen that we're going to be working
with I'm going to store a unique message
inside of this guy and it's going to be
public final static it's going to be
string and we call this extra message
and here I'm going to use my package
name to avoid any conflicts that might
occur with other apps so I'm gonna go
call them dot you think tank of course
you would use whatever your own domain
is I can call this my first app thought
message this is just going to be the
message we're going to be passing from
one activity that we have into another
activity and I'm not going to worry
about much about all these different
methods right here but I am going to
have to define the method that we talked
about in activity main called send
message this needs to be created so that
it can be called whenever our buttons
clicked so we're going to bounce down
side here and create send message so to
do that we're just going to go public
void send message view view like I said
before this is going to be triggered
whenever the button is clicked
and you're going to get a little error
here that we need to import library no
problem import view ok so the next thing
we have to do after we create this is we
need to create an intent and of course
we're going to have to import another
library no problem did that now an
intent is an object that can be used to
start another activity and to create an
intent we just go new intent type in
this and what this is is just a
reference to main activity this guy
right here that's what this is a
reference to and if you want to really
understand the ins and outs of this main
activity is of course an activity as you
can see here extends activity and
meanwhile activity is also an extension
of another class that is called a
context and a context can represent
various different application specific
resources inside of your application and
in essence the reason why everything is
structured this way is so that all these
different resources can gain access to
each other because they're going to have
shared methods that are all going to be
inherited because they are part of the
ultimate context class now once again if
you didn't quite understand that don't
worry about it we're going to cover this
stuff numerous times throughout the
course of this tutorial and by the end
you will get it so then what we're been
essence doing here is saying that we
want to call displaymessage activity
that is our intention and it is our
intention to have this guy executed
whenever send message is called and send
message is called whenever the button is
pressed inside of our application now
whenever all this goes down what we want
to do is create a text area and place it
in our new view for our new activity and
to do that we're going to go edit text
edit text and this is going to give us
another error because we need to import
another library of course because we
always have to do that so let's just do
that right away and then there's going
to have to be a cast to type edit text
set up here and then we just want to go
find view by ID and this is just going
to create a text area and place it in
our view and remember
whenever I said before our Java this guy
over here which is stored in the
generated Java files file this guy has
all the IDs for all the different
resources so what we're going to do is
go r dot ID dot
edit message to get ahold of the ID for
this guy we'll get rid of that of course
there we go got that setup right and
what is edit message of course jump over
into this guy and you're going to see
that edit message is this guy stored
right here in the Edit text field that
we're going to be able to create here in
a second it's all I'm doing is passing
this information around so then I want
to be able to store that text inside of
my text area and to do that I'm going to
create a new string called message and
then I'm going to go edit text and I
want to get the text from that field
that they entered in there previously
I'm going to go to string of course to
convert it into a string so all I'm
doing is this guy over here wherever I
had the area for the user to be able to
enter in a message inside of it I'm
getting the ID from the our Java file
right like I have right here
storing it inside of this edit text
field and then here what I'm doing is
extracting that text from the edit text
field and storing it in a string called
message okay so that's what's going on
here now what I want to do is I have my
intent which is my intention to call
display message activity this class up
here and what I want to do inside of
this intent is to put extra information
in it to be passed over that extra
information can be stored in extra
message and the actual message itself is
going to be this string right here so
that's what's going to be sent over
there whenever display message activity
is needed and then all I need to do to
get display message activity this
activity to show up on the screen is to
go start activity and pass along the
intent or intention to start that
activity along with the message that is
going to be used inside of it so now
what I need to do is actually create
display message activity this class
everything else here is perfectly fine
solely from a file save that now to
create a new
tivity what I'm going to do is zoom up
here come up to this little guy here
click on new and in this situation
you're gonna have to scroll down inside
of here until you get to other this box
is going to open up and of course we're
making a new activity a new screen to
show so I'm going to just double click
on that
let blank activity just be set because
we're just making a real simple little
app here and then under project I'm just
going to let this be set to my first app
the activity name of course is going to
be display message activity just like we
did before we can let this all be set
exactly the same we can come in here and
type in something like my message for
the title of this guy under hierarchical
parent because I don't want to have any
conflicts I'm going to select that guy
and then I'm just going to go to this
guy right here my first app and double
click on that so there we go got that
all setup navigation type I'm going to
let that set for none and then I'm going
to come down here we can click on next
if we want don't really need to worry
about any of this let's just click
finish and there we go now whenever we
do that activity display message is
going to open up inside here and another
thing that's going to be inside of here
is in the source folder this is where
you want to actually work inside of the
source folder you're going to see
display message activity this is going
to be the code that you're actually
going to want to work with so open this
up so we can see all our different
libraries we have Dada Dada we're not
going to need to change anything here ok
so now with on create this guy is going
to be called whenever our new activity
is created so what are we going to need
to do well we want to actually get the
message that was entered into the app so
we're going to have to create a new
intent like this and we're going to
store inside of it the information that
was passed over into this which was
actually the intention to call display
message activity and of course come in
here and get this library now if we want
to actually get this string that was
stored inside of the intent we're going
to go string message is equal to to get
that message go intent get string extra
and to get it go main activity because
that's its name and extra message and
there we go
and where did that main activity come
from right here and where did that
message come from right here
this is it extra message that's how
we're pulling that information in what
that means so now we're going to need to
create our new text view where we're
going to display this message so we're
going to go text view and we call it
text view is equal to new text view type
this inside of there because that's what
this is this activity course come in
here again get that library I can also
come in here and set my text size just
40 points side of there then inside of
this new text area if I want to set my
text inside of it with the message that
was passed over from the intent I'm just
going to get a text view dot set text
and pass the message inside of it now
that I have that all set up now I have
to come in here to set content view and
just put my little text view on the
Android device and if I save that the
neat thing that's going to happen is
display message is actually going to be
created automatically for me inside of
here and I can run this guy so just
commit the inside of here hit run
configurations make sure I have my first
app main activity selected here with
launched go over into target make sure I
have automatically picked compatible
device and have my emulator all set up
like I did before and I come in here hit
run and here the emulator is starting up
I can see down here that my application
has been installed on my device and all
I need to do is open it up and here we
can see and her first message and I can
put just random message just whatever I
want to put come over here hit Send and
random message gets printed out on the
screen so there is how to do 50 million
different things with Android hopefully
I didn't overwhelm anybody I just wanted
to try to do a completely different type
of Android tutorial in upcoming
tutorials I'm just going to make a ton
of apps that's all I'm gonna do and I'm
