apple ipad review i know everybody else
has done a review on an apple ipad so i
thought i'd do it except i'd cover
pretty much only the things that
everybody else doesn't cover here i'm
going to go over the pros the cons and
how to set some things up that you might
not know first off what's great screen
is beautiful it's just fabulous it's
easy to set up your email calendar
contacts as well as transfer all of your
ipod apps or iphone apps it does it
automatically within itunes is where you
would be able to set up what information
you wanted to be transferred directly to
your ipad so would do is go into the
contacts area click that calendars you
could sync your mail accounts do
whatever you'd like and then click sync
and it would automatically transfer all
of that information bein your contacts
calendars and emails directly over into
your iPad's you don't have to do
anything okay so here's the ipad screen
sorry it's a little blurry going to zoom
in here on settings the con set in come
over here click on mail contacts
calendars to set up your new account you
just click on Add Account then if you
have one of these being Microsoft
Exchange mobileme gmail yahoo or AOL you
click on them or other and then just
click on add mail account type in your
name address password description and
then hit save and I tried this on gmail
accounts GoDaddy privately hosted web
sites a whole bunch of things it
automatically always sanks great thirdly
my laughs a lot cooler this guy doesn't
seem to put out any heat at all which to
me is absolutely made very intuitive
interface if you already use an ipod or
an iphone you will know how to use it
been to an apple store which people use
the ipad and even if they didn't have an
ipod or an iphone it seems that they
were easily able to pick it up and just
start using it and finally makes the
apps air video tweetdeck and youtube
absolutely amazing air video is one of
the coolest apps available on the iPad
it was previously available on the ipod
but now with the giant screen it's even
better tool to get it you just go to n
method calm forward slash air dash video
and click on download you would pick
based off if you have a Mac or a PC
platform works
on both of them after you install it
which is quite simple this little bugger
up here shows up on your screen want to
go in here click on server preferences
then come you'd click on shared folder
server running yes you can take any
movie you have on your computer then and
stream it directly to the ipad quite
simply so you just find it say i want to
transfer over battlestar galactica i
select the folder click open and it's
available just like that and it will
automatically convert file formats
that's what makes it such a great app
then you have air video might click on
that what it allows you to do is to go
in to any computer you have that has
movies on it and watch those movies
right on your iPad which saves a ton of
space what it'll also do is
automatically convert into a file format
that works on ipad and you can see here
it's loading up battlestar galactica for
you here is I books click on that I know
you probably saw this but there's a lot
of information maybe you didn't know
that you get a free Winnie the Pooh book
the vet tip there's winnie the pooh and
i heard a lot about information in
regards to their not being a lot of
books available well i SAT here on
purpose and typed in a ton of books here
i typed in Lord of the Rings and you can
see here whole bunch of different
versions the Lord of the Rings is
available i typed in tons of books
everything seems to be available as far
as i could look down here york times
bestsellers click on that you'll see
here a whole bunch of new york times
bestsellers that are available to
another really amazing thing you can do
with ibooks is if you type in project
gutenberg like i have right here you
will see a world of free books there are
tons of them many of them some of the
best books ever written and you can
click through this is called the project
gutenberg project something like that
and i think that's absolutely amazing
just another really great thing about
the ipad well that's it for now hope you
enjoyed the presentation till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
