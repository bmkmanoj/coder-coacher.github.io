19 of my android development tutorial
today I'm going to talk about
localization or how to make your app
translate automatically on different
devices I'm also going to show you how
to catch multiple events I'm going to
show you how to create custom landscape
layouts for whenever people rotate their
phone and a whole bunch of other things
if you haven't watched part 18 I provide
a link in the upper right hand corner to
it you absolutely have to watch it to
understand what's going on here though
and I have a lot to do so let's get into
it okay so here we are in Eclipse and
I'm in contact Java and I'm gonna start
making some changes inside of here for
example I'm just gonna add a couple
extra fields inside of this class so I'm
going to put street address and I'm also
going to put city and after we have that
setup just right click and then we're
gonna go down into source and then we're
gonna come over here we're going to go
generate getters and setters and you can
see right here we have city and we have
street address select both of those and
I'm gonna go down here and make sure
that fields and getter setter pairs is
set because I prefer that and then I'm
gonna hit OK all right so now those are
all set up for me and what I'm going to
be doing here is I'm going to be saving
data from the app and over into the
actual contact object so what I want to
do here ahead of time is I want to be
able to test to make sure that my
contact object is actually being updated
so inside of all of these actually I'm
going to be putting in log dot e and
then I'm going to in uppercase letters
go census so that I'll be able to see
this more easily in my logcat then I'm
going to say that address changed to and
then I'm gonna put street address right
like that and make sure you get the
library for log and port that and then
I'm going to go and put this in all of
the other different set methods so here
I'm going to put city change to and then
change this to city and again this is
just being done so that I am able to
track what's going on and I actually
don't like the fact that these are up
here this doesn't have anything to do
with anything but I'm just going to copy
these could it did that before and come
down
and pastes them inside of here there we
go and then copy this come back up to
another set name paste that in there and
then change this to name change to
change that to name and then set phone
number paste that in there change this
to phone
change too and phone number and there we
go everything is saved and now I'm going
to go into strings dot XML make some
changes okay here we are in this
strings.xml file and I'm going to put
hints in for both the street and also
the city and these whatever I put inside
here is going to show up in the actual
application so I'm going to say enter
Street and this is where we're going to
be changing some things later on
whenever we want to allow this to
automatically translate into French I
just pick that randomly and that's all
we're going to need to change for
streets to XML now I'm going to go into
fragment contact XML and I'm just going
to go through a situation in which we
started off with a linear layout and
let's say somebody comes along and says
you know what I prefer a table layout
how exactly would we change that
actually it's not that hard go into a
graphical layout I'm going to be
bouncing between the actual code and the
graphical layout here and you can see
right now all I have inside of here is
enter name
well if I want to change this to a table
layout I'm just going to select it right
click on it and scroll down here where
it says change layout click on that and
then in the box it pops up I'm going to
change it to table layout and that was
pretty easy and there it goes it's
automatically going to handle all that
for me jump back over here into the code
you can see the table layout is here now
and I'm just going to leave this name
table layout 1 I normally don't worry
about that it's up to you if you want to
change that or not and then inside of
here I'm going to put a whole bunch of
editable text boxes and I think I'm
going to do this inside of the code area
there's a little note that I left myself
just get rid of that and I'm just gonna
paste this in here get rid of the
requests focus don't need that and the
odd thing is is I tend to almost always
do a lot of changes inside of the text
area which i think is considered a
little bit odd but either way we're all
a little bit odd in some ways so inside
of here I'm just going to change this to
Street and I'm just doing this randomly
out of my head so I'm not really
worrying about what its gonna look like
at this point another thing that I think
I'm gonna want
do here is change the margin between
these editable text boxes but I'll
change that here in a second and I'm
just going to throw a couple more of
these editable text box areas inside of
here get rid of that again and throw
another one inside of there and I'm just
going to change this to contact City and
let everything else be the same here
this is gonna change again actually
since I'm in here might as well just
change it right now change this to phone
I originally was going to change these
hints over in the graphical area but I'm
just going to change them here just
change this to Street come down here
change this to city and then change this
the phone file save it jump into the
graphical layout and whoops that's not
right jump back over here on its phone
number hint it's actually I'm gonna
change this because I think phone just
works better jump back over here and
there you can see all those are set up
now the one thing I don't like about
that there's a couple things I don't
like about it but either way what I want
to do here is I want to put in a margin
between these guys so they're not quite
so cramped up so to do that I'm going to
go into dimensions XML and since I'm
getting rid of these I did that in last
part of the tutorial I'm just going to
type in app outer margin now that seems
good enough and then I'm also going to
put in a component bottom margin so I'm
just going to call this component bottom
margin there we are that's all I'm going
to do with dimensions dot XML so I'm
just going to close that and then I can
jump over here and all this code of
course is available in a link in the
description I wanted me to do is I'm
going to select each one of these
individual little guys here and then go
over and change the input type for them
so I have text person's name and other
thing I'd like to add to this is to make
all of my text capital words so that
helps out and then hit OK and then we
have Street I'm going to do sort of the
same sort of thing for that here it's
set for text person's name that's just
because I copied and pasted here I'm
going to get rid of that I'm going to
also do text capital words and then on
top of that I'm also going to do postal
address now that is it okay go into city
do the same sort of thing here I'm just
going to get rid of that and then I'm
going to put text capital words hit OK
and then for phone number I'm going to
and go in here of course and change this
to phone number I'm just going to make
it automatically sort of look right when
the
type it in and there it is phone okay so
we got all those set up right now what I
want to do is go in and change the
margins on these so I'm just gonna
select each of them individually get rid
of that too much information I think
it's in here yes it is margins and like
I said there's no reason to memorize
this stuff it's just after you do it for
a while as you saw right there you just
remember where things are and you know
so that works okay so what do I want
component bottom margin well there that
isn't hit okay and you can see it's
stretched apart go back in here do that
again bottom margin select it again jump
in over here bottom margin and for phone
number I'm just gonna let that be that
way and as far as I'm concerned err
everything here looks perfectly okay so
I'm gonna let it just sit the way it is
that means I'm going to go into contact
fragment dot Java and I'm going to show
you how to catch a whole bunch of
different events all at one time now to
do that I'm going to be making a couple
little changes I'm I have four different
editable text areas instead of just
three now one two three and I'm just
going to call this contact Street edit
text city and phone so here we go got
all this set up and now what I want to
do is basically show you how to get rid
of this stuff right here see where we
have contact name at a text and then we
went and created a text watcher and blah
blah blah blah blah now you could create
one of those for each one of these
editable text areas but I want to avoid
that but first one of the things I'm
going to need to do is actually define
or initialize these editable text areas
so these are going to be the new ones 1
2 3 and this is going to be Street and
this is going to be City and this is
going to be phone just like we just set
up above and then for these this is
gonna be a street and this is going to
be city that's why it's nice to keep
these the same you don't have to think
about anything and there it's going to
be phone and there we go so now we have
all those set up now you may ask
yourself well how exactly do we set up a
text watcher so that'll work with all
these editable text areas well there's
actually a whole bunch of different ways
to do it but I'm going to show you just
one of them that I consider to be a
simple easy to understand way to do it
so all we're going to do is create text
watcher and I'm going to call this edit
text watcher call it
whatever you like I'm going to say new
text watcher and it's going to come in
here and say hey you need to add some
unimplemented methods so do that that
saves us a little bit of time and then
in this situation you're going to put a
semicolon down here and then you're
going to go in here and make a couple
little changes I am basically going to
stay in this on text changed area and
I'm going to use what I did before as a
sort of a little guide so I'm going to
copy that
and basically what we need to do inside
here to decide what actions we want to
take place or what specific contact
object we want to be changed is we're
going to need to figure out exactly
which editable text area was edited and
to do that you can go if like I said
there's a bunch of ways to do this but
I'm just doing it this way so I'm going
to say contact name edit text so I'm
going to say hey I want the editable
text area and I want to check if it has
focus if that's the reason why this
specific text watcher was called was
because the contact name edit text
component actually has focus and if that
is true well then I want to go and
change my contact set name like this
just like that and we could get rid of
that altogether like I said there's more
intricate ways of doing this but I think
this is understandable and
understandable is good thing and then
we're going to do an if statement and
then we're going to do another is
statement and then we're going to do one
more if statement what we're going to do
an else--if because we don't know some
out of there editable text area might
come about and then we're just going to
paste these in here and we're going to
change different ones depending upon
what's going on so I'm going to go set
name well actually let's go and do this
to copy that paste that in there they
sat in their face that in there and then
here when I say contact Street edit text
and then here we're gonna say City and
then here we're going to say phone check
if they have focus and then I'm just
gonna go set street address I believe
that's what I called it to whatever the
string was that was passed in there then
this is funny s is what we're gonna use
this time this changed since last time I
used it paste that in there paste that
in there always something to look out
for they sat in there and paste that in
there this is going to be called set
city and this is gonna be phone number
so there we go now we have everything
all in one little box now the only
problem is is we want to keep this part
but we don't want any of this other
stuff so let's just delete it go down
here and delete all of it goodbye
and then what we're going to do is we're
going to call our edit text watcher
directly down inside of here base that
in there that's all we changed soft
works good then we're basically just
going to do it for the other type of
editable text areas I wan 2 3 and then
just change this to contact Street City
and phone and that is it this guy will
actually run and what the heck let's
just go and run it just to see exactly
how that works and here you can see I
have everything in here I'm just going
to click inside of there and I'm just
going to type my name real quick just
like that that's all I did then I come
over here scroll through this real fast
and you see right here since this name
change to Derek so we know it worked and
you also know why I did that whole thing
with the log in the very beginning of
the tutorial so there that is now what I
want to do is as you make apps you're
going to eventually come across the
situation in which sometimes in a
vertical format your app setup in a
vertical format is not going to look
good so what you're going to want to do
is have a separate landscape layout
that's going to be used whenever they
rotate the phone and then you're going
to have the regular traditional layout
whenever they just keep it the way it is
it's really pretty easy to set it up so
what I'm going to do is just come over
here and this is in package Explorer and
inside of our res folder what I'm going
to do is like this guy and I'm going to
say new and I'm going to say folder then
inside of this guy I'm going to create a
folder that it's going to be called
layout - land and hit finish and then
what I'm going to do is I'm actually
going to take fragment contact I'm going
to copy it and I'm going to paste it
inside of this guy so paste it and then
what you're going to need to do is
actually close fragment contact there it
is it's gone and then we're going to go
back into layout land and we're going to
double click on that and there it is now
let's say that I want to take
the phone number and put it up here next
to name and city and move it next to
Street how exactly would I do that
well I'm going to go into fragment
contact just like this actually first
what I'm going to do to save time is
click on graphical layout again and in
this situation I'm going to go into
layout so I don't have to type stuff out
and I'm specifically going to look for
table row I'm going to grab that down
here and drop it in okay so that's in
there just so the code is in here so I
don't have to think about it then women
to do is put all these in table rows so
to do that I'm just going to cut this
out of here jump way up to the beginning
right before the first editable text box
and this is how I do things so you know
and this is a very specific situation
also so I'm not telling you always do it
my way then after this guy I am going to
throw in another one of those and then
I'm gonna come back down here I'm going
to get the table row closing bracket
come after this guy and then remember I
said that I wanted to have my name and
then I wanted the phone number and then
street and city well here I have Street
and then I have city and then I have the
phone well I want the phone to go up
above so I'm gonna copy that
oops there's a mistake that requests
focus snuck in there
get rid of that and I'm gonna get this
and there we go scroll back up here and
paste that in there so now we have the
name and the phone jump over here and
look and you can see that everything is
lined up the way I wanted it to be but
it kind of looks sloppy so let's make
the name in the phone and the street in
the city take up all the space that's on
the screen okay to do that first table
row I'm going to have that set up to
match parent right like that and I'm
going to do exactly the same thing with
the other table row so come down here
width
match parent okay so we got that fixed
and let's go look and see what's going
on all right so that's so bad
but there's still not lined up perfectly
I want them to take up all the space
available so to do that just jump back
inside of here again come down inside of
this then right after this I'm going to
go Android and I'm going to say layout
weight is equal to one and if I give all
of them ones that means they're going to
take off exactly 50% of the total space
and you've got to see me do this before
and we do the same thing with phone and
I'm going to do exactly the same thing
with these other editable text areas and
there that is and there that is and if
we jump over here and look at it you can
see everything is lined up and
everything looks much better or better
than it did before and if you want to
take this app and run it and make sure
that it works I'm positive it does so
I'm not going to waste time running the
emulator for that so now what I want to
do is show you exactly how to
automatically change text to other
languages basically what you're going to
need to do is called localization and
we're going to go over into the res area
again and actually let's look at
something here real quick okay here I am
on ISO dot-org ISO country names blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah what this
is going to do is show us all the
different codes for all the different
countries that we could use because
whenever you set up these folders
special folders you have to use these
special codes and what I said before
we're going to use is just France so we
just go through here and we find FR well
i can remember that
so back inside of android in our res
folder what we're going to do is create
a special values folder for french
that's right click come over here do a
folder new there it is and then this guy
we're just going to call it values - FR
for french that's it and we go finish
and then we're going to do pretty much
the same sort of thing for Strings those
are going to be the guy that I'm going
to be using here so I'm just going to
copy that
jump here and then do a paste and the
new strings is going to be inside of
there and then I'm going to go and get
this guy and close it and then I'm going
to open up my new strings folder and
there that is now what you're going to
do is you're going to translate this in
one way or another I
don't really care which way you use I
personally don't know French well enough
to do this right and I don't know if I
am doing it right but I do know that
that's how you do since this app just
because I've done this in the past but
what I would do now if I didn't know all
these different languages which many of
you guys do is I would just go settings
for example coffee jump in here and I
have this set for English on the left
and then on the right I have it set for
French just like that and I can just go
paste and there you can see it
translated it for me then I can jump
over into this guy and I can just do an
R and there we are and then I could do a
an enter name and then get this and
paste that in there and that's all I'm
going to change for now I'm going to
change everything after this but I want
to go and actually execute the app so go
run configurations again and I'm going
to show you how to exactly test this so
we're going to do deuce there we go
I'm going to go run and here you can see
I have it set for French and then
automatically change that and change all
these other ones because I didn't change
them in my strings or XML folder and
it's very important to be able to change
them back to change them back you're
just going to click on this guy down
here and then click on this and then
you're going to look for settings and
that's going to be divs settings in this
situation so you might want to say well
second row for in and it's probably a
good idea to do that and then you're
going to want to go down three boxes so
there's this one right here and then
there's going to be this one right here
and then there's going to be this one
right here and then this one's going to
be language click on that so basically
the third little area down and a third
one inside of that and then you can see
it's a set for French I'm just going to
click on that and then I have to figure
out what is English I'm going to come
down here until I find English United
States click on that and then everything
set up right I'm just going to click on
this and then if I click here you're
going to see that census app is back to
being in English so there is a ton of
different things we can do with Android
please leave any of your questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
