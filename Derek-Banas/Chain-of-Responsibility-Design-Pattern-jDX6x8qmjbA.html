22 of my design patterns video tutorial
today we're going to talk about the
chain of responsibility design pattern
so what exactly is the chain of
responsibility design pattern well this
pattern has a group of objects that are
expected to between them be able to
solve a problem and if the first object
can't solve it it just simply passes the
data to the next object in the chain in
the example in this presentation I'm
going to create four objects that can
either add subtract multiply or divide
two numbers that are sent what you're
simply going to do here the clients
going to do is send two numbers in a
command and allow these four object to
the side which can handle the requested
calculation so let's look at a UML
diagram to sort this out basically we
have our client just like always and
then of course we're going to have a
chain interface and this is referred to
as the handler and inside of it we're
going to have set next chain which is
going to be passed a chain object now
what's that next chain is going to do is
is going to be passed a reference to the
next object to call in the chain if it
is needed then calculate which is going
to be implemented by both add numbers
and subtract numbers multiplied numbers
and divide numbers which you're going to
see here in a minute
what calculates going to do is either
make the calculation or call the
calculate method on the next object set
by this guy right here set next chain
say so if it can't make the calculation
like add numbers down here can't make
the calculation it is gonna say okay
what is the next object in the chain
which is gonna be subtract numbers and
it's gonna say ok let's call calculate
on subtract numbers based off of the
fact that subtract numbers object is
going to be stored by set next chain
that didn't make any sense don't worry
about it we're gonna get into the code
and go through this step-by-step okay so
here I am over an eclipse so we're gonna
start writing some code the first thing
we're gonna do is create our interface
called chained Java so let's just go in
here this is very simple don't worry
about it and it's an interface and I'm
going to call it chain and it doesn't
have to be called chain I just thought
it made sense that way and then here
we're going to define the
to object to receive the data if this
object is unable to process it so we go
public
Lloyd set next chain and it's going to
be passed and an object that implements
the chain interface and we're just going
to call it next chain because that seems
to make sense
and then we're also going to force it to
make a calculation of some sort and it's
going to be passed a object called
numbers and here I'm just going to call
it request and that's it you're done
there is the chain interface so now
let's jump over into numbers Java and
see exactly what's being passed to it so
we're just going to go public class
numbers and then we're going to store
private int number one private int
number two private string calculation
wanted and this is going to ultimately
decide on which one of these calculate
methods is going to be called in which
object that implements the chain
interface and then numbers is going to
be passed new number one new number two
as well as a string calc wanted and then
it's just going to simply take all these
guys number one number two and
calculation wanted and store those
inside of here real simple if I'll save
that and then if we want to be able to
get access to these numbers public int
get number one and it's just going to
return number one of course and then
this guy is going to return number two
and then this is going to be a string
calc wanted and here we're going to
return calculation wanted file save it
ready to go so now we're going to do add
numbers and you're going to get to see
how this is all put together so this is
going to be real simple we're just going
to go public class add numbers
implements chain and then each one of
these is going to store the next object
in the chain that can perform these
calculations and here in this
constructor we're going to define that
next object that's going to receive this
data if this object is unable to use it
let's just go up to add numbers add-on
implemented methods save ourselves some
time and here we're just going to go
next chain or in this situation we'll go
this exchange is equal to next chain
that works
down here in the calculations section
everything is going to be based off of a
string so we're going to get requests
get Cal wanted and we're going to ask it
if ad is the name for that string and if
it is just go requests get number one
plus plus number two and this is just
going to show them on the screen plus
equal sign
and then we can just take this and add
these two numbers together so that's a
quick and dirty way to get that
information and that's just going to
shoot it on the screen this is going to
be capitalised of course there we are
else if they did not send a string ad
like you see right here well real simple
we're just going to say well I'm not
going to worry about it let's let the
next object in the chain calculate it or
figure it out and we're just going to
pass them that number object called
request file save and you're gonna see
the only thing that's really going to
change is let's go into subtract numbers
right here and you can see everything is
exactly the same just like before the
only difference is here we're gonna
check to see if sub was passed along and
here we're going to subtract from it and
then you're also going to see the same
thing is going to be true for malt
numbers there you can see malt is being
passed over and here we're doing a
multiplication instead of subtractions
or additions and then I'm going to go
into divide numbers Java and actually do
this all from the beginning except I'm
just going to copy this because not much
is going to change either even though
this is a completely different one
divide numbers all the same the only
thing is we're going to type in here div
and here we're going to put in a
division sign and here we're going to
put in a division sign so that's going
to handle those divisions and then down
here else what we can do is print out a
command I mean this is just the basics
of how this works you can use this for
numerous different things it's basically
just how to pass the buck to other
objects is the whole entire idea of
using this pattern which is very very
useful so we all can print out an error
message if none of those other things
work alright so there we are we're done
let's jump in here and test this guy so
let's go test calc chain and the
is going to be public and all the code
is available underneath the video if you
want to really learn this stuff go get
it heavily commented to help you
understand what's going on here
there we are arcs and then what we're
going to do is create our chain objects
so calc 1 is going to equal 2 new add
numbers this is really where all the
magic happens
and we need to do this for all of our
potential calculation objects come to
calc 3 and calc 4 and then this is going
to be subtract malt and divide so we are
we have all those set up inside of here
and then next I'm going to tell each
object where to forward the data if it
can't process the request so we're going
to go chain calc 1 set next chain which
is in every single one of these objects
that implement the chain interface like
that and then we're going to do that for
three of these guys so the second one
and the third one and then this is just
going to be three and this is going to
be four and that's just going to pass
everything to the right place and then
we're just going to define the data in
the number of objects and send it to the
first object in the chain so just go
numbers request is equal to new numbers
and let's say we want to pass it a 4 a 2
and add file save and then we're just
going to go chain calc 1 which is the
beginning of our chain to find that and
pass request which is the numbers object
to it and let it do its job that's it
execute see what happens and there you
can see 4 plus 2 is equal to 6 and just
as easily let's go multiply didn't
really have to change anything execute
it again 4 times 2 is equal to 8 and
what happens if we would do something
like type in pow
I'll save execute and there you go you
get a little bit of an error message
only works for add subtract multiply and
divide so there it is there's the chain
of responsibility design pattern whole
bunch of things you could play with
inside of there leave any questions
comments or requests below otherwise the
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
