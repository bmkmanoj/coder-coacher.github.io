3 of my wordpress a newspaper theme
tutorial in this tutorial I'm going to
finish all the HTML and CSS that we need
to create this really nice wordpress
theme and the reason why I keep doing
these wordpress tutorials is this
wordpress tutorial series has led the
more people being employed than anything
else that i have done from all the
emails i've received from you guys I
believe that employers are hiring people
right now who understand how to program
wordpress and i'm going to provide you
with continuing tutorials on this
subject if you haven't seen part 1 in
this tutorial series in which i created
this simple theme you should definitely
watch that first then you will be able
to create more complicated themes like
we have right here so i'm just going to
jump right into the code and it will
proceed from where we are from the last
tutorial to where we are today and as
well as i provide a link to a tutorial
on how to create this featured content
tool we have up here and also a link
back to part 1 of this tutorial series
okay so now we're over into the code i'm
going to make changes here to this code
on the left side and you're going to
watch how it changes over here on the
right side and this is the way I program
I do HTML then I go in and clean up the
CSS so we're going to come down here to
post list that's this stuff right here
and I'm going to clean it up and
basically here with this lorem ipsum i'm
just going to cut off the end of it
that's all I'm going to do and I don't
need this break statement in here
anymore so that's gone it's all I did
was cut that from the previous tutorial
I'm gonna leave click for more inside of
here then I'm going to come down to
image source and i'll link out to a
picture of a shark featured content
images okay i'll text i'm just going to
type in shark like i said this is all
going to change whenever we get this all
together but for now this works and this
is actually going to be 85 85 and i'm
going to leave everything else they're
the same and actually I'm going to copy
this guy right here and then I'm going
to delete all of the old content from
the previous theme that we had then I'm
going to look and see exactly how many
of these we need we need four of them so
that works I'm going to come in here
just paste those four times all that
that I just showed you right there if we
file save that jump over here you can
see that this pretty much is fixed I'm
going to have to jump over into my home
CSS file and find title post title
background color and change this to FFF
that's white now if i'll save that jump
over here and you can see that
everything is real
looking everything's all set up here
pretty much exactly the same as what we
had here so now I got to create this
bottom part and jump over into index
down here to the end of this UL
unordered list and then before this div
closes and all of the code used in this
tutorial is available in a link in the
underbar so i'm going to create another
div and i'm going to give it class more
posts and i'm going to close this div
off put in a little mark in here and of
more posts div and that just allows me
to easily see where this dev opens and
when it closes then inside of it i'm
going to create another div class is
equal to recent post give it a name i'm
going to create h3 tag give it a class
recent and i give all these things class
names so that i can easily change them
and edit them with CSS post title goes
here again this is going to be dynamic
whenever i get this all fixed up and i'm
going to close that div off there and
you could actually do this again copy
paste end of this is going to be recent
posts then i'm going to create an image
source it's going to be equal to
includes like I said I this is the way
that I create themes I couldn't find any
other video tutorials on how other
people create things so far as I'm
concerned this is the way to do it or at
the very least that's what works for me
alt is equal to and I'm just going to
call this polar bear with is equal to
150 pixels I eat sequel to 150 pixels
recent image and close off that image
tag very close to being done and then
after the image I'm going to come in
here create a paragraph give it a class
named recent ex or then I just need some
lorem ipsum i'm just going to scroll up
here and grab some of that scroll back
down then just paste that in there like
i said before that's just a placeholder
then i'm going to skip to the next line
create a link h reference and i'm going
to leave it empty create a class it's
going to be called click for more and
i'm just going to put more inside of
here and close off that link tag and
close off the paragraph tag then i'm
going to have to select everything these
tips right here and i'm going to have to
create copies of these so i'm going to
jump over here you can see here we need
eight of them going to go one two three
five six seven and that's seven and
eight from the original file save it
reload it and you can see there is all
the stuff out there on the screen but
it's not been styled so I need to go in
there and properly style it so I'm going
to jump over into home dot CSS scroll
way down to the bottom and start doing
all the CSS styling that is needed for
this guy so we got recent posts which is
that day of that surrounds everything
I'm going to give it a font of 13 pixels
wide 1.4 Georgia and Sarah text color
666 which is a grey adding com 10 pixels
and then right three pixels padding
bottom of 15 pixels I'm just lining up
this div so it looks nice adding left
three pixels background color is going
to be white and the width of the day
there's going to be 160 pixels shows
that so that I can have eight on the
screen that look real nice float left
that's just going to make all the divs
glow to the left side of the screen text
alarm is also going to be left spell
that right inside of the div margin left
is going to be equal to five pixels
margin right is going to be equal to
five pixels and margin comp is going to
be equal to negative 10 pixels so let's
file save that reload this boinking you
can see everything's lined up real
nicely there is one extra one in here
I'm going to have to delete that out but
you can see if you jump over here the
only thing that's really messed up is
the title so we have to go in there and
fix that and get rid of this one extra
one don't know how that slipped in there
and let's jump in here and fix the final
thing which is recent title this is also
why it makes sense to give everything a
name like recent title instead of title
one title to title three because I've
seen a lot of people do that color give
it a blue color dark blue adding 0
pixels margin left of 0 pixels text
transform upper case we saw previously
this is just going to force the text to
be shown in upper case and the font is
going to be bold 13 pixels line hunt 17
pixels helvetica sans-serif I like that
and that's closed off file save it jump
over here reload it and you can see
everything is lined up perfectly so the
only thing I got to do now is fix the
footer so to do that we need to jump
into index and come down to the footer
area now I'm actually going to steal
some information from the sidebar here
to just make this real easy to work with
so copy this guy right here scroll down
the bottom go into my footer area and
I'm going to create a div class is equal
to Twitter content is its name put an h3
tag inside of here and I'm just going to
say pages again later on this will be
dynamic actually very very soon next
tutorial everything's going to start
becoming a lot more dynamic paste that
inside of there they've closed the devil
and of footer content and then I want
three of those and paste paste and then
just change one more thing really like
that I'll save it jump over here reload
it well you can see everything lined up
over here we simply have these bullets
and things are a little bit mangled so
what's that mean we need to jump into
CSS and fix it up so I'm going to jump
into style dot CSS lose that off come
down here to the footer area background
colors fine text-align center is
perfectly fine text color White's fine
this is all fine okay so we don't need
do anything there so what do we need to
change we need to change footer content
text align but we want that to be a line
to the left and it's this the div that
I'm working on right now we want each
one of those boxes to be 300 pixels
padding on left it's going to be 10
pixels so we can separate everything
apart and I'm bottom it's going to be 15
pixels and we want to float all these
guys to the left side of the screen
inside of that div and then I need to
perform certain actions to get rid of
that actually what's this file save this
just so you can see how this progresses
okay see now everything's lined up real
nice and neat when we just go to
remember those bullets not a problem
footer content UL li list style in a
Winnie and that gets rid of the bullets
margin and we get rid of those bullets
we need to also move these words over as
you can see here move about and
communications over so what are we going
to do we're going to change the margin
left we're going to put negative 30
pixels inside in there I'll save it and
reload it and you can see right here on
your screen that I was able to perfectly
turn what we started out with into
exactly what I said
gonna create so that's how you lay out
all the HTML and CSS for an extremely
complicated theme in the next couple
tutorials I'm going to turn this HTML
and CSS into a wordpress theme that's
going to have all kinds of plugins and
all kinds of neat tools leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
