tutorial on how to do a whole bunch of
things in facebook but we're going to
really focus in on the three different
ways to use the like button inside of
your website which would be to just
simply link to your personal page on
facebook also how to link to your
website using a like button and also how
to like individual pages on your website
so the users on your website are going
to have the ability to actually like
individual articles and on top of that
i'm going to show you how to use the
Open Graph protocol to make your website
part of the Facebook network and I'm
going to answer a whole bunch of other
questions that you guys have sent me
over the last couple days first let's
jump into the like button the easiest
way to add your like button to your
WordPress site is just simply to come in
here and let's say facebook.com forward
slash new think tank this is silly silly
easy alright so just enter in your
Facebook page or whatever you want zoom
in here a little bit and then you can
choose to either have the send button or
not have it you can choose all your
different options whatever you want to
put on there you can define your overall
width make sure it shows up you can
choose to show the faces instead of just
the names and you could also change your
different color schemes and even your
font and after you do all that you click
on get code remember this is super super
easy and you're going to select what
pops up on his screen here hit OK jump
over into widgets underneath of
appearance inside of wordpress if you
can't see this you can watch this full
screen high-def and then choose a widget
where you want it to go put a title in
and paste the code in there and then hit
save of course and that's it now you
have your facebook like button in your
widget section but now I'm going to show
you something a lot neater which is in
regard to how to actually link to each
individual page on your website this is
something really cool i'm going to open
up my code section and inside of
functions PHP and if you don't know
where that is i'm going to show it to
you right now just come in here to the
wordpress dashboard and under appearance
again go to editor click on that and
over on the right side of your screen
one of these guys is going to say
functions.php underneath of it you're
going to click on that and then inside
of this code area here you can see my
code right
here from my facebook button and I'm
going to go through here bit by bit and
explain exactly what it does and you can
see that i just typed all this in inside
a functions dot PHP very very close to
the end so let's jump over into the code
area and of course all this code is
available in a link in the underbar so
you don't even have to understand it to
be able to use it but i'm going to go
into explaining it either way so i'm
going to create a function again it goes
in function dot PHP i'm going to call it
ntt facebook like just a basic function
here then what i want to do is I want to
get the current web page that the user
is on I want to get that exact URL so
I'm going to go current create myself a
variable inside of here and if you want
to get the page that they currently are
on just type in server racket and type
in server underscore name bracket dot
server bracket and what this is going to
do is it's going to return the full web
address for whatever page they are
currently on on your website case we got
that inside of there now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to jump back over
into the like button section and get all
the code for the button it doesn't
really matter what I put here you're
going to see why in a minute let's just
say I say new think tank calm and this
situation i'm going to say standard so i
get a little bit more information here
i'm going to jump down here hit get code
just like before i'm going to select all
of this code copy it back in my text
editor or you could be doing this right
in your website itself and the editor
that it's provided through wordpress and
i create another variable i'm going to
call this FB like code is equal to i'm
going to put a single quote and i'm
going to paste in all of that code that
facebook provide it and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to close off all
these sections here put all this on one
line and as I'm putting this in here I'm
going to put a backslash in front of any
single quotes so that PHP is aware of
where the original single quote is
that's what I'm putting these
backslashes in there it allows me to use
it but at the same time the PHP will not
get confused tin you going through here
putting backslashes right before head
another backslash another backslash and
then right where you get to data dash h
reference we're going to close this off
with a single quote right like that and
I'll leave all this information here i'm
going to go FB like code is equal to
take the variable in PHP if you want to
add on
additional information what we're going
to add on to this is the actual URL page
that they are currently on so there you
go so that's going to automatically
insert that inside of there and then I
don't need this anymore so I'm going to
cut that out of there and we're going to
go FB light code just going to copy this
right here put that inside of it single
quote right there I'm going to come down
here put another single quote and then
close that guy off so now this is going
to automatically create a like button
depending upon whatever page the
person's on and we'll give them the
capability to like individual articles
on your website which is really cool and
not to complicate and then at the end
this is what we call a wordpress
shortcode i'm going to go FB like code
i'm going to close this guy off and what
this is going to allow you to do is I'm
going to type in add shortcode nttf ble
okay and then here is going to be the
function that is going to be called so
I'm just going to copy that paste that
in there and what this is going to allow
you to do as a wordpress user is
anywhere you want this like button to
show up on your page you're just simply
going to put this opening bracket nttf
be like right like that and then save
your oros and order your page and the
like button will automatically appear
every time you type in this code
anywhere and that is all you're going to
need to do to be able to create custom
like buttons for all of your posts and
pages on WordPress and to just simply
have a light code shortcode whatever you
want to call it like you had before
that's only going to link to an
individual page well I kind of
dismantled that you just come in here
again click get code so if you wanted to
link for example to your website and
allow people to tell their friends about
how great to wear your website is well
FB like code you're just going to come
in here and delete all of this stuff
paste but closing quote right like that
and now you're able to create a specific
like button for your specific website
and of course you can come in here and
change this to facebook com /and
whatever your username is on facebook to
be able to allow people to like that as
well another thing that I hear all the
time is people want to know what their
user ID on facebook is and what their
user ID for their pages are well if you
just simply type in graph dot facebook
com as i have here on the screen /and
your user ID on facebook it's going to
kick back your ID
as well as your name and this is all
public information it's available to
anybody and if I wanted to get the user
ID and some information on my page I
just type in the user ID for that hit
enter and you can see right there is the
user ID for my new think tank page on
Facebook so that's kind of cool another
thing that's really neat as you'll then
be able to track things on facebook.com
forward slash insights and I just set
this up an hour ago that's why there's
not that much site and engagement and
information regards to that you can also
tie into the Open Graph protocol by
simply putting in a couple meta tags as
you can see right here and again this is
facebook.com forward slash insights what
you want to do is you want to copy all
of this code this meta tag for example
and put it over in your head or dot PHP
section this will automatically hook you
into the Facebook network so we're going
to copy this it and right here and what
this is going to represent is an admin
and let's say I do this for a new think
tank it's not going to matter calm and
then you can link with you can have
administrators be these other different
pages inside of facebook or what have
you I'm just going to cancel in this
situation and I'm going to open up my
text editor and again this would be in
Hetar dot PHP where you would put all
this information and you see over here
is where i define FB colon admins which
is exactly what I just copied off of
that page say exact same thing and the
content part here is my user ID on
facebook and I also linked in my page ID
and that is new think tank 20 8571 this
number right here I actually got from
facebook so if we go in sites for your
website and we type in comp new think
tank you can see it's going to pop out
this meta tag right here and just like I
have right there that's going to allow
me to connect not only me but also my
personal website inside of facebook it
allows it very easily for people to
transfer information other things you
can define is the title of your web page
that you're defining what exactly this
thing is in this situation it's a
website the URL for your web page you
could put in a description for your web
page again for facebook you can define
an email address you can define an image
that you want Facebook to use to
represent your website you could also
put in phone numbers
latitude longitude street addresses
postal codes and country names as well
as a couple other really really really
bizarre things so there's a whole bunch
of different things you can do with
Facebook and how you can integrate your
website to better work with facebook if
you have any questions or comments leave
them in the comment section below
