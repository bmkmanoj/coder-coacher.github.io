specifically and exactly show you how I
lost 35 pounds in just two months today
I'm going to go through the exact best
of the best foods I came about this list
by looking at nutrient labels on the
sides of food packaging and put them all
in spreadsheets over a thousand of them
and analyze all the information I got
first off the bad things here diet these
are the things I aimed to eliminate fat
cholesterol sodium what our hydrates and
sugar what is specifically not tell you
to eliminate carbohydrate or sugar
altogether but you should try to aim at
consuming good carbohydrates and sugar
which I will show you exactly how to do
the good things your diet calories that
give you energy 5 are they eliminate
waste from our bodies and lower your
overall cholesterol protein repairs are
herbs vitamin A gives us healthy skin
hair and helps and dim light that are
necessary for bone growth in tooth
development
vitamin C helps you to maintain
capillaries bones and teeth iron helps
to deliver oxygen throughout the body
and I along with other things and of
course there are numerous now onto the
list this list was compiled by
eliminating the bad things I just
mentioned and looking for those that
increase the positives most of all and
after a quantified that information I
found that is my belief that
blackberries are the absolute best food
you can eat and this is in order and
second one list is jalapeno peppers peas
corn and eggplant so forth and so on
you can obviously pause this to look at
this list but it is in order
there are additional shows 51 just
because that's the way it worked down I
also want to show you here you can see
mozzarella she is not fat as listed what
I did with this list was I trying to
include a certain number of Jesus
certain number of bagels breads cereals
even different spices so that the list
wasn't just like a giant list of
vegetables and fruit which wouldn't be
useful to anyone and you can see here
additional lists I pointed out specific
manufacturers only in those cases in
which I thought they provided a superior
product like for example the Del Monte
tomatoes and a can with low sodium first
here we'll look at foods that make you
feel full jalapeno peppers asparagus
romaine lettuce broccoli green peppers
these are all of a different foods you
can consume them that will fool your
body into believing it's fold even
whatever it is not these right here are
those foods with the highest amount of
fiber per overall calorie and you'll see
number one the list is all cream brand
but I'm not being paid by them it just
ends up that that's the way it worked
out now we'll look at the highest amount
of protein per calorie for all of the
nutrition labels I can put it into my
spreadsheet applesauce being very
specific to pots
natural applesauce came out number one
on the list so this proves you can
consume protein without eating meat of
any type not only that but it's the most
superior in regards to protein per
calorie foods with the highest amount of
fiber and the lowest sodium who actually
find our knock in the product that has
both have a lot of fiber also has a lot
of sodium jalapeno peppers again one
here but there's definitely additional
ones here with corn peas eggplant
granola is a grain that makes for a
great rice substitute foods with the
highest fiber and Veloz carbohydrates
bran buds wins here again followed by
asparagus northern beans broccoli and so
or people always ask me what is the best
bread that I can eat I listed here on
the left the best bread and down on the
right the best cereals the second on the
list
Bob's Red Mill 10 green hot cereal can
be eaten with water the other two more
than likely you're gonna want to eat
with either skim fat-free milk or with
some sort of soy milk the best cheese
don't like to tell the people this but
it does it is actually the truth that
most Jesus that are healthy don't taste
particularly good haha but if you really
really want to lose weight every time
you think about eating cheese just think
about how much money you're taking off
and how much healthier you're gonna be
but if you definitely want to get some
cheese in your diet these four here farm
pretty good cheese's overall and pretty
healthy overall some great cheats I
listed here salsa is number one on the
list especially if you make at home made
because you want to eliminate this
sodium that's found in high doses the
most
store-bought salsas I love pickles apple
sauce there's different fruit about
different types of smoothies and so
forth that are also listed here best
vitamin A foods it's very easy to
consume the total number of vitamins you
need with just 1/4 of a cup of carrots
you can get a hundred percent of your
vitamin A requirements so that you can
see here it's very very easy to not
overload your diet just trying to pull
in a couple different vitamins and you
can see the same here with vitamin C
foods
FDA recommendations my personal diet I
try to eliminate fat altogether and my
cholesterol intake it's excruciating we
love my sodium I sometimes have a
problem went by it I do keep it within
those recommended levels
my overall carbs I don't dwell on like
other diets and my fiber I'd normally
double sometimes even triple that
throughout a day my sugars are normally
pure just want to point out the raw food
diet is that absolutely fabulous diet if
you can get it is I would definitely
recommend it for anything Hamlet but the
major problems with the raw food diet
which is you consume immense amounts of
fruit sugar which is a bad for you by
any means that's great
the negative is that the preparation of
the food takes forever and also it cost
a lot of money because you're actually
consuming large quantities of fruit and
vegetables so if you can handle that raw
food diet is very but otherwise I think
my diet works out a little better the
best foods and meal plans and recipes
are available on my website a new thing
bank.com you are able to get them
totally for free and without any signing
up for anything or anything that just
out there to look at there I list a
hundred dust foods with nutrient data I
give you a one week long meal plan that
is extremely detailed and I also include
70 healthy recipes I would put those in
these videos but I think they'd be very
boring and tedious so I hope you enjoy
this diet and lose lots of weight a
little better if you have any questions
feel free to leave me a comment thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
