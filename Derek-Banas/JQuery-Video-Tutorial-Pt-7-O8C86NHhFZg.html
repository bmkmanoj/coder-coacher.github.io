my jQuery video tutorial today I'm going
to show you how to pass text and XML
from the server dynamically using
javascript and jQuery I'll also show you
how to call PHP scripts on the server
and have them pretty much do anything
that PHP can do dynamically on your
websites if you look over here on the
right side of the screen here is our
finished product it looks really simple
and I kept it that way just so
everything is understandable here I'm
going to get some text and put it right
there from a text file on the server and
you can see there that is here I'm going
to perform some multiplications using a
PHP script and you can see that it did
that multiplication right there and here
I'm going to grab some xml data from the
server as well oh the code that i use
here is available in a link in the
underbar and of course it is free so
what we have basically over here is just
some HTML let me close the finished
product and this is just the HTML with
three buttons
that's all it is then of course I have a
paragraph here this is where the text is
going to go from the text file and it is
inside of a paragraph with an ID name of
first then I got my buttons that I got
right here here is where I'm going to
put the result of the multiplication
inside of this span and then down here
in this div with the ID customers is
where I'm going to post my XML data so
what do I got to do here first it's
really simple don't let it confuse you
course I bought my jQuery library right
here loaded and here I set it up so that
this function is called whenever the
document is ready for my jQuery code to
execute so I need to bind these buttons
this is real simple
could do very cool things using jQuery
that would be much harder if you just
use straight JavaScript so what I got to
do I'm binding this button to a function
so the dysfunction is called whenever
the button is clicked and of course I
got to put a comma in all right so I got
to do that for the other two buttons no
prob fils k and put two inside here and
three and I know this is bad names this
is kind of so that you can look over
here and say oh that's button one and
that's button two just the sort of
things we wouldn't do in the real world
that you do in video tutorials to
hopefully make them more understandable
then I'm going to call another function
called get double from server and then
here I'm going to call get xml from
server and these are all my functions
okay so i'm going to create those
functions
I'm going to come down aside here scroll
this a bit create the function get info
from server it's going to pull text
information from a file on the server
okay got that it's not going to be
passed any properties and I'm going to
call the Ajax method that's inside of
jQuery and makes our life beautiful and
easy because it doesn't care what
browser we're working with but I do need
to define the type of request that I'm
going to make here it's options either
get or post and I'm going to use git and
then I also have to define the URL for
the text file that I want to pull
information from and that's it so that's
where it's going to get my information
from and then upon success what function
I want to call to handle that and I also
could put in error which would be the
function that is called
if an error occurs and I could also put
in data type but I don't need to do that
right now because we use text by default
and I'm going to show you some more on
those guys here later on in the tutorial
okay that's it right there just pulled
some text from there so I got to create
the other function which is called post
to page post to page it's going to be
sent the data from that text file it's
also going to be sent a status message
basically to tell me if it was a success
or not and then inside of the element
labeled first I'm going to place the
text that I received all right like that
and then close that off and that's
basically all I got to do to pull
information from a text file if I'll
save that reload it waiting for message
this text is from the server and the
actual file is right here this text is
from the server ok so that's how you
pull text from a text file on the server
so let's get more impressive here I'm
going to show you how to call a function
or a program called get double dot PHP
it's PHP file and what we're going to do
is pass get double information from that
is actually entered inside of here and
it's going to execute over on the server
so I got to create a function called get
double from server you could make calls
to a database you can make calls to
anything you can do with PHP if you do
it this way you can do it dynamically so
I'm going to say in span I'm going to
call the load function it's just going
to load the results that are sent back
from our program that's called get
double dot PHP into this span
that's what this guy does so it's going
to pass all this information that is
stored in the form which is the name of
my form hash tag inside of their home
and serialized array function which is
going to pass all the information that
is in the form over to get double dot
PHP and get doubles going to figure out
everything from that point on and really
that is all that I need to do there I'll
show you what the PHP code looks like
that is going to be inside of here and
let's just say keep this simple I'm
going to put it inside comment areas out
of here so this is the actual PHP code
if you don't know PHP of course I have a
PHP tutorial you can watch that learn
PHP also so what this guy does
number two double it makes a call to
post and it's going to receive things
labeled as data from that array and then
echo post data and all of this
information is then going to be saved in
that span everything that I echo out
here double off it's going to be equal
to number
ooh double x to write like that and
write like that so that is the PHP code
that is actually going to be sent see
this is a get double PHP this is how
short it is and what's doing is
multiplying times two and then echo is
going to pass back the result of that
okay so that's what that is and if I
found save it jump over here and then
type in 65 you can see 65 times two
equals 130 so that's exactly what that
PHP code did right there and that's
actually what this function right here
did so that's how easy it is to talk to
PHP programs back on the server so now
what do I got to do I got to get myself
some XML information call this get XML
from server and it's not going to be
fast anything scroll this up so you can
see it a little bit better and what are
we going to do again we're going to call
ourselves the Ajax function ejects or
method if you will type I'm going to use
get again go to find the URL that I'm
going to meet Colin it's going to be
called customers dot XML here's data
type I have to define it as XML because
by default it thinks it's text success
I'm gonna call function called post a
page to write like that and again I'm
not going to find the error okay
please pick now I need to define another
function called post to
page two and it's going to be past the
data that's sent from that XML file and
here I'm going to use the find method to
search through all the XML data that's
sent back to me data which is the data
represents the XML text and I'm going to
look for customer and for each one of
these pieces of data I'm going to call a
function on it and just so you know what
this actually looks like here is
customers XML C customer right here
customers right here first name last
name streets data data data
so that's what an XML file looks like
and this is the actual XML file that is
located on the server okay so now I'm
going to define a variable it's going to
be called ID and I'm going to call this
and I'm looking for the ID attribute
inside of it and I'm going to save that
as ID here and save myself some time on
a copy this and create six of these guys
right like that and then this one's
going to be called first name copy that
paste that in this is going to be called
last name Street city and zip so those
are the names of the tags that surround
all that information in the XML file and
then what I just need to do yeah just
show you something different div class
equal to first name name div I know
there's easier ways to do this dot HTML
call the append to function and then
perform that operation on the day of
called customers and let's just copy
this paste fist fist is and then I'm
going to come in here and type in last
and then last name and then everything
else stays the same and type in street
type in street city city zip and zip so
I'm doing a state creating these
variables based off the information that
I pulled in from the XML file saving it
there and then like for example here
where I have last name I'm taking last
name and I'm putting it on the web page
dynamically and I'm appending that
information into the div called
customers okay here's customers down
here this is where I'm appending that
information so that is what's going on
there and then after I'm done of this
need to close that off close that off
close that off and then close off the
entire function okay so if I file save
that and jump over here
reload the page and click on get XML
data you can see that it did just that
it grabbed all that XML information over
from the server and put it here on the
screen so there is how to pass text XML
and called PHP scripts on the server and
pass information dynamically now you
know how to do ajax
fumé any questions or comments leave
them in the comment section below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
