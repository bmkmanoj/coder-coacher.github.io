teach you how to fool people into
thinking you are psychic and these are
the real tricks that psychics use
whenever they sit you down in front on
those glass balls and supposedly predict
your thoughts I wrote this because Mary
Beth wrote in and asked me do you have
any psychic tools I can use to act like
I can read people's mind if there's
anything you would like me to do a
tutorial on leave it in the comments
section below and I will do it I'm going
to show you how to trick people into
thinking you know a psychic I'll then
read your mind I'll and show you how to
read minds by watching my movements this
is a technique used by real psychics
I'll then show you how to guess which
number a person is thinking whenever you
ask them to think of a number between
one and ten again using real psychic
techniques and then I'll show you how to
guess what name the person is thinking
of again using real psychic techniques
here's a trick I used to use in college
whenever I would walk up the girls and
bars and I wanted to entertain the first
I would set up with a friend ahead of
time and ask them please to answer the
telephone whenever I call then I'm going
to proach a girl and say hey I have a
psychic friend and hand them a deck of
cards and ask them to pick a card and
then tell them that my psychic friend on
the phone would be able to predict the
exact card they would have in their hand
I would then have my friend whenever the
phone was rung start rattling off
numbers two three four five and whenever
they got to the number and I would act
like the phone was ringing during this
period of time and then whenever they
got to the number i would say hello
psychic friends then they know for
example it was a five then I would have
them start saying clubs hearts spades
diamonds and at that point in time I
would say please predict my friends card
and hand the telephone over to the girl
I then figured out an even better way of
doing this now what I would have them do
is whenever my friend would start
rambling off the numbers two three four
five I would make a statement that
begins with the proper suit so for
example I would say if it was diamonds
do you have the psychic there and then
immediately hand the telephone so
literally it was seconds as far as this
girl now or if it was clubs i would say
can you get the psychic say what card
this lady is holding or have this i
could get on the phone all depending
upon the suit so I literally was there
saying one sentence as far as the person
or the market thought and now i'm going
to read your mind i know for a fact that
you are often critical of yourself some
people find you hard to deal with
you're a very nice person once the
people get to know you deep down you
have a need to have other people like
you you have considerable abilities that
you have trouble using to get ahead at
times you have doubts as to whether you
have made the right decision in the past
or not also while you act as if you're
in control you often feel very insecure
you're proud of the fact that you're an
independent thinker and don't accept
others beliefs without proof you prefer
a certain amount of variety and change
in life you know deep down that some of
your aspirations are unrealistic and you
don't like feeling as if you are
restricted or limited from doing what
you want so what exactly did I do there
I just stated numerous truisms that most
anyone would agree with and of course
acting counts meaning if I was actually
doing this to you in real life I would
be straining and acting like I was
trying to read your mind as I would go
through this and as you stack these
things up what you have to understand is
psychologically if you do something to
somebody that they find in any way odd
or they can't quite figure out how you
did it slowly they actually start deep
down believing that you might actually
have psychic abilities and this is what
I would do I would start off with the
telephone trick and then I would jump
into these truisms and by the time i was
done the people would often think at the
very least I was entertaining and in
comparison to the other people that were
hanging around the middle or I was a lot
more interesting and worth spending
steimle I touched on the I accessing
clues in other NLP and psychology
tutorials but basically what you do here
is you can figure out what a person is
thinking or fold them into thinking you
can anyway by watching where their eyes
move whatever you ask a personal
question that forces them to remember
something they saw they will normally
look up into the right up into your
right so these eyeballs are looking at
you if they're remembering something
they heard they'll look sideways and if
they're remembering something they felt
or something that they did they look
down and to your left as you can see in
this diagram so a psychic trick that is
often used is a psycho Google say
something like I want to get in tune
with you and then they'll say something
like I want you to either see now
something you've seen that is bothering
you and then they'll say something like
or think about something you've heard
that might sound right and if their eyes
are not moving the way that you want
them
move I mean these are set up sentences
that are just in essence programming the
eyes to move if they are not moving the
way you want them to just repeat the
sentence and tell them that you need
them to really go there and
re-experience the moment and then you
could say something like maybe you feel
something that occurred to you is more
important and then you say make your
choice on which of these three things is
most important and I will tell you which
is most important and then you just
simply figure out where their eyes move
and then you guess whether they're
remembering something they saw something
they heard or something they felt and
remember if they're remembering
something they saw up into your right
remembering something they heard
sideways or to your right remembering a
feeling down and to their left and if
you doubt or it's just not working just
guess that they're remembering something
they saw because a large majority of
people do that so how do you guess
whenever a person's trying to figure out
a number between 1 to 9 well more than
likely the number is going to be 7 this
is just based off of averages and
statistics and it just comes down to the
fact that most of the time you ask
somebody to think of a number between 1
&amp;amp; a 9 they just automatically think of 7
but what do most psychics do they
actually read lips because a large
majority of people whenever you ask them
to think of this number they will
actually speak it out under their breath
and if they don't speak it out then you
need to say something like I need to
hear the number or think about what it
sounds like that's what they're doing
whenever they are probing with those
sentences when they're talking to a
person they're literally trying to get
them to the point where they can read
their lips and just so that you know the
lips will round like they're making aww
sound whenever they're speaking one the
tongue touches the back of the upper
teeth and the roof of the mouth whenever
they are trying to say to the tongue
appears between the teeth with a 3 with
a 4 bottom lip touches the top teeth and
they make a slight frown 5 bottom lip
touches the top teeth and they make a
slight smile obviously you need to
memorize these things it's not wrong way
that hard though I never said it would
be extremely easy to trick people into
thinking you're a psychic I mean it's a
gift it's something that's developed
over time but this is exactly how it's
done with a six tongue lightly touches
the roof of the mouth and they make a
slight smile with a seven tongue
slightly touches the roof of the mouth
and they make a slight frown with an ad
lower lip bends in
a smile and nine you'll clearly see the
bottom of the tongue and I the link in
the underbar that shows you how to read
lips for letters and that is exactly
what you're going to need to memorize if
you want to perform the trick where you
tell the person to think of a specific
persons name and then read lips that's
all they do or you could just state
common names but chances are this isn't
going to work too well or you could
gather a lot of information ahead of
time which would definitely help and I'm
sure is done very often and of court to
properly read their lips you'd ask them
to sit up straight so that you have a
good view of the mouth and then you
would tell them to think of this
person's name and then you could use
what's called an embedded command which
I go over in my hypnosis and psychology
tutorials that I have here on this web
page you could say something like don't
and then pause for a second and then say
say it out loud this will often be just
enough of a trick to get them to say the
person's name so there are a couple ways
to fool people into thinking you are
psychic if you have any questions or
