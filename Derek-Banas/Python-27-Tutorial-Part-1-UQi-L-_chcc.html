python 2.5 through 2.7 tutorial this is
the most requested tutorial that I got
recently in a poll that I put out there
and the reason why I'm doing this even
though I've already done a Python 3
tutorial is there are an immense number
of libraries available with these
different versions of Python and I'm
going to go through a couple of them in
this tutorial first off you're going to
want to install Python 2.7 you're going
to have to go to python org and download
that I trust you can handle that on your
own the ide i'm going to use to develop
everything in is called eclipse it's
available at eclipse.org as you can see
right here on the screen very very easy
to install and free you're also going to
want to add on a tool to eclipse called
pydev it's available at pydev dot-org
I'm going to show you here in a second
how to install that and if you get
confused at any point in time and need
any more information if you go to this
site right here it shows how to install
all this stuff but I'm going to show you
here on the screen so let's say I can
trust that you're able to install
Eclipse this is how you hook up pydev
with Eclipse this is a little bit
confusing you click on help and you
click on install new software and then
here you're going to want to actually
type in pydev dot org and then click on
the little pop-up that comes up here on
the screen and you'll want to click
right there and here I want to click on
next just click on the first one and
install that then what you want to do is
click on eclipse up here and you're
going to want to find preferences
somewhere inside of Eclipse you're going
to want to point to your version of
Python just click on new this is the
same for all OSS Eclipse looks the same
as one of the reasons why I use it then
you want to click on browse and you want
to locate the version of python the
interpreter that you installed click on
open and then hit ok ok ok ok so that's
how you set up the whole entire
development platform here that I have in
front of you now to start off your
python coding you're going to have to
tell the terminal that's going to run
your python program the location of the
interpreter once you install it for most
of you it's going to be hash exclamation
point space forward slash USR meaning
user then forward slash python and that
will work for almost all of you if
that is not true then you just want to
find the location where you have the
Python interpreter whenever you tell it
to execute your program it's going to
hit this line and say okay well where do
I execute it oh okay this is where it
goes so that's really the whole point of
this first line of code if you want to
comment anything in Python you just in
python 2.5 through 2.7 put a hash symbol
and this is where you would comment this
is totally ignored by the interpreter or
anything after that hash symbol now what
I'm going to do is create a bunch of
different variables and assign values to
them there's something weird here
if you programmed in the past or this
will look weird in most programming
languages you have to define using the
like for example int that this is going
to be an integer meaning this is going
to be a variable you can see the errors
popping up this is going to be a
variable that's going to contain a
number that does not have decimal places
in Python you do not do that you create
a variable name and it'll either start
off with an underscore or a letter and
it can contain numbers if you want to do
that inside of your code but you don't
have to whitespace is very important in
Python and we'll get more into that
later on but basically what you do is
you say okay I want to create a storage
area I want it to have this name and I
wanted to have this value and Python
figures out what type of variable it is
so I'm also going to create what they
call long which is just a long number
again with no decimal places it's called
a long int and as you see here I put an
LT and to force it to become my long end
I'm going to create a float or a number
that does have a decimal place I'm going
to create a string and these names don't
mean anything you don't have to start
off all your strings with this and
floats with word float these are just
arbitrary names that I picked out
creating a string which is just a string
of characters and then creating a
boolean variable which can only contain
either true or false as a value now what
I'm going to do is I'm going to use the
print function and what print does is
prints out whatever follows it onto the
screen that's it if you use Python 3
you're used to everything being
surrounded by double quotes now I could
actually do that with 2.7 but I'm going
to choose not to because it doesn't work
on some of the other versions I'm going
to use a function called type to display
on the screen what type a variable
all these different variables up here
are that's what it does and a function
just is a defined grouping of code that
does certain actions for you don't worry
about that and we'll be getting into it
further if that's at all confusing to
you I'm just gonna copy and paste five
of these guys right there I'm gonna come
up here copy this so I'm doing is
creating storage areas when I was
creating this tutorial I didn't know if
I should just talk about what's
different between three and these other
versions of Python I decided just to go
from the ground up okay so I did all
this and I'm gonna run this code that's
all I have to do and see it's of type
int long float string boolean what
happens if I take this out off of here
let's see now it's an integer not for
long if I put enough zeros in here see
now it became of type long int and all
it means is it's just a gigantic integer
it's best to put the owl in there just
to make sure I'll give you a couple
boolean examples now like that let's
create another boolean we call it
boolean too and we give it the value of
false I'm going to show you what are
called boolean operators and this is
just ways to work with boolean variables
one of the boolean operators is and and
another one is or you can see it's
highlighting the text here
that's notifying you that these are
keywords so let's run this guy again
what's it doing alright so boolean e^x
true and boolean 2 is has a value of
false what it's doing is it's saying if
both of these are true then print true
on the screen episode it prints false on
the screen and it says if either of
these are true that's what or says then
print true on the screen and if you
proceed a boolean operator with the
keyword not it's going to print the
opposite so for example you see here
this is false so it prints true and if I
put X in here and run it again now it's
going to print false and if that's at
all confusing don't worry about it
you'll catch up to it here soon enough
I'm going to show you different ways you
can work with the numbers all I'm doing
is creating two integers assigning a
value to them and two floats remember
just it's a number with a decimal place
all it is nothing that confusing and I'm
going to show you different ways you can
mess around with numbers inside Python
I'm going to divide 99 by 7 remember
these are two integers see what happens
14
that's wrong this actually should be
14.1 for why did it do that if you
divide an integer by an integer it will
spit out an integer it will ignore any
decimal places that follow it so how
could you it around that well could use
another function that will convert these
integers into floats but it's only going
to convert it inside of here it's not
going to permanently convert it into a
float now you see it printed out a float
with the decimal places and so forth and
so on you can convert using an int
function and go in here and convert a
float into an integer and you can do the
same thing with putting bll and strings
you can see it converted that was seven
even though the value is seven point
nine if you convert a boolean value
that's true into an integer you get the
value of one and if it was false you'd
kick back the number zero here you can
print out the screen whether one number
is bigger than another number
see false came out let's copy this I'm
going to go through all the other
different comparison operators that are
available to you there's also less than
greater than or equal to less than or
equal to not equal to or equal to and
whenever you run these it's going to
spit out the boolean operators you could
also go and assign this boolean DX is
equal to you could actually assign this
value back to this guy just to show you
what it does and it would print out
false there because they're not equal to
each other of course you can also add
these guys or subtract them or multiply
them divide the modulus will return the
remainder of a division and for run that
you can see all of the different math
functions that are available and built
into Python one of the reasons why I'm
doing this tutorial is because of the
fact that Python the two series has so
many libraries that are available to it
I'm going to show you how to import a
library now what you could do is go in
fourth
math is a common library that people use
and now I have access to all of the
different pre-built functions that come
with this library and all I had to do to
get them was just type in import now
let's say for example I want to print
out the screen the square root of n one
that's all I need to do
see they're popped up on the screen but
let's say I only want this function
right here I only want square roots
there's no no reason to import the whole
entire math library and make my code
longer and my files bigger than they
have to be well is there a way to just
get that yes I just say from math import
where a root and I have to come down
here chop this little guy off and then
hit f5 and that's just another way to
import just a single function from the
math library but what if you want to
allow users to actually send you
information inside of a program well
we're just going to create ourselves a
variable that's going to store the value
that the user sends to you followed by
equals raw input this is just simply
input inside of Python 3 but either way
this is one of the ways they're
different and I'm not going to keep
bringing up the different things little
different about them there's actually
not terribly many things whenever it
comes down to it all right and what this
is going to do is print out that string
what is your name and then I'm going to
print that back to the screen exactly
what they presented to me as their name
and all I'm doing is putting this string
of text right here followed by whatever
they entered in so let's hit f5 what's
your name enter and it says hello
Derrick pretty nice
I see how it has no space available here
well you can get around that either by
putting a space in here or you could get
rid of that plus sign and put a comma in
there instead and you can see it
automatically puts a space in here
there's many different ways to mess
around with strings and I'm going to
cover that completely in further
tutorials I just kind of wanted to give
you a little bit of an idea of how you
can play around with strings another way
to assign let's say a multi-line string
to a string variable let's just call
this long STR is to use multiple quotes
so 1 2 3 let's print that screen and you
can see it printed out that long series
of text onto my screen but it also
inserted what we call a newline in here
what if I want to get rid of that simple
just put this backslash in here hit f5
and you can see it printed it all right
there
to the screen well you can also save
strings in a couple other different ways
so let's say you see here I use double
quotes I could also use single quotes
show you how to do multi quoted strings
that cover multiple different lines
still a string see how it popped it up
there you can interchange double quotes
or single quotes in any way and the
reason why this is an issue is say you
wanted to do this and you can see
there's errors popping up all over the
place
why are their errors popping up all over
the place because Python doesn't know
where this string ends because you have
a single quote there you have a single
quote there single quote it gets
confused so you can put a double quote
in here and now python is no longer
confused by your code see how are you
doing but let's say you wanted to use a
single quote and double quotes and all
these other different things how would
you be able to do that like let's say
this you demand that this is a single
quote well you can escape out the single
quote by putting a backslash followed by
your single quote backslash and a single
quote like that and you can see now it's
using single quotes and you can also
backslash a bunch of other different
things like let's say string lue and
let's say I want to put a space see this
is what we call a new design backslash n
and probably the only real backslash is
you're going to come in contact with a
lot or of course wanting to be able to
use a backslash inside of your strings
and how you do that is just double
backslash and then of course your quotes
your double quotes and your new lines so
that's a quick quick quick run-through
of a lot of things about Python specific
to python 2.5 through 2.7 I'm going to
continue this tutorial on and it's going
to actually be longer and more in-depth
than my previous Python tutorial if you
have any questions or comments leave
them in comments section below and if
there's anything specific you'd like me
to do with Python in this tutorial leave
that request below I'm gonna pretty
heavily focus this tutorial on digging
information
out of websites however but of course if
you bring up a good example you'd like
to see I could do most definitely also
get into that till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
