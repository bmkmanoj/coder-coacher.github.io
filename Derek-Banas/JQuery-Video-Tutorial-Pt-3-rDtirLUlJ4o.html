my jQuery video tutorial now that I've
chased away most of my potential viewers
with the first two boring videos I will
now reward my favorite people out there
by showing you how to do some really
cool stuff with event handlers and
jQuery on the right side of your screen
you see just a bunch of stuff that
doesn't really look like anything but as
you see as I click on it I'm now
tracking all my mouse movements and you
can also see if I put my mouse over top
of my image this is automatically
changing here keep your eyes here if I
come down here you can also see that
this change right here as well as a
timestamp was printed out the screen for
when I entered information inside here
and now you're going to see a whole
bunch of other things change and you can
see that that change and when I click on
that submit button that changes when I
click on here that changes if I double
click on this this changes up here and
so forth and so on I'm also going to
show you not only how to bind events to
different items I'm also going to show
you two how to unbind events off of
different elements in a webpage and
what's really cool if you watch down
here and right here if I click on any of
these guys it's automatically going to
tell me what type of element it is or if
I click out here it'll just say body
click inside here body you can see that
all these things are being tracked so
I'm going to show you every event
handler in one tutorial if you want to
see every single event handler here is
the list and I provide a link in the
underbar to this list and also here is
all of the event object properties that
are available to you pretty much going
to show you everything except for Event
Alt key and ctrl key and all these
different little guys but for the most
part you're going to be able to figure
that out because this tutorial is
extremely detailed ok so here is the
basics of what I got and this guy
doesn't do anything we're going to add
events to it going to jump over here and
on the left side of your screen you're
going to see another way to input a
jQuery library or framework whatever you
want to call it this takes it directly
from jQuery and it provides the most
latest version of the jQuery library
automatically for you so that's how you
do that and down here if you saw the
previous tutorials you know that this is
what is going to be called when the
and it's ready to start accepting jQuery
commands and as we go down through here
you can see that I went in and created
all the HTML and gave IDs to everything
that is the only thing that's been done
though I created all the stuff you see
on the right side it has no
functionality which it will very very
soon and I gave all these different
blocks IDs so that's all that's been
done ahead of time that's just to save
me from going absolutely batty and
turning this tutorial into a 30 minute
long ramble okay so I'm going to jump in
here and the very first thing that I'm
going to do is actually bind and event
this button down here called alert on
click and how I do that is I come in
here because this is jQuery I put a
dollar sign and then since it's an ID
called one button I'm going to put a
hash symbol and I'm going to type in one
button right like that and then to bind
an event just type in bind and then I
want to bind a click event to it so when
it's clicked it is going to call a
function call it alert button click and
that's all I have to do now there so
let's show you exactly what alert button
click looks like so I'm going to come
down here I'm still inside of my script
but I'm going to create the alert button
click function so what am I going to do
I type in function alert button click
write like that we're going to start off
very very simple and then we're going to
get more complicated as time goes by
what I'm going to do is if you click
this button I'm just going to open up an
alert box this is what most boring
tutorials do but we're not going to be
boring for long so that's what that guy
does and if you can see here I reloaded
it and this already has that
functionality built in that's all I did
these just couple lines of text here and
I bound an event so in the alert box
opens but you say that's kind of boring
so let's do something a little bit more
jazzy so for example how do you bind
multiple events to something here I'm
going to bind everything to this text
box is called textbox 1 that's the ID
represented inside of it
quote ash text box 1 dot bind and I'm
going to bind a blur event and that just
means whenever somebody leaves the text
box that's going to trigger a non blur
event and whenever that happens I'm
going to call a function called on blur
event and then what I'm going to do and
yes it's legal to do this I'm going to
say bind focus
and that just means whenever click
inside of it it gains focus I'm going to
call another function call it on focus
event and I'm also going to bind another
event on this you can bind as many as
you want on Mouse down it just means
when they click the mouse I'm going to
call on em down event and I'm going to
go create another bind on Mouse up and
if the mouse button goes up I'm going to
call that and then bind change on change
event that means it's changed in any way
alright so I just bound five different
events all on to these guys on to this
one textbox so now I got to create these
functions so that everything works so
I'm just going to come down inside of
here again hopefully I've made these
function names good enough that you
understand exactly what I'm talking
about on blur event I'm going to say
that I want this guy here waiting for
event to be changed or the text inside
here to be changed whenever any of these
vents are triggered so the ID for that
is second and I'm going to do that by
going HTML you left the box okay let's
just copy this and create it on one and
here I'm just going to change this to
focus and I'm going to leave this as
second you entered the box so how easy
it is to just keep triggering these guys
and keep putting them on or over and
over and over again now I'm going to say
M down event
what's that and mouse down you left the
textbox scroll that up M up event you
entered the box and then something is
changed in the textbox on change event
you changed the box so those are all
those guys and if we reload it you could
say you entered the box is there you
left the boxes there and all of those
other different changes that occur as I
click in and out of the box and you're
going to see more of them as I play
around and create more additional
functions so now I'm going to come up
here and I'm going to start tracking
inside of this box right here anytime
the window is resized which is also kind
of cool so I'm going to say window dot
resize and whenever that's called or
whenever the window is resized I'm going
call a function called resized window
and that's all I need to do I'll scroll
down here and I'll create that function
let's just copy and paste that there
type in resized window I'm going to
again trigger the second text box inside
of there with this except this time I'm
going to be a little bit more
complicated window was resized and then
I'm going to print out the screen the
width of the new window since it's been
resized window dot width is all you got
to do inside of there and then I'm going
to put a plus sign inside of there H
colon space plus window height right
like that and if I file save that you
can see here as I change the window -
width all of that information is
automatically updated there on your
screen
so that's kind of cool - you can of
course resize anything force this image
here to be resized do whatever you want
with it now I'm going to actually show
you how to do some things with this logo
of course I'm not showing you every
single thing you could do with the logo
I expect you guys like I've seen out
there do you experiment a lot with the
stuff that I create which is the only
true way to learn how to program
I can never teach you really truly how
to be a great programmer you got to do
it on your own I'm going to say mouse
over on my image whenever that occurs
I'm going to call a function called
mouse over me and then I'm going to bind
another event and I'm going to say Mouse
out and by the way these guys are all
built into jQuery so if you ever want to
get it click these aren't me I didn't
type these in I didn't make these up
these are all jQuery and they're on that
page that I showed you originally Mouse
out me was kind of bad English in it
alright so now that I created these two
events on this image I get a create
mouse over in Mouse out jump down here
copy and paste those two functions in
here I'm going to go mouse over me and
I'm gonna have this bound again to the
second guy right here so I'm just gonna
say you put your cursor on my logo kind
of sounds kind of dirty then I'm going
to come here and say Mouse out me that's
horrible English either way you stop
touching my little go and if I save that
you can see as I put the mouse over top
of the logo the different things change
right there so
or how to bind those different events
now I'm going to come in here and I'm
going to add an event to this button
down here and this guy has an ID of two
button so I'm going to come in here hash
symbol to button bind and on this guy
I'm going to bind but it's only going to
react if a double click occurs and if it
does double click to me is going to be
called the function so I got to create
that balance down here double clicked me
double clicked mod button reload it
see you double click my button now I'm
going to show you how to add an event to
an item that lies inside of a form so
I'm going to go form dot submit which is
the submit button and I'm going to say
function and here I'm going to create an
anonymous function it's going to open up
a boring alert box a button clicked and
since you guys have been sending me a
ton of code in regards to errors that
you've been making I'll show you exactly
what you normally this is true of
everybody that programs what most of you
are messing up like here if you're
making a call to an element that's
called double button you're typing in a
lowercase there instead of an uppercase
another thing that you guys are doing is
for getting these curly braces so you're
doing things like that and also you're
forgetting semicolons at the end
whenever you need a semicolon so for the
most part almost every error that you're
sending me I say 80% of your code errors
or dependent upon variable names being
incorrect or missing curly braces where
you need curly braces or not closing
curly braces or not closing your
parentheses or starting off with a
double quote and ending with a single
quote so those are the things that
you're messing up almost all the time
and that's true of almost every single
programmer you're messing up variable
names
you're forgetting to put hash symbols in
you're forgetting to sometimes to put
periods in if this is a class instead of
an ID and you're using incorrect quotes
parenthesis and forgetting curly braces
and parentheses and semicolons so that's
what you guys are forgetting so those
are things to look out for in regards to
error checking didn't plan on doing that
sort of just came out of my mouth
because I keep getting these ok so now
I'm going to go and put another event on
three-button this is
unbind the logo and I'm going to show
you how to take events off of elements
on your webpage just do this three
button bind when it's clicked unbind
logo so what do I have to do I got to
create on vine logo I'm going to show
you how to on bind elements so jump down
here again throw that in there and it's
very easy to unbind elements as well
unbind Noga in here we're going to put
logo inside of here instead of second
because we're going to take all the
events that were triggered or that we're
set for this image right here and get
rid of them so instead of HTML here
we're going to have on bind and then I'm
going to type in exactly what I want to
take off so on mouse-over so it's no
longer going to trigger mouse over me
and then I'm also going to unbind mouse
out which is triggered whenever you take
your mouse off of it and the function
that was being called before and I want
to put in that final parenthesis so you
might be saying what did he just do
let's reload it see here how this is all
changing as I put that mouse on there if
I come down here and click on unbind see
now it is no longer being triggered so
that's how you take events off of items
might not seem like the most useful
thing but you're going to see in the
future exactly how that does become
useful and now as a final thing I'm
going to show you how to bind events to
the body and this is also where I'm
going to show you how to do that really
cool thing where you can click on
elements and it tells you what you click
on which is also a great way to catch
all errors and it's also something that
I found by digging deep into the jQuery
library it's not something that's often
taught so with this I'm going to be able
to check that a key has been pressed
which is extremely useful bind I'm also
going to track mouse movements which is
really cool you can stalk people that go
into your website see exactly what
they're doing not that I do that I think
you have to be pretty weird big weird I
do that and then if they click on
anything I'm going to grab the event
that was triggered which is going to
contain whatever they clicked on no
matter what it is which is kind of neat
and just by doing that I'm now tracking
all the key movements all of their mouse
movements and all events in general so I
have to create all the different
functions that are going to print all
that out to screen so jump down
here create some functions paste that in
there and I'm going to create my
function called check key pressed and
here I'm going to receive an event so I
want to type that in there and in the
textbox it's labeled v which is this guy
right here I'm going to type in text
instead of HTML and I'm going to put in
the actual key that was pressed on the
keyboard instead of just putting a key
code in which wouldn't make much sense
I'm using jQuery for this this is that's
all this function does or this method of
type string this is what it does it turn
converts a key code which is a number
that represents a key that's pressed on
the keyboard into the actual key that
was pressed so that's what this does
don't let yourself get confused by that
scroll this up let's create two more
functions inside of here this one's
called the mouse moved and I need to
accept an event because this is going to
be changing constantly I'm also going to
need two of these and in the seventh and
it ended up being ninth sorry about that
if that's confusing I'm going to print
the screen event dot screen X that's how
you get the x coordinate for the mouse
and here is how you get the y coordinate
for the mouse and these have to be
uppercase x and y so those are going to
be put right here and right here and
then the last thing I have to do is
capture every single event remember this
is the thing that I say I don't see all
the time definitely not in tutorials and
I'm going to put this actually I need
two of these guys here and the guy with
the ID tenth which is this guy and this
is where a timestamps going to go
they've been text event dot target dot
node that's going to tell me exactly
what type of element is inside of that
in here 11th and I believe this is HTML
event on time stamp and that's going to
give me the exact time in which that was
clicked all that stuff it's kind of cool
and then I want type in node name not
just node you want to have a vent target
node name and now all this stuff will
work we reload it and you can
see that as I click on all these
different things all of this information
is being updated on the screen and then
as I type in different things also that
is being registered here on the screen
so there's numerous different ways you
can do all sorts of things with events
in jQuery any questions or comments
leave them in the comment section below
