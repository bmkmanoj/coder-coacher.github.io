tutorial on how to make a cross-browser
horizontal menu like you see here on the
screen this menu is going to use almost
no JavaScript it is in fact going to use
no javascript in all browsers except for
internet explorer 6 and 7 because they
require work properly and i'm going to
walk you through the whole entire
process of making one of these guys so
you completely understand it all right
so basically a horizontal menu or a
vertical menu is just an unordered list
that's all it is and you can see over
here on the right side of the screen
basically what we have here is a div
item that's gonna surround everything
and let me bring this up to maybe
explain it a little bit better basically
we have a div a big john box it's going
to contain an unordered list and then
across the top let's switch over to this
guy right here where you see products
and services available workshops and so
forth those are actually anchors that
are inside of list items and everything
that's going across the top in this
situation is an unordered list with list
items and anchors inside of it then
whenever we trigger a hover over one of
these buttons like you see right here
that makes all of these additional ul's
that also contain list items and anchor
tags inside of them let's make this real
simple I'm going to jump over here and
show this unordered list and I'm going
to jump in here and start showing you
just how easy it is to edit all this
alright so I'm in index dot HTML is the
name of the file but it doesn't really
matter what the name of the file would
be and what I want to do is I want to
add some styling to this unordered list
just to show you how simple it is to
change things so I'm going to link out
to a style sheet and all this code is
available in a link underneath this
video each reference is equal to and
then in a CSS folder I of a file called
style dot CSS type is equal to and text
for / CSS and that is how you point
towards a style sheet alright so if we
file save that and then I jump over into
said file here is style dot CSS and I
want to start doing some styling on this
guy to make it actually kind of work
like a menu it's really simple all that
I need to do say i want to point at the
UL name drop down and then ul's
underneath of that remember everything
isn't contained inside of UL visibility
is equal to hidden and if I file save
that just that little bit of a change
and reload it you can now see that all
those ul's disappeared well if I want to
bring them all back how do I do that
really simple actually I'm just going to
go UL named drop down if I hover my
mouse over top of an li ID on my list
item inside of there I want to make
changes to the UL item that lies
directly underneath of it and in this
situation I want to set its visibility
to visible if we file save it reload you
can see now whenever I put my mouse over
these ul's or these Li items actually
that all these other different things
will show up so basically the rest of
it's just styling and like i said this
works on every browser except for any
internet explorer prior to internet
explorer 7 so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to jump back over into
index.html and we're going to throw in
all of our additional list items and
just to make sure you're a hunter sent
certain we have a div called menu menu
controller this is actually the default
list that are created by wordpress so
this will work automatically inside a
wordpress but of course it'll work on
any other website and then you have a UL
item and name drop-down that's what this
is called and then there's a list item
underneath of it you don't even need to
worry about this but like I said this is
automatically generated and then there's
your anchor tag that's right there and
then if you would have additional
unordered lists or drop down to come
underneath that well you just create
another UL without closing off the Li
tank and then create additional Li tags
until you got enough and you close off
the LI the UL and you work your way back
up so that's all it is unordered list so
I just paste it in a great big huge
giant menu and reload it and now you can
see all the different menu items and how
they're positioned themselves on the
screen so basically I have to edit all
of these now but I did say there is
JavaScript needed in part of this so
that it works inside of internet
explorer so I'm just going to jump in
here right after where it's calling for
the default jQuery code that I'm going
to use here and I'm just going to say
script type is equal to text JavaScript
language is equal to JavaScript and then
i'm going to point at my javascript file
i'm going to call it cross browser menu
j/s and then closed off my script
section alright so now we got to be able
to create that and we've done every
single thing that we need to do for
index so I'm going to jump over into
style and i'm going to start styling
this guy i'm just going to move this
down and i'm going to jump right into
styling the div that surrounds it it's
called menu menu container in my
situation you call it whatever you want
just put a div around it that's all you
need to and in this situation I'm going
to say that I want to target everything
inside of menu menu container and these
are the sort of things you do whenever
you want to make things cross browser
margin i'm going to set it to 0
everything by default is going to start
off with margins and padding's of 0 and
i'm also going to say that i want to use
font and this is another cross browser
thing if you want to have your fonts
resize inside of all versions of
Internet Explorer you have to define
them using a.m. instead of pixels so PT
sans and then I'm just going to define
my fonts and I'm going to say that I
want all my fonts on top of that to be
white so that you won't be able to see
them reload and you can see they all
disappeared but then we're going to
correct that a second now what I'm going
to do is make some additional changes
inside of menu menu container like I
said that's basically for internet
explorer what we just did right there
i'm going to say though want my menu bar
to have a width of 1000 pixels margin
I'm sort of doing some things here just
so I can go over some CSS things if I
want to define my top and bottom as 0
pixels that's how you do it and if i
want to have left and right be auto well
you just do it like that this is top and
bottom this is left and right sort of
shorthand notation and then let's say i
want to give it a border of 1 pixel and
remember this is a whole entire div that
surrounds the entire menu 383 be 8a
which is like a blue and then I want to
float the whole entire menu left just
means take the whole entire div and but
it up to the left hand side of the
screen then I'm also going to find my
background that same blue and then I'm
going to provide a sort of gradient on
here I actually have this saved as I use
this all of the time basically this is a
cross-browser way of doing gradients
it's real simple it's basically just
copy and paste code you know no reason
to memorize all this it's insane but
basically what you define is the top of
your gradient that's the first color and
then it's going to progress towards this
color and then you can see here in the
notes and you find a gradient in a menu
or whatever inside of Internet Explorer
this is for WebKit browsers and
this is for Firefox and that is how I'm
going to create my gradient inside of
there reload it and you can see now that
all these different things are showing
up here and you can actually see well
one problem is sort of sticking itself
out there is I want to get rid of those
underlines so I'm gonna go menu menu
container hey if I want to get rid of
those underlines just go text decoration
none reload there you go now we got rid
of those that's nice another thing i
want to do inside of here is get rid of
any list styling that might show up
meaning the bullets was stung and on
alright so we got rid of those bullets
and then I want to style the unordered
list name drop-down we know it's a class
because it has a dot in front of it if
it was an ID this would be a hash but
it's not so we're going to let it that
way position it relative to where it is
so any changes I make in regards to this
guy is going to move it up and down
right and left based off of its current
default position on the screen that's
all that means create another UL
drop-down and here I'm going to target
the list items make changes to those
guys I want to float them left and then
for internet explorer whenever you type
in zoom Cola one to follow layout rules
that I need to do here that's basically
why that's in there in the background
again in this situation I'm gonna have
the same exact colors here so I'm just
going to copy that jump down here paste
that in like I said before that makes a
nice little gradient that looks nice on
the screen let's file save it see what
we're doing here reload and now you can
see that these guys are all button up
kind of nastily together but they are
going more like a menu that's good give
myself fall into space here I'm gonna go
in here and make a couple little changes
drop down whenever you hover over the
links i want to change the color of the
text white and of course this is kind of
in here just in case you would want to
change these later on a couple of those
things you'd want to do of course i can
make these non white if you want it to
change the color of the text based off
of it being the current active link
there's also additional styling you
could provide and i'm just throwing
these in here so that this is a very
customizable menu system even though i'm
not using that customization in this
tutorial and then i'm going to target
list items anchor tags that are
contained inside of list items and i'm
going to say i want to display them
elements and that just means that i want
to be able to define their height and
therewith and their padding and so forth
and so on and so i'm going to define
their padding six pixels 10 pixels
remember top bottom left right that's
what's going on here and I also want to
put in a nice little border on the right
of it it's the one pixel solid am using
that same blue that we had before of
course you can change these colors as
well and defining my text color again
now what I'm going to do is I'm actually
going to add a hover class using jquery
and i use jquery a lot because it helps
me keep things cross browser so that's
why i do it now if you wanted let's just
come in here drop down li hover and i'm
also going to yo UL drop down li colon
hover define my background and i'm going
to use that other color this guy right
here goes from dark to light then again
text FFF border and i'm putting a lot of
things in here that aren't going to
change on my menu just so like i said
before you can change those things in
the future quite easily because
everything's already built in there so
you say okay well i want to change the
text color even though everything is
white already it's going to allow you
very easily to go in there and change
that color or i want to change the
border or I want to do whatever so
that's why those things are in their
position relative again want any changes
to apply to where it is currently on the
screen and then I'm also going to throw
this in here drop down trying to think
of all the different ways that you might
want to apply changes to this menu so
let's say that you as a person would
like to be able to change the color of
the font for the anchor tag whenever
you're hovering over top of it even
though I didn't do it that's how you
would do it and now we're going to start
doing our drop-down styling so this guy
is actually going to be our first drop
down and that's how you do call Manning
inside of CSS all right first thing I'm
going to target our unordered list items
name drop-down that have a UL underneath
of them so i'm targeting all of those
unordered lists and i'm going to say
that i want them all to have a width of
200 pixels i'm basically defining
buttons here visibility is equal to
hidden so i don't want them to lay on a
screen let's just get rid of these so it
doesn't cause any confusion i'm saying i
want all the unordered lists to not be
shown on the screen i am defining that
they are going to take up 200
wit I want to position them absolutely
on the screen top hundred percent and
what this does is it sets the top to the
bottom of the containing box let me show
what I mean so here we are defining this
guy see where it says products and
services here it says social media well
by putting in a hundred percent that
means I want social media this box it
surrounds it too but up underneath
directly underneath of this unordered
list that lies above it so that is what
top one hundred percent means it means
they want to be but it up right
underneath of this UL that's right there
okay so that's what that means and then
left 0 that sets it left equal to the
containing box that's right there so
that just keeps it absolutely to the
left side of where it is on the screen
so that's how you do positioning using
percentages versus absolute and then I'm
going to define you will drop down you
will and then the Li tags that lie
inside of those unordered lists like
that here real simple again I'm going to
come up here grab this guy and just
paste that little gradient inside of
there of course you could change these
stylings and that's why I provide you
that option and what else might you want
to change on these list items whenever
they pop on the screen well you might
want to change your text color you might
want to put a border bottom underneath
of those list items and in this
situation i'll put it one pixel i'll
make it solid i'm gonna make it white
just to be pouring and then i want to
set my float for none and we do that for
internet explorer once again i'm trying
to put together a tutorial that sort of
explains everything that's bad about
internet explorer so that you can fix
things it's been struggling on that a
little bit another thing internet
explorer is going to require here drop
down UL li hey is for these anchor tags
to be displayed none border-right-width
is equal to a hundred percent and this
is sort of like tricks that I've learned
over the years how to work with internet
explorer and how do you find things like
this a lot of experimenting that will
make everything show up right internet
explorer then I want to do my second
layer of dropdowns styling let's file
save it and see how this guy's changed
you could say it's pulling itself
together here but the
drop downs are not showing up but a lot
of the styling has been done so I have
to come in here and fix all the
additional styling that he's finished I
want to go UL drop-down and I want to
target the second grouping of unordered
lists on the screen and I'm just going
to say left colon one hundred percent
and this is going to position the item
to the right of the containing block
remember how i did before top one
hundred percent positioned it directly
underneath of it well whenever you put
left one hundred percent it pops up
right here next to it and perfectly
matches up to the UL that is to the left
of it so if you put top one hundred
percent you come up one hundred percent
underneath of the bottom if you put left
one hundred percent you come but up
right next to the rightmost side with
the leftmost side of this guy that
you're creating and this is the guy that
I'm creating right now so hopefully that
makes sense and then Tom we're going to
set to zero and what this is going to do
is set the top to the top of the
containing ball so that it's on the
right side of the containing UL that's
right here that is what we're defining
we're saying we want to basically be
horizontal which is what you see on the
screen whatever it's created and then
the final thing that we need to do here
is go UL draw now we actually did this
before li hover we want to target all
ul's that are directly underneath of any
Li tags that are hovered over top off
and what do we want to do we're gonna go
visibility visible and I shows you that
before reload and there you can see
everything's popping up exactly the way
we want it now this would work
absolutely perfectly except in IE six
and seven without any JavaScript at all
but like said Internet Explorer is
difficult so we're going to go fix that
so I'm going to jump over into cross
browser menu dot j s and what this
basically is saying is whenever this
document is loaded we want a function to
be called and execute it so everything
inside here is going to be executed so
what we're going to do in jquery is go
UL or targeting all Li tags that are
contained inside of a ul name drop down
that's what that does and we're saying
on hover whenever those are hovered over
we want to call a function and if some
of this doesn't make sense to you just
leave it a note below they we want to
say
this meaning this Li tag that is
contained inside of a UL name drop-down
that's what this means we want to add a
class to it in the class that we want to
add to it is the hover class then we
want to say UL first this we're going to
do is add a CSS rule is ability which we
chose you for like I said this is needed
for internet explorer but no other
browsers you want to set it to visible
and then we want to close off that guy
but then we want to call another
function and I'm going to close this
function basically what I just closed
here is that bracket and that bracket
say curly bracket dot it out it up yeah
I'm going to actually copy this cuz
we're going to be doing a lot of the
same things here ace that inside of
there say this we want to remove a class
called hover and then you well first we
want to target this guy and set its
visibility to hidden and nothing's
really going to change because this is
google chrome so there's no point in me
even showing you and one last thing you
may want to do is if you want to target
just internet explorer browser because
i'm going to jump over into index.html
and let's say we want to provide
specific styling only if internet
explorer versions are being used how you
do that is you actually put a comment
like this and then go if this situation
I'm going to go later then internet
explorer 7 which is where all the
problems lie and then this and if we're
going to close off that comment section
so this is only going to be called if
internet explorer is trying to look at
this there you go style sheet type is
equal to text /c SS and then just point
at the style sheet that you want to be
used if internet explorer's used it's
going to use both style sheets but it's
going to use this style sheet in
addition with Internet Explorer so
that's how you would link out and
include additional resources if it's an
IE browser what's file save that and
then something you would use in this
situation like I said I could use it any
other file but let's just use it here
you will drop down you won't Li Li tags
need to be defined as display inline and
then also another requirement for those
old versions of Internet
or is the width be a hundred percent and
this just defines that the width depends
on the size of the containing block and
reload and everything is happy
everything works out exactly the way
that we wanted to leave any questions or
comments below like I said before all
the code is available on or eat this
video otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
