obligatory video everybody needs to make
right after they become a YouTube
partner I'm gonna try and do a little
bit better job than I've seen some other
people do here today not because I'm any
type of expert not because I'm any type
of super store on youtube i'm not
putting that out there i'm just sort of
going to reach out and try and touch on
some subjects i'd never understood why
other people didn't touch on and some
information that I wish I knew whenever
I first started off on YouTube saket
graphic specifically asked me how I make
my videos and basically what i do is
you're looking right now at an apple
keynote presentation i create all my
presentations in apple keynote I record
all my screencast using QuickTime 10 and
I then edit the videos using apple
imovie all of this software is extremely
cheap and that is why i use it because
this is really just a hobby and it's fun
for me if you're on a pc however you can
get all of this pretty much for free
just by getting OpenOffice impress
camstudio and windows movie maker which
are all free windows movie maker isn't
quite as pretty as I movie but it is
quite similar and quite a good piece of
software in my opinion and it's free so
who cares now on to exactly how I make
my videos here's quicktime down here
quicktime 10 down here this little icon
and i click on it and i go file and i
click on new screen recording recording
right now and that's why that is grayed
out but that is all that i do right
there now if i want to do an audio
recording i click here if I wanted to do
a recording of my own face I would click
right there and that is all its to that
then in regards to iMovie this is where
I do all my editing at and edit out all
my mistakes basically you just come in
here and go file new project and then
you click on whatever you want your
presentation to look like i'll zoom in
so you can see this a little bit bigger
and you type in your project name hit
create that's pretty much all that's to
that then you go file new event you
create a new event like i did down here
and then if you right click on that and
go import movies little allow you to
import a new movie that you recorded
using quicktime if you're on Mac and
then just drag this guy up here one of
the screen and iMovie automatically puts
in transitions here as you can see nice
little pretty transition and you
come in here and change the title and
then click on done and then one thing
that I do that a lot of people do not
seem to do is I heavily edit my videos
now the lot of the professional people
do this on youtube but again not that
I'm calling myself professional say I
come in here and find the part right
whenever I'm not talking and I delete
that out so that video immediately
starts with me talking and then i zoom
in you can see that's all you do to
delete and then when I continue to do is
I find all those areas in which I am
breathing or making any type of strange
noises and I delete those out as well
and that's one of the things that kind
of separates me from some of the other
people and some of the little things
that I do and here's another area where
I paused and if I come in here and I'm
just selecting this with my mouse and if
i delete that area out what this allows
me to do then is put in little text
boxes so let's say I want to put this
guy in here like i always put this
information here on the screen so that
it's harder to steal my videos have
other people say they made them when
they didn't so I'm gonna put my website
name in here of course they could come
in and delete that out but whatever if
they're willing put that much effort in
i say to them they might as well just
steal my video then so that's how you
would put those little guys in there
that provide that little bit of added
splash to your screen and this right
here goes in here because apple throws
that in automatically again because
whenever i clicked on new project i
clicked on scrapbook so that's where
that comes from and i can also throw in
photographs if I'd like into my
presentation automatically pulls in all
of these different photographs so I
would say I want to put this guy holding
his hand on his back right here I just
drag it out of my photo library and drop
it in right there and as you can see
here on movie automatically put this
transition in here for me now if I'd
want to create a transition between this
graphic this photograph and then me
talking again I just come over here into
this pane click on that and it shows me
all my transitions that are available to
me Oh drag a transition right here and
drop it in and I you have to turn off
automatic transitions if you want to do
this click on that and then it'll put in
a nice little pretty transition in
and there's a gazillion different
transitions that are available inside of
iMovie as well so that's how you put all
the different text inside here and
there's all kinds of different things
like if you've watched any of my other
videos you've seen these little clouds
pop up well that's how you put those in
there and then if you want to edit what
is in those little boxes just click on
this and type in whatever text you want
to play and then that pops up inside of
there and then finally this is really
all it is time if you wanted to put in
any type of music you can see that there
is a ton of different music that's
available to you and I specifically like
to use the music that is a little bit
longer so I just click on time and then
you'll be able to see all the different
music that's available to you so one
that I used to use all the time is Jarek
onda I think it's not any pronounced ax
and if you'd like to put audio into this
guy you just again drag it on up in here
and you can see that the audio shows up
in there and always I always click on
audio adjustments after that and lower
the overall volume normally down to one
percent but if you've seen any of my
recent videos you realize that I never
use audio at all anymore I totally never
use audio because I got tons of
complaints about it so I just don't put
music in it and that's basically how i
create all of my videos using imovie but
again you can use the other tools that i
showed you previously if you're on a pc
now in regards to how do you become or
what are the requirements to become a
YouTube partner I think this first one
is the big one I think you need over
125,000 upload views because I've looked
at a lot of other people right at the
point when they become partners and it
seems like most people become a partner
right around 125,000 views I personally
have over six hundred subscribers i know
that's nothing and i really don't think
that has that much to do with being a
partner i might be wrong about that
though i get over 1200 views per day but
this goes up pretty astronomically on a
regular basis now and i do have two
videos over 20,000 views maybe this also
is a requirement I'm not quite sure and
I have a lot of videos and I think that
youtube in general or Google in general
likes whenever people have a lot of
videos especially if they're longer but
not necessarily longer because doing
long videos in my
general is a bad idea even though I do
it so how long does it take to get to
that point where you can become a
partner and whatever you're getting
considerable number of views per day
took me about 11 months took me about
four months to average 100 views took me
nine months to average 500 views and it
took me up to approximately 11 months to
average over a thousand views per day
I'm actually around 1200 but like i said
it keeps going up it's 1,400 the other
day and something like that so what do
the ultra successful not me youtubers do
and if you want to know who the greatest
video blogger in my in general I would
say that most of the even the most
successful youtubers would agree with
this the guy's name is a Frank and I
provided a link in the underbar where
you can look at more information on Zeya
Frank basically what you want to do is
you want to create the idea that the
viewer is part of an exclusive club and
again I don't do most of these things
but this is what the real successful
people do once you do that you want to
then address the viewer as a club member
normally giving them a fancy name or
giving them a goofy name whatever just
you want to label all the people that
watch your videos you then want to
address them directly if at all possible
so if somebody comments address them by
their whatever name they use on YouTube
people love this then almost everybody
edits their videos very heavily like I
do when I cut out all my breathing and
so forth some people even go to be even
more extreme than that where it seems
like they never take a breath or they
never blink or they're constantly moving
around so heavily editing the video is
also a very good idea you also want to
keep your video short normally three
three and a half minutes and never over
four minutes again I know that I break
this role and I'm not necessarily making
these videos just for that reason and
since I brought that up when i created
this youtube channel what i was trying
to do was provide in-demand skills for
unemployed people that was my first goal
that was the only goal wasn't to become
a partner it was to actually help people
and that's still pretty much my goal
otherwise i would just follow these
rules that are on your screen right here
which I don't then I decided that I
would provide solutions that people sell
for thousands of dollars for free these
are the ones like the sales gurus and
the diet
guru's if you don't know about it I lost
85 pounds in like five months and I put
all that information on YouTube for free
or how to make money blogging so I
started doing a lot of that stuff and
then now at this point in time I'm
pretty much just answering questions
that you guys send in so if you do have
any other questions send me a request
below and I'll definitely cover any
tutorials that you guys want to see in
upcoming videos then again you want to
keep it personal to a certain extent i
do that keep it as personal as possible
you want to address comments people have
made in a really cool trick that I've
seen some people do is to actually
reward the last person who commented on
the last video that the youtuber
uploaded so basically that would give
people who were commenting more of a
reason to comment because they wanted to
be the last commenter I think you get
that whole point if at all possible you
want to reward people for liking your
videos you also want to reward people
for leaving video responses so you can
say things like you have a chance to win
some special prize if you leave a video
response you want to allow users to
create the format of your show and I do
this to a large extent all my videos at
this point are all based off of requests
from you guys you want to Center your
content on topics everyone or the
largest number of people will find
interesting that's why you see so many
pop culture and things like that and
news related vloggers on YouTube you
want to post regularly at least i would
say at least once a week and probably
you're better off if you post at least
twice a week sell t-shirts that help
advertise you out in public so they
should be cool t-shirts that people
would actually want to wear create
interesting music videos again couldn't
use copyrighted information on youtube
but you can create your own original
songs this is extremely successful
another thing that's great is to break
your show down into multiple different
segments so let's say you're going to do
a three minute video the first minute
you could cover one topic or you could
sing a music video or you could do
something like that and then do a
general interest and do something about
comedy that's what i mean by break the
show down into multiple different
segments again it's very popular to
attack public figures that a large
majority of viewers would not like like
for example a lot of
different video bloggers build up a
large fan base by a tagging George Bush
when he was president because a lot of
people didn't like them then you want to
end your shoe with an interesting
closing something that will draw people
back to watch other videos you've done
or draw them back to see future videos
or to subscribe you also want to reward
people for subscribing in any way if at
all possible and then of course use
interesting titles and or thumbnails and
if you want to increase the chance that
you're going to have a prettier cool
looking thumbnail just post prettier
cool looking pictures there's no way to
pick your own thumbnails and as far as
I'm concerned it's impossible to crack
the math to insert a picture somewhere
in your video to get it to show up so
basically if you just put cool looking
pictures that aren't copyright it in
your presentation and chances are you're
going to be able to use one of those
cool looking pictures in your thumbnail
and there's pretty much all the
different secrets and the answers to a
bunch of your different questions if
there's a topic or a tutorial that you'd
like me to do leave a comment below or
send me an email or do whatever
otherwise tonics time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
