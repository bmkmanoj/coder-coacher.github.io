of my design patterns video tutorial
today I'm going to talk about the bridge
design pattern so what is the bridge
design pattern well the official
definition is 2d couple an abstraction
from its implementation so the two can
vary independently yes that is a bunch
of gobbledygook and I have found through
numerous different tutorials that the
bridge pattern is often very poorly
explained or glossed over completely and
on top of that everyone seems to explain
it differently in this part of the
presentation I'm going to explain it the
way that I have always used the bridge
design pattern and the way that it was
explained to me by someone much more
intelligent than I and my basic
definition is to progressively add
functionality while separating out major
differences using abstract classes so
let's go into a bunch of pictures and
explain this further so let's say that
you want to come in here and you want to
ultimately create remote controls that
are going to work differently depending
upon very specific televisions and along
the way you want to define all of those
attributes that each television or
device will have and then remote
controls along with that so if you're
going to be creating the most abstract
of televisions what are - it's a
functionality that every single device
ever is going to have actually in fact
whether it's a television or a radio or
a DVD or so on each one of them is going
to have a remote control that is going
to control volume so what we're going to
define here in our first abstract class
are the buttons that are going to define
volume for all of our devices seven is
going to represent up volume and eight
is going to represent down volume then
afterwards we're going to create more
concrete devices and this first
television which we're really going to
focus on is going to define what five
and six are going to do which means
they're going to define that the channel
number should increase wave number six
is pressed or decrease whenever five is
pressed however let's say TV two is
actually a DVD player in that situation
button six will skip to the next chapter
well button five will skip to the last
chapter then we come to our abstract
remote control what it is going to hold
is a reference to a specific
ice either the basic TV or the TV that
is going to have a DVD player connected
to it it is then going to find all those
abstract methods that are going to
differ between this remote right here
and this remote right here and there's
very specific differences are going to
lie with button 9 remote 1 whenever the
button 9 is pressed is going to mute the
sound while down here with remote 2 that
we're going to define whatever it is
pressed let's just say it's going to be
connected to a DVR which is going to
pause the television so along the lines
we're adding different layers of
functionality with an abstract class
that lies between hence 2 layers of
abstraction between classes and one
class that is going to be dependent upon
the other so wind should use the bridge
design pattern when you want to be able
to change both the abstractions or the
abstract classes along with the concrete
classes completely independently so like
I've showed previously when you want to
have your first abstract class defined
certain roles and then create a concrete
class that adds additional roles for the
concrete televisions and then you're
going to have another abstract class
it's going to have a reference to each
one of these devices and it's going to
define the abstract methods that will be
defined in the final concrete remote
controls that you create so hopefully
that made sense if it doesn't I'm going
to jump into the code and explain it in
a completely different way so on with
the code alright so the first bit of
code we're going to create here is
entertainment device and this is going
to be the abstract class is going to
represent every single device that we're
going to be creating abstract class
entertainment device and sometimes this
is created as an interface but I never
thought it really made that much sense
that way so this is the way that I
normally implement these things so I'm
going to say device state and all the
code is available underneath of the
video and a link so if you want to check
that out and we're going to define some
different fields inside of this that
every single television as well as
remote that comes thereafter is going to
have and mainly device state is going to
either be the current channel that the
device is on or the current chapter if
we're using a DVD and then max setting
is going to be the map
some of channel number possible or the
maximum chapter and then volume settings
just going to represent volume setting
so all right so now that we got that all
set up we're going to define those
methods those abstract methods that are
going to need to be defined so we're
going to say well what is going to
happen when button five is pressed in
the concrete class that follows it
didn't have to implement that and what
happens whenever button six is going to
be pressed then on top of that just to
show that everything is going to be
working we're going to come in here and
create device feedback and all this is
ultimately going to do is spit out
information in regards to the current
channel that we're going to be on and
we're just going to come in here and go
device state if it's greater than max
setting or device state less than zero
and that remember the device state
represents either the current channel or
the current chapter we're going to set
the device State or the channel or
chapter back to zero so that's what
we're doing with that guy and then we're
going to print out a message and we're
just going to say on device state and
that's going to shoot out either the
channel or the chapter and then remember
we said that every single television is
going to have a volume so we're going to
go in here and go public void button
seven pressed and that is going to
represent the volume being increased so
we're going to go volume level plus plus
and jump up here and change this to
level because I like that and it better
improvin this a little bit and then
we're gonna come down here and type in
volume at and volume level and there you
go so there we are we're setting just
those buttons because everything that
comes afterwards is going to have a
capability of raising or lowering the
volume and then button eight is going to
decrease the volume and we're just going
to leave that exactly that way so that
is our abstract class that we're
creating called
entertainment device which every single
device will be based off of so now let's
go into TV device and let's actually
create one of these guys going to copy
this and jump into TV device alright so
now we're in this and this is called the
concrete implementer while entertainment
device is represented just as the
implementer and we're going to go
that's just jargon by the way public TV
device extends entertainment device then
we're going to come up here to TV device
and we're going to say okay we want to
implement on implemented methods I'll
click on that there we are and now we
got all those in there but then on top
of that we're going to create a
constructor for this public TV device
int new device state and ant new max
setting so that all the different
devices are going to have different
device States or maximum settings
whether it's channel or chapter if it's
a DVD and then we're going to go to a
device state which is represented back
in the superclass device stay like that
and then max setting is going to be
equal to a new max setting and there we
are so we have that all defined so then
we just have to come in here and talk
about how TV is going to be different
from the DVD so I'll print line channel
down so that's perfect
copy that and whenever button six is
going to be pressed we're going to say
channel up and then I'm going to go
device state - - and device state plus
plus and I'm not going to worry about
the DVD part that is going to extend
entertainment device if you want to see
what that code looks like you can look
underneath the video but amazingly going
to focus on the different swings between
the TVs that are going to be created and
then the remote controls that are going
to follow thereafter so that we need to
come in here then and create our
abstract remote and I'm going to call
that remote button dot Java so let's
click on that and this is called the
abstraction layer and it's going to
represent numerous different ways we can
use this remote to work with all the
different types of devices so I guess
your homework would be to go in there
and take a look at how the DVD would be
represented here so another abstract
class then we're going to need a
reference to the generic device using
composition and I'm going to label this
as private entertainment you guys I'm
just going to call it the device like
that then I'm going to create a
constructor remote button and it's going
to be passed one of the entertainment
devices I'm going to call it new device
then just go the AA device that's inside
of this guy is going to be equal to the
new device that's passed over to it got
all
so then we're going to come in here and
reference all of the different methods
that were defined for each of the
devices so if you go back into TV device
you see here button five pressed as well
as button six was pressed so let's jump
back over into remote button and let's
define those guys so we're just going to
go public void button five pressed and
we go the advice and we're going to just
call button five pressed inside of it so
that's how we're bridging that and then
we're also going to reference button six
being pressed right like that and then
if we want to also implement device
feedback which is going to either spit
out the chapter number or the channel
number that is currently set for the
device we're just going to go device
feedback like that and then just go the
device and call device feedback and then
what we need to do because this is an
abstract class is to find all of the
things that those remotes that are going
to implement this abstract class are
going to need to use or extend anyway so
we're going to go public
abstract void we're going to say that
each one of them needs to define what
happens when button nine is pressed and
there you did you just did that so now
we're going to go in and actually create
the individual remotes so we're going to
need remote button which is the generic
abstract remote and then I'm first thing
I'm going to do is the TV remote that
whenever nine is pressed is going to
mute everything so let's create this and
this is called the refined abstraction
again there's some jargon for you and
we're going to go public class TV remote
mute extends and there's that abstract
class and then this guy is going to say
hey you need to implement a couple
methods here and there they are there's
a constructor we're going to need to set
and basically we don't need to do
anything for that just get rid of it
altogether and then we're also going to
need to implement another method and
that is what happens when button on is
pressed and real simply we're going to
come in here like that and we're going
to print out a different message on the
screen and it is going to be TV was
muted say just different layers of
functionality everything abstracted out
and everything can be changed without
affecting absolutely anything else and
there you are now we're going to come in
and implement the other version of our
remote that is going to pause the screen
whenever the button 9 is pressed and
we're going to call that guy TV remote
pause job paste that inner remote pause
extends remote button and everything's
going to be the same there then this is
going to be pause again everything else
can stay the same and then TV was paused
okay now we go in to test the remote to
see that everything is working so we're
in test the remote and I'm going to go
remote button again I'm going to be
referring with an abstract class here
I'm gonna call this saw TV and then go
new TV remote mute and right here I'm
going to go to new TV device see this
allows me to use multiple different
types of devices not even just the TV
devices if you wanted to implement a DVD
or whatever but it's tons of
functionality then we're going to create
another one I'm going to call this the
TV 2 and then just call this pause like
that and it's also going to create
another television and just so you can
see what it would be like if you would
want to create a DVD it's going to
operate in much the same way so I'm
going to go remote button again except
this would be called DVD and this is
then I'd have to create a different
remote DVD remote like that instead of
creating remote pause and so forth and
then I'd have to go in here and go DVD
device and then let's say our DVD that
we create has 14 chapters anyway the
codes underneath the video if you want
to play around with that and you should
if you want to completely understand the
way this guy works okay so now let's go
in here and go system out and check this
guy out so first thing we're going to do
is test TV with mute that's the first
test we're going to do then we're gonna
go the TV and we're going to say button
just see right here 5 is pressed just
click on that what's going to happen
when button 5 is pressed and you can see
right here button 5 is going to make the
channel go downwards and button 6 is
going to make it go up and just so if
you don't remember the remote that is
going to change 9 into mute is right
there and then this one right here is
going to pause live television as if
it's in a DVR okay hopefully that makes
sense if you have any questions leave
them down below okay so this is the TV
that has mute and we could also go the
TV and then go button 6 pressed and
there's that then we can go the TV
button now this is the one that's going
to change but 9 has been pressed and
there you go now we're going to be able
to look at the difference so let's go
and copy this guy and this time we're
going to perform a check for the test TV
with pause and how it's going to differ
from the TV that has the mute so we're
going to go the on TV 2 and then we're
going to go button 5 pressed there's
button 5 and then if we would just want
to do something a little bit different
TV 2 and let's say we want to do a
button 6 pressed which is going to make
the channel go up and let's have the
channel go up multiple different times
ok so there's like four times and then
to also provide or cover what happens
when button 9 is pressed on this there's
that and then on top of that if we want
to get feedback on exactly what channel
we are currently on device feedback
course is the only option there
I'll save so let's execute it see what
happens in there you can see here's the
TV remote that is specific to the device
that has the capability to mute
everything and here you can see channel
down channel up and then whenever 9's
press TV was muted you can see likewise
TV was paused whenever button on was
pressed here and you can also see that
we made the channel go up multiple
different times and here is our feedback
that we are on channel 4 so that is the
bridge design pattern like I said I go
into much more detail in the code that's
on the website if you want to look at it
further and of course if you have any
questions or comments leave them down
below the last till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
