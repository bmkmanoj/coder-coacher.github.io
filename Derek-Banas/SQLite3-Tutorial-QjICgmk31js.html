late video tutorial in this tutorial I'm
going to show you how to install SQL
light both on a Mac as well as Windows
and I'm also going to show you a ton of
different ways to use it now if you have
been watching my Android tutorial don't
freak out the SQLite tutorial is part of
the Android tutorial and I am going to
be using SQLite to a great extent in the
Android tutorial and that is the reason
why I'm covering it so I have a lot to
do so let's get into it so what exactly
is SQLite well in essence SQLite is an
embedded relational database and what
makes it cool is that it doesn't require
a dedicated database management system
to use the database is literally part of
your code and it is not an outside
resource like you may be used to so you
might say well what is the purpose for
using SQLite well the reason it was
created was to provide a self-contained
database that was both easy to use could
travel with the program using it and
also it's great because it runs on
pretty much any machine with no required
software so how does SQL Lite stand up
in regards to performance well for small
to medium sized applications which since
we're making Android applications right
now they are a prime perfect type of
application use SQL like with SQLite
actually has been found to be superior
to most other databases even in regards
to speed once again for small to medium
sized applications it does however
underperform if you manage multiple
connections or if it is asked to perform
really complicated queries and to a
certain extent with Android that's going
to occur because the device is much
slower than a desktop so you may ask
what languages does it work with well
pretty much every single language even
though SQL Lite was written with see
there are literally numerous extensions
that make it usable with other languages
and in most situations there's numerous
extensions for even individual languages
so if you want to use SQLite you're
pretty much going to be able to use it
with any language and for the most part
the really cool thing is these
extensions are going to follow a similar
pattern so for example they are each
going to provide
connection object that represents a
connection to the database they're also
going to provide a cursor object that
represents an SQL query and of course
that objects going to allow you to do
such things as execute commands and also
iterate over your results so now let's
jump into how to install SQL Lite well
the very first thing I'm going to do
here is show you how to install SQL Lite
on a Macintosh system now what I like to
use is something called macports
and if you haven't used macports it is
going to save you an insane amount of
time basically to install it you're just
going to go to macports org forward
slash install dot PHP and then you just
want to come down inside of here until
you get to this part where it says Mac
OS X package installer this is of course
the easiest way to install however
you're going to have to install
different version Mac ports depending
upon the version of OS X that you are
using not the way to find out which
version you're using is to go up this
little apple and click on it click on
about this Mac then on your screen
you're going to see Mac OS X 10.7 point
5 so what exactly does that mean
well that means depending upon the
version number you're either going to
have leopard if it's ten point five or
if it's point six snow leopard point
seven lion or point eight mount line so
it's just that easy to figure out which
version of Mac ports to install so I
personally have Lions so I'm just going
to click on that and then Mac ports is
going to install down here now I already
have it installed so then what we're
going to do is you're going to go
through the whole process of installing
everything then come into terminal
inside of here and after you install Mac
ports you want to make sure that you go
sudo port dash V self update like that
if you can't see it there it is sudo
port dash be self update and then just
hit enter and you're going to have to
enter your password of course and
everything is going to update and you
can see there is everything updating
it's wonderful and there we go and what
this is going to allow us to do is
really easily install SQL Lite and there
we go we're all installed so I'm going
to clear my scroll back and here we are
now how hard is it to install SQL Lite
now you're just going to type in sudo
port install SQLite three that's
that's all you need to type in and then
hit enter and the world will be
wonderful and everything will be
installed so you may ask yourself well
where exactly is it installed right here
under users and then my name is Derrick
baños and it is going to be installed
right inside of here and all your
databases and all your different files
and as you're going to see here in a
couple minutes I'm going to actually
create a folder that is going to hold
all of my databases and so forth in
someone so now we'll jump into how to
install it on Windows well you're just
going to go into SQL Lite dot org click
on download scroll down through here
until you get to precompiled binaries
for Windows this is the guy you're going
to want and just click on where it says
SQLite shell da-da-da-da-da and of
course open it up and there you can see
SQL Lite is installed right there now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
actually get this guy and cut it jump
into computer here my computer or my
part of Windows is called boot camp jump
into Windows and then finally jump into
system 32 and then just paste it inside
of here now the reason I did that is
because I have this path set up for
windows system32 so I'm just going to go
in here click on programs accessories
and then I'm going to go into command
prompt and here I am inside of the DOS
prompt or the command prompt then I can
type in SQLite 3 and you can see SQL
Lite opened right up inside of there now
everything I do from the rest of the
tutorial is going to work on Windows and
Mac's but I'm used to using a Mac so I
am going to use the Macintosh from now
on so here I am back in the wonderful
world of Mac's now if you want to create
a new database all you're going to have
to do is type in SQLite 3 and I'm just
going to call the first database we're
going to create test database and what
this does is it's going to both open up
SQLite as well as provide a database
name now if I want to store it off here
by creating a table you just type in
create table and let's say I want to
call it employees and I want to have an
ID and I want it to be an integer ID and
since I want this to automatically
generate values that start at 1 and then
increase by 1 all on its own I'm going
to call this a primary key and then I'm
also going to have a text value
out of it that is going to be called
name and that is how easy it is to
create a table so now let's go in here
and actually populate this table with
employees how you do that is insert into
employees and then you can do this in a
couple different ways I'm going to show
you one way and then show you the other
way then we're gonna say what the names
are for the parts in the database so we
want to assign values so then you just
type in values and then I want to set my
ID for this employee and let's say I
want to call him max Eisenhart well
there we go
and he's been inserted in there now to
save myself a little bit of time
actually there's no point doing it this
early now I'm going to show you the
other way to install or enter a value
now since this is a primary key what
this is going to allow me to do is just
automatically go in there for me and add
one to this value to make this - as
you're going to see in a second so if I
just want to enter in my name I can just
type in values and then inside of this
one let's say I want to go Pietro
Maximoff and there we go and that's also
going to work now if I want to come in
here and shorten this up I can just
press up and then come in here and enter
another employee and this time I'm going
to call this person Wanda Maximoff and
then my next employee is Mortimer twende
and then the final employee that I'm
going to put inside of here is going to
be jason wyngarde and there we are so we
entered in a whole bunch of different
employees inside of the table inside of
our database now I'm going to clear back
my scroll back and start showing you how
to output this information so I'm going
to set this mode as column and in column
mode what this is going to do is each
record is going to be shown on a
separate line with the data aligned in
columns so you know pretty simple and
then let's say that I also want to show
headers for all the columns so I'm going
to set that for on and then if I want to
show all my employees I'm just going to
say select star which is all of them
employees and there you go you can see
all of them print it out there on the
screen but you can also say here that
the names
didn't print out the whole way we're
going to fix that here in a second all
I'm going to do if I want to change that
is go with and then I can define the
width of my first column let's just say
it's 15 and then let's set the width for
my second column to 20 and you don't
have to put a semicolon there or
actually don't do it and now you're
going to see if I go select star from
employees that now you can see the whole
entire name so that's pretty useful
clear scroll back and if you want to
exit out of SQLite you just type in a
dot and exit and there you go now you're
out of there and then of course if you
want to reopen your database just going
to type in exactly we typed in before
and there you can see we're back inside
of there if you want to display the
tables in your database you're just
going to type in dot tables and there
you can see employees popped up and then
also there's a whole bunch of different
modes which I'm going to show you let's
say that you wanted all of the
information to be printed out on its own
line we're just going to set it to mode
line and then select star from employees
and there you can see all of them print
it out on their own line if you want to
see all of these statements that were
used actually let's clear the scroll
back here if you want to see all of the
statements that were used to create the
database you just type in schema and
there you can see there's only one or if
you want to see just the statements that
were used to create employees type in
schema employees and it shows you the
same thing but if there were multiple
tables it would show you individual ones
you could also come in here and set mode
back to column and headers to on and if
you wanted to get a more detailed look
at your database you can type in select
and you can go type name TBL underscore
name SQL from SQL light master and I
have all of the stuff that I'm typing
here in a link in the description
underneath the video so you can use that
as a cheat sheet and there you can say a
whole bunch more information popped up
there for us to look at and if you want
to show the current settings so I've
been show there
are you can also see all the different
things here that I've been changing and
I'll go through here and explain like
null value let's say that null instead
of being an empty space you wanted null
value to actually be the warden all no
problem just go null value dot null and
then of course show again and now you
can see that changed if you wanted to
change the prompt for SQL lights since
we're using SQL 83 you could come in
here and go prompt dot SQL Lite 3 put a
space boink and you can see it already
worked and if you would like to output
your database on the screen you could go
dump and dump can be used for a couple
different things but there you can see
that's how we built the whole entire
thing and if you'd like to output to a
file which is really cool what we're
going to do is go output change our
output source and I'm going to change it
to documents and everything's going to
be based off of this guy right here
so remember and you can actually see
test dB there's your database that was
created so if I want to come in here and
actually create a new folder that's
going to hold all of my database
information I'm going to go in here to
documents in this situation and I
created a new folder called SQLite 3
files now of course it's going to be
slightly different with a Windows
machine so I'm just going to go dot
forward slash documents SQLite 3 files
then I can go employees dot SQL and then
I can go dump to output to that file and
then if I want to change my output back
to my screen instead of outputting to a
file I'm just going to go output
standard out now if we bounce over into
SQL Lite 3 files you're going to see
employees SQL and if I want to open this
with a text editor for example just go
TextEdit and you can see that all the
same exact things that previously
printed out are now printed out to this
file that's pretty cool
now one thing it's kind of weird with
SQL Lite is you don't delete a database
with a command you delete tables as you
can see here in a second with commands
but not databases so that means that
what you're going to have to do if you
want to delete a database is write it
here again just go test database and
you're going to drag it down here and
delete it now why I did that is I'm
going to show you now how to recreate it
from the SQL Lite file that I just
created
right here and if you want to delete a
table you just go drop table employees
but I got a little bit ahead of myself
yeah I see it gave me an error because I
already deleted database but if I just
want to delete to a table that's exactly
how you would do it now that if I want
to come in here and actually read back
in the database information that I
deleted I'm going to jump out SQL Lite
type in SQL Lite 3 testdb to recreate it
and there you can see I are I am and
then I'm going to type in dot read dot
documents which is where I have it
stored yours is probably going to be
different SQLite 3 files forward slash
employees SQL and there we go
repopulated that database with that
information that was saved and then of
course if I come in here and go select
everything from employees here is all
the information again so now let's take
a little bit closer look at mode and all
the different things that it's capable
of doing because it's pretty cool
one of the options for mode is of course
to use columns as well as comma
separated values you could also come in
here and type in mode dot HTML and
that's going to print out an HTML table
which is kind of useful insert is going
to show all of the insert commands that
are used to create the table you can see
if I do this and then go select dot from
ploy ease there is the insert if you set
insert for mode if you wanted to
actually show a list without commas you
would just type in dot mode this is
something you can play with on your own
list that's another option and then
finally if you wanted to do tabs there's
how you would do that as well I'm sure
you know how that works now if you
wanted to output all of this information
as a comma separated value list to a
file you could actually do this in a
couple different ways you could type in
mode dot CSV you could also type in dot
SEP a Raider like that and then put in a
comma and then output all of the
information as I've been showing you
before but I actually prefer to just go
dot mode CSV separator by the way would
change the way that information
being output and then let's say that I
want to output it to a brand new file is
calling a separated value list
I'm going to go output dot forward slash
documents SQL Lite three files employees
dot CSV and then you're going to type in
select star from employees and then
don't forget to set your output to
standard out now if you do that there
you go
you see employees dot CSV and then we
can bounce over here go TextEdit and
there you can see all the names printed
out as a CSV file also pretty cool and
just in case what the heck I have a
little bit of time here let's just go
and show you what it looks like if you
output the information as an HTML file
there we go there you go there's a table
and if you decide that you would like to
put it on separate lines with just the
column names and values I mean there's a
whole bunch of different options just go
mode line doctor dot and there they are
and then finally you go mode TCL this is
kind of a funky one what this is going
to do is well I might as well just show
you there you go it's going to print out
all the information using double quotes
and of course make sure you go output
standard out so there is a whole bunch
of different ways to use SQLite in the
next part of the tutorial I'm going to
go through all of the SQL behind SQL
Lite and then after I'm done with all
that I'm going to show you how to use
SQL Lite inside of Android please leave
