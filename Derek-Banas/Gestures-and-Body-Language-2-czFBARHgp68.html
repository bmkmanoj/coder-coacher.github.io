new and improved gestures and body
language tutorial this time with
pictures and videos so this time you
guys shouldn't have any questions
because I'm going to demonstrate
everything on the screen as you probably
know I've spent quite a bit of time
studying gestures and body language and
in this tutorial you're going to see a
combination of what all the experts
agree on
I read numerous books and psychology
body language and law enforcement
training manuals what I did was I took
everything that all these different
experts agreed on and put it in this one
video first I'm going to go over some
basics and we're going to go from the
eyes into an analysis of hands arms and
then legs but first off eyes a person's
eyes dilate strongly when they are very
stimulated and or in a problem-solving
mode at maximum dilation the person is
ready to make a decision and more than
likely that decision is going to be a
positive one in a conversation if a
person is maintaining strong eye contact
they are either interested in you if
their eyes are dilated or challenging
you if their eyes are constricted or as
I have here the normal eye this would be
constricted and eyebrow raised is a sign
that a person isn't threatening when you
eyebrow raise someone they will often
smile this is a very submissive sign or
at least it is perceived that way
the most threatening look is achieved by
moving narrowed eyes first to a target
and then followed by a head move as I
demonstrate here also 70% of Liars based
off of studies maintain strong eye
contact with their victims far above
average you will notice that they are
maintaining more eye contact than they
should if someone gives you a sideways
glance look at their eyebrows if they
are raised they like you like I have
here or if they are lowered they do not
like you if a person's blink rate
increases they are more than likely
lying and if a person's eyes are darting
around they are getting either bored or
nervous when first meeting a person
shake hands with strong eye contact and
then give them at least three seconds to
look at you uninterrupted this is the
best way to first meet somebody and then
to continue building strong rapport with
this person you just met you should
maintain eye contact from 60 to 70% of
the time until you have gotten through
the introductory phase if a person is
remembering a visual thought they will
look up and
word right if however they are
constructing or making up a visual
thought they will look up and to your
left so for example if asked what color
is your house they will look up and to
their right like you have right here
because that's a visual thought they can
actually remember however if they are
asked to imagine their house was purple
with yellow polka dots they would look
in this direction because they have to
make this up by studying the eyes you
can also tell when a person is lying if
you ask somebody a question and they
look in this direction chances are
they're going to tell you the truth
however if they look in that direction
before answering you chances are they
are going to lie to you
if a person looks sideways and to your
right
they are remembering something they
heard so once again you ask them a
question their eyes dart in that
direction you can then tell more than
likely if they're going to either lie
we're not lying if they are constructing
or making something up they will look
sideways and to your left as I am doing
here once again for example if asked
what is your favorite song they would
look sideways into the right and if
asked to imagine what sounds a Jackalope
would make they would look in this
direction if you don't know what a
Jackalope is it's a mythical creature
that's supposedly a rabbit and an
antelope so if that makes any sense
if a person is recalling a feeling or
emotion they will look down and to your
left and if they are talking to
themselves internally they will look
down and to your right and just to
review can see right here visual
constructing this means they're making
something up visually in their head
auditory that means they're trying to
come up with a sound that's made up
kinesthetic means feelings or emotions
that are remembering a feeling or an
emotion visual remembered that
remembering something they saw auditory
remember they're remembering something
they heard auditory internal means they
are talking to themselves when shaking
hands with someone if your hand is on
top you are trying to dominate that
person as my hand is doing right here
also if a person flips your hand palm
side up they are trying to dominate you
whenever they first meet you an equal
handshake in which both people shake in
a vertical manner with equal pressure is
the best way to generate good rapport to
make sure you're able to create an equal
handshake step slightly to the left and
forward when approaching a stranger for
handshake do not shake with both
or touch any other part of the body
unless you have an intimate relationship
with this person however a brief touch
to the elbow during a handshake has been
shown to generate good feelings towards
a stranger a valuable clue to whether
the person is being open and honest is
whether they are showing their palms or
not honesty equals palm displays so for
example if a person says they can't do
something and they show you their hands
they are more than likely telling you
the truth
also if you talk with your palms this
more than likely will get others to
answer positively to your questions
however just like with eye contact if
there is way too much palm display which
you start to notice their palms are
always out chances are this person is a
good liar and more than likely is lying
to you hands clenched in front of a
person means they are holding back a
negative reaction holding one wrist in
your hand behind your back is an attempt
of self control the further up the wrist
the person is holding is a barometer of
either frustration or anger if a person
places their head on their open hands as
if on a platter they are saying they
admire you if you want to draw people
towards yourself this is the best pose
you can make if a person is picking
imaginary lint they have a secret
opinion that they don't want to tell you
hands folded in front hand and hand
shows they are feeling vulnerable if you
use a palm down gesture you are
exercising Authority and this right here
will antagonize many people even though
as you can see with my face I'm not
really antagonizing or acting as an
authority figure this is more of a
gesture that you would make to somebody
whenever you're saying sit down or calm
down pointing at a person is one of the
most annoying gestures never rub your
thumb to your forefinger around people
also the rubbing of hands together shows
that you are expecting something
positive and the speed at which these
hands are rubbing together will show who
the person thinks will benefit so if I'm
rubbing my hands very quickly together
that means I think I'm going to benefit
from something and if I rub them more
slowly that means I expect others to
benefit the steeple hand gesture
represents that you are confident and
self-assured this gesture should be used
sparingly however because it can come
across as being arrogant if however you
want to guarantee a look of confidence
this is the look I know it looks like
I'm praying but this is a position a
person would normally take when they
were sitting
and not standing by pressing your
forefinger to your thumb you will come
off as authoritative however not
aggressive so this is definitely a
better way to point rather than
projecting one finger forward holding
hands behind the back shows that you are
confident and feel superior hands on
hips show that you are preparing to
dominate unless elbows are held close to
the body and this is a submissive pose
if the person tucks their thumbs in
their pants rather than rest their hands
on their hips they are very aggressive
thumbs protruding from the pocket show
that person feels they are superior to
others if the hands are held out from
the body this shows that they're feeling
superior as well and somewhat aggressive
we fold our arms in front of ourselves
when we feel threatened or don't like or
trust something when you fold your arms
on top of that you lose credibility and
if you are folding your arms while
grasping your biceps it shows that you
are feeling insecure as I demonstrate
here if however you clench your fists
while folding your arms people will see
you as being hostile arms crossed with
thumbs turned up shows that a person is
warming up you women will often use
their purse to create protection in some
situations and if in a meeting a person
puts a drink on the opposite side of the
hand in which they are drinking as I
demonstrate here that shows that they
feel uncomfortable information you gain
by studying leg and feet positions is
extremely useful because people have
little control over their feet this is
also why most meetings feel only
comfortable if the two people have their
legs hidden by a table or a desk if you
want to appear young and vibrant walk
quickly while swinging your arms your
feet will point towards where you want
to go so in this instance I want to go
to my right because that foot is
protruding that direction when first
meeting with someone and you want them
to open up always offer them a hot
coffee or tea that makes it very
difficult to remain crossed up without
burning themselves another tip to get a
person to unlock themselves is to ask
them positive questions that get them to
tell you what they are feeling never
cross your legs and then have both hands
cradled behind your head this is
extremely off-putting especially to
women the jiggling of the feet is a sign
the person wants to get away from a
situation as I demonstrate here open and
uncross legs show that you are open or
dominant while cross legs show that
you're closed off or uncertain and this
is true whether you are sitting or
standing and if you ever want to find
out who
thinks they are the alpha male in a room
full of a bunch of men look for the man
that is sitting like this
if legs are crossed my hand is pointing
the direction towards what I prefer in
this situation never ask a person to
make a decision if they have both their
legs and their arms crossed and if a
person has their legs crossed and they
are holding them in place as I
demonstrate here with their hands they
are feeling very stubborn and are in
more than likely in a mood to reject any
of the opinions you may provide a person
that locks their ankles together is
essentially biting their lip and holding
back a negative emotion or are just fear
for uncertain and if a person locks one
foot around their calf or thigh they are
showing signs of timidness approach them
as a friend in a low-key submissive way
to relax them if a person sits oddly in
a chair they are showing you that they
don't see you as important and they are
the dominant person in the room and if
they place the back of the chair in
front of you they're in the mood to take
control of your situation and are very
dominant and stubborn and aggressive
women specifically cross and uncross
their legs around people they like and
more specifically cross their legs in a
parallel manner when they really like
someone I never sit like this because
it's terribly uncomfortable but I'm
demonstrating how a woman would sit
whenever she would be attracted to
somebody you can check to see that a
smile is sincere by checking for
wrinkles around the eyes I naturally
have wrinkles around my eyes I'm trying
to make a fake smile having a hard time
doing it but this is more of what I mean
by a real smile also if you smile at a
person they will often respond as well
people that smile a lot often will
receive positive reactions and when a
person is smiling they are more than
likely telling you the truth a false
smile will often appear stronger on one
side of the face versus the other well a
tight lips mound which teeth are not
shown tell you that the person is trying
to keep a secret a smile on which the
mouth is open is trying to get others to
believe you are comical also a smile on
which the person has their head turned
down and their eyes or aimed upward is
used to show that the person is
attracted and finally what exactly it is
laughing and yawning me laughing is
attractive and makes you as well as
others feel comfortable and as people
age they actually will start to laugh a
great deal less for example an average
preschooler
laughs 400 times per day versus the
average adult who only last 15 in fact
laughter has a lot more to do with
bonding than it does with humor and
likewise yawning is used by people to
build rapport and avoid aggression hope
