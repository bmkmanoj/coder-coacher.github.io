10 of my c-sharp video tutorial this
one's going to be very interesting
because this time we're going to be
using interfaces first to model a simple
car and then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to model a complex flexible system
that is going to show you how you can
interact with electronic devices we are
quite literally going to create objects
that are going to model picking up a
remote control taking the road control
aiming at a television pressing a button
and then having interactions occur
between in a extremely flexible way and
basically an interface is just a class
with nothing but abstract methods like
we saw previously with abstract classes
and interfaces are used to represent a
contract and object may decide to
support now all of the code as well as a
transcript of this video is available in
the description and now let's get into
it
okay so I'm going to model a very simple
interface here and then create an object
that is going to implement it and we're
going to start off with what I'm going
to call drivable now very often
interfaces commonly have names that are
adjectives because adjectives modify
nouns or objects however the names very
often also describe abstract things and
it is very common to prefix your
interfaces in c-sharp with a capital
letter I like you see right here now
what I'm going to do is model what I
consider a drivable vehicle to be able
to do so an interface can have
properties and remember this is a
contract we're saying that anyone that
models this interface has to have wheels
and we're going to go get em set and
they are also going to have a speed and
we're also going to say that they are
going to have to have the methods or
capabilities to both move as well as
stop and all of these are considered
abstract methods just you don't have to
put the abstract in there because you'll
already labeled it is
so we're going to save that and like I
said this is a simple one now we're
going to jump over into vehicle and it's
going to have a line here it's going to
say that you know we didn't implement
the interface and this is how you
implement an interface just : and
whatever you want the interface to be
and you can have multiple interfaces you
so just put a comma and multiple
interfaces out we're going to implement
this so we're going to say show
potential fixes and implement interface
and it's going to create everything here
for me I am going to dramatically
simplify this so we're going to have our
speed here and I am just going to get
rid of all of this stuff so that's all
going to go away and then I'm just going
to go get and set just like we always do
going to also get rid of all this extra
stuff right here and then inside of this
likewise just go get and set alright so
those are all set up well now what we
need to do is actually decide what we're
going to do with the move and the stop
vehicle here in this situation what I'm
also going to want to put a constructor
inside of here so let's go public
vehicle and let's also throw in another
field that's going to be specific to the
vehicle class let's say that we want to
have one in here that is going to be
represent the brand so this is going to
be a string and brands and have the
getters and setters generated for us so
we're going to have brand as well as
speed and wheels now we can go into the
constructor area here and string and
we'll say brand is equal to no brand by
default we are then going to come in and
get the number of wheels and we're going
to say zero but false and then we will
get our speed and have that also be zero
by default and then of course you know
that we're going to say brand is equal
to whatever the brand was that was
passed in and Wheels is equal to
whatever the wheels were that were
passed in and then speed equal to the
speed that was passed in all right so
there's our constructor pretty simple
stuff now for the Move part I just want
to keep this nice and simple the next
part is going to be a little bit more
calm
I'm going to come in here and I'm going
to do just put some information here do
something like the brands moves forward
apps and whatever the speed is set at
and I'm going to say miles per hour and
then likewise we can come down here and
get rid of this guy paste this inside of
here and then we're just going to say
the brand and we'll just change this to
stops right like that
alright so very simple and I let's go in
here also since it is stopped and let's
change this to zero now we can jump over
into program and we can go and implement
this now I guess I should also show you
how to create interfaces you're going to
do it slightly different than classes
you're going to go in here and click on
projects add new item and one of the
items options is going to be interface
so that's how you create an interface
inside of c-sharp or Visual Studio I
guess specifically alright so now let's
go and create it so we want to create a
vehicle object so I'm going to go
vehicle and let's say this is a Buick is
equal to new vehicle and we're going to
pass in some information so we'll say
Buick and then we'll say it has four
wheels and it's going 116 miles per hour
ok so just something to do and then we
can check if a vehicle is going to
implement drivable how you do that is go
if Buick is a drivable then we know that
we will be able to use the methods
inside of it so we can do something like
move and we can also come in and do
stopped like I said this is a very very
simple type of interface otherwise we
can come in here and let's just get rid
of all that right there and we'll say
something like the can't be driven
because it's not a it doesn't implement
drivable so that makes sense so Buick
brand will go in there and save that
alright so now that we have that all set
up and saves we can run this and you're
going to see that it's able to go in
there and do it moves forward 160 miles
per hour and Buick stops ok like I said
extremely simple type of setups
now we're going to do something that is
quite elaborate what I'm going to do
here is basically with interfaces you
can create very flexible systems and
here what I'm going to do is model a
generic electronic device
like a television or a radio and remotes
that are then going to control them and
then further yet the buttons on the
remotes so we're able to take this from
a big picture type of thing deep deep
deep down so what I'm going to do here
is this is an interface of course called
electronic device and I'm going to say
that every single one of my electronic
devices are going to be able to turn on
and turn off and let's say we want the
volume to be able to turn up on them and
the volume to be able to turn down and
for homework I'm going to basically set
up the on and off and your job is to go
and make the volume up and down work and
if you do that you'll understand
interfaces on a very deep level and
that's all we're doing right there we
just created our interface for all of
our electronic devices alright so now
we're going to get more specific with
television now because we implemented
electronic device the electronic device
interface any other device we create
will know exactly how to interface with
those devices so since we have a
television we know that we are going to
have all of those different methods come
in here show potential fixes just click
on an implement interface all right so
let's just create everything now I have
to come in here and specifically tell it
what to do so one thing I want to do
though is I want to come in and I want
to define volume so I'm going to go int
and volume and there that is and then
for these guys get this out of here if
it goes off it's just quite simply just
get rid of that and we'll say the TV is
off and of course it could do much more
complex things than just that and then
for on we're going to do pretty much
exactly the same thing the TV is
and for volume down we can come in and
do something a little bit more complex
so we could say something like if and
volume is not equal to zero then we want
to decrement the volume and then after
that we can come in and say let's go
like this and get rid of this the TV
volume is at anthro volume into that
like this and likewise we will do a very
very similar thing with the volume up
paste that in there if the volume is not
equal to let's say we want the upper
bounds to be 100 then we can increment
this and TV volume is at volume alright
so we'll just keep that that way and
we'll copy this for later
all right so very simply incrementally
we are adding this functionality here
all right now what we're going to do is
jump over and handle commands which are
going to basically represent brought
button presses going to be doing this in
an interface called command and
basically we can model what happens when
a button is pressed for example a power
button and what we're going to do here
is break everything down so that we can
add pretty much an infinite amount of
flexibility to say a remote control that
would have numerous buttons on it and
basically what we're going to do inside
of here is just say that this is going
to have two capabilities it's going to
have an execute and it's going to have
an undo so just like a power button if
you press it the first time and TVs off
it turns it on if you press it again if
the TV's on it turns it off okay so it's
basically going to do something or undo
what it previously did and that's all
we're going to do with that now we're
going to jump over into power button and
we're going to implement this so there's
the command we'll come in and show
potential fixes implement interface and
there that is and basically what we're
going to do inside of here is we are
going to refer to our instances using
the interface so we can come in and we
can go electronic device and let's call
this device just to keep it simple and
then let's also implement this a little
bit for
there we go public and power button this
is going to receive an electronic device
which I'm going to call device and then
I can say this device is equal to
whatever the device is that they passed
inside of there so that's how we can set
that up and now simply we can come into
the execute part and say device and on
and it's working and undo we can come in
here to this guy and whenever that's
clicked on we can call off and it's very
modularized and very very simple to see
what's going on basically if we come in
here we can see a device on we jump over
here into the electronic device
interface we see it was defined there
and then in television specifically it
is defined there what happens whenever
on is clicked on so everything is very
modular eyes and extremely flexible it's
so so easy to come in here and make
dramatic changes without affecting any
of the other classes that are defined
inside of it
so now let's get even more into it with
TV remotes so with our TV remote what
we're going to do is literally model the
action of picking up the remote with
your hands off of a desk or what have
you so all this is going to do is have
public and static and it's going to
return any type of electronic device
remember I said this could be a radio
this could be anything
so we'll say get device and in this
situation what it's going to do is
return a new television and we could put
logic inside of here that would return a
radio or whatever so I'm just keeping
this very simple and you can add that
logic and it would be very simple
although so we have that safe let's jump
back over into our program and let's
make it work so what we're going to do
here is we're going to model the act of
picking up a remote and aiming it at the
TV and clicking power button and then
watching as the TV turns on and off so
the very first thing we need to do is
pick up the TV remote and to do so I'm
going to come in and go electronic
device I'm going to call this TV could
call TV remote or whatever but I already
called this TV remote so alright so we
got that and we're then going to call
get device so there's get device
at all set up and now we can create our
power button so we can say power button
and let's just call this power but is
equal to new power button and we're
going to say that we want the TV power
button specifically to be used and just
like that now we can go POW but and
execute or press or whatever you want it
to bei but I just call it execute and
now we can also come in here and go to
power butts and undo all right like this
and everything is going to work so it
just looks right I mean you know it's
pressing the button pressing it again
and if we run it you're going to see
that all those things matched up with
each other across all those different
classes and by pressing the button on
the remote control it turned the TV on
and off okay so there is both a very
simple type of way of using interfaces
and avataric methods and a whole bunch
of different things and then a more
elaborate system and as we start making
games you're going to see the games are
very much modeled in this way of
building up from the very very abstract
to the very very specific all right so I
hope you guys enjoyed that tutorial and
like always please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
