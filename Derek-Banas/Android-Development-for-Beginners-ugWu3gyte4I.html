1 of my android development tutorial for
beginners however do not let that title
dissuade you if you do not consider
yourself a beginner because I think this
tutorial be very valuable for most
anyone if you don't know all the things
that a tool called App Inventor can do
for you in fact about 80% of the
requests I get on how to develop certain
things for Android can all be done
infinitely easier using App Inventor
it's a very very powerful tool that most
people just don't know about so what are
we going to cover in this tutorial I'm
going to show you how to set up app
inventor on Windows and Mac it's
extremely easy shouldn't be a problem
then what I'm going to do is create an
application over the next two tutorials
that is going to allow you to use GPS to
find locations it's also going to show
you how to open up dialog boxes how to
open other applications how to open up
settings how to use vibration how to
play sounds how to convert text to
speech how to use accelerometers and how
to get your app to automatically resize
whenever the screen orientation changes
and a whole bunch of other different
things now the app is kind of goofy but
it will cover a ton of things and I just
wanted to make this fun so let's take a
look at exactly what the finished apps
going to look like okay so this is the
application we're going to make it's
going to automatically come in here
AB latitude and longitude it's going to
show our zombie on the screen if we
touch it
ninety-nine point eight three five one
nine it's going to generate
text-to-speech and print out or speak
out the latitude and longitude it's also
going to vibrate whenever we touch it if
we change the orientation it's only to
automatically resize itself and if we
change it back it's going to change back
and also if we shake it it's going to
play a zombie sound effect and there we
go okay so there's the application like
I said it's kind of a fun little
application it's just going to
demonstrate how to do a whole ton of
different things so let's jump into
exactly how to install everything
alright so to install App Inventor what
we're going to have to do here this is
very easy unless you don't have Java
installed and it's a little bit more
complicated if you have a Mac and you
don't have Java installed so let's just
come here first to App Inventor mit.edu
and what you want to do here is go to
support and get started right like that
and chances are let's click on setup
instructions which is right here now
chances are what we're going to do here
is develop on Android devices and the
reason why is yes there is an emulator
but a lot of things I want to teach you
just don't work on the emulator so what
I'm going to do is instead focus on
those people that have an Android device
they're cheap and expensive hopefully
someone can get one and at the same time
I'm going to show you how to set up
everything to use the emulator just
understand that some things just won't
function like GPS for example doesn't
function when you're using an emulator a
lot of things do but there's one example
of something that doesn't then what
we're going to do is we're going to need
to install an application on our
telephone or on our tablet and I'm going
to show you exactly how to do that okay
to get your application we're going to
use to develop over Wi-Fi on our Android
device we just have to go and find the
guy that we're going to want to install
course if you just go into the search
area right up here and type in MIT ai2
it's going to pop open and you're going
have to hit install mine's already
installed so I'm just going to open it
and whenever it opens up it's going to
look like this and whenever we're
developing applications I'll show you
this a little bit later what you're
going to do is whenever you want to
transfer your application over to your
device you're either going to enter a
six digit code or you're going to click
on this guy right here and it's going to
scan a QR code which is going to be on
the screen and so that's how that works
okay so now that you have that
application installed you basically can
just start using it as long as you have
Java on your computer if you do not and
you are on a Macintosh and you want to
use Google Chrome this is the only
situation I'm just covering absolutely
everything you'd ever want to know if
you want to use Google Chrome you're
going to have to install Java six and
I'm going to provide a link or this link
right here in the description for the
video this is where you get Java 6 if
you want to use Java version 6 on a Mac
on Chrome if you want to use Firefox for
both Windows users and Mac users you're
going to go to the same address
you're gonna go to java.com /en download
manual JSP again the links in the
description so the only reason why
you're going to want this is if you want
to use Google Chrome on a Mac otherwise
use Firefox on a Mac and just go here
and download java that's if you don't
have it alright so now it's time to go
in here and actually make the emulator
work and here it is and all you got to
do is click on instructions the easiest
thing to do is just to go here and find
it again it's App Inventor on mit.edu
explorer you go into support and get
started ok so that's where I am then to
install again this is only if you want
the emulator if you don't want the
emulator forget about this and just jump
ahead in the video but here it is if you
want the enemy later for a Mac click on
that click on download installer and
everything just works that's it if you
want to install on windows click on
instructions for Windows there you go
you're going to click on download
Installer again and then just go through
all of this stuff which is very simple
and everything is ready to go this is if
you want to connect USB
you can click on instructions if you
want to do that but now why would you
want to
whenever you could just use a Wi-Fi
connection all right so now that we have
everything installed on here all we need
to do is again go to App Inventor on
mit.edu and click on create you're going
to log in with your Google password you
have to have some sort of Google
password which pretty much everybody
does and here are just a whole bunch of
different things that I've played with
over the past year and if we want to
create a new project we're just going to
come in here and click on project and
I'm going to say start a new project and
I'm going to create to the guy that you
just saw and I'm going to call this
zombie locator cuz that's what it is
it's sort of a goofy sort of zombie type
locator and hit OK alright and this is
what you're going to say over here on
the left side of the screen you're going
to see all the different components
you're going to be able to drag and drop
over here this right here is your screen
this is going to represent your actual
application and over here are going to
be some components you're going to be
able to use now if you don't know what a
component does like if you don't have
any idea what a button does you can
always click right here in this little
question mark and it pops up and it
tells you what the button does and if
that's not enough information for you
click on more info and get more but
either way you can also go and easily
drag and drop check boxes and we can use
clocks to time things and images and
labels and list Pickers and by the end
of this tutorial I want to cover all
those different things you're also going
to have layouts down here scroll up
horizontal arrangements you're going to
use this whenever you want to go from
left to right vertical arrangement
you're going to use this whenever you
want to be going downwards in regards to
how you're going to lay out all your
components and table whenever you want
to do some more complicated things get
into media yes we're going to be able to
record use the camera pick images play
sounds record sounds convert text to
speech play videos all sorts of things
it's a really absolutely amazing tool
drawing an animation just click on that
there's a ball there's a canvas you're
going to be able to create a paint
application literally it's minutes it's
absolutely amazing all sorts of
animation things sensors accelerometer
barcode scanner location sensor we're
going to use this we're going to use
this whole bunch of other different
things social contact picker email
picker all these different things
storage we have databases I mean there's
just so many different things
there is even a way of connecting to
Lego Mindstorms so there you go
and basically what we're going to have
here is whenever we put a component here
on our screen we're going to have this
part right here let's just go and do it
let's go and user interface so I'm going
to get a label and if I want to put a
label over here I just drag and drop it
and there it is there's our label now
you can see over here under components
that label is now listed as a component
then you can also see that you can
change your background color for your
label just by clicking on it let it be
none you can make the font bold or
italic change the font size there's a
limited number of different typefaces
available we can change that of course
let's come in here and change the text
on it this is where you change it you
don't change it over here you change it
over here I know it's a little bit weird
and let's just call this zombie now
let's call this locate the zombie it's
just a label it's just a little box
text-align:left right da-da-da-da-dah
I'm going to put it in the center text
color black is fine do we want it to
show yes width here automatic is going
to size it based off of the size of the
text like that and if I would go into
font size and change it to 20 like that
you're going to see that it went and
automatically got bigger but it's still
basically taking up that much space if
we would want it to be centered on the
screen what we're going to need to do is
go in here and do a couple things let's
go into screen first now for the screen
what we're going to do is we're going to
have a background image which were sort
of like grey splatters of blood or
something like that so I'm gonna go in
here and I'm going to show you how to
set a background image as well but the
very first thing we're going to do is
have our background color be none so
there that is change that to none and
then we're going to get ourselves a
background image now to get a background
image we're just going to click inside
of here right like that and we're going
to go upload file and this little guy is
going to pop up here and then we have to
click on that and we need to find it so
here is my splatter background just
select it and you're probably going to
want to use ping or JPEG files all the
time I always use pane and there that is
and just hit OK you're gonna see it
automatically it's going to update
inside of there
boink there you go now it's splattered
all right now I'm going to go into your
to label select
again and let's say that I want that to
be centered here on our screen well one
thing I have to do first is the width if
I want it to be centered on the whole
screen I'm going to click on this I'm
going to say fill parent that's pretty
much what that means height I'm going to
let that be automatic and automatic is
basically going to mean it's going to be
as tall as the letters are with a little
bit of padding inside of there
I'm packing to screen1 again I'm going
to be able to come in here and define
different screen animations that occur
whenever your application is closed
we'll get more into that later icon is
going to allow us to go in there and
insert 48 by 48 pixels sized
icons and that's what's going to
represent your application on your
device your Android device we're going
to be able to define opening screen
animations whenever the thing opens up
screen orientation and let that be
unspecified but this is basically the
default orientation if you just let it
be unspecified it's automatically going
to use this screen orientation based off
of the position of the device do I want
it to be scrollable in this situation no
all that means is if i shut off
scrollable that means there's no
scrollbar in the screen which means the
application is going to be as big as
what the screen allows and it's not
going to be able to allow me to scroll
but I don't want to do that so that's
fine title this is again for the screen
and this is what I'm talking about now
it's set for screen 1 and this is where
that title is so let's call this zombie
locator and there it is and hit like
that these two guys down here are
basically going to be used whenever you
would upload to the Google Play Store so
each time you create a new version of
your application these are going to
increment and that's all they are for no
need to worry too much about that all
right so there we go and when we have a
label we could come in here and click on
label come down here and say rename so
let's say that I want it to instead be
called title label
I don't care there you go ok and now you
can see that it now is called title
label now what I want to do is create
the area on the screen that's going to
have the zombie in it that is going to
react when it is clicked on now to put
this on the screen what I'd like to do
is have the zombie button is what it
actually is going to be is going to be a
button
to locate or put it in a very specific
part of the screen anytime I want to
mess around with what we were referring
to as layout I would need to click on
layout over here and decide one went to
go from left to right well it's just
basically one big button so yeah that's
perfectly fine otherwise I'd use
vertical arrangement vertical
arrangement would actually work but
horizontal arrangement is normally the
default whenever you don't care what the
layout looks like so let's just drop
that inside of there and you can see
right here since I don't have anything
inside of there it's not going to allow
me to change the alignment and there
that is I want this to be shown and this
is basically going to be a box it's
going to take up the majority of the
screen so I'm going to set my width to
fill parent fill the whole thing up and
then I also want to just fill in as much
height as possible just click on that
you can also see here we can define
pixels which you're going to see in a
second click on fill parent now that I
have that set up you can see that the
little layout box is taking up all of
the screen now what we got to do is get
our button so again I'm just going to go
in here and drag-and-drop this button
just drag it over here and drop it
inside of there and there it is and it's
boring and it doesn't look like a zombie
so let's make it look like a zombie so
I'm going to go over to the properties
I'm going to leave my background color
be default don't worry about it enabled
needs to be checked if you want the
button to actually do something when
somebody clicks on it you could change
the font to bold or italic font size
typeface but what I want to do is put an
image inside of it I want to put my big
zombie in there so just click on that
and I'm going to need to upload it and
you can see here I need to choose the
file and you can see here is massamba
and it's a ping file that has a
transparent background got that hit OK
and it's going to show up and there it
is and it's too big
another thing you can see is it says
text for button one we want to get rid
of that let's just get rid of it that is
the text on the button and I don't need
it so there it is it's going text
alignment can also be set here to
whatever you want left right center I
don't have it so I'm not worrying about
text color do I want it to be visible
yes and then we have our width in our
height well our width and our height is
too big for our device so what we're
going to do just for now I don't want to
get into too much complexity in regards
to changing sizes based off the device
used so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go into width and height and
I'm going to define exactly how wide
it's going to be now this is something
you do on your
run in a graphics program but I'm going
to say 285 pixels and the height is
going to be 342 pixels and again you
have to figure that out in some sort of
graphics program if you have any more
questions about that leaving a comment
section below and I will try to help you
out so now you can see its size properly
but we need to get it to fit in the
screen area right so to do that we're
going to go into horizontal arrangement
and look at that now we can arrange
things so I'm going to change this to
Center remember these were blacked out
before and that was only because there
was no components in there to use and
there we go and there is my zombie it's
all setup and it's in the right position
so that looks pretty good and I don't
believe I need to do anything else and I
think I talked about everything else
here on our screen yes okay so now that
we have the zombie button on the screen
and in the next tutorial I'm going to
show you how to make all these
components work didn't want to cover too
many things so what did I do in this
tutorial I use two different sounds for
one thing so if I want to import sounds
I need to go into media click on that
and then find sound and there's sound
right there and I just want to drag it
and drop it anywhere in this area and
there it is and now you can see non
visible components there's a sound right
there now let's say that I have a sound
I want to play 500 minimum interval that
means how long is the sound I'm going to
play so let's say I just want a sound to
play for approximately a half a second
in that situation I put 500 in there and
it would play for approximately a half
of a second well I need to go and find
my sound and I have them on my computer
I'm going to say upload file you can use
mp3s you can use WAV files click Choose
and I need to find something now this is
a half of a second little play so I'm
going to click on zombie moan wave and
that's just 303 kilobytes so I know that
is the smaller sound so select that and
import it and hit OK and now it is going
to go automatically in there boink
there it goes so there that is so now we
have a sound well we want another sound
so just drag and drop it in here and
there's another sound this sound is
going to be a little bit longer so let's
check let's make this 4,000 so that's
going to play for a little bit longer
and I need to go and find it so I'm
going to go in here and go upload file
and here we are and go choose file and
let's go and get our lah
longer playing sound that's zombie
attack wave I'm in in here and hit okay
and you're gonna see that it goes in
there in a couple seconds and go go go
and come on there it goes alright so now
we got two sounds inside of there
something else that I want to do is I
want to use the accelerometer and an
accelerometer is a sensor so go into
sensors and let's find accelerometer
there it is right there and I just going
to drag and drop it over and we'll set
that up in the next tutorial also going
to use GPS data that's under location
sensor so I'm going to grab that and
throw that in there don't need to change
any of the properties on those also when
you use pop-ups so to do that pop ups is
in user interface and it's called a
notifier I want to use alone them so
drag it over here and drop it and here's
some different properties you could set
but I'm just going to let it the way it
is I also want to be able if the user
doesn't have their GPS turned on so my
app can use it I want to be able to
automatically open up the Android
settings in the precise location where
they are going to be able to switch on
their GPS to do that I'm going to need
to be able to open up a new activity or
a new application and to do that I need
the activity starter and that is going
to be under connectivity so there's
activity starter just drag it and drop
it you can see there it is down there on
all the other ones and then finally
text-to-speech I want to use and that is
under media and text-to-speech is right
there drag it over here and drop it and
there it is got the whole entire
interface all set up for our little
zombie Android application there's
anything it didn't quite catch please
leave him in the questions and comments
section below and in the next part of
the tutorial I'm going to finish up all
of the rest of the what we need to do
and basically what we're going to do is
we're going to click on this guy up here
blocks there you go and this right here
is going to allow us to create our whole
entire application but by dragging and
dropping and connecting all of these
components it is a ton of fun it's a
totally new way of making and
applications and I hope you stick around
till next stop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
