JavaScript scripting tutorial in this
presentation I'm going to go through how
to embed JavaScript scripts in HTML
files how to hi JavaScript code for
browsers that don't support it how to
create functions how to create variables
explain what the document object model
is and how to use it to find nodes and
how to manipulate them explain how to
use for loops explain how to use while
loops if an else statement switch
statements event handlers and how to
edit your page content on the fly
well first off we're going to show you
exactly what you're going to be creating
this looks like an extremely simple
script and to a certain extent is the
reason I made it very simple is so that
I could explain all those things before
they were in those bulleted items in the
easiest possible way which is kind of
daunting basically what happens here is
as you click on all of these different
items a whole bunch of data is passed
around and then you can see the text is
changed on the fly so just stick with me
here you're going to learn a ton of
stuff if you watch this whole entire
tutorial a back to the tutorial as I've
already explained in the previous HTML
tutorial this is how you would normally
start your HTML code which the
JavaScript is going to be embedded in
then you would define the header then
you would just drive some more
information that was explained in that
HTML tutorial give your page a title and
then start your script and what you want
to do here is type in script type
followed by the equal signs and then
with the in quotes text forward slash
JavaScript now you don't necessarily
have to do this because every browser
out there that sees a script tag
immediately thinks it must be JavaScript
but this is just considered good form
and you should definitely do it so what
am I doing here well you have to
understand a little a lot of browsers
that are out there do not support
JavaScript or there are a lot of people
out there that do not trust JavaScript
maybe not a lot some so what do you do
for those people well you could hide all
your JavaScript code and so that the
page is presented in a nice form even
for people who do not use JavaScript how
you do that is by inserting an HTML
comment
that out with this bracket here followed
by an exclamation point and then two
negative signs and you can type whatever
you want here I just type that in and if
you do this it's going to hide from
those browsers that do not support
JavaScript all of your JavaScript code
in my JavaScript code then I am defining
a function just by using the keyword
function followed by the name that I
want to give the function and then in
between these two brackets here I have
to find that I expect when somebody
calls this function to send me two
variables one named ID one name new text
that I will then use to manipulate that
data that's how you create function down
here or four of the most complicated
lines of code and one of the most
complicated concepts that you will need
to understand to program in JavaScript
and I'm going to go through what each of
these lines of code do but first I need
to give you a brief explanation of what
the document object model or Dom is the
document object model or the dome allows
you to access all of the objects that
line your HTML code now every web page
is considered to be a document object so
if the browser considers the whole
webpage to be a document object how can
we work with and edit the HTML by
manipulating the document object HTML
documents as you know contain text
images links CSS style tags form
elements and a whole bunch more these
tags refer to as nodes in the document
object model JavaScript can be used to
manipulate these HTML elements by
referring to them by their defined HTML
ID name in the body of the HTML code
below I create a span that contains text
with the following HTML code this is
what you saw previously you can see here
I defined a span I gave it an ID number
so that I'll be able to refer to it in
the future and then I said that every
time somebody clicks on that span with
the on click event handler which we're
going to learn a lot more about whenever
they click on it it's going to call a
function named testing it value and pass
along those two variables to that
function previously I showed you four
lines of code and here they are again
now I'm going to explain exactly what
they do first line of code here let's
start
with var node says I want you to give me
the element being the span that I just
showed you previously defined above that
has the ID name I passed an ID name to
the function get element by ID I then
assign a shortcut that I will refer to
as the variable named node that's
basically what goes into that first line
of code here I'm using a while loop that
is used to continually perform an action
over and over again as you'll see here
in just a couple minutes in this case I
am repeatedly asking whether there is
text in the span a then with the next
line of code delete any text found in
the span using the function remove child
put plainly this code is looking for
text in the span and if it finds any it
is deleting it until the span is empty
the function create text node accepts a
variable named new text and creates a
new node that will contain the text I
give to it you see not only as a tag
considered a node but any block of text
can also be considered a node in HTML I
then use the function append child to
assign the newly created text node to
the span and that's simply without one
line of text right there you see done
next I'm defining a function named
testing F value so that I could explain
to you exactly how if-then-else
statements work you can see here I'm
accepting two variables and then I'm
taking those variable names and I'm
assigning new values to them this is
definitely not needed you cut this out
but it's just something that I did then
I'm defining a variable named value to
return this is the value that I plan on
returning whenever I'm done using this
function and I'm giving it a blank space
as a value and then I'm creating another
variable that I'm calling note
you can see here the if then else
statement is checking whether value past
is greater than value past two and for
this whole entire thing come back true
this also must be true value past one
must not be equal to value past two and
yes any other shorthand ways of doing
all of this I'm doing it in a longhand
way just so I can explain how to use
different pieces of JavaScript if this
is true which means this is true and
this is true then this action down here
is performed which means I'm going to
take the variable name value to return
and I'm going to assign it by you past
and then this plus sign here is going to
attach to this string as well as this
plus sign is going to attach this
variable at the end of the string and
then assign it to the value to return
variable receiver if this and this were
not true then this if-then-else
statement would have been performed and
here we are checking in much the same
way whether value past is greater than
value past and using the + symbol here
to make sure the book those values go
you can see here I continue on using the
if then else statement and we're doing
the same thing over and over again there
are multiple ways to compare values in
JavaScript and here they are listed out
you have your greater than symbol your
less than symbol your greater than or
equal to your less than or equal to your
equal to which is two equal signs and
then you have your not equal to symbol
which is found right here previously I
referred to the and symbol and you see
here it's called the logical and what it
does is returns true it's both the
values on the left and right equal true
this right here is the logical order
statement it returns true if either or
both values on the left and right are
true and here's the logical not and was
placed in front of an operand it
provides the opposite of the result of
the comparison so if a wasn't it greater
than B returning a true statement by
putting this exclamation point here or
the logical non
this would in actuality refer the value
false here
I'm calling the function at at no text
and passing along some variables for it
to work with I already described what
that function does then I close my
function with the closing curly brace
the two forward slashes tell the browser
that this is a comment and that it can
ignore everything that follows till the
end of the line you can also make
comments using a forward slash star and
go across multiple lines as long as you
end that comment with a star forward
slash that's all I have time to cover
today in this video but in the next
video we're going to continue on going
over the switch statement and what it
can do for you till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
