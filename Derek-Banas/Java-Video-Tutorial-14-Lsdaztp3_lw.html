14 my java video tutorial series today
I'm going to talk about a whole bunch of
things that are supposed to be
complicated but really aren't like
polymorphism inheritance protected
methods and final methods and a whole
bunch of other different things well the
first thing I did here was I created a
new class called the animals class and
I'm going to come in here and go class
and type in animals just like that and
then I'm going to create a private field
it's a string and it's going to be
called name and I'm going to give name a
default value of animal and then I'm
going to create a public string and I'm
gonna call this favorite food is equal
to food so just default values that we
put in here now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to talk about protected I'm
going to create a protected method and
what that means is I'm going to use the
private and the public fields that I
created here to explain what protected
is private means that the only thing
that has access to this information is
the animals class itself that is it and
public means that the whole world has
access to it what protected means is
well I have to explain something else
animals is what is called a superclass
and it's called a superclass because we
expect to make subclasses or copies of
it and then change those copies in one
way or another now if we want those
copies or those subclasses to be able to
access this method that we're creating
here we have to call it a protected
rather than a private or a public method
now remember I said a subclass is a copy
of animals well in copying the animal
class it is possible to override a
method or take and create a method with
exactly the same name however have it do
completely different things if you want
to block a subclass from being able to
do that you put in the final word that's
it that just means that this method that
we are creating here cannot be changed
by any subclasses you're not quite
getting this the code is underneath of
this video and it's heavily commented
but just stick with me here as you see a
couple examples this should make a lot
of sense and there it is it accepts a
new name and then we're going to say
this which is a reference to an object
that was created using the animals class
so this is the object that is being
using the blueprint which is what the
class is just a blueprint for creating
objects and we're going to go and
protect it create another protected
final method and this guy is going to
return a string so we're just going to
say return this name then we're going to
create another method of lick Boyd it
doesn't return anything call it eat
stuff because it probably makes sense
for animal to be able to eat and this
guy is just going to print out the word
YUM followed by fav food it's all it's
going to do then I'm going to create
another one Alec would walk around it's
not going to receive any attributes and
then what this guy is going to do this
is actually going to be a method that
we're going to overwrite it's going to
go this name plus box all around real
simple
then we're going to create a constructor
this is just a generic constructor for
the animals class and then we're going
to create a more complicated one and
Mol's string name string favorite food
and this guy is going to go this change
name name is passed to it and this dot
favorite food is equal to favorite food
and everything's been saved there and
that is the end of the animals class so
now what we're going to do is create a
subclass or a copy of the animal class
and it's going to be called cat and how
you do that is just go same sort of
thing so we're gonna go cats we're going
to go extends animal and that just means
I want to copy all of the methods and
all the fields that are defined in the
animal class and this is referred to as
inheritance why because the cats class
is going to inherit all the methods and
fields defined inside of animal that's
it now what we can do is we can add some
new fields inside of the class named
cats let's say it has a favorite toy
where we want it to so now the cats
class is going to have access to a new
field called favorite toy and animals
does not have access to that then we're
gonna go forward play with create a new
method to play around with our new field
that we just created and just type in
yay favorite toy now I want to override
the walk-around method we jump back over
here you see walk around right here if I
want to override that with the cats
class and I can
override walk-around if I would have had
public final inside of here I wouldn't
have been able to override it like I
have right here with the change name
method but there is no final so that
means I am allowed to override it so I'm
going to go public void walk-around just
make sure if you want to override it
that you do exactly the same sort of
things you define everything exactly the
same way and here we go system out where
you go this get name I call that get
name method and animus a stalks around
instead all walks around not much of a
change but just showing you how to
override those guys and then I'm going
to go public string because it returns a
string and I'm going to return this
favorite toy semicolon create the cat's
constructor method there's a generic one
it doesn't really do anything and then
create a more elaborate one and this one
will get a string from name and a string
for favorite food and then another
string for favorite toy now wouldn't it
be really really great if I could call
the animals constructor right here that
automatically processes the name and the
favorite food for me say it sets for
this new object we're creating the name
and also the favorite food well you can
if you want to call a super class as
constructor file just type in super
that's it and then we're going to pass
it the name and let it figure it out and
that's exactly what we did right there
however favorite toy does not exist in
the animals class so if we want to
define it we have to define it inside of
this constructor file favorite toy is
equal to a red toy and there you are you
just defined everything and create a new
subclass I'm going to jump over in the
Java lesson 14 and play around with
these new classes we create it public
class I'm going to go to public static
void main you've seen this guy at lunch
times args and now I'm going to come in
here and start creating a bunch of
different objects so let's create an
animal object animals generic animal and
you create these objects just in the
same way we've created all our other
objects and there you are I just created
a new animal object of course make sure
these match up now if I want to output
some information to the screen remember
every animal gets generic information
assigned to it
so I can come in here and do a generic
animal call the getname method and then
we can also go generic animal favored
food and if we save that and execute it
see what happens and you can see animal
and food pops up there and the reason
why if we jump back into the animals
class we created here see there's a
default animal food so we're going to
create a cat object called Morris it's
equal to new cat we're going to pass it
the name and favorite food and favorite
toy just make sure this is cats and
that's cats and there you go you just
created a new cat's object now if we
want to execute or print out some
information about Morris very simple get
name so that's going to get me Morris's
name that's going to get me Morris's
favorite food and that's going to get me
Morris's favorite toy throw that in
there so there's a new line dividing us
up you can see Morris tuna rubber Mouse
all print it out on the screen again
very understandable very easy to
understand here now we're going to do
something a little bit more crazy I'm
going to create an animal object named
tabby however I'm going to define it as
a cat no problem because every cat is an
animal so this is totally possible to do
this however not every animal is a cat
you've probably heard that phrase before
if you've heard object-oriented
programming being explained there we are
just created a new animal object named
tabby but it's really a cat well now
what we're going to do is pass this new
animal object named tabby and this is
how you pass an object inside of Java if
I'll save it now I need to come down
here and create accept animal do some
things with it and whenever I'm passing
this in here I have to call it an animal
object because that is what it is then
we're going to play around with this guy
and see what happens first thing we want
to do is we want to print out exactly
what we got here random animal now
because get name is defined inside of
the animal object or animal class I'm
able to get ahold of it and also I'm
able to get ahold of favorite food
execute and you can see that it printed
out tabby and salmon so that everything
is divided up here throw in a couple
newline and now I'm going to explain the
extremely complicated concept of
polymorphism it really is not that
complicated
so you see here that this animal is we
all know it's a cat really because we
defined it up here but does Java know
yes Java does Java knows that even
though this is an animal if a method is
called for example walk around is called
it knows that if this guy overwrote the
walk around method which it did jump
back into animals see walk around says
this object walks around and cats you
see here this whatever its name is
stocks around polymorphism is it says
whenever an object is passed or a method
is called for a specific object Java's
interpreter is smart enough to say okay
is this really an animal yes it is
however is it also a subclass of an
animal yes it is it's a cat well if it
really is a cat is there a walk around
method defined inside of the cat class
if so use that new method instead of
using the animal walk around method and
as you see here it's gonna do just that
and as you can see here tabby stalks
around gets printed out to the screen
because job is smart enough to know that
random animal is really a cat that is
all polymorphism is everybody tries to
make it more complicated than that but
that's really what it is
however the interpreter is not smart
enough to be able to locate methods for
example or fields for example that
didn't exist inside of animal so for
example let's go in here and create
something let's go random animal and
let's say we want to have access to
favorite toy which is a field that
exists inside of this guy see there's
favorite toy that's inside the cats
class however favorite toy does not
exist in the animals class so whenever
we call this and this is going to
trigger an error Java says unresolved
compilation problem favorite toy cannot
be resolved or is not a field job is
kind of smart with the polymorphism up
here where it can find any methods that
both exist in the animals class as well
as the cats class however it cannot on
its own find any fields or any methods
that are defined only in the subclass
think about that for a minute
rewind listen to it again
it'll make sense however if you want to
access fields or methods only found in
the cat class you have to cast the
object to that specific class first and
I'm going to do this as a temporary so
I'm going to go cat temp cat cats that
is and I'm going to cast it just like we
cast everything else so I'm taking the
random animal and I'm telling the
interpreter hey I want to create a new
temp cat and I want to take the random
animal animal class and convert it into
a cat now I can take this guy right up
here print that out but instead we're
going to call the temp cat and if we do
that and execute it it's now going to
work you could say ball gets printed out
onto the screen there's another couple
different ways of doing this stuff
though you could also cast the object
directly so and how you do that
I'll just go system.out.print line and
you can cast it right inside of here
cats like that like that
you can see it printed ball again and
just so you can see this a little bit
better copy that out of there that's
what you need to do you need to put the
whole entire thing inside of these
brackets here and then cast inside of
that so that keeps you from having to do
the temporaries and all these other
different things now if you want to
check if an object is an instance of or
has the ability to access the methods
and fields defined inside of a certain
class you can do that as well so if we
want to go and check your friend Amana
is an instance of or has access to those
things just do it like that print line
is a cat and if this comes back positive
it's going to print out whatever this
animals name is is a cat and you can see
tabby is a cat however it's also going
to work if you type in animals because
guess what not only is tabby a cat but
tabby is also an animal and you can see
there there's a whole bunch of different
things about Java and object-oriented
programming leave any questions or
comments below if I didn't make anything
a hundred percent clear but if you go
download this code it's free and all
that stuff it should be a hundred
percent understandable to you till next
