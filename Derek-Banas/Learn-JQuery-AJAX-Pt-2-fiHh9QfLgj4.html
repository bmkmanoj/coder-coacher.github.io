2 my jQuery and Ajax tutorial here I'm
going to show you exactly how to select
and edit elements using jQuery and Ajax
techniques if you didn't watch part 1
you definitely should watch it because
the finished web page that I'm going to
be talking about in this tutorial is
actually shown in the previous tutorial
so what exactly you learn in this video
how to select elements in your web page
numerous ways how to edit elements in
your web page in numerous ways learn how
to monitor event handlers with jQuery
and JavaScript and a bunch more I'll hit
you with a bit of code and then I'll
describe it here I'm defining beginning
of my HTML page in the last line I'm
pulling the latest jQuery library
directly from the jQuery home page now I
can use all the functions to find in
that library I could have stored the
library on my server and referenced it
that way also using this sorts attribute
as well here I'm defining some CSS
styles that I'll use in the code below
if you don't know what this is you
should definitely check out my CSS style
HTML tutorial I normally would link to a
style sheet and not embed the code
directly in the HTML but I wanted to
keep all the code in the same place here
I'm assigning all of the event handlers
I'm telling the browser that everything
that lies between script tags is
JavaScript code if you don't know what
this is see my JavaScript scripting
tutorial I then tell the browser with
the second line of code that I want it
to perform all of the actions defined
between the curly braces as soon as the
page loads with the line of code that
begins with document dot get element by
ID I'm saying that I want the node with
the identification name one button which
lies in the current document or current
web page to be assigned an event handler
when someone clicks this element I want
the function name bold the text to be
called the element with the
identification name one button is
located in the HTML code below it is a
form button and you can see it here over
at the bulleted items a second bulleted
item down the other lines of code inside
the curly braces perform the same
actions to other buttons on that page
this is a JavaScript function it's
called when someone clicks the button I
just described it sets the element in
the web page with the ident
vacation name first to have a CSS font
weight equal to bold you can change the
CSS styling of any element on the page
without performing a page reload here
you are seeing the jQuery selector for
the first time
jQuery allows you to easily select
elements in a web page and edit them in
numerous ways the selector by the way
starts with a dollar sign and has an
opening bracket and a closing bracket on
the right here it is surrounding the
letter P and in quotes here I'm using it
to select all the paragraph tags then I
use a prebuilt method of the selector
name size to return the total number of
paragraphs on the webpage I throw those
results into a string and display them
in an alert box the visitor will see
here I demonstrate another way to select
elements I'm stating that I want to make
the div with class named first div
disappear off the screen with the
fade-out function when the button below
is clicked it will do just that the div
tag I'm referencing looks like what you
can see here and the third bolded item
on the lower left this function will
change the text that lies in the
paragraph of the eye of identification
names second this is a lot easier than
straight JavaScript the paragraph tag it
is referencing and changing looks like
the third bolded item you can see here
in the lower left hand side of your
screen this function will look for all
paragraph tags that lie inside of the
div with the class name first div and
insert the text we are the same into
those this function will assign new CSS
styling to the paragraph which is of
class third and that tag you can see
right here in the second bulleted item
on the left the function toggle class
will allow you to change CSS styling
without a page reload here I use the
jQuery selector to choose the last
paragraph on the webpage and change the
font style of it to italic you have just
seen the beginning of the jQuery styling
methods but I think you'd have to admit
it to CSS function is pretty neat
remember when I made the div of class
first div disappear with the fade-out
function well I thought better of it and
I'm using the show function in this
circumstance to bring it back on the
screen here I'm stating that I want the
fourth paragraph element on the web page
to be colored blue and no that wasn't a
typo I meant to type forth the first
element on the webpage has the index of
zero instead of one yes
you also just learned another way to CSS
style elements in jQuery you can also
directly change CSS attributes of an
element by referencing the attribute
name after the attribute named style
here is another way to select an element
in a webpage the selector code makes
reference to an element with the
identification name for the function
slide up will make the element name
fourth seem as if it was swallowed up by
the webpage it disappears slowly with a
slide and the actual element you can see
here in the third bulleted item in the
lower left hand side of your screen this
code will insert a new paragraph element
after the element named fifth the new
element will contain the text another
paragraph in all circumstances and the
rest of the HTML code should be
completely understandable if you know
HTML and CSS here it is by the way right
here for you to look at you can also
check out your think-tank to download
all of this code it's 100% free and free
to use in any way that you would like in
the next tutorial I'm going to show you
even more ways to select and edit
elements but first here is a sample of
what will be covered in the next
tutorial till next time in the next
tutorial I'm going to show you how I
made this page right here I'm going to
show you how we can add a little icon
next to this email make the table a
little bit prettier fix the table title
so it's a little prettier mess with the
fourth paragraph mess with all
paragraphs in this day of right here
highlight the fourth find a paragraph
based off of whether it has an attribute
or not and find the paragraph name third
all in the next tutorial till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
