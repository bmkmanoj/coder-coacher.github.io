all I thought I'd break things up a
little bit and show you how to take the
most tired normal thanksgiving sides
being cranberry sauce and sweet potatoes
and make them the most exciting part of
Thanksgiving I'm going to start off with
the sweet potato casserole first what
you want to do this is going to go over
the top of the sweet potatoes you're
going to take a half a cup of brown
sugar and a fourth of a cup of flour
this is starting to sound strange ina
and then to your blender you want to add
right around three tablespoons of either
or drink or butter put your lid on
course and blend all right you want to
get this consistency so it's almost like
a doughy feel to it that's perfect then
what you want to do is get a half cup of
pecan and it just lightly blend up area
go that's perfect that's exactly what
your name for now I'm going to get into
the rest of the sweet potatoes now I
have a pot boiling and what I want to do
is you want to take all the sweet
potatoes I have five of them they're
just five normal sized pretty big sweet
potatoes I want to throw them in boiling
water I'm going to tell you exactly how
long that takes basically what it what
you're looking for is sweet potatoes to
allow a force to go directly through
them so that they can easily be mashed
and I'm just cutting them up so that
they require perfect so that's five
sweet potato and there's not much else
to the recipe so I'm going to jump right
into how to make the cranberries while
the sweet potatoes are cooking because I
like to get a lot of things done all at
one time all right now I got a cast iron
pan what I'm gonna do is add one chopped
up orange just throw it in there it's a
biggest orange that I could find and I
just chopped it up exactly as you see it
then to that I'm gonna add a cup of
raisins one and a half cups of apple
cider vinegar this is an old-school
recipe meaning that I got it from my
great-grandmother so it just add vinegar
in there but apple cider i think is the
best there you go one and a half cups
and this is going to be pungent this is
really tangy like old-school cooking
here what we what we're doing then this
is on high i want to add 16 ounces are a
pound of cranberries and what's stay
just for the heck of it roughly how many
cups that is there's one
roughly two very yeah I say right around
four and a half cups and cranberries
like set on high no water of course then
we're going to get ourselves a cup of
sugar just dump it on there and then a
half a cup of brown sugar just bump it
in there and then a teaspoon of ground
cinnamon there's one there you go so at
ease Buddhist enema a half a teaspoon of
ground cloves and it actually says salt
and pepper but I'm not putting that in
here so I guess back in the day they
used to put salt and pepper in the
cranberry sauce but I don't feel free to
do it if you want and this is on how you
just let it cook and this is going to
cook for 12 minutes and occasionally
watch it because this is very sticky
okay sweet potatoes done I boil them for
10 minutes might take a little bit
longer than on your oven or like what
you guys tell them into a blender put
the lid on and blend it so I can just
put the fork right through it that's the
consistency with grown four and then
blend it down until it's smooth after
they're all blended down to about this
consistency you know like mashed
potatoes you want to get an entire half
cup of honey and put that inside of
there these are definitely going to be
sweet potatoes just dump that honey down
inside of there then you want to go whip
yourself an egg throw that whole egg
inside of there itself a teaspoon again
cinnamon this is a half teaspoon that's
why I'm putting two of them in there you
get a little bit extra don't worry about
it I never get then itself a half
teaspoon of nutmeg throw that in there
four tablespoons roughly of either
butter or mortar and I didn't answer
that outcome I know roughly what a
tablespoon looks like and to finish that
off a half cup of milk if you have
trouble blending this before it's not
going to be a problem now
ended up shaking it's almost like apples
off now we got just dump it in pan &amp;amp;
dawn go over get yourself a nice glass
bottomed pan jump in everything have
your oven preheated at 350 degrees and
this should taste good right now may it
does they taste like pumpkin pie which
like Justin should or sweet potato by us
just smooth it out and don't forget your
little crumblies that we made very first
off and I'm just gonna take these and
drop them all over this make it real
crunchy they're gonna take this sweet
potato concoction and throw it in your
350 degree oven for 45 minutes then
slide over your cranberries cuz they're
done they cooked for 12 minutes two
minutes on high and then the other 10
minutes on medium you just dump lamentar
is this gonna get cold anyway I don't
like cooking online I don't want to get
soggy I want them to be nice and crunchy
inside of here just mix them on and if
it doesn't look like there's enough nuts
in put some more nuts in this is tangy
tangy cranberry sauce like people gonna
know this is not jellied this really
enhances a meal it's almost like a
flavor enhancer more than anything else
remember oh oh nothing tent whoo
cranberries done stick them in a pan
throw them in the frigerator be ready by
tomorrow and there they are all ready to
go in refrigerator absolutely one of my
favorite things about Thanksgiving
Izzy's cranberries and I've used this
recipe for decades and this is right out
of the oven this is a sweet potato
casserole after cooking on 350 for 45
minutes and it is absolutely amazing
especially this crunchy stuff on top o
the oprah leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
