3 of my tutorial on how to create
wordpress themes from scratch currently
there are three video tutorials on how
to create wordpress themes from scratch
and i provide links to them above and in
this tutorial I'm going to show you how
to completely style this blog page that
we have here on the right side so that
everything looks real nice by the end
this right side will look pretty I
promise you that first thing I'm going
to do is in the upper right hand corner
over here you can see this text which is
the slogan part of the wordpress theme
if you can't see this widget full screen
what what I decided to do was actually
change the font on that and I did it in
exactly the same way i'm using a google
font just like we used before google web
font so i'm going to go in here and i'm
going to copy that link to that font so
that i can use it everywhere jump into
the header dot PHP files and then paste
it in right underneath of where i define
my last google fonts that's the only
change of making their to the header and
I file save that and now i'm going to
jump back into style dot CSS i start
styling everything ok so what we're
going to do here first is just by
looking at what's on the right side of
the screen I'm going to put everything
into position well first thing I'm going
to do is come down to blog slogan since
I just changed that font I have to go
into my CSS code it surrounds this blog
slogan in the upper right hand corner
paste this inside of here and I'm just
going to change the name of the font to
my chroma or however you pronounce that
and then file save it all right if we
reload it you can see that that font
just changed ok but it looks absolutely
ridiculous being left aligned we
definitely want to change that so what
I'm going to do is just come in here and
just go text a line and change it to
text the line right reload and there you
go it looks a lot better now ok so
pretty much everything else there looks
about right and I see no reason to
really change anything else there so
let's just move on we come down here to
the search box also everything looks
pretty good of course we're going to
have to test this on internet explorer
later on to see if that gets messed up
but as it is right now it looks pretty
nice then on top of that the first time
is doing this website for decided they
wanted this swirl inside of here so I'm
going to try to fix that even though
it'll particularly like the way it looks
and it's surrounded by an ID
because there's only one swirl so I'm
just going to position it in here so
that it looks a little bit better i say
i want position it relative to where it
is and i'm going to say that I want to
move it up 50 pixels so I put negative
50 reload and yes indeed that looks
better so that's we're just going to
leave that the way it is also as well
now what we got to do is come in here
and fix this menu system right now it's
just an unordered list well what I do
whenever I'm using or creating a menu
system is I use the same code every
single time so I'm going to say menu
styling foresight it's going to put a
little comment in here so that if
anybody looks at this they know what
they're saying and the code that i use
is right here and just going to copy it
because this is what I do every single
time all the way down here you can get
this code again there's a link
underneath this video back into style
dot CSS and I'm going to paste it all in
there what's great about this is there's
very few things you're going to need to
change basically all I change and the
entire thing is the color for the bars
for the menu system that's it and if we
file save this let me come in here and
reload it and there you can see there is
the menu system or you might not be able
to see it i zoom in here there's a menu
system it's all done and it's working
and it's a word press menu system so you
know it's going to work properly on any
website so that's cool one thing I'm
noticing here though is my search box
just fell down so let's jump over here
search box and let's move it up a little
bit let's say we want to take it of 95
pixels and there you go search box is
fixed so let's get back to this menu
system what did I basically do here well
down in the footer section which from
before it has a gradient y decide use
the same gradient in my menu system so
basically all I had to do was scroll the
whole way down after I copy and paste
that code was I had scrolled the whole
way down here to this background area
and i just copied all of this or this is
for the gradient for the footer and then
i came back and put into this and pasted
that inside that color change and that's
pretty much all i do whenever i'm making
these sites and then i take whatever
color so like here i have this color
defined well if i'm putting in a border
I just copy and paste those color
changes from menu system the menu system
and it hit file save and that's it
pretty much everything else that's
defined inside here actually saw
previously the menu system and WordPress
is an unordered list that's how it's
done well with the code that i'm using
here I don't need to change anything
except for the background colors that's
it so and everything will just snap in
place and work beautifully so now that
the menu system is all fixed up and it's
really that simple CSS code or content
area so the content rapper everything
seems to be fine the content wrapper is
this purple here that surrounds
everything that's on the website so that
looks fine I don't see any reason to
need to change it one thing I do need to
change is the div that surrounds
everything that's in the left sidebar
from the previous tutorials you may
remember we change the name of it from
left sidebar to first sidebar eps the
only changes we need to make there so
that's real nice then with left
container this is the div that surrounds
all of the individual elements in our
left sidebar everything looks fine there
so I'm not going to bother changing
anything we can even zoom in here just
so you can see all the individual things
that are going on inside of their banner
title you can see here on the screen
that this is kind of overlapping for
some goofy reason we're going to do here
is bring it down a little bit so from
the left side I want to take this 27 and
I don't want it to go up quite as much
i'm going to change that to 20 i'll save
you can also see everything else popped
into place well why did it do that the
main reason why is float left i floated
this guy left so everything popped up
here into place and you can also see
that the banner title which is the
little guy that i just edited also looks
real real nice we can zoom back out here
basically what you're going to see is
the left sidebar now looks good the
middle content area looks good except
the right sidebar is not up here where
it should be and we're going to go in
here and we're going to slowly fix that
mainly the reason it's not up in here
snapped into place is because the middle
content isn't floated left another thing
that's a problem you know me zoom in
here again is the fact that flamingo is
underlined and I don't like that I want
this just to be black if they click on
it it's still going to take them to the
content of the article but for styling
reasons I don't want to have that there
so what am I going to do well the div
that surrounds that guy is called
article title so I'm going to go article
title and a close that off and if you
want to get rid of the underline you
just go text decoration none and then
we're
to change the color of the text to black
and you can see now it looks exactly the
way I want it to look and the left
sidebar pretty much looks done it looks
perfect so I don't really have to change
anything there okay what comes up next
is the actual content column well what
this is is it's actual pages inside of
wordpress meaning all of this I'm going
to leave that for the next tutorial
because I want to fix all the different
pages all at one time so we're just
going to skip that for now let's scroll
the whole way down until we get into
middle column these are the divs that
surround all this information that's in
the middle of the screen well looking at
it everything looks to be pretty tight
here the margin right i think i'm going
to take down just a little bit because
the distance between those guys is a
little bit much and in margin left i'm
going to take that down a little bit so
that everything gets in here a little
bit tighter than it currently is set up
for and then another thing that I'm
going to do is I'm going to eliminate
line breaks between these guys but I
still want them to work like block
elements so if you want to create divs
that don't force a line break because
basically this guy has a fixed width of
two hundred sixty pixels so we know that
these divs are always going to line up
properly i'm going to call for display
inline block if you don't quite get what
I'm saying there don't worry about it or
you can leave a question below I'll try
to explain a little bit better just
helps me with overall lay out and pretty
much everything else is looking tight
here except again I don't want these
titles to be underlined I want them to
be black if we scroll down you'll see
middle art title right here if I want to
target the actual links for styling I'm
going to follow that with an A and then
come in here and do the text decoration
none again and color the text black just
like we did before and you can see that
that works now so all that's nice and
tidy and now basically we got to do is
get the right sidebar styling all
looking real nice and here is the right
sidebar right now so we got to move it
up into this area so I'm going to
continue scrolling down here's where the
right sidebar tiling is and again we
change this instead of right sidebar to
second sidebar and you're going to see
that that snaps up inside of there and
there it is and that's pretty much all
the styling we need to do there because
why everything looks good that's why now
with bright container which is going to
be everything that surrounds all the
widgets that are thrown into the right
we're going to make some changes here
for one thing I'm going to make sure
that the font is the same inside of this
guy so let's just copy that jump down
here and then we're going to jump down
after background color and we're going
to throw that font in there just that's
all just a little bit of Tidy you know
make sure everything looks good then on
margin left I'd like to get a little bit
more room inside of their kind of
cramped so I'm just going to copy this
and I'm going to change this the margin
left so that everything lines up a
little bit better and i'm going to
change this to 15 pixels and i'd also
like to add some padding on the left
side of about five pixels again this is
all like sort of looking at what you got
and seeing how you'd like it to change
it I do a lot of twiddling around with
padding and changing of margins and
things like that and it's something just
kind of comes naturally after you make a
couple web pages well then what I want
to do if you see this right here I'm
going to actually move in on it this
looks really nasty I mean it's just not
doesn't look nice so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to change the bullets on
this get rid of them and I'm going to
add some nice styling to this page so
that everything looks a little bit nicer
I also know that I don't need this ebook
thing here because I got rid of that the
last tutorial so that's gone and the
same things going to be true for the
affiliate container because I got rid of
that in the last tutorial so let's get
rid of those two things so now i'm going
to create a brand new set of styling
that's going to work for all of the
widgets well if you want to do that
inside of wordpress you're going to do
the same thing again every single time
you're going to get the name of whatever
the div is that surrounds all of your
widgets which is going to be right
container we define that in the last
tutorial and then you're going to make
specific styling changes to unordered
lists because that's how everything is
set up inside of wordpress in regards to
widgets you're going to make changes to
unordered lists and individual list
items and then we're going to make also
changes to list items that are links so
that they look nicer and then on top of
that we're going to make changes to list
items in general and this is the way
you're always going to do this you're
going to make these three changes it's
again it's whatever div is surrounding
the widgets and then these individual
elements is what I'm going to be making
changes to so let's say I want to put a
border underneath any of these
still items and I want to make it dashed
and I want to have it be kind of like
gray and i also want to put in some
padding on the bottom of three pixels
and some padding on the top and again
this is just preferences that i have i
like putting padding around on stuff and
the margin left yeah that's indented
there i don't like that indentation so i
wanna get rid of it so what do i do i
just go margin left and then i make it a
negative number 30 pixels and then x
decoration my stuff that's for not
reload and you can see it's looking a
lot tighter here only problem is I have
this bulleted item inside of that I
don't want that but everything else is
looking nice and I also don't like the
fact this is underlined and it looks
like a link it's real simple again to
get rid of those underlines just go text
decoration none and then go text
transform think uppercase as a tendency
to look nicer especially whenever you
have unloaded lists like this so i'm
going to change it to uppercase it's
going to automatically make everything
uppercase and then i'm going to change
my color again which is also a kind of a
gray reload it and amp see got rid of
that now things are starting to look a
lot nicer so what do I have left to do
well I want to get rid of those bullets
and a couple other things so let's go
text transform per case put that in
there again if you want to get rid of
bullets just go list style type and
change it to none reload and you can see
there it is it's all laid out it looks
really really nice it looks a lot nicer
than it did before anyway and then
another thing that I like to always add
to this and let's scroll out just you
can see that it looks good there's
everything all laid out real real nice
the way that I wanted it to be laid out
before up that pesky search form jump
down there again let's go in and fix
that in their search box and let's move
it up to say 105 reload it is moved up
and then from let's make the width a
little bit bigger basta all right now
the search feature fits in there real
nice and tight so that's good and let's
move the blog slogan over as well let's
take it 35 and just so you can see it
reload there you go went over just a
little bit I'm just moving things around
left to right up and down all these
different things okay so that looks
perfect and another thing that I like to
do and this is something that we're not
actually going to see on the screen this
time but I all
please do this with all my wordpress
websites and in this situation i'm
actually going to show it right here
using my own website as an example you
can see here when I embedded this image
inside of my post inside of wordpress
see how their spacing around this guy
well you have to actually put that into
WordPress and I'm going to show you how
to do that this is again like copy and
paste code that should always be in CSS
files inside of wordpress and it's real
simple to do are you going to do is go
image and centered and basically what
we're going to do is we're going to
define exactly what happens when
somebody uses different alignments
inside of wordpress so we're going to
define what exactly does it mean for an
image to be aligned in the center or
aligned right inside of wordpress so
that things look the way that we want
them to look I'm gonna copy that alright
so for alignment center I've worked this
out on my own you can always want to
display things as a block format and you
want it to be displayed margin left auto
this is always going to fix up a lot of
problems in margin right auto which is
centered but WordPress messes these
things up sometimes so that's why I come
in here and i always make sure i do it
and i'm going to copy that and i'm going
to jump down here and paste the exact
same thing in for alignment center and
then image a line right what we're going
to do is put some padding inside of this
so I'm going to go padding all around
the whole entire thing of four pixels
and I'm also going to put on margin
around everything so 0 in the top 0 and
right and then two pixels and then 7
pixels on the left for alignment right
because we're going to want that extra
padding on the left side so that's why
we're putting it this way and I'm going
to display this in line so that it just
lies right in there in the right place
and then for align left pretty much
going to do the opposite because it's
going to be on the left side of the
screen leave my padding of four pixels
exactly the same except I want the right
side to be 7 pixels on the right side of
my image and I still want this to be two
pixels however I don't want any padding
on the other side displayed in online
format as well and then it's real simple
to define this as a line right here
because we're just going to say float
right and for left we're going to say
float left and another thing this is
Internet Explorer this is something else
you're always going to have to do is
internet explorer by default always
surrounds all images that link to a page
with a blue border if you want to get
rid of that blue border you go border
style and none just like I promised the
blog is properly set up plus you learned
a couple other little neat tricks these
are definitely if you're going to make
wordpress themes these are definitely
things that are going to come up you're
going to be like oh how do i properly
style images inside of posts and then in
the upcoming parts whenever I make this
whole entire thing work now if we click
on archive here I'm going to fix all of
this actually in the next tutorial I'm
going to fix the archive page across the
entire site leave any questions or
comments below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
