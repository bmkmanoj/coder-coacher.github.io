two of my programming with Python
tutorial and I already got idle up if
you didn't see part one definitely go
check that out first otherwise you're
going to be completely confused remember
from the last tutorial on the right side
you're going to see everything executing
and on the left side is where we're
going to be typing in our code again
we're going to start off here by listing
the location of the interpreter that is
going to interpret all of our Python
code for us this might be different for
you but that is what length the line of
code does and today I'm going to put a
comment in here we're going to
demonstrate all the things you can do
with integers also something else
there's different ways to assign values
to variables what I'm doing here is
creating three variables first one is
called X seconds y&amp;amp;z and I'm going to
assign those the values of one two and
three and you can see here if I print
these guys out
see them over here one two three they
print it right out and if I just to make
this 100 percent clear the value of X
look over here and that's where one
shows up so those are just a couple
things I didn't cover previously and how
you actually create functions and we
talked a lot about functions you just
saw print they're how you define a
function in Python is with the three
letters de f standing for define and I'm
going to create a function it's called
bull e^x boolean example and then inside
of these braces is where you would
receive values or variables that you
want to be able to work with and let's
actually go in here and define two
variables and you want to put a colon
number Python is all about whitespace
and what a boolean is is this a variable
that either has the value of true or
false no other values are allowed and
basically what we're going to do is call
this function down below and how we're
going to do that just by listing the
function name just like we did with
print and input in the previous tutorial
except here we're going to send the one
value a fault
true and the other one is going to be a
false those value is going to be
assigned right here and we print out and
call the function name type for a and
then save this and print it to the
screen you can see class full so it is
of type boolean remember that can either
be true or they are false and B actually
has the vaulted value of false well we
can compare these two guys like for
example let's print to screen a and B
and is an operator what it's going to do
is it's going to print out on the
screen true if both a and B meaning
these variables both have the value of
true which they don't and you can see
that prints out false well if you wanted
to check if these guys but at least one
of them had the value of true you put
the or operator in there and you're
going to see true pop up another thing
you can do is use the not operator and
what it's going to do you know here that
the value of B is false because that's
what we passed to it if you put not in
front of one of these boolean guys it's
actually going to print out on the
screen the absolute opposite of whatever
it is in the future you're going to see
how this sort of stuff's useful but I'm
just sort of like introducing it to you
you by no means have to go crazy and
also another thing we can do is to
create boolean spaced off of comparison
operators this being the greater than
sign now obviously D is going to have
the value of false assigned to it
and it does and I mainly brought this up
to go into the operators here real fast
this is greater than Shore a lot you
guys notice this is less than this is
less than or equal to this is greater
than or equal to and this is not equal
to so those are the different operators
that are available to you but you could
also take these guys up here that I
showed you previously and do comparison
operators like let's say if 2 is greater
than 1 and do another comparison
operator here 3 is less than or equal to
free I like to put brackets on here with
us need it or not and in this case it's
going to print on a true so those are
different ways that you can use boolean
values inside of Python now let's jump
into what are called integers which are
just variable types that do not have
decimal places that's it and we're going
to create ourselves another function
this one's not going to have any
arguments or variables or values passed
to it and let's just get rid of this guy
altogether and because there's nothing
going to be passed to it we'll get rid
of that also and there are a couple
different types of integers that are
available to you first they're just
plain integers and what should I do here
if I don't want anybody to read this put
a hash symbol so it's looked at as a
comment and also there's binary which is
ones and zeros and then you have octal
which is base eight and hexadecimal
which we're not going to go into these
which is base 16 so those are the basic
different types of integers that are
available to you and what I'm going to
do here is assign a value to the
variable named X and let's make it 5 and
then we're going to create another
variable and call it Y and we're going
to give it the value of 2 and what we're
going to do is print out to the screen X
plus y is equal to and you could
actually put the calculation directly
inside here X plus y is equal to 7 5
plus 2
as you can see right there but we could
also go in here if you remember from
last time use print and put the curly
braces in here curly braces again and
use the format function and put the
variables x and y inside of there and
then close that off and you can see here
I was able to pull the X put it in there
take the Y throw it in there and then
also do the calculation directly inside
and then see it makes more sense instead
of X plus y is equal to 7 it would you
would have 5 plus 2 is equal to 7 so
that's just a little bit more
interesting I guess we're gonna copy
these guys going to show you all the
other different operators that are
available to you in regards to integers
and we're just going to change sure you
know what the subtraction symbol does
this is multiplication this is division
this is what is called modulus which
returns the remainder of a division and
this will actually give you X to the
power of Y and let's go make these all
correct
moleculus ^ why
and there is all the different types of
calculations you can perform on integers
right there now if you wanted to
actually see what binary is not sure if
you remember from last time whenever we
use the integer function to turn a
string into an integer but you can also
do similar things for binary just so you
know this it's kind of neat and it will
just perform Ganim using the binary
function let's say we want the binary
function of 4 so that's what I ton boink
binary format and it shows you what a
binary four looks like and you can do
the same thing for hexadecimals and all
of those other different things that are
available but let's say we want to see
prints in this case we're going to look
at X up here let's say we want to create
a float what does a float is just a
variable that has decimal places so
let's point out print out the float
version of variable X up here and you
can see just add the decimal place to it
and there's a whole bunch of other
different functions that are available
to you like the power function just to
keep this short
X Y numerous different functions that
are available to you Z divided by 3 then
you can see there it's doing that
division down here on the screen and if
you ask it what type it is let's just
keep it simple
can see over here class float just means
it has a decimal place a lot of stuff is
sounds really complicated but whenever
it comes down to it it's really not all
that complicated and another thing that
you other different functions and
there's numerous functions I have a
whole bunch of them listed let's say we
want to define the right we actually
wanted to round the value that is in
here we have to define this is a
function again we're passing it this
long don't have it here anymore but it
was multiple decimal places let's say
we're going to just round that to three
decimal places and see inside Python
there's all kinds of things and you can
say it did that for me right there and
if we wanted to use additional math
functions that are available sometimes
we have to import these are imported
functions we just type in import up here
type in math remember no semicolons or
nothing and this provides us access to
another library of tons of different
mathematical functions let's say we want
what's called the ceiling what this is
going to do remember it's 3 3 point 3 3
3 it's going to provide the next number
next largest number so it's going to
round up no matter what is here and then
of course if there is a ceiling there
must be a floor and you're going to see
that there as well the final thing that
I'm going to talk about is whenever you
are defining variables let's create a
new float so I'm creating this really
really long number and then I'm going to
print onto the screen
z now watch over here you will notice
that it chopped it off it chopped off
the end of my 11 now this might be
different on your system because every
computer is different regards to the
accuracy of decimal places well let's
say you needed all of this accuracy you
actually could get it there's a variable
type called decimal
and this is how you would create it
again you'd have to come up to import
and what we're doing is we're going to
pull in another library of functions
that do not come standard and these are
called the decimal functions so we have
Z over here and it's actually if type
decimal it's currently of type string
though because of the quotes that are
there and how you would create a decimal
type decimal dot upper case and no
matter how many decimal places you got
here this is going to maintain the
integrity of the number of decimals and
it can prove it
by looking over here blank say I went
the whole way up to 14 so those are a
whole bunch of things that you can do
mathematically inside of Python and in
the next tutorial I'm going to cover
strings till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
