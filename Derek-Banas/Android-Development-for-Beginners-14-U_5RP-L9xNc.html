my Android development for beginners
tutorial today we're going to completely
finish the weather app on top of that
because of a request I'm going to add
text to speech which is going to speak
out the weather report and on top of
that also add the ability to search for
other cities and states and so forth and
so on so why don't we just jump over and
look at the finished app and here is my
weather app and let's open it up and
there you can see it automatically
figured out when my current latitude and
longitude was and pulled up the current
weather report for me and with a long
press it's gonna read it the current
temperature is 25 current conditions
mostly sunny with a high near 40 west
wind around 9 miles per hour tonight
mostly cloudy with a low around 31
southwest wind 6 to 10 miles per hour
and of course this time we'll be able to
enter in city and States and it's
automatically going to pull up that
weather information ok so now you know
what we're gonna be building in this
tutorial and I'm going to go through
here and it's really not that much
information very first thing though that
I noticed for some odd reason the
National Weather Service flips the highs
and lows depending on if we are
currently at nighttime or daytime so
what I just did just to keep everything
really easy to understand and everything
you see here on the screen is available
in a link underneath the video so you
can see all the blocks all in one place
so what I found out is if indeed it is
not night we're going to have to pull
our lows from the second index and our
highs from the first index and then do
that for all the other ones however if
we scroll down here and if it is indeed
nighttime then we're gonna pull the low
from the first index and the high from
the second index so that's all I did
there
I didn't see any reason to pull all this
stuff out here would take forever so
that is basically what we needed to do
was flip-flop the highs and the lows and
how we were pulling them from the JSON
data which is right here
ok so let's jump back over here and fix
a couple other issues that came about so
as we scroll up inside of our block
section another thing that I noticed
inside of initialized that I needed the
change was let's scroll down through
and let's specifically look right here
now whenever I go to set up the location
sensor and then get latitude and
longitude data what I do here is I say
well if I don't have the latitude data
which is pretty much what this
symbolizes not equal to zero well then I
don't automatically pull the weather
data up on the screen and instead I just
use the default data now what's neat
about this app is you can just open it
up and automatically get your current
latitude and longitude and it provides
you with weather based off that latitude
and longitude however in its current
setup what it's going to do instead is
just pull up whatever the default
settings are which is up here and if you
are not interested in what Pittsburgh
Pennsylvania is weather is well then
that's pretty worthless so what I did
was instead decided to go in here and
change this information right here so
instead of just saying well I'm only
going to go get the weather data if I
have the current latitude I instead want
to say if I don't have the current
latitude data well I want to wait and I
want to keep asking for it until I get
it
so how do we replace this if-then
statement that we have right here to
instead say you know what we're not
going to continue until I have the
current latitude information
let's not that hard what I'm going to do
instead is take this out of here which
is this if-then statement it's still
going to exist because I want to avoid
any potential errors and I also want to
take out this part right here where
we're going to be setting that data and
in its place I'm going to put in a while
loop basically what a while loop is
going to do is it's going to continue to
ask for that information until it gets
it so I just have to put a condition
inside of this I'm going to go over into
math and go and get my little equals
sign right here and drop it in there
then I'm going to come over to this guy
right here
duplicate it grab it pull it over here
drop it right there and I'm going to say
wow it continues to be equal to zero I
am going to continue asking for new
latitude and longitude data which is
exactly what I did there so what I'm
saying is okay
is the latitude value equal to zero well
if it is I want to ask the sensor for
that latitude and longitude information
then this is going to continue asking
over and over and over again until the
latitude value has an actual latitude
value okay so now I know whenever the
app stores up as you saw previously it
will have latitude data but I'm going to
keep this if-then statement inside of
here just to verify that because it
doesn't hurt anything okay so that
guarantees when the app opens up as long
as the GPS is open and set for us to be
able to use that it is going to pop up
proper latitude and longitude and
weather information based off the
person's current location so that's
fixed so now what we want to do is fix
the weather data procedure that we have
so let's just cycle down through this
and there you can see get weather data
is right here another thing I want to do
just to verify before I ask for weather
information I want to verify that I have
latitude values because remember one of
the goals of this tutorial is to allow
the person in the search box to say I
want the weather information for Los
Angeles California and pull it up well
before I get the weather data I want to
make sure that I have the latitude
information for said city that they
asked for so I'm just going to wrap this
in an if-then statement just go into
control.if then grab that guy drop it
right there I'm going to pull this out
of here and then take this guy and drop
it in there move this out of the way and
then my condition here is going to be
based off of whether the latitude value
is equal to 0 or not so I'm going to go
into the math section get this guy right
here drop them right there and then I'm
going to go into variables get drop this
right here and then we have to get
latitude value and if your App Inventor
slow it's meant to be slow because we're
doing a lot of things there we're really
pushing App Inventor to the limit here
with this application we're making I
want to say not equal to zero and then
take everything we had here and put it
in the then part of it and then we're
going to put an else statement inside of
here as well and that else statement is
going to tell us to get location data so
let's just come down here and grab this
and drop it right there and then we'll
come back to
that later alright so now what we need
to do is figure out exactly how we are
going to get location data and I
mentioned this previously I'm going to
be getting that information from Google
and here are all the component
information we have here in this JSON
data and most specifically what I want
to get is where's location need to
scroll this is the latitude and
longitude data that I want to be able to
get we're just going to be pulling that
in using the URL just like before so
when we just scroll away down here and
start building that guy okay so here we
are now what are we going to need to
build our URL we're going to need a
whole bunch of variables so let's go
over into variables and initialize
global in the very beginning part of
this what I'm going to need is the
beginning of the URL that I'm going to
be pulling the data from so I'm going to
call this location URL beginning and
where am I going to get that from well
this is where I'm going to be pulling it
from right here
so I'm going to come in here grab all
this right up to the point where it has
the city name right there I don't want
that because I'm going to be getting
that from whenever the person types out
information in search box click quote
paste it in there hit enter and then
make sure you know that the HTTP part is
already in there you don't have to type
that in and there we go so that's the
beginning of our URL well then we're
going to have to put in the city name
and if you don't know what I'm talking
about up here they're going to be typing
in the city name and then territory
afterwards so what we're going to do is
we're going to need to grab that city
name and grab that territory or state or
what-have-you and put that information
inside of there so the very next thing
we're going to need is the city name
variable so initialize this drop it
right there and I'm just gonna call this
city name city name and I don't know
what the city name is so I'm just going
to put a default in there for now I'm
not really going to matter and drop it
right there
well then if we go back to our URL we
can see here after the city name that we
have this quote here and this plus so
I'm going to copy that jump back over in
half inventor and create another
variable and the slash global name and
this is just going to be a junk field so
I'm just gonna call this URL separation
doesn't really matter what I call it as
long as I
what it is a real separation and then
inside of that put that and there we go
then the next thing we need to do is put
in the territory name which is going to
be where the person lives create another
one IRRI Tori
and in here I'm going to put PA as a
default again there we go and then let's
jump over inside of here again and see
what else we need well this is PA the
territory and here we're going to grab
this final part of the URL jump back
over inside of here create another final
variable initialize global and then this
guy I'm going to call URL end quote
paste that in there there we go
so now we have the beginnings of the URL
that we're going to be pulling latitude
longitude data from now we're going to
have to store all that information and
JSON data is all going to be stored
inside of a list of lists so we're going
to create another one of these guys and
I am going to call it all location data
and it's a list so we're going to go
into the lifts area right here and
create an empty list and there we go
we are also going to be grabbing the
city and the state from the search box
inside of our app and I want to use that
as a list as well so it's going to be a
list that's going to contain city and
territory or city and state so I just
create another variable call this
location list like I said it's going to
be a list as well so just duplicate this
and create an empty list and then we're
also finally going to need a variable
it's going to contain the city and state
that is going to be pulled from the
search box in our app and then we're
going to dissect that as you're going to
see here in one second I'm just going to
call this location complete and because
we're going to be filling that with
information I'm just going to make it
empty and there we are okay so now that
I got all my variables out of the way
what I need to do is figure out how the
search button is going to work so just
come in here where is our search button
there it is click on search button and
we're going to say when the search
button is clicked well we want to do
certain things and basically what we
want to do is we want to grab
information from the search box which is
going to be the city and state this guy
right here and we want to separate it
into city and States in a list and
and use that with our URL to pull in
latitude and longitude for that specific
area so the very first thing we want to
do is we want to store the city and the
state name inside of this variable right
here so set then we want to go inside of
here to City text box and we want to get
whatever text is currently stored inside
of that guy grab that drop it right
there
then we want to verify that there
actually is city and state information
in there and if they didn't enter any
information we would protect from any
type of errors so we're going to go and
get ourselves an if statement anytime we
want to do one thing under a certain
condition or another thing under another
condition we use if or then and we just
want to verify that's not equal to grab
this guy right here drop it right there
and that came from the logic section
right there again we're going to use
location complete so we're going to say
if location complete which we just set
with that information there is not equal
to and then we're going to have nothing
so if it actually contains information
well then we want to separate the city
from the state come up here and get this
guy and set drop it right there now we
were requiring the user to separate
their City and their territory or state
name with a comma and I'm going to have
error messages pop up if they do not
follow that rule so what I want to do is
split the city and state based off the
column to do that I'm going to go into
text and I'm going to say split at first
over here drop it right there I'm going
to get location complete which is going
to be city and state there's the text
drop it in there and then I'm going to
separate it based off of the comma so
just put a comma in there drop it right
there and there we go so now we have a
list that's going to have city and state
inside of it now what I want to do is
verify that they put in a city and a
state and if they didn't then we're
going to throw up errors and make sure
that they go and fix that so to do that
we got to go into control another
if-then statement and here we want to
verify that the list has a city and
state or that it has at least two values
inside of it so we're going to put that
there and I'm going to say greater than
or equal to like that
and we're going to go length of list
right there and then get our location
list
and verify that it has a city and state
inside of it appear math can get a
number and input to here okay so now
that we know we have a city and state
what we want to do is trim off any
excess spaces and also come inside of
here if we would want to put in another
city with same multiple names inside of
it so if we go
for example Penn well you're going to
have to put in a quote followed by 20
and there we go you saw that I changed
that right there for any spaces and
there you can see I pulled up latitude
and longitude data so what we need to do
is go in here and replace any spaces in
the city or territory or state names
with a % followed by 20 so I'm going to
go and get my city name and a state name
see here there's city name and I'm going
to get set specifically and I'm going to
do the same thing for territory let's
give ourselves a little bit more room I
just put in that I want to be able to
set the city and the territory name and
then I'm going to be messing around with
text again so in this situation I just
want to replace all spaces with a
percent sign followed by 20 come through
here replace all text segment
replacement grab that drag it up here
drop it right there and I also want to
trim any excess white space before the
city name or after the city name so I
can do that is use another text tool
called trim there's trim and that's
exactly what it does so take that throw
that right there all right now remember
the city is in index 1 for our location
list so we can just grab this guy
location list drop it right there and
then we're going to go into the specific
list part and say that we want to select
list item and we want to specify an
index grab this this is our list and the
specific index that we want is 1 so
that's how we'll be able to get our city
name and there we are
alright now let's get back to replacing
our spaces with percent 20 so put a
quote and a space sometimes this doesn't
take inside of App Inventor so if you
have any problems where it's not
converting the spaces into percent 20
this is where you're going to have
do it you're gonna have to go in there
and type the space again only happens
sometimes but just want to make you
aware that sometimes it doesn't take
that space and he considers that a blank
space duplicate this and then replace it
with percent twenty and there we go
and then we're going to have to do the
same thing for our territory or our
state so we may as well just duplicate
this drag it down here and then of
course our state's or territory is going
to go into the second index to get that
information and there we are now
everything's set up now that we're in
this position we're going to be able to
say hey go get our location data and we
might as well stop beating around the
bush and just go and create that
procedure so that we can make everything
else work so we'll do over here two
procedures and we're going to create a
new one and like a set is called get
location data and it is going to use the
complete URL I have up here this will
scroll up here and it's going to store
information in a variable called
complete URL which I have to create here
play euro and it's just going to have
junk information in it right now in the
beginning and then we're going to set it
over inside of this procedure
now of course URL that we're going to be
using to grab the latitude and longitude
information is going to require multiple
lines so that means we got to go into
text we're going to get ourselves a join
and we're going to need five parts to
create our URL so for our join we're
going to grab some extra spaces drop it
in there now we need to go and grab our
URL data so we're gonna get location
right here and we're gonna get dragged
that there city name get that as well
URL separation territory name and then
just grab it and drag it over here then
the final part is URL end and there we
go
we have the beginning of our URL the
city name the separator the territory
and the end of the URL now that we have
created that what we need to do is go
and get our web component and call for
that information
now it's very important to have more
than one web component if you're going
to be pulling data from multiple sources
so I have web component 1 for pulling
weather data and web 2 for pulling
latitude and longitude and of course
here we're going to have to define our
URL that we just put here so set your L
drag it drop it right there and there it
is and then this is the URL that we're
going to be using with it and then after
we have that set we're going to go in
here again and say hey go get that
information and I like to log this
information as well so I'm going to use
a notifier here and I'm just going to
say log info and this is just going to
log in on the Android device and I do
this for testing purposes but you should
also do this if you want to error check
anything and I'm going to need to do a
join so let's go up here and get text
join and whenever I'm putting any type
of information inside of a logs for
error checking I like to use capital
letters so things stand out so I'm going
to put location URL like that uppercase
letters and then if we have any type of
error I'll be able to quickly go in here
and figure out exactly where it is and
then I'm just going to get the complete
URL we'll be calling from and I do this
because the way that these URLs are
structured could change anything could
happen so that's the reason why I got
that inside of there all right so get
location data is all fixed up so why
don't we go back up to our search box
here and finish that guy up and there it
is there's our search button so let's
get this guy move him out of the way and
get the get location data and move it
out of the way so that we have room and
now inside of this right after I get my
city name and my territory name I'm
going to be able to call that get
location data and I'm going to drop it
right there and now what I want to do is
verify that I have latitude and
longitude and they're not zeros and if
they are not then I want to get the
weather data after I get this so again
that means that I need to go and get
myself an if/then statement drag this
drop it right there math section will
check for not equal to zero and go and
get latitude value again I'm just doing
this to hold up any errors that might
come look for latitude value
specifically here and there it is I want
to verify that it's not equal to zero
and there we go
and then if it's not equal to zero I
want to call for the weather information
to update get weather data and drop it
right there
and now just to provide some dialog
boxes if certain errors occur if the
length of my list is not greater than or
equal to two well then I want to handle
that so I'm going to come in here and
going to put an else statement inside of
this else and I'm also going to want to
put an else statement here if there is
nothing inside of there for city and
state and they click on the search
button there that is now I prefer to use
dialog boxes instead of alerts because
alerts are kind of hard to read but just
to mix things up here of course you can
come in here and change this on your own
I'm also going to go into notifier and
go to show alert drop one of those right
there and then put another alert right
here here I can say enter city followed
by state provenance territory etc
whatever that'll be a little error
message it pops up and then down here
because I require them to use commas to
separate them enter city and territory
separated by a comma and there we got we
handled all those errors now remember we
had another guy hanging out up here that
was waiting for the ability to call get
location data when we're not done with
get location data yet and that was get
weather data which we just called and
there that is this is get weather data I
guess I should screw up a little bit
more there we go
weather data over two procedures get
location data and drop it right there
and what I'm saying here again is if the
latitude value is not equal to zero then
I'm going to build this URL otherwise
I'm going to call get location data so
that I can get that latitude information
ok back down to the bottom and the only
other things I have to handle here are
text-to-speech and actually getting my
information that JSON data for latitude
and longitude now how I'm going to do
that is here I am making a request over
here to get our JSON data and here is
URL that I'm supplying now after it gets
it it's going to return it just as we
saw in the last part of the tutorial so
we're going to have to catch that new
information so to do so we're going to
go into web - this guy right here the
guy that's getting our information and
specifically go to got text which is our
JSON data and we just need to verify a
couple things which means if then
statements again drag that drop it right
there first thing we want to do is
verify that our response code is equal
to 200 which means that our information
got passed
Actos properly so go back into math drag
this down here and verify that the
response code this guy get response code
is equal to 200 which means we got our
information that we wanted to placate
this drug down there put 200 inside of
there and there we go and if we did get
that information then we want to set all
location data and store all of the
information from that webpage into our
variable called all location data just
come up here all location data this guy
right here set get it drop it right
there then to pull our JSON data we're
going to go into web 2 again JSON text
to code up this right here and then
response content is going to have all of
that data so then just go to response
content and drop that right there okay
so now that we have all that data we
need to figure out how it is sorted so
what we're going to need to do is store
the latitude and longitude value and
variables we already have those
variables so let's just go sets get two
sets and drop them inside of here
actually it's just get one for now and
specifically we're going to have
latitude value inside of this so let's
go find that there's latitude value
they're going to have a bunch of select
list items so let's go and take a look
at that raw data that we get from Google
okay so this is the raw data that we get
from Google and basically just like
before we need to cycle through this and
find the information we need okay so as
we look at this there are two big pieces
of information results which is
ultimately going to contain our latitude
and longitude data and let's scroll down
here there's another one called status
okay well that means and they're
separated with comments that's how
everything is set up inside of this JSON
all right so that means whatever we're
pulling in our latitude and longitude
data we're going to want to get results
and not status so there's two possible
things we can grab first results or
status so I'm going to grab results so
that means I'm going to put down a big
number one right there then what I want
to do is I want to get address
components but I do not want to get
results so that is an option of either
one or two address components and all
this other data inside of here
everything structured as a list inside
of a list so to get that I am going to
need a to not results but all of this
data right here okay did this to the
last part of the tutorial then I want to
specifically jump inside of this block
being the first component which means
that that is going to be a number one so
that is going to give me all my list
items inside of here
then I specifically out of all these
different guys address components is
actually there's actually four items in
this list first one's going to be
address components and you can see where
address components end by looking for
this bracket right here followed by a
comma so the first one is going to be
address components which I have no
interest in at all
then if we cycle through here and look
for a closing bracket and a comma you
could see one right here there is the
end of address components so the next
item in our list is formatted address so
there's currently two list items inside
of here
so what we want is geometry if you can
see here there's a comma there's all
this information and there's another
comma so that's the end of formatted
address which means we want the third
item in the list which is geometry so
there is three and this is us working
towards getting our latitude and
longitude information now do I want the
word geometry or do I want bounds which
is going to contain my location data
this is where I want to get to
ultimately no I want bounds so that
means I want the second item in our list
here then we can see bounds because this
curly bracket is going to end down here
and I want location this guy right here
which is the most specific latitude and
longitude so I want the second item in
our list so that's going to get me down
into location now do I want the word
location or do I want the latitude and
longitude
I want the latitude and longitude so
there is another second drilling down
into the data
I then want latitude and longitude data
which is going to be a number one and
then more specifically I want this guy
right here which means that I that is
new
be the second option so that is how we
work through here I did this previously
with a little bit less complicated json
data hopefully you're getting it if you
didn't watch the previous part of the
tutorial it's something that once you
get it you get it forever but there is a
little bit of a learning curve to figure
out how to cycle through all these
things you're basically just looking for
changing brackets and commas to decide
how this information is stored so now
that we have all these numbers I'm going
to jump back over into the block section
and grab latitude and longitude okay so
here we are and all I'm going to do is I
wrote all those numbers down on a piece
of paper so I'm going to select those
different list items inside of here that
means I need to go into lists select
list item list and then I'm going to put
a whole bunch of indexes inside of here
let me tell you there are a bunch of
them so I'm going to need a total of
nine of these guys so just duplicate
them duplicate duplicate that to make
six duplicate this to make nine okay so
that's going to allow us to cycle
through all that JSON data then the
final thing is going to be all location
data which is stored inside of here way
down inside of here so that's pretty
much the whole entire document so I'll
go into variables get up that right
there and then this is going to be all
location data and there we go then I
just have to put all these numbers
inside of here so to grab all of the
data we're going to put index one inside
of here there we go and then I'm just
going to put in all those numbers that I
was writing previously this is the
second one I don't want the word result
I want the actual data that was stored
inside of it there's list items of which
latitude and longitude were just part
then the third which is geometry this is
going to be the bounds part who need
another to scroll over here so we can
see a little bit better and then that's
a one okay so I have all that I'll be
able to get my latitude information and
now I just need to get my longitude
information so what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to copy this because
they're right next to each other so I
just have to only change one index to
get the right information so I'm going
to duplicate that drop it right there
and then change this from latitude to
longitude
there's longitude value there you go and
then the only thing I need to do is
change this from a1 to a2 that's going
to get any longitude instead of latitude
there we go
so got all that all set up the only
other
left to do here is to set up a note of
fire if there was some type of error
that occurred whenever we are pulling
all this information inside so I'm just
going to come up here and put it in our
statement I like that so I go down here
put in a note of fire and let's just do
a show alert again and let's just say
error occurred retrieving data and there
we go and the only other thing left to
do is to handle text-to-speech so it
reads out our weather report to us so
everything's pretty much hands-free this
is extremely easy to do what I'm going
to do is just go with the search button
and say that if they use a long press
right like this drag this right here
that I want to use text-to-speech so
I've texted speech here somewhere there
it is and just go to speak and of course
I'm going to need a join because I'm
going to be saying more than one thing
go up into text get a join drag it drop
it right here and then I could start it
off by saying the current temperature is
put a space otherwise it could get
confused up that right there and let's
say that we need six of these join areas
for us to put our information inside of
grab a couple more of these then we have
to actually get our information so the
very first thing we want to do is get
our current temperature it's over here
current temple able and there's that I
get here drop it right there put in
current conditions over here look for
current weather report label get the
text from that and then let's say that I
want to also say whatever the weather is
going to be for the next time period
just like through here I want to say
whatever that is which is either going
to be tonight or this afternoon or
whatever it's going to be it's going to
be a next weather period label drop that
right there and then let's say that we
want the description next weather period
description label and just that easy you
just added the ability to do hands-free
weather reporting so there we are that
is the weather app it's done it's
finished hope you guys enjoyed this hope
somebody out there actually watched all
these videos please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
