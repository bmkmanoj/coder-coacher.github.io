17 of my android development for
beginners tutorial today we're gonna do
something pretty cool we're gonna create
ourselves a secret chat app that's gonna
allow applications on completely
different devices to share data using
App Inventor
so over the course of making this video
and this application I'm gonna answer a
ton of questions that I get all of the
time so it should be fun so let's take a
look at what the finished app is gonna
look like okay so here is my incognito
app and I'm just gonna open it off and
basically you can just give yourself any
type of identity just so that you'll be
able to find yourself in the messages as
well as the people you're talking then
you'll be able to come up here and type
in any type of message that you would
like to send and it's gonna be going up
into a server where other people will be
able to fetch these messages from so I
just said how are you and I clicked on
send and then you'll see right there a
little message sent box pops up then
anybody that also has this application
everybody who has the application can
communicate and you'll be able to just
click on get messages and here I'm
demonstrating again and you'll be able
to just click messages and pop up and
see all the messages that are left on a
server so it's kind of a nice app Here I
am I'm just gonna put in a different
name and then leave a completely
different message just so you can see on
a completely different device that this
is going to work and people are gonna be
able to communicate and as you can see
here or Sally's typing in I'm great and
then clicks on sand and then message
sent and then you can come on here and
take a look at all of the messages and
you'll see that there you go there's
Sally talking
I also added the feature that's going to
allow you to clear all of the data and
of course you're gonna see all this in
the tutorial and of course if you go to
this website right here which I'll
provide a link in the description to it
you're gonna be able to come down here
and click on get value and whenever you
click on get value you're gonna be able
to pop over into another screen and
there we're gonna have sort of like a
secret phrase that you have to know to
be able to get the values and click on
get value and you can get all the
messages so let's go ahead and take a
look at how to make this app
okay so you saw the finished application
and it's pretty simplistic I want to
keep it simplistic though just so it's
very easy to understand so you'll be
able to use everything you see in this
tutorial in your own applications so
basically what we got here was we're
gonna use something called the tiny web
DB service and this is free you can use
the service it's provided by Google or
if you would like you can also create
your own custom tiny web DB service and
here is how to do that I'm just gonna
put the link to this in the description
under the video but basically what it
allows you to do is both store values
and then get values from a web service
on the Internet and that's gonna allow
you to share information between
applications on different devices so
pretty simple so to save some time I
went and created this interface and it's
just as really really simple interface
all you have here is a horizontal
arrangement it's gonna contain my
message text box which is where I'm
gonna type in my message right here then
we're gonna have a send button then
we're gonna have the message label right
here this is gonna be a label that's
gonna hold all of our messages just like
you saw whenever I showed you how the
app works this is gonna get our messages
this is going to allow us to give an
identity and this is gonna allow us to
clear all the messages okay
now i didn't actually create this app
ahead of time i decided to just do it
over here in the block section cuz it's
kind of fun for me to do that
alright so let's just come in here and
we have to think about what we're gonna
use so we got our tiny web DB over here
and the very first thing to get out of
the way is what are we gonna do whenever
an error occurs well you can see right
here that this is going to allow us to
catch any service errors that would
occur and then decide on how we want to
handle them now I'm thinking what would
be a good way to handle them yeah
probably just come over here to this
list message label that we have and just
print any errors inside of there because
that's where the user is gonna want to
look anyway so we're just gonna come in
here and we're gonna grab set text and
there we got it and then the message
that was going to be sent if there is an
error and we're gonna throw it there and
it's going to be displayed in or out
I think for the most part that's good
enough so that's gonna handle any errors
that it could occur and we gotta think
about what are we gonna need to need
here well we're going to be passing a
series of messages back and forth
between applications so I think if we go
in here and create a variable that's
gonna make a lot of sense and since it's
going to be a whole bunch of different
messages I'm just gonna call it message
list and there we go and then I'm going
to have it be a list we're gonna be
storing a list on this web service so I
want to create an empty list and then
let's think about what else we're gonna
want to do well we're gonna want to send
messages so that's something that we
would want to handle and there we have
our send message button and whenever it
is going to be clicked on we're gonna
want to do certain things and I'm just
thinking this out like I said this is
not pre-planned I'm just sort of working
this out as I go now we got to think
about some things well let's say that we
want to always guarantee that there is
an identity of course that identity is
whatever the person types in but
nonetheless let's say that we want to
have an identity just so we can track
who is speaking in our message box sooo
how are we gonna handle that well sounds
like an if-then-else statement we're
gonna need let's just drop that right
there
and let's think about where is our
identity gonna be put there is our
identity text box right there
and what we're gonna want to get here
from the identity text box is whatever
text has been entered inside of it so
let's go and get this and drop it here
and then basically what we want to do is
decide if this is empty we were not
going to allow the person to send the
message so how are we gonna do that well
we can come up here to our text area
click on that and then get to is empty
let's drop that inside of there and
let's put this here however let's say
that we want to check if it is not empty
so basically we want to do things if it
is not empty how do we handle that well
we're just gonna come in here sounds
like a logic issue to me and there's a
not so guess what that's gonna work
really good and this is going to allow
us to continue if they have entered an
identity inside of there now we got to
think about what exactly are we going to
want to do well I think we're gonna want
to add all of our messages to our
message list so we're gonna come in here
and we're gonna click on lists and we're
gonna say add items to list and drop
that right there
and the list we're gonna want to be
adding to of course is our message list
so let's just get that and drop that
right there and then what are we going
to want to add well we're gonna want to
add an identity have some sort of
separation between that and the message
that's going to be sent so we're going
to need to get ourselves a join right
here with the text and drag this over
here drop it right there and let's say
that we also want to have a new line
after the message so each message takes
up just one line so that means we're
gonna have to have for these guys okay
so what are we gonna have here we're
gonna get the identity which we already
checked and we know is there grab that
drop it right here then we're gonna want
some sort of separation let's just say
that I want a colon so let's come in
here and put a space and of course a
quote there we go and there we go
all right so now we're gonna have that
inside of there or that colon and then
let's also think about where we're gonna
get our message well over here with the
my message text box that's going to
contain the message that they want to
send and let's go and get the text from
it and there it is and then like I said
if I want to put all the information on
separate lines I'm gonna put a backslash
and and that's gonna give me that okay
so now I just added the new identity and
message to our list that we're going to
be storing so let's just go in and store
it so how do you do that that's actually
pretty easy just go over to the tiny web
DB and we're just going to get store
value drop that right there and then we
have to give it a tag everything is a
key value pair this is the key this is
the value even whenever you're storing
lists so let's say I want to give it
something I'm gonna call this app
incognito so let's call it in Cognito
message list there we go drop that right
there
and then we just have to pass along our
message so pretty easy duplicate this
drag this drop it right there and there
we are and then let's say that we want
to call our notifier and then
you know showing alert that the message
has been sent message sent there we go
and what else could we want to do maybe
we could want to clear our message box I
mean so that when every time they want
to type in a new message this area is
going to be clear so we're gonna go in
here to my message text box right there
and we're gonna go to the text area and
we're gonna clear that so let's go sets
drop this right there and just put in a
blank nothing space trying to think of
anything else well I want to handle if
they did not put an identity in here so
I'm gonna need to put it else inside of
here
and I'm just going to again call the
notifier here and I'm gonna show an
alert drop that right there and we can
say something like enter an identity
there we are
so that'll just be pop up there if they
didn't enter an identity and of course
no this is gonna happen if they didn't
and as far as I can see that's gonna be
all I'm gonna need to do so the next
thing we need to do is we need to
retrieve messages how are we gonna do
that well we're just gonna wait until
they click on the button
so let's come up here and go to the
click area drop it right here let's drop
it over here so I'm get away from this
and then we're gonna have to go to the
tiny web DB and to get values we just
call get value so it's not that hard
drop that right there and then to get
our message we just have to pass the tag
and that's gonna get it so it's pretty
easy and let's go and get myself a
little bit more room here think about
some other different things and that's
that's literally all I'm gonna do they
click on this and it's gonna go get the
value pretty simple so what else would I
need to do well the way this works is it
asks for the value and then you have to
call another method called got value to
actually get it there's gonna be some
things we need to check so just come up
here to got value right here and let's
drop that right there and let's think
about some things that we're gonna need
well I'm gonna want to cycle through all
of the messages so that means I'm going
to need an index that's just gonna be a
value that's just going to be
incremented and let's just grab this
track down here and let's drop it right
here and I'm just gonna call this index
and the very first value is gonna be the
number 1 because that is where we're
gonna start in our list so put a 1 in
there and then as I'm cycling through
this I'm also probably gonna want to
store the messages in a temporary value
and then after that has been done then
I'm going to want to add them all at one
time so I'm going to create another
variable yeah let's grab this and let's
say I'm just gonna call this messages ok
and let's just give it a value of
nothing here in the beginning and there
we go all right back to God value so
what are some things I'm gonna need to
do well one thing that I'm probably
gonna want to do is I want to check that
the value that has been returned is a
list so that means I'm gonna need
if-then-else let's grab this drop it
right there and if I want to check if
what they return to me is a list let's
just come in here and let's look for is
a list this is the way it works whenever
I do things out of my head is a list
thing yep that's what I want drop it
right here all right and then to check
for it this is the value that's returned
I'm just gonna put that there then if it
is a list what am I gonna want to do
well I want to make sure that my index
is set for 1 so I'm gonna get that drop
that right there and it's just duplicate
this and there we go
what other things am I gonna want to do
well I'm gonna also just to make certain
here I'm going to verify that the
messages also have nothing inside of
them and this isn't optimized this is
just me working out of my head so strop
that right there and then what am I
gonna want to do well I'm gonna want to
cycle through all the messages and so
that means I'm going to need a while
loop basically gonna say wow I still
have new messages I want to continue
cycling through them and I could use a
for each but I'm just gonna use while so
they're the wireless drop that right
there and my tests is basically going to
be I'm gonna cycle through and continue
getting these as long as they exist
which basically means I'm going to
continue doing this as long as
the index is less than or equal to the
number of items that are in the list so
let's come up here again and I'm gonna
have to get math and get this guy drop
that right there I'm gonna get my global
index right here get and I'm gonna keep
increasing out as long as it's less than
or equal to the length of my list some
have to go into lists and get length of
list right there
drop that right there in the list I'm
gonna be working with it's gonna be this
guy so let's just duplicate this and
then I have to think about what do I
want to do while I do this well I
basically want to assign to my empty
shell here called messages all the
previous messages as well as all of the
new messages that I'm going to be
getting out of this list right here so
I'm gonna go set and get the messages
drop that right there and then I'm gonna
do a join it's a text join drop that
right there I'm gonna get all of the
previous messages so I'm getting on one
of these get in the beginning of course
it's going to be nothing because that's
what I have right here and then I want
to get the next list item out of our
list that we pulled from the internet so
go back in lists select list item select
list item and I know the index and there
we go then I want to actually get this
list so duplicate whoops leave that one
there and grab this one instead
there's our list and then the index that
I want to use of course is this guy
so get drop it right there and that's
gonna get each of those identities as
well as lists and or messages and store
them all in messages just like you saw
when I demonstrated the app and of all
of these blocks of course are available
in a link in the description all right
so now what do I need to do well I need
to increment index because I just got
the first one so I want to get the next
item in our list so I'm gonna set a
value for index and I'm going to add num
let's duplicate this drag this over here
and I'm going to do some math so go into
the math section and I want to add
increment 1 grab index put it right
there and then a number 1 and that's
going to increment that ok so what else
am I going to need to
if anything well basically after I go
and I get all of the messages I'm going
to want to display them in my my
messages label so list of messages label
I'm gonna say that I want to set the
text for this and make sure you do it
outside of the do loop here or the while
loop and what's gonna go in there is
gonna be messages so I just have to call
messages right here and get messages and
there we go okay so now let's go in here
and let's make our Clear button work
which is gonna clear all of our messages
from the database and everything else
let's come up here go get to click drop
it right there and then what I want to
do is I want to clear my messages list
so I'm gonna go and get my messages list
which is way up here there it is get
that dragged it down there let's see if
it's still there yes there it is well
actually I want to get the set messages
list no big deal there it is here and
then grab it and put it right into place
right there like that and then I want to
completely clear the list so I'm gonna
go up into the list section and go to
create empty list drop that right there
and then I want to make a call to store
value for my tiny web DB there it is
store value drop that right there and
the tag I'm gonna use is the same tag as
I used right here so let's just
duplicate that drop it right there and
then I want to do a get message list
should have kept the one that I created
before there that is get it and then I
want to drag it down here
slap that into place then let's say I
want to call the notifier and put out a
note that all the informations been
cleared drop that there and let's just
say data cleared so I'll put a message
on the screen then I have to think about
if there's any other little housekeeping
things I want to do here I didn't do it
before but I think it would be a good
idea for whenever everything is
initialized to pull information or
messages from the database and I'm also
going to be calling the database a whole
bunch of times so why don't I just
create a procedure for that so let's
just go into procedures and create a
brand new procedure
get out of here throw it right here and
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna call this
get data from web and what its gonna do
is exactly what I have the retrieve
messages button doing right now which is
just this stuff right here so I'm just
going to actually I'm going to pull that
out of there
and then I'm gonna drag it down here put
it here and then in the retrieve
messages button area right here I'm
gonna call that so get data from web so
I'll be able to pull all that from the
little procedure I created that'll be
useful then we can also do is come down
here to screen one and when everything
is initialized right here what I'm gonna
do is I'm also going to call get data
from web and that's going to update the
messages whenever the screen or the
application starts so that'll be useful
and let me think about some other things
here
I'm going to also want to make sure that
I keep all of my messages both the user
that I'm communicating with or the
people that I'm communicating with as
well as my own messages
so one way to do that is to come in here
and store that message list which is
gonna be everybody else before I come in
here and try to add in new messages so
what I want to do here is I think I want
to store everything in the message list
right there so let's go and get the
message list and let's say set message
list drag this and let's put it right
here right after we check that it's a
list all right then what I'm gonna do is
say I want to get this and store it
there so what I'm gonna be storing here
are the messages that are currently on
the message board so that I don't delete
those and let me see is there anything
else I want to try to do I think that I
also want to get data from the web
whenever this is called up here so once
again I'll be adding I'll be sending my
message and I'll be adding on top of
this right here so I want to go and I
want to get data from the web as well so
let's just come in and go over here to
this procedure
and get data from web and we're gonna
throw it in right there so that is
everything and I'm gonna go test it
right now and actually the app that
you're gonna see is going to be what was
at the very beginning this tutorial just
wanted to leave a special note for you
guys that I am giving away a samsung
galaxy note 3 this is currently March
the 25th you have to go to in the

be able to go on my website answer some
questions if you get them all right
you'll get into a live drawing to maybe
win a samsung galaxy note 3 as well as a
