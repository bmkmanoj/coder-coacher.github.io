7 of my java algorithms tutorial today
I'm going to cover the second part of
sorting algorithms inside of Java and
we're going to focus exclusively this
time on the shell sort now the shell
sort is very similar to the insertion
sort which I covered previously and I
provide a link to the insertion sort
tutorial above if you want to check that
out now the only difference is is the
shell sort has a new feature that's
going to improve performance while at
the same time remaining pretty simple to
use and in fact many experts believe one
should always use the shell sort unless
performance needs dictate the need for
the much more complicated quicksort now
on your screen you actually can see the
shell sort working
now while the insertion sort is really
fast if an array is almost sorted
problems can occur if say a small item
is far to the right in an array and the
reason that is is because all items in
that situation would need to shift in
the array to move the small item from
the right to the left now the shell sort
solves this problem by partially sorting
an array before then using the insertion
sort to make sure everything's in order
as you can see here on the screen and by
partially sorting the array this is
going to eliminate the problems that
occur if for example a small value is
far to the right in the array now in
this 50 item array that you have here on
the screen the first items that are
going to be compared to each other are
going to have an interval of 40 we've
now moved on to the interval of 13 what
this interval means is that items that
are 13 spaces apart from each other are
going to be sorted in comparison each
other then as you can see here the
interval between those values that are
going to be sorted is going to shift to
4 spaces apart and then at this point
when interval is equal to 1 we are
actually going to use the insertion sort
to move everything perfectly in order
and as you can see now the items that
are being shifted are just one space
apart and like I said before this
partial sorting is going to dramatically
increase
Mormont's over just the basic insertion
sort so now that we've seen this in a
graphical format let's watch this
process step by step now like I said
before the shell sort partially sorts
the array by sorting elements that are a
certain number of spaces apart and this
number of spaces apart is known as an
interval now in this example you see on
our screen all items are going to be
sorted that are four spaces apart and we
are just simply going to step through
the array compare what is in index zero
to what is in index four and then
compare what's in index 1 to what's in
index five and sort just that small sub
part of our array now the index that is
going to be for the stew the left is
going to be referred to as the inner end
X and then H in this situation is going
to represent our interval or number of
spaces apart and this is also known as
the outer part of our array when using
the shell sort now you can see we're
just simply going to step in here and
exchange values in situations in which a
value in a low index is higher than an
item in a higher index so here we
compare 27 to 57 no reason to make a
change there then we compare items in
index 1 to 5 here we need to make a
change so we are not going to move all
these into place we are just simply
going to put the 34 down here and the 50
up here just like that then we're going
to compare items in index 2 to index 6
and in situations in which higher
indexes have lower values we're going to
switch them just like that and then
proceed to index 3
in comparison 7 switch Ford 8 switch 5
to 9 switch and now after we've
completed this process index is 0 4 &amp;amp; 8
are going to be sorted amongst
themselves and as you can see 27:42
and 57 also indexes 1 5 &amp;amp; 9 are going to
be properly sorted as will items in 2 6
&amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 7 then after this process
completes we're just simply going to use
a regular insertion sort which is going
to be very fast because everything's
already partially sorted so here we're
just going to
up through in situations which we need
to move numbers we're going to store the
lowest value number in a temporary
variable and put it into place just like
that then we'll compare index 0 to 2 and
again move everything in place 2 to 3
again
store 22 and a temporary value and then
move it down into place
comparing indexes 3 to 4 4 to 5 again 5
to 6 store 13 and a temporary value and
then move it into place right like that
and so forth and so on until every
single item is properly sorted so now
that we've looked at the shell sort in a
couple different ways let's start
writing some code and all of the code in
this video as well as all the graphical
things I'm using here are available in a
link underneath the video if you want to
play around that little graphical tool
with the bars and all that stuff so just
simply just going to come in here define
my shell sort object and let's say that
in this situation to keep it simple I'm
just going to have 10 indexes inside of
it and then I'm going to print out a
little bit of information so that we're
going to actually be able to watch the
shell sort actually work here we're
going to call the shell sort I'm going
to create that method here in a second
and then I'm just going to print out the
arrays then down here in my constructor
for my shell sort I'm going to get my
array size passed in which is exactly
what's going on right here 10 indexes
here I'm going to store the array size
create a new int array by passing array
size in there and then I created a
method ahead of time that's going to
generate a random array like I said if
you want to look at this there's code is
available inside the description so
there's all that so now let's actually
get into the shell sort and exactly how
it works okay so just like I talked
about before we're going to have inner
we're going to have outer we're going to
have temp
all the things that you've already st.
then I'm going to start interval off as
one and then I'm going to say a while
interval and that's just the spaces
between the different indexes that we're
going to be comparing I'm going to make
sure that it's less than or equal to the
array size divided by 3 then I'm going
to define my interval sequence and these
can be different and very often will
change depending upon the size of the
array to improve performance but this is
a very common interval to start off with
and then I'm going to
say that I want to keep looping as long
as the interval is greater than zero and
this while loop is actually going to
continue to run until this becomes an
insertion sort like I showed before in
the diagrams and then what I'm going to
do is continue incrementing the index
that I labeled previously is outer until
the end of the array is reached and
that's quite simple I just go outer is
equal to interval while outer is less
than array size and here we'll just
increment outer then I'm going to store
the value of the array in temp unless it
has to be copied to a space that was
previously occupied by a bigger number
closer to the beginning of the array and
I'm just going to throw outer inside of
there in that situation I'm also going
to bounce up here real quickly very top
of this class and define my array so we
get rid of those little errors and there
we go
and then here I'm going to put some
information in here so we'll be able to
actually track exactly how the shell
sort is actually working so I'm going to
go the array outer into ten so that we
know that that was stored in a temporary
variable now inner is going to be
assigned the value of the highest index
to check against all values that precede
it and along the way if a number is
greater than temp it will be moved up
inside of our array so just like that
and here I'm going to print out another
message on the screen that's going to
document exactly what's going on it's
going to be checking if the array this
actually does a pretty good job of also
commenting exactly what's going on the
array inner - the interval in index
inner - interval is bigger than two and
there we go then we're going to go while
there is a number bigger than temp move
it further up in the array and we'll do
that by just going while inner is
greater than interval minus one and the
array with the index enter - interval is
greater than or equal to ten
we're going to continue switching these
guys and then once again here I'm going
to say in my while loop and I'm checking
if the array inner - interval again just
the distance between the different
indexes that we're checking in index
in ER - interval is bigger than and here
we're going to compare this to temp
which is exactly what we're going to do
that guy there's just going to help me
print out the screen the array and then
I need to make room for the smaller temp
by moving values in the array up one
space if they're greater than temp the
array enter minus interval there again
I'm just going to print out the screen
what's going on and here I'm going to
subtract interval from inner turnout to
screen some information about what our
array is doing and there will be outer
there's temp and there's interval we're
going to be able to watch this whole
entire thing just totally crank out
numbers and work and then after we get
out of there now that everything has
been moved into place we just need to
put the value stored in temp into the
index above the first value that is
smaller than it we're just going to go
the array inner is equal to temp
pronounced more information on exactly
what's going on here in our screen and
then once we get here we know that we
have intervals sorted our array so we
just decrement interval and do it again
just like we showed in the graph where
it went from 40 to 13 down to 4 down to
1 well that's what we're going to do
we're just going to decrement the spaces
between the indexes that are going to be
compared and to do that we just go
interval is equal to interval minus 1
divided by 3 and now that we have all
that done let's run this guy and watch
it work and as you can see everything
just sorts itself out and if we look
here at the very bottom we can see that
the final array is sorted and I'm not
going to go through this whole entire
thing but you can see here eyes
represents inner Oh Rose ents outer
we're comparing these two no reason to
change and there's all kinds of
information about what's going on and we
compare 24 to 20 because those need to
be changed we move 24 up and then we
move 20 down here and so forth and so on
so there is the Shelf sort looked at in
numerous different ways if you didn't
quite catch anything just go get the
code run the guy and watch everything
fall into place right in front of you in
numerous different ways and you'll get
it please leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
