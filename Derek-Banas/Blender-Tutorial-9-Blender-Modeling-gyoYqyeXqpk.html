9 of my blender video tutorial series
and this part of the tutorial I'm gonna
start showing you how to create more
complicated models with blender and
specifically what I'm gonna try to do
here is model the car from The
Incredibles movie mr. Incredibles car in
the description underneath the video
you'll find a whole bunch of little tips
in regards to things that I use in this
tutorial so that you'll be able to
easily follow along and I'll also
include the file that I have here along
with all the pictures of the Incredibles
car my aversion of it anyway and I have
a lot to do so let's get into it okay so
you can see right here a kind of I
haven't figured out how I want to handle
the materials but this is basically the
car that we're gonna try to model in
this tutorial series this is actually
going to take a couple videos to put
together because I want to take my time
so that I'm sure that you can follow
along ok so here we are inside off
blender and like always everything that
I do with my keys is gonna show up down
here in the bottom left hand corner so
the very first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna get rid of our Cube right here as
you saw X and I deleted it okay so what
I want to do now is I want to bring in
my images this is loosely based off of
the car from The Incredibles because I
couldn't actually find you know a
perfect model of it so what I'm gonna do
here first is bring in my background
images that I drew inside of Inkscape
and I'm gonna bring in my side part the
right side of it and you can see right
here where I have all of my different
images and I'll put these on my web page
if you want to go get them so side there
that is and we can switch over to our
side view by going 3 and 5 and there you
can see it right there and then what I'm
gonna do also is I'm going to make it
show up so I can see it something to
click on front and I'm gonna take the
opacity down to 0.15 alright so there
that is okay no it's add another one add
image and this one is going to be my
front view and once again open and here
is my front and we'll switch over the
front view there that is and
I'm gonna have it be on top I'm
switching it to front so that I can
always see it whenever I'm drawing on
screen as you're gonna see here in a
minute point one five for the opacity
and then I'm gonna hit control one to go
to the back and I'm gonna add the back
part so where is that and it's not gonna
be a lot well obviously I'd showed you
what the what we're shooting for is
gonna say that it's not gonna have the
black around the outside of it but I
already showed you that okay so then
we'll go back and then we'll go open and
then we will go find our image and there
is back and there is the back and we're
just using this loosely it's not gonna
look exactly like this obviously and
front and opacity and point one five
okay so we got all of our different
pieces I'm gonna switch over to my side
view now and what I'm gonna do is block
in the basics of what we have here you
can see this is a pretty complicated
model and this is gonna be extruded out
this is gonna be extruded out the back
bumpers and flares and these little
streamlined things here and tires and
then the bumper is gonna be extruded so
this is a fairly complicated model so
I'm gonna come in and I'm gonna go a at
a mental object mode and I'm gonna go
and create a cube and then I'm going to
want to move this around here a little
bit on the screen and the very first
thing you need to do is to block in all
of the main shapes on all the sides and
then slowly work into more and more
detail so I wouldn't want to do here
first is I want to scale on the y-axis
green is y so scale Y and stretch it out
and I basically want to go up to the
point where I am going to up to the
point where I'm going to start extruding
so I can extrude from that point there
forward and I can extrude the bumper out
forward from there they don't want to
scale on the z-axis so scale Z and then
let's bring this up and I'm going to
extrude the bumper on the bottom
I want to extrude obviously the top also
so let's just put it like that
and let's drag it up here a little bit
and I can go down a little bit more also
so this is stuff by if you know things
you're going to do mainly if you're
practicing so you know the more and more
you draw things like this the more and
more you'll you'll get a feel for you
know what works for you alright so there
we go that is the basics of the car so
what I want to do now is I want to
extrude up the top part of it so now
what I want to do is create some loop
cuts so I'm gonna go tab to jump over
into edit mode
I'm gonna go ctrl + R and I'm gonna have
to create loop cuts that are going to
allow me to extrude up here and then
extrude up here so you can ou know if
you can see this view at full screen if
you can't but basically I'm going to
move this around until I can get myself
a little purple bar to show up there as
you can see right there and I want two
of them so I'm gonna move with my middle
mouse button up a little bit and then
I'm gonna left click now I'm going to
move I'm just moving the mouse over
without holding any buttons for that guy
right there I'm gonna hit a and then
this down here remember this guy down
here he can cause you a immense amount
of problems so I'm gonna say that I want
to I'm gonna be turning this on and off
whenever it's off its going to select
what is behind it any vertices and
whenever it is on whenever it's dark is
not going to select what's behind it
okay so that can cause you a lot of
problems if you're having trouble
modeling complicated things it's gonna
be because you're not properly clicking
on the right selection tools down here
so I want this guy right here and I want
to move it in place so I have the
vertices select on
I'm gonna go B and I'm gonna get this
guy and then I'm gonna drag it into
place which is going to be right about
there
alright so we got all those selected I'm
gonna hit hey it's always better to just
every time you do anything just click on
it so we're gonna go in here and then
I'm gonna extrude this up now I want to
extrude the face so I'm going to do face
select this down here this is what
vertices select edge select face like
okay so face select I'm gonna right
click got it and then I'm going to hit
extrude and then I'm gonna hit enter now
I'm gonna go back I'm gonna hit 3 and
then I'm gonna move this into position
just by moved drag
this up alright and that is going to get
me the basics of outline that I'm
looking for here with my car alright so
once again a that's in position so
everything looks good there
now what I want to do is I want to add a
series of loop cuts that is going to
model the outside of the car going to
completely ignore everything except the
outsides so I'm gonna go in once again
we're in edit mode and I'm gonna go
control and are now how many different
loop cuts am I gonna need for this top
part I'm gonna need two so let's just
come in here and let's go and create
those two loop cuts so we got this right
here and I'm gonna go like that and
create both of them so not and actually
I'll any one loop cut right yeah okay so
any one loop cuts I'm gonna move back to
this left click drag it into place and
like I said I'm using the image
underneath just as a guide I'm gonna put
it like right there okay hey get rid of
that now I'm gonna go and drag these
into position I don't want that one
today I'm gonna go into vertices select
and you know what else I'm gonna do
before I do any of that other stuff I'm
gonna go one go into the front part then
I'm gonna select all and then I'm gonna
scale this guy so that it is the right
width and I'm gonna mirror it so I am
going to go you can see this is red
which means the X plane or the x-axis is
what we're gonna work with so I'm going
to go s and then I want to go X and now
I can scale this out so let's bring it
out here to that position that looks
pretty good let's drag it out to roughly
the size of our car and we're just using
this as a guide then I'm gonna left
click and then I'm gonna hit a to
deselect all that then I'm gonna make
sure that this guy down here is shut off
I'm gonna come in I go B select this and
then I'm gonna go X and I'm gonna delete
all those vertices so now I have half
the car and now what I'm gonna do is
mirror everything else over here so I'm
gonna select all and when I come over
here to the modifier add modifier I'm
gonna come down here where it has mirror
and I'm gonna mirror it so now
everything I do on the right side is
gonna happen on the left side as long as
I have X here and merge here and I'm
also gonna clip on clipping and that
just means if these two meet in the
center that they're basically going to
merge with each other for the most part
that's a good
all right so I got all these different
things I could see here remember I want
to mold the outside lines of my car
before I do anything else so I have a
loop cut here Luca Terra that's gonna
allow me to do that properly
I need another loop cut so that I can do
this properly and I'm gonna put another
loop cut there alright so what we got as
we have this selected there you go shut
that off with a control R and I'm going
to need a loop cut here and then I'm
going to put another loop cut down there
so up here I basically just need one
loop cut so I'm gonna left click drag it
down and put it right in the middle of
that guy go hey deselect that and
control are once again come over here to
the side and let's just drag this right
up around that area and then a to
deselect I'm gonna go in and be remember
make sure this dumb thing shut off
otherwise you're gonna have problems
because I want to change everything drag
this into position and that's good a and
then I'm gonna go and drag the other
ones into positions of B grab this guy
and there we go we're molding the
outside of our car a again B and let's
go and get this again and there we are
so now our car the front of our car is
all molded out that's good eh
and I'm gonna go into three and then I'm
gonna do the same for these guys so let
me go B like this and drag it into
position and that looks pretty good this
doesn't look good
eh remember you're just hitting a and B
over and over and over again
let's drag this into position so that
that's flat in front and that's good
a and then we're gonna do this again
drag it into position and then I'm going
to deselect get just the bottom urticae
drag that into position and I'm just
gonna ignore the fact that that dips in
here doesn't matter this is my design I
can do what I want with it so if it
makes it a little bit easier I'm gonna
do it that way and then we'll do and
shape that and I'm not going to do
anything with this I'm probably gonna
decide to merge this upwards like this
instead of doing it the other way or
maybe I can move it down what do I want
to do I'm gonna leave it the way that it
is alright so we got that basic mold
right there let's deselect let's jump to
the back I'm gonna go control I to do
that and now
I need to go and mold this a little
better do I actually I think that's fine
the back whenever I drew it in and my
vector art tool it was kind of like do I
like it or not so I'm just gonna keep it
the way that it is all right so let's
jump back to the side start doing more
complicated things all right so what do
I want to do well I'm probably gonna
come in here man let's select this and
let's have this go downwards and then
inwards like that yeah that looks about
right
okay so that's going to be on an angle
and then what I'm going to do is extrude
the bumper out from that point so I'm
gonna go like that yeah that's fine I
think that looks about straight that's
good enough all right so now what I want
to do is I want to extrude out this
bumper and it's not what I want to do I
think that's what looks good to me
so let's go let's drag this out here a
little bit let's do a face select grab
it like that and II to extrude and then
enter and then go back into three and
let's bring this out and I'm thinking
that I'm probably gonna maybe go like
this no no a lot of this stuff is just
by eye and just what looks good to you
let's go and extrude it out that far I'm
gonna deselect everything jump back over
into vertices mode and go B and let's
select this part right here and then
let's move this up into position and
that looks fine
okay and then I can extrude out from
that okay so a once again face select if
this e enter back into three and then
I'm going to bring this out again some
more go right to that point right there
a to deselect B grab this guy
whoops jump back over in diversity mode
oh and you can also hit ctrl tab to jump
in but for some reason I don't know it
just doesn't feel right that's that's
the reason why sake I have a tendency to
do this do dumb things when I do that I
don't know it's just some malfunction in
my brain but you see how I've went and
put the 3d cursor there I don't want it
there I want it in the center so I'm
just gonna go shift F and cursor to
Center put it back in position so
anytime you make that error like I just
made that's how you fix it all right so
be let's get this and let's drag it over
here
that into position and then I want to
extrude out a little bit more with this
or do I want it to just be I just wanted
to go and curve like that I don't know I
haven't really decided if it looks
better doing that with that rough angle
yeah it probably does look better if I
do it the other way don't it all right
so let's get back to three and let's
drag it back into position so there's
that curved edge there and then let's
just do a whole entire face select so
I'm gonna get a face select get that
extrude lift it uh and then go back
three to the side view and I'm gonna go
out like that you know what I'm gonna
undo that get rid of that extrude that I
just did the extrude is gone and then
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to do a
loop cut here that's gonna go right
there and it's gonna match up with this
and then I'm gonna bend it on that angle
so I know I need to put these little
bars inside of here so let's just do
that now so I'm gonna go ctrl + R and
I'm going to need to have one two three
I'm gonna need at least three of them
for right now so let's just do that
again I'm moving up with my middle mouse
button dragging around okay okay so I
got that and let's put this inside of
here I'm gonna show you a neat trick to
get rid of this curve right here so
let's just deselect everything and I'm
gonna go control holding down the ctrl
key and right clicking on this and then
to make it into a straight line I'm
gonna go s Z and 0 and see how it went
straight and I'm gonna hit Enter okay so
now I have a straight line there instead
of the bend that we had and then I'm
gonna bring this down here approximately
right there and then I'm gonna you know
sort of blocking that those streamlined
little things I don't know that much
about cars whatever they're called you
can tell me in a comment section but the
part that sort of extrudes out on the
side that's what I'm gonna do with that
okay so we got that know what I'm going
to do is unselect this and then I'm
gonna go and do a face select here and
right click on that and we can do an
extrude and enter and three and then I'm
gonna bring this out just slightly and
then I'm going to change into virtus
the mood and I'm gonna bend that so
let's go be and grab it and then bring
it out okay
so there that is more like what what the
original design was for for this whole
thing and let's go and grab just the
edge there that guy and bring it in
bring it all the way alright so there we
go we have that part all set up now what
I want to do is come in and do our
windows so I'm gonna do some more loop
cuts someone need one two three four and
five of those so let's just go control
our and you can see that our going in so
two three four five and enter and where
do we want our first one to be of course
we're going to make all of these
straight so I'm going to go alt and
right click on this guy and then to make
it straight I'm going to go s Y and zero
and there it is now it's straight and
then I'm gonna hit enter and then I'm
gonna position it so I'm gonna drag it
over here and drop it in right there and
I'm gonna do the same with this guy
right here so I'm gonna go alt and right
click on that sy and zero straight say
it's exactly the way I want it put it
right here and it's alt and right click
on this that's why zero and enter and
let's drag it and put it here and then
I'm gonna do like in set some things
whenever I am doing the windows sy 0
enter drag it over here and alt right
click and I'm gonna do sy 0 because I
want it to be straight for now and then
I can put it into position let's put it
like right here that's fine and then
deselect everything and then I'm gonna
go and grab these individual little guys
here so once again vertices select is
down here and we come in and grab just
those and move them into position so I
got that one right there into position
and then a deselect B let's grab this
one and move it into position so that
they are nice and straight ok so now I
got my windows all blocked in that's
good so I'm going to I'm actually gonna
grab all of these these two so that I
can use those to help model
my extruded streamline thing that's
gonna come out of there alright so that
looks pretty good
hey daddy select once again and you can
continue on from this point onward here
so what I want to do next well I got
these all sort of drawn in here I could
use that to help me draw now I'm
probably gonna do another one just for
this this face right here for this I can
use this this and this and then have the
brake be right there and then draw that
all as one I'm gonna go and do a loop
cut though for this bar that's gonna
come down here and Bend and I'm gonna
probably gonna use a knife tool to cut
this angle into this but before I do
that I'm thinking that I probably want
to extrude out my bottom bumper because
that is a little less complicated than
everything else that I'm doing here fool
what I want to do um this is gonna come
down here I think I want to extrude down
and then extrude out like this so what I
do is before we get too complicated with
the top part I'm gonna go get this and
I'm gonna start extruding downwards and
I'm just doing a face select and right
clicking all of these guys and there
they are
Eames so let's go back to three and we
go E and enter again to extrude bring it
down here so I got that in place and
then I can do all the extrusions for
everything else here and everything will
look pretty neat a to deselect B to
select so I'm going to come up here and
grab all of these guys this won't affect
anything by moving those whoops gonna
change back into vertices mode and we go
B and I'm going to select all of these
and drag them to the right so that that
lines up there that looks pretty good
do you select and this I'm probably just
gonna have the wheel well be where it is
right now that looks fine I'm gonna to
add in another loop cut so that I'll be
able to define the the part down here
that's gonna be gray so I'll probably
just grab
this guy right here and drag it into
place for now I'm thinking that's a good
idea
and I'm gonna do another loop cut here
so I can define this so I'm going to go
control an are there that is drag it
into position let's try this is going up
and down so that should be well let's
place it first and then it was go s y 0
there that since that's straight now
drag this over here and then I will
there's that positions for right now I
don't know if I need to do anything else
with it I'm going to extrude downwards
from this so that I can make this go
into position and whenever you're
modeling these what you want to do is
you're basically creating faces or at
least that's the way I look at it so I
want to create the face so I can extrude
this out from here so I'm gonna drag
this over here and put it right there
see now I can this is a face that I can
extrude out for my bumper which is
something I want to do these faces all
match up that are going to allow me to
create my gray space down below what I
need to do now is create some more loop
cuts that are going to allow me to
define this part right here that's going
to extrude out so let's just do that
right now so let's go ctrl + R go back
over here towards the left and that
allows you to do loop cuts that go
horizontal versus vertical okay alright
so I'm gonna I'm just gonna do two of
them because I don't want to mess with
anything else this is an extremely
important part so let's go and let's
grab that let's put it right here so
that's gonna allow me to get those faces
right there now I need to go and let's
let's mess with this a little bit let's
say that I decide that I want the loop
cut to come down alright let's do a B
this isn't going to matter let's mess
with this a little bit grab that and
drag it over here a little bit and do
you select that so what's coming roughly
right there and then I'm gonna say that
I want to go from there down to this
area so I'm going to do another loop cut
for the top of that and remember I want
to go towards loops towards the left
side for drawing those in there yeah
so I got that there and let's go and
drag it down to create the very top of
that so now I'm going I have loop cuts
for this this and this I'm gonna use a
knife tool to come down and drag into
this and can I use this to create the
rest of the faces that I'm looking for
as far as I can tell the answer to that
question is yes so I'm going to deselect
this B I'm gonna grab this and move it
in just a little bit that looks good
do you select that and I'm gonna use a
knife tool to cut down there to create
that part those faces and cut down to
those faces right there
so knife tool there it is and let's go
and grab it it doesn't have to be
precise because I'm I can drag them into
position okay I dragged and created all
those vertices and I hit enter on my
keyboard I'm gonna deselect now what I
want to do is individually come in here
and drag these until by my eye they look
like they're good so I'm gonna sort of
use the background image so get that
back in order and then I'm gonna use my
knife tool against a knife tool again
I'm gonna drag from here down and create
all the faces I need whenever I get to
the last one I hit enter i miei to
deselect them then I'm gonna grab them
and move them into position to what
looks good
so roughly in the center a to deselect
right click vertices and you know I'm
just sort of working this together and
there we are
so now we're got we have all those
different parts okay so I have the face
for that that that I don't like the way
this looks um whatever those are all
those faces so those are all the faces
that I'm gonna be able to select to
create all of those different parts I'm
also gonna be able to create these faces
I need to be able to extrude this down
however to create that part and that
part what I'm going to do is get the
front bumper first so I'm going to do a
face select and right-click and I'm
gonna go E
enter jump back over into the side view
with the three and I'm going to extrude
that down
that looks fun let's deselect that now
what I'm going to do is go and do
another control or here another control
or here so that I can extrude downwards
and then merge to another one there and
then extrude outwards from there I'm not
the greatest blender user in the
universe as you're well aware I could
probably use a lot less cuts and a lot
less vertices but things turn out well
enough for me so because that's is what
I'm doing okay so I need to have two of
these so again in my middle mouse button
just rolled my mouse button on my mouse
wheel up a little bit left click and
then I can extrude these down and then
unselect all those hold down the Alt key
right click this drag this down here put
that in position if I wanted to have
these be straight I could sy 0 say that
but I don't really care
you know they look fine some people
really like it to have those be straight
I don't know I guess they kind of look
nice sy 0 and there it is and we'll drag
that into position okay so now I can
make this bumper so let's deselect
before we start dragging our mouse
around potentially caused all kinds of
problems we're gonna do our face select
we're gonna select this face I looked
there make sure you get the right thing
there we are
extrude enter jump back in the side view
and then drag that down there we go we
just created our other bumper so that's
good always hit a button to cause a lot
of problems to disappear I'm going to do
another extrusion here so this here drag
that into position that looks fine
actually it works better to have that
curve there okay so now I have another
face to that I'll be able to extrude
down and then create the bottom part of
that bumper so face select yeah that's
right click right click all of these
different guys so that we can extrude
them and then we will shrink them down
so extrude boom
and then we will drag them down into
position and that looks pretty good yeah
something like that deselect all of them
jump back into vertices mode and then
box select them and drag that over into
position and once again box select these
and drag that into position whoops I
forgot state always hit a after you do
anything that'll keep you from doing
dumb things and there we are and got
that into position right there a to
deselect and then once again I'm going
to extrude outwards first create the
outwards part of this so what I'm gonna
do I'm gonna do face select remember you
can hit the control tab but I'm just too
much of a meathead for some dumb reason
I can't do that without messing up other
things so all right so let's grab that
put that in position let's get the
bottom part here instead a to deselect
let's go get the vertices and B and put
this in position that looks about right
and I'm gonna grab these and extrude
them down back all right so this upwards
so a to deselect once again and I'm
gonna do face selects and I'm gonna
extrude and draw that in there so
selects like all these guys make sure
you get them all and extrude boom three
and then we'll drag these down right
like that huh
and then deselect and then for the neat
work we will go and work with our
vertices B select that put that down
into position and there we go got the
whole outer shell of our car all done
and everything is straight and looks
pretty sharp jump back over into three
and just so that I can just keep this
nice and simple what I'm going to do is
I'm going to end the tutorial here and
in the next part I'm going to add in I'm
going to extrude out these parts and I'm
going to add in the wheels and the
headlights and the blinker up here and
all of the other details so I got all of
the basics all lined up here and ready
to go and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
