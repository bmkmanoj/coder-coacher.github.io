25 of my c-sharp video tutorial in this
part of the tutorial I'm going to be
doing a ton of things mainly I'm going
to show you how to set up sequel server
as well as Visual Studio all brand new
versions literally the newest version of
Visual Studio just came out like a week
ago I'm going to show you how to create
tables in sequel server I'm going to
show as well as in Visual Studio I'm
going to cover SSMS so I'm going to
cover app config I'm going to show you
how to connect to a sequel server
database using c-sharp and a whole bunch
of other different things like always
the code that I use is available in the
description underneath the video and
it's evalee comma and and I have a lot
to do so let's get into it okay so the
very first thing you're going to need to
do is get sequel server and this is
where it is but if you just type in
sequel server 2016 and no there isn't a
20-17 this is the most up-to-date
version just go to Microsoft comm
da-da-da-dah that you are alright there
you can pause it or you can just go on
to any browser and type in sequel Server
2016 and you'll get it then what you're
going to want to do is come down here
where it says developer and you just
want to go and click on that and
download that you're going to probably
have to setup a Microsoft account but
it's free everything's free so don't
worry about that then this guy's going
to open up on your screen you're
specifically going to click on sequel
server 2016 developer and whenever that
does you're going to probably 264 up
here and all of this stuff is exactly as
its set up and you're going to click on
this guy
whenever you do this is going to pop up
on your screen and you're just going to
come over here and click on basic then
after that you're going to be accepting
a whole bunch of things and hitting okay
so just click on accept and this is more
than likely where you want to just have
everything be default you're not going
to be problems that way and then click
on install that's going to take a little
bit to install but then after it's all
finished up you might want to go and
copy down some of this information for
example your connection string that's
going to pop up here on your screen
obviously probably going to be a little
bit different than mine your log folder
if you want to look up any errors that
you have and so forth and so on and then
you're going to want to click on install
SSMS whatever you do it's going to open
up a browser and you're going to want to
download this
I so come in here and click to download
it this is going to pop up on your
screen of course you're going to click
on install and then that's going to take
a little bit of time after it's done is
going to say setup complete click on
close then what you're going to want to
do is come over here and find the sequel
server management tool that you just
installed and click on that and you're
going to see a pop up on your screen
what you want to do here is copy this
guy right here because we're going to be
using that a little bit later on you can
just put it in text folder or whatever
and then click on install SSMS then when
it opens up you're going to see your
database it's all set up inside of here
just leave Windows authentication on
there and click on connect and at this
point if you do not have Visual Studio
2017 you're going to want to go to
visual studio comm /downloads and the
version you specifically want is the
community version which is free so just
click on download and then click on ok
and install everything in the default
ports and everything will all be all set
up for you then after you have Visual
Studio 2017 installed you're going to
come up here and you're going to click
on View and server Explorer whenever you
do you're going to see this guy pop-up
right here you're going to right-click
on data connections and you're going to
come down here and click on create new
sequel server database you may get an
error message that says that you need to
install missing packages but
everything's set up beautifully here so
what we just wanted to do is just click
on OK and it's going to come in here and
show you exactly what you need to
install and you just need to install it
that's going to take a little bit of
time but after that installs you may
need to restart Visual Studio you may
not might as well be safe what we're
going to do is right click up here on
data connections and once again go into
create new sequel server database
whenever you do this guy is going to pop
on your screen obviously your server
name is going to be different than mine
you're going to keep used windows
authentication checked here and then
you're going to give your database some
type of name I just called mine store DB
then you're going to click on OK alright
so now we got our database set up now
it's time to create a table you're going
to right click on tables and then click
on add new table and then you're going
to if you want to actually have the
example I have in this video work you're
going to go in here and set everything
exactly the way you see it's a product
ID it's going to be an integer product
it's going to be characters of 50
lengths price money
code and you're going to once again have
characters of twenty characters of
length you're also going to want to come
down here and put products right here
after you have all that set up you want
to come up here and click on update this
little guy is going to pop up on your
screen and you'll want to click on
update database now if you want to go in
here and actually put some products
inside of your table you're going to
right click on products under the tables
folder and go show table data and then
what I did was I just went in here and
put in a whole bunch of different types
of cereal so the product ID is going to
automatically auto update as you add
additional I put curios lucky charms
checks life raising brand you can see
all those and then I also put it like an
abbreviated code I don't know if I'm
going to do anything with us and later
parts of the tutorial but that's what I
got after that you can just click on
break click on products again and go and
create a new table I created a customers
table I'm not actually going to do
anything with this in this part of the
tutorial but I might use it in a later
part of the tutorial you can go in there
and play around do whatever you'd like
then of course after you're done click
on update now it's time to actually go
in here and actually start writing some
code to connect to the database you're
going to come over here and the search
solution Explorer and you're going to
right click on references and click on
add reference this guy is going to pop
up on your screen you're going to scroll
down until you see system configuration
and put a check inside of there and then
come down here and click on OK then
you're going to open up your app dot
config file and it is over here app
config so you're just going to open that
guy up right there and basically the app
config file is just going to store
configuration data that you're going to
use to connect to your database and I
went and put in a couple of these in
here you're going to actually type
everything in here from App settings
there down to here that's all you're
going to need to change this file
basically system data SQL client is
going to provide classes for accessing a
sequel server database which is what
we're using here obviously and then for
the connection screen string what you
need to do is come over here and click
on your database that you just created
and then you're going to come over here
and you're going to copy all of this
stuff exactly what you see right here
and then you're going to paste it in
here for the connection string and this
is just going to define the database
name and other
parameters for connecting through your
database then you're going to open up
your program dot CSV file and I'm
actually going to go through here and go
line by line and explain exactly how to
connect to a sequel server database and
I'll put that and make sure everything
works so you're going to need to go and
get these two libraries right here make
sure you put those inside of there and
then you're going to come in and go
configuration manager and this is just
going to provide access to the
configuration data that you just set
inside of your app config file so we're
going to call this actually I'm going to
come in here and define a string first
and I'm going to call this provider and
then Configuration Manager apps settings
and we're going to get what we marked as
provider inside of there and just to
point this out this is inside of the app
config so we're grabbing this guy right
here which is going to allow us to
connect to our sequel server database
jump back over here we're then going to
do the same thing to connect so we're
just going to come in here like this and
we're going to change this to connection
string and we have that connection
string over inside of the app config
file so we're just going to go
connection string right like this and
now let's do some stuff with all this
we're then going to go DB provider
factories factory and we're going to
call this factory I'll explain what this
is here in a second and then DB provider
factories get factory and pass in that
provider information and basically the
get factory method here is just going to
generate an instance of DB provider
factory and this guy right here is going
to allow us to do things like pass
queries to our database within going to
type in using DB connection and I'll
just call this connection and this is
going to represent our database
connection for us here
then I'll go factory and have it creates
our connection to our database we then
want to verify that we actually have a
connection and to do that we go
connection null and if we comes back
with an
value of null we know we have a problem
so we're going to come in here and say
something like connection error just to
keep it simple and then we'll come in
and do a read line just to pause the
screen so that you can see the error
message and then if they this is all
going to occur in the console and then
if they hits return that's going to end
our program and I'm going to go
connection and connection string and
this once again is going to be needed to
open the correct database this is the
data that's needed to open the correct
database and we'll pass connection
string to that we then want to open the
database connection so to do that we
just go connection and open then we're
going to create a DB command and this is
going to allow us to pass queries to the
database so let's go command equal to
and call the factory to create that
option for us we then want to verify
that we're able to issue these commands
so put a null inside of there and then
once again we're going to do pretty much
the same thing so just copy this rather
than type it out again here we'll say
something like command error we then
want to set the database connection for
commands so command connection equal to
connection we're then going to actually
create the query that we want to issue
and I'm just going to keep this very
simple this is going to be select
everything from the table called
products and then we'll cycle through
all that information print it to the
screen the DB data reader is going to
read the row results from our query if
we have any results which I know we will
so that a reader and let's just call
this data reader execute our reader then
we need to cycle through our results and
how we do that is by calling the data
reader with the method of read and it's
just going to read the results of each
you know row of results as we go through
here based off of our query and then
what I want to do is just come in here
and output some simple information from
the database
so I'm going to go data reader and then
I'm just going to put in whatever I
called these pieces of data and sort of
inside of our database so product ID was
one of those things and then we'll also
go and get the product name so once
again we'll go data reader followed by
product that's capitalized close off
that curly bracket close off that quote
and that's basically it now we just come
down here to keep our consoles open
after everything has been executed we're
just going to throw a read line inside
of there I don't think I have any error
so let's try to run it see if we can
grab data from our database and it opens
up and there you can see there's the
product ID as well as a product name
alright so there you go guys that is a
lot of information on setting up sequel
server and working with the new visual
studio and creating tables and executing
things and grabbing data from tables
inside of databases I hope you guys
found that tutorial very useful and like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
