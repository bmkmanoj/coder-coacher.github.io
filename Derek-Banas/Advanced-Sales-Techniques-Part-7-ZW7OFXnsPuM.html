7 of my sales and closing strategies
tutorial today I'm going to cover
closing techniques and multiple
different closes that are available to
you here I'll wrap up my closing
technique series of videos you'll be
happy to know that the final part of the
selling process getting the client to
buy is the easiest if you're having
trouble getting the client to buy you
have messed up the presentation phase I
wrote scripts for telemarketing
companies that were hugely successful
and original and I'm sure in this
tutorial you've learned many tips that
you've never seen anywhere else first
I'm going to cover the assumptive close
this is the most effective clothes if
you get them to affirm positively
throughout the presentation sort out
getting them to affirm to smaller
decisions and work your way up to the
big decision Joe Gerard the Guinness
Book of World Records greatest salesman
said if the client says no you failed to
assume the call throughout the
presentation you must be one hundred
percent sold on your product before you
could sell it to others on the other
hand when you are one hundred percent
sold is extremely easy to sell that
product to most anyone if you don't
believe in your product find one you do
believe in and sell it instead and if
you do not follow this advice good luck
ever becoming a good salesperson you can
soften this close by assuming the sale
and then follow that up with another
soft affirmation question there is an
example I know you'll love this product
or service now which payment plan
additional features delivery options etc
work best for you then you have the
honest close here you look them in the
eyes and you tell them you want to be
honest and tell them you want your
business then ask them what you need to
do to get it and you also might want to
be a little bit humorous here to lighten
any tension that might erupt most people
will return your honesty and will tell
you what you have to do then you have
the compromising closed hear you say I
see you see value in this product or
service and that the price is the major
sticking point right you then get them
to make a smaller and less expensive
purchase that won't allow them to miss
the opportunity totally another option
here is to give the person a maximum of
three potential offers and ask which
works best for them never present more
than three options in fact two options
is normally the best have the Ben
Franklin clothes Ben Franklin used this
technique every time he had a decision
to make he'd list out on a piece of
paper the positive
negatives to both sides of a decision
whichever side had the most reasons
listed would make his decision for him
tell your prospects historian have them
go through this exercise obviously get
them to affirm that this is a good way
to make a decision beforehand and also
with the Ben Franklin clothes I used to
write all the negatives and then hand
the paper to the prospective buyer and
ask them to list the positives I used to
ask all my customers to describe what
objections they had before they made the
positive decision to buy from me I did
this at the end of the presentation I
would have them explain in their own
words how I overcame that objection but
I wouldn't call it an objection I'd call
it you know a problem they had with the
product I had all of these testimonials
printed in a book and when i received an
objection from new customers i would
just present the testimonials to them i
spent a great deal in my career having
old customers sell two new ones this is
really a very easy way to sell to people
here's a few extra tips people walk
through your doors because they are
expecting to buy your product or service
if you operate through walking sales
calls if they are listening to you they
are saying they are interested if they
weren't they would just tell you to
leave and you must remember throughout
the call you should constantly speak as
if the person will buy if you do this
they will start to assume that they'll
buy as well here's some good phrases you
could use you can handle the payments on
a quarterly basis at a ten percent
discount not you may wish to purchase
based on a 10-percent discount on a
quarterly basis say the first one was
assumptive the second one was not or you
could say I think you're smart to make a
purchase today before the price
increases instead of if you buy today
you avoid the price increase make the
customer feel as if the product belongs
to them get them used to owning the
product once people feel ownership
closing a sale becomes natural you can
do this by using words such as when
instead of if also use the words we and
let's to give them the impression that
they aren't making the decision alone so
what's next this was the basics of my
selling system is there anything I've
missed I'm or do you have any questions
or are there any specific problems that
you have in regards to selling if you do
leave them in the comment section below
