prologue video tutorial in this one
tutorial I'm going to cover pretty much
everything you would read in a standard
prologue book in one video because many
of you guys have told me most of the
books on prologue are very poorly
written or are hard to understand I'm
going to specifically emphasize numerous
examples on prologue to clear up the
language and make it very understandable
in the description underneath the video
I have timestamps for all the different
parts of the tutorial so you'll be able
to click on them and go to directly
whatever you want to learn and also in
this tutorial because numerous people
have asked me I'm going to show you how
to install numerous different languages
including C++ the most requested on
Windows so you may be asking yourself
well what exactly is prologue well
prologue is just quite simply a
collection of facts and rules that we
can query and Prolog is going to focus
on describing facts and relationships
about problems rather than creating a
series of steps to solve that problem
like you might see in another
programming language and these facts and
rules are going to be stored in a file
called either the database or
knowledgebase as you're going to see and
why don't I jump over and show you how
to install everything okay so if you're
on Mac this is going to be very easy all
you're going to have to do is go to brew
dot SH and install homebrew that is all
you're going to have to do and you can
see all the instructions right here
then what you're going to do inside of
your terminal is just type in brew
install good new prologue right like
that and hit enter and then inside of
that same terminal you'll be able to go
to whatever directory you have your
prologue files stored in or your
prologue database stored in and type in
G prologue right like that and you're
ready to go now let's go and look at
exactly how we can install numerous
languages on windows including prologue
okay so this might seem like a lot of
steps but it's really not you're just
going to go to cygwin comm and install
dot HTML or you can just come over here
and click on install cygwin and then
you're going to come down here and click
on setup x86 64 Exe and that's of course
is going to say do you want to run or
save this and just click on save and
then you're gonna have to give it access
click on yes and you're
gone next and then you're going to leave
this on install from Internet and click
on next and this is perfectly fine click
on next direct connections fine click on
next and you can choose any of these
different sites or you'll be able to
download normally I just let it select
whatever it selects automatically and
click on next and then after all that
installs you're going to see a window
kind of like this what you're going to
want to do is come down here where it
has DV e L or development and click on
that and whatever you do all this stuff
is going to open up what we're going to
do now is cycle down through all these
different lists of data and still you
see canoe and you're going to see that
right here and here is going to be all
the things you're going to want to
install and you're going to want to make
sure that you come in here and click on
binaries for all of these different guys
GCC core GCC Fortran if you one Fortran
G plus plus if you want to c++ to be
able to work and there's a couple other
here's a Dan Objective C and all those
different things might as well just go
ahead and install all of them you don't
need to install Fortran however and this
is going to work for Prolog as well as c
and c++ you can see i also have a check
here for the new debugger and you're
going to keep on scrolling and then also
you're going to want to get the make
right here make sure you check inside of
that and i think that is everything then
after you do that you're going to want
to come over here and click on next and
whenever you do it's going to say do you
want to resolve all the dependencies
install everything yes click on next and
it's going to take a while to download
and install and then after it is all
installed you're going to see a message
like this and you can decide if you want
to put an icon on your desktop or in the
Start menu or whatever and click on
finish okay all that's installed now we
have to install Prolog we're going to go
to G prologue dot org and there's a
couple different flavors of Prolog I'm
just using G prologue because that works
out best for me and you're going to look
at what you want to install you're
either going to get one of these Windows
versions right here and everything is
going to install directly for you and
make sure you install this one right
here see cygwin over here and this is
going to auto install so you're going to
click on that and then this little
wizard is going to open up
going to click on next and then you got
to pick the location I just left it at
the default and click on next
and here is our Prolog console and we
get that just by clicking on the little
icon that's going to launch that for us
and this is going to work exactly the
same way it works on a Macintosh or OSX
or whatever then what you can do is you
could go into the folder where you have
cygwin 64 home and then it's going to be
your name and just to verify that c++
and everything else is also installed
because of course I want to make sure I
covered how to do that you can just
create hello world dot H right like this
and then type in everything you see
right here inside of here and save it
and if you want to see exactly where I
have this stored cygwin 64 home say
there's my name of course is going to be
your name and then what you're going to
want to do is just go inside of a
terminal and you're going to want to go
to cygwin so you're going to get another
icon on your desktop that's going to
look like this guy right here you're
going to click on that this is in
Windows of course and then you can see
the process of everything that I'm doing
right here just to verify that c++ is
installed and there is everything and
there you can see hello world printed
out so feel free to pause your screen if
you want to and check that out just to
make sure that cygwin is installed and
c++ is installed and everything else is
installed and of course we know the
prologues installed because we were able
to open that up so that is everything
you need to know about installing
everything on Windows as well as on
Macintosh let's start writing some code
okay so as I was talking about
previously all your facts and your rules
that you define are going to be stored
in a file called the database or the
knowledge base and that is this guy
right here I just called it DB PL that
extension is important and this is going
to be the knowledge base where we're
going to store those facts and rules now
you're going to be able to load those
inside of here well first let me show
you how to exit out of the G prologue
system you're just going to type in halt
like that and period and there you go
you're back to your terminal and of
course you're going to be able to load
everything just by going G prologue
right like that you're also going to be
able to load your database is empty
right now but to load your database you
just going to type in a little bracket
like that and then
Phoebe and then a closing bracket and a
period and there you can see everything
compiled and everything is ready for us
to work with you could also come in here
and type out the much longer consult and
then DB dot PL like that and that's also
going to load the database but you can
see I actually type that in make sure
you put another quote right there and
there you can say there's another way to
load it but of course this is a little
bit shorter so this is what I use this
guy right up here
another thing is going to be important
once you are able to have some things in
your databases you can type in listing
and in a dot and it's going to show you
a whole bunch of information about the
contents of your database and all of
these commands as well as most of the
commands inside of Prolog are called
predicates so I don't I do a very simple
hello world thing again this is the
terminal this is the text editor or the
knowledge base if you wanted to do a
hello world you could just go right and
hello world and you're going to I'm
going to show you a whole bunch of
different ways to output stuff if you
want to do a newline you just type in
and out like that and you're going to
divide everything up with commas and
then write and let's say let's now I
have a opening quote right here so to
define a quote inside of the string I'm
going to do a backslash with a quote
like that
and I could do this and program and I'm
going to close this off with a period
like I always will
and there you can say hello world and
let's program prints out on our screen
and once again NL is for newline so
let's come over into our database let's
define something so let's say something
like love's Romeo and Juliet now what
this is saying is Romeo loves Juliet in
this situation this is going to be a
fact where love's is going to be what we
call predicate and Romeo and Juliet
these guys right here are called atoms
which are going to be constants and also
of course they are the arguments that
are going to be passed into the
predicate loves and I might as well go
in here and also do a little bit of a
brief introduction of much of what
you're going to say if you want to
define a rule you're going to use
something that looks like this and
that's the same as if we would say if
like we're very accustomed to in other
programming languages and here we could
say loves Juliet Juliet loves Romeo if
and then we could say or refer to this
guy right up here Romeo loves Juliet so
this is a rule
Juliet is going to love Romeo as long as
Romeo loves Juliet and that is quite
simply what we're saying right there and
of course we're going to save that and
then we're going to also come in here
and we're going to load our database
right like that and we can come in here
and check to see if indeed Juliet loves
Romeo right like that and you're going
to see that yes comes back as our answer
now as you're reading through books or
you're reading online also facts and
rules are referred to as clauses and now
to close the intro part off I'm just
going to briefly talk about variables
now variable is going to be an object
that we can't name at the time of
execution now unlike our atoms that we
saw previously such as Romeo and Juliet
a variable is always going to start with
an uppercase letter while they will
always start with lowercase letters and
what's great about variables is they are
going to allow us to answer questions so
if we want to find out who loves Romeo
and we don't know we can just ask our
terminal and it's going to come back
with Juliet and those are the basic
things you really have to understand
about prologue to really get to
understand the language it's really a
simple language that does certain things
extremely well but it is very easy to
get confused by it because you may be
used to other languages in which
everything is done in a step-by-step
manner but I'll do my best to clear
everything up so now let's focus in here
more on facts and cover more complex
examples now basically with a fact
you're going to write the relationship
first followed by objects between
parentheses followed by a dot and as you
can see right here this is a fact that
Romeo loves Julia these guys are always
going to start off with lowercase
letters and then they're going to be
able to contain letters uppercase
letters numbers as well as plus/minus
underscore or multiplication division
signs and a whole bunch of other
different things which you will probably
never use whenever you're defining them
but anyway you're able to use them just
make sure that you never start off an
atom with an underscore it's also useful
to know that you would be able to define
instead of saying something like Rome
dog and underscore like you would very
commonly do you would also be able to
use whitespace in here as long as you
put this between quotes so that's
something else that you can do however
it's not very often seen so now I'm just
going to define a whole bunch of
different facts inside of my database
and it's very important whenever you're
defining these that you keep all of your
predicates mail mail mail mail all these
guys all in one area
you don't want mail and another mail
down here you want to keep everything
all nicely and organized and then of
course if you go in here and you do this
again always remember to load your
database you're going to be able to come
in here in fact check or check that
these facts are indeed true quite easily
another thing it's kind of interesting
is we can type it in listing and then
mail like this and then get a listing of
all the mails and of course you could do
that with all of the females as well and
another thing that's interesting is we
could get mail and then throw a variable
inside of it and female and throw a
different variable inside of it and this
is going to show all the combinations of
male and female together and how we
whenever you see a little question mark
after this how we cycle through all
these guys is we hit a semicolon like
that and it's going to continue cycling
through all the different versions of
male and female until there are none and
there you can see we got to the end of
it and that is really all you need to
know about facts so why don't we talk
about rules so let's go and let's get
some of these guys out of here okay so I
went and threw in a couple different
facts about our different people that
we're working with here and I'm going to
talk about rules now rules are going to
be used when you want to say that a fact
is going to depend on a group of other
facts and we're very often going to
define these rules by using a guy that
looks like this which is the same as
saying if as you're going to see in a
second so let's say that we want to say
that Albert runs under certain
circumstances so we're going to say if
we're gonna say Albert is happy and then
follow that with a comma and then yeah
actually that's enough so let's just put
a dot inside of there and you can see in
fact that that is going to be true lotor
database and let's check
if albert is running and you can see
that albert is running and that is a
rule that is a very simple rule but that
is a rule we're also going to be able to
check multiple conditions as I was just
going to show you there a second ago and
you're going to do that with a comma
which is also the same as saying and so
let's say that we want to say Alice
dances if alice is happy and alice is
with Albert and then put a period at the
end of it and then we can check if
currently alice is dancing and you can
see that in fact she is so there's two
simple rules and of course all of the
code you see here is going to be
available in the description underneath
the video so you should get it and use
it as a cheat sheet or something like
that we're also going to be able to come
in here and define our own predicate to
keep our commands brief so let's say
something like does Alice dance and then
we're going to say if so does Alice
dance is going to be our predicate and
we could say dances Alice like this and
then we could also come in and issue a
write command so we could say when Alice
is happy and with Albert she dances and
then close that off of the period and
then we could come in and just say does
Alice dance just like we did with all
the other predicates and you're going to
say that when Alice is happy and with
Albert she dances prints on the screen
exactly as you would think come in
create a couple more rules it's very
important to know let's say we go swims
so Bob swims if Bob is happy and near
water if we type this in come over and
then check if Bob is swimming you're
going to see oh uncaught exception and
why did we get that well we got that
because we did not define a fact called
near water so that is one of the reasons
why we got that error if I wherever we
would go and take this up here and throw
that in there as a fact then of course
it would execute and it's also very
important to know that not only do all
the predicates need to be defined but
also in two situations where you're
using and right here with the comma that
both these conditions must be true for
this rule right here to be considered
true we could also come in here
and define two instances and if either
of them comes back true then the answer
is going to be yes so we could say bill
swims when bill is happy and then also
come in here and swims bill and it's
still going to work even though we have
not defined a fact called near water for
bill or for anything and you're going to
see that that's true if we come up here
and do this and then we say swims and
impasse in bill you see that that comes
back true and yes indeed bill is
swimming so it's possible to define
different predicates are different rules
that all depend upon different
conditions all with the same name now
we'll come back to rules but let's focus
more on variables here for a second so
that you completely understand exactly
how they work let's get rid of all that
stuff now a variable is going to be an
object like I said before in which
you're unable to be able to name it
whenever you're writing your program now
what sets variables apart is they all
begin with an uppercase letter or an
underscore and of course they're going
to be able to contain all the same
symbols that I talked about previously
with atoms there we go throw a couple
facts inside of there and now of course
we're going to be able to come in here
and load the database and use a variable
and I use X a lot of course you don't
need to use X and this is going to spit
out all of the different females that
are inside of our database and I'll
throw a couple more facts inside here to
kick things a little bit more
interesting so that we are defining
albert is the parent of bob albert is
the parent of Betsy and so forth and so
on so we'll be working with that
information so let's enjoy our new
database inside of here and let's go and
query this guy so let's say that we
wanted to find out everyone who is the
parent of Bob it would just do it this
way and there you can see that Albert
came back as well as Alice Kim's back
and then the no right here means that
there is no more additional X's or
values that could be assigned to X it's
also very important to know that the
same variable name or X like I've been
using whenever I've been issuing queries
like this guy right here that are used
in two completely different questions
represent two completely different
variables so they don't go from one to
another and retain their value in any
way
basically disappear as soon as the role
of the quarry ends okay so I added a
couple additional facts in here so we
can do a little bit more complex little
questions here always update your
database and now we could say something
like who is the parent of Bob who also
dances uppercase letters of course
you're going to see that Alice comes
back and that there's nobody left after
that now we can come in and do something
a little bit more complicated so for
example let's say that we wanted to ask
if Carl has grandparents so we can work
our way up through the system now this
is where logic comes in what are we
going to do well we're going to look for
a parent of Carl and we're going to look
for one of the whys right here that
comes back as a child so we're looking
for who are Carl's parents and is coral
the child of an ex parent and you can
see right here Albert and Bob pop back
and the bob part of course is going to
be Carl's father and we can also see
that Alice also comes back and that
there's nobody else in the results so
that's one way to think through a
logical way of looking at these things
we could also come in in a similar way
and try to find Albert's grandchildren
so the first thing that we're going to
say in this situation is is Albert a
parent then after we do that we're going
to say does his children have any
children so we'll be able to say parent
through the X in there which represents
a child and then we'll throw a Y inside
of there and those are going to
represent the children and here you can
see back the Carl comes back as well as
Charlie comes back and that there's no
further results so that's a way to find
out if he has any grandchildren now
we're also going to be able to come over
here and create a custom predicate to
basically get multiple results so let's
call this get grandchild if and here
we'll say parent Albert and we're also
going to say that you're going to be
able to pass these values inside of here
so we'll be able to do even more
customized things and parent and x and y
and now we'll be able to come in here
and write out Albert's grandchild is and
I'll show you a neater way of printing
stuff out here in a second so you don't
have to type it
right a million times but this works for
now no we'll just be able to go in here
and go get grandchild like that and
Albert's grandchild is Carl pops back
and also you're going to get Albert's
grandchild as Charlie also Bob's back
and there you can see are all the
results for that query we could also
come in and do something like check and
see if Carl and Charlie share a parent
how we would do that is by saying parent
X again for our variable parents put the
X inside of there and then throw Charlie
inside of there and you can see the Bob
pops back and there you can see that
there's no further results another way
to print things out is to use format to
get your results so let's just change
this to get grandparents like this here
we're going to change this to X and
we'll change this to Carl leave this as
X and change this to Charlie then we're
going to get rid of all these write
statements and use format instead so
we'll say format now if you want to put
in a variable here you're going to put
the tilde with a lowercase W if you want
to transpose a string inside of here
you're going to put a tilde and an S and
then we're going to say grant parent and
then you're going to put a new line
inside of here using format with a tilde
and an end and of course you put a space
inside of there if you want and inside
of here inside of what we're going to
learn more about later which are called
lists put these brackets X is going to
be the variable you want to transpose
inside of here and then for the string
you want to use you're going to go is
the inside of there right like that and
of course close that off and we'll of
course be able to jump over here load
our database and then go get grand
parent and Bob is the grandparent pops
back and you can see that there is no
further results afterwards I went
through another fact in here that Bob
and Bill are going to be brothers and
let's say we want to check if Carl has
an uncle so how would we do that well we
could say that we're looking for a
parent for Carl of course we don't know
who that is and we're also looking for
brothers in which that parent has a
brother and of course let's just go and
copy this and throw it over here paste
that inside of there and there you can
see that Bob pops back as the version of
X which is going to be Carl's parent and
you can see here that Bill is the
brother of ball
and you can see also that there's no
further results also like to commit here
and demonstrate axioms and derive facts
let's come in here and define
grandparent which is going to receive an
x and y value as an attribute we want to
say if parent we're going to throw a Z
inside of here
and an X and then parent again inside of
here we'll go Y and see now what this is
going to allow us to do is to go
grandparent actually I don't need that
space inside there but since I did it
whatever and we'll be able to go Carl
and then we'll be able to throw a inside
of here what this is saying is we want
Carl to go in here to the x position Y
is still going to be a variable inside
here that we don't know anything about
and then a is going to represent a value
that's going to be passed out after this
predicate is done executing and if we do
that you're going to see that the
grandparents of coral come back both as
Albert as well as Alice so it's another
way to work with our predicate s-- and
pass parameters into them also very
important to know let's say we have
blushes x if human x that if this value
on the right is true then this value on
the left is going to be doomed
true as well so if we commit here and
define human as derek that we'll be able
to come in here also and go blushes and
pass derek inside of it and that's also
going to come back as true so you can
see how these rules and these different
facts all play off of another and to
finish this off to another example let's
say that we want to say that Thibault
which is from Romeo and Juliet again is
going to stab Mercutio with a sword and
henceforth Romeo is going to hate X if X
stabs Mercutio with a sword and of
course we're going to be able to do that
and check that out and another thing
we're going to be able to do over here
in the terminal in a second is there
something else called an anonymous
variable let's say for example that we
wanted to check for the existence of the
predicate male right here but we did not
care about any of the values that are in
the predicate male we could also do
those with what are called anonymous
variables
first off let's go and let
check hates if Romeo is going to hate
anybody and just throw that in there and
you can see the Tibble pops back and
also you can see whenever we use an
anonymous variable which is just an
underscore we're going to be able to
check for the existence of the male
predicate without getting any additional
results however it's going to pop
through there for all the different
results but we can just hit enter to
close that out and see that yes in fact
there is a predicate called male so one
thing you may be asking yourself is
where is if where our conditional
statements well there really are no if
statements inside of Prolog except for
that guy right there
however you can pretty much knock them
off with a sort of case statement sort
of way now remember we're going to be
able to define the same predicate name
multiple times and then accept different
results and then act on them well one
thing we can do is we could define a
predicate called what grade and in this
situation we'll say five or what we're
going to do if five is entered as a
value or a parameter for what grade and
in those situations say something like
go to kindergarten and then close that
off what will then be able to do is
define what grade again but in this
situation we're going to perform a
different reaction if their age is sex
like this and in this situation we'll
say something like go to first grade and
then we see that that works then we
could also define another predicate
which is going to cover any other
situation so we could give it a
different name or variable here let's
just call it other and in this situation
we could say something like grade define
a variable and we'll be able to perform
arithmetic operation here by going grade
is which is the same as saying equals
and then we could say other minus five
so we're going to take the value of
whatever they pass in here subtract five
from it and then from that let's use
format here again I just like the bounce
around and use different things we could
say something like go to grade and then
our tilde and our W and then of course
after that inside of brackets put grade
and then close that off and you can say
that we'll be able to come in here
execute that and then we can say
something like what grade and then let's
pass five inside of here and
say go to kindergarten pops back and
also we'd be able to come in and say
something like what grade for every
other result say something like 10 and
see that it automatically pops out the
information that we would expect there's
a whole bunch of different ways to work
with variables and predicates and a
whole bunch of other different things
now we're going to go and take a look at
complex terms or structures now a
structure is going to be an object
that's going to be made up of many other
objects or components and structures are
going to allow us to add context about
what an object is to avoid confusion for
example let's say that you had defined a
fact inside of here which is albert has
olive now you may ask yourself well what
exactly does that mean does that mean
that albert has a pet named olive or
that albert actually has an all of that
now maybe Albert wants to eat well
structures are going to allow us to
clear that up now basically a structure
is just going to have what's called a
funk tour which we can just have right
here you've already seen these guys
followed by a list of arguments so for
example if we had female Alice females
going to be the functor and also it's
important to know that the number of
different arguments inside of here is
referred to as the arity inside of
Prolog so in this situation female has
one arity or one parameter and that
parameter is Alice so let's get back to
our little albert explanation here we
could also say something like owns and
Albert and then pass in inside of here
pet and then in here we could provide
more information so Albert has a pet cat
named Olive is exactly what we're saying
and it helps us avoid any confusion of
would have came from just using what we
had previously and of course if we would
then come in here copy that inside of it
paste this inside of there and then
maybe take all of out of here all
together you're going to see that all
the pops back as a result more
constructively we could also come in
here and create some customers Tom Smith
and he has a balance of twenty dollars
and 55 cents and Sally Smith who has a
balance of 120 dollars and 55 cents so
let's define those two facts you're
going to see here another example of an
anonymous
variable commits here and load that
information in the screen and say
something like customer and let's say
that we want Sally or information on
Sally we do not care about Sally's last
name and we specifically want the
balance to be pulled and stored inside
of the variable called balance there you
can see that's a very easy way to do it
and another use for an anonymous
variable we could also come in here and
define our own predicate so get customer
balance and it's going to get first name
passed inside of it as well as last name
we're going to say F customer F name
last name and balance and then we'll be
able to go right F name another thing we
can do with write if we want to throw a
space inside of it we could just type in
tab 1 that would be the same as saying
we want one space inside of something
but format works a little bit better so
let's just use format here tilde W owes
us a dollar sign inside of there if we
want to take the balance and we only
want two decimal places worth of values
we just put a tilde inside of there
followed by a two and a nap and that's
going to do that for us then of course
we'll come in and say let's just say we
want the last name and the balance to be
output we then be able to go get
customer balance and then pass in Sally
Smith and see that Sally Smith owes us
one hundred twenty dollars and fifty
five cents we could also come in and do
some really neat things so let's say we
wanted to define something like a
complex term that shows exactly what it
means to be vertical versus being a
horizontal line well we could do that we
could say vertical and we could define a
line that's going to have a point it's
going to be x and y as well as a point
that is going to be the same value of x
and a different value of y and there you
go we just defined what it means to be
vertical and we could also come in and
find what it means to be horizontal in
much the same way so we could just take
this guy right here
throw that inside of here and what's it
mean to be a horizontal well it means we
have the same value of y we have a
different value of x to find that inside
of there and you can see over here that
I have
warning it's called singleton variables
you're basically going to see that any
time that you define a variable that you
don't necessarily do anything with and
sometimes that's okay warning sometimes
it isn't in this situation it would be
okay so we're going to do now is come in
here and ask if a specific piece of data
for vertical is actually going to be a
vertical line let's just paste that
inside of there change this five change
this to ten change this to 5 and then
change this to 20 or something if we
execute that you're going to see that
yes indeed that is a vertical line and
we could do the same thing for the
horizontal line and get the same sort of
results I could also come in here and
change this five and then put a six
inside of there and you're going to see
that this is not a vertical line in that
situation one thing it's interesting is
we can actually ask what the value of
the point should be if it's vertical
let's just throw that in there again and
in this situation let's go to the sixth
part and change that to X exactly like
this and here you can see they pop back
the value of x even better yet we can
come in and type in something like
vertical and pass in line and point and
five and ten and then ask it for the X
and Y's that would be required to make
this vertical close that off and there
you can see that it doesn't matter what
the value of y is as long as the value
of x is equal to five so that's an
introduction to complex terms and
structures and of course we're going to
be seeing those later as the tutorial
continues now let's jump over and take a
look at how we can compare values inside
a prologue now of course we're going to
be able to do things like say is Alice
equal to Alice and it's going to come
back as yes we're also going to be able
to come in here and say is this equal to
Alice and you're going to find that yes
indeed that also is equal to Alice we'd
be able to come in and check to see if
things are not equal by just going back
slash and then a plus and then Alice is
equal to Albert for example and you can
see that that comes back that indeed
Alice is not equal to Albert and that's
exactly how we would figure that out we
could also come in and just do arbitrary
things like is 3 greater than 15 no we'd
be able to check it
three is greater than or equal to 15
also no or we can come and check it
three is and this is how you do less
than or equal to like this and that's 15
and that also comes back as no and the
reason why they do that is so that these
don't look like arrows and some
arbitrary Prolog thing another thing
that's interesting is we would actually
be able to go W which is going to be a
variable and go like this and you can
see that that comes back and true and
this is basically saying that we can
assign the value of Alice to W and not
necessarily that W is equal to Alice so
that's what's going on there if that
confuses you at all another thing that's
true in an equal way as we'd be able to
come in and go ran one which is say
variable is equal to R and two and
indeed those are also going to come back
true this basically just says that any
variable can be assigned anything and
one of those things is another variable
and another thing that's true is let's
say we go riche is equal to money X
equal to rich Y no debt completely
arbitrary types of things and you're
going to see that this also comes back
in true and the reason why that comes
back is true is this is going to be
equal to this if we can take this
variable right here and assign it to
this money right here and this X right
here can be assigned to this node debt
if those two things can work for each
other then both sides are going to be
equal there's a rundown of equality and
how it works it's very important to
figure those things out because it's
very easy if you understand them to then
be able to handle a lot of errors and
get yourself out of errors also another
thing that's very interesting or that is
good to know about is trace because it's
going to really help you better
understand how Prolog works how it
processes data achieves goals and comes
back with either whether things are true
or false
so what I did was I can went over here
and created a couple different rules for
ourselves so we have penguins and humans
and whether or not they are warm-blooded
produce milk or have feathers then I
defined a roll down here on whether
something can be a mammal or not must be
all those three things and you're going
to see exactly how this works because
we're going to use trace go get our
database all loaded and now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to turn on
trace this is often used
debugging inside of prologue and you can
see there the debugger is all setup and
now what I can do is I can go mammal
like this and pass in human like that
and see exactly how it's going to be
processed so you can see right here the
very first thing Prolog does whenever I
hit it with one of these questions is it
says well let's pass over human to the
mammal rule which is what we have right
here then what we're going to do is
we're going to check is the human
warm-blooded because that's the first
thing in our list and you're gonna say
that it exits out of there and
everything seems to be okay
then it's going to ask does it produce
milk exits out of there everything's ok
we still don't have a failure so we're
going to check again does a human have
hair yes it does have hair that is the
last goal or clause that we much meet
for a human to be considered a mammal
and there you see we're going to exit
out of the mammal predicate or role that
we defined and then answer with the
value of yes alternatively what we could
do is come in of course and do the same
exact thing with penguin and this is
very important you've ever get confused
about how exactly rules are working
inside of Prolog and turn on trace and
just check it out
so here we're going to check of penguins
real or a mammal anyway and so you can
see it's being passed over to there it's
being checked to see if it's one blooded
comes out of that ok then it's going to
check if it produces milk comes out of
that ok then it's going to check if it
has hair and you can see that it fails
right there and that is the entire
process of how we're going to be able to
walk through all these different guys
and of course if you want to shut off
trace just go no trace right like that
and the debugger is switched off also
likewise we could come in and say
something like warm-blooded X just as a
review produce milk and what does that
and then we could command and say
something like right X and
a new line and you can see that both the
Penguin pops back as well as human also
pops back so different ways of working
and comparing and walking through and
better understanding exactly how Prolog
processes all these questions that we
pose now let's take a look at recursion
I went in here and defined a couple
different rules we're going to be able
to work with so let's say if we wanted
to come in here and now that we have
this information about who are parents
of what children let's say we want to
come in and check out exactly how we
would find out if someone in this list
is related to another one well we just
go related if and then we're going to
find exactly a situation in which they
are related well there's going to be a
parent x and y of course and this indeed
is going to work for us if we get a very
specific relation so for example we
could go related and we can check for
Albert and Bob and know that that's
going to come back is true however if we
would come in here and do something like
related and then we would type in Albert
and Carl like that
is something that we know definitely is
true it's going to come back as no so
how can we work around that well one of
the ways we can work around that is
through using recursion now what we're
going to do is we're going to keep this
in here because it does work pretty well
I'll rule over we're also going to come
in here and we're going to define a
little bit more specific so let's say we
go x and y and if now what we're going
to do jump over here we're going to say
parent and here we're going to say x and
z something that we do not know about
and then we're going to call back
related once again and Z and Y so it's a
little bit more complicated so what
we're going to do in this situation
let's just use Albert and Carl is an
example well Albert and Carl pop in here
so Albert coral so we check is there a
situation in which Albert let's put
Albert in here for X is the parent of
something Z other than Albert and Carl
so yes that indeed is definitely going
to be true because Albert is the parent
of Bob Betsy and Bill so we know that is
true
we're going to take this value of Z each
of them Bob Betsy and Bill represent
this with Z and then we're going to
throw coral inside of there so we're
then going to pass this back and inside
of it and we're going to say is Bob bets
your bill which are now going to get the
values of X right here going to be equal
to coral inside of parent and you can
see indeed yes Bob is the first hit and
here you can see our answer and that it
indeed is true and now that we have that
saved we can load that and we can say
related and then pass in Albert and Carl
and you can see that that comes back
it's true so that's one way we can use
recursion
another thing is interesting is we would
also be able to come in here and go
related like this and then pass in Z and
coral and be able to cycle through all
of the possible different results
everybody that coral is ultimately
related to so kind of cool ways of using
recursion and of course we're going to
look more at those later on now let's
take a look at a lot of the math
functions that are available to us with
Prolog now Prolog is going to use the
key word is to evaluate mathematical
expressions so we could say something
like X is 2 plus 2 like that that works
you don't need the space you can see
there that we get the answer of 4 for X
and of course we're also going to be
able to come in here and use parentheses
or anything that we would like so we
could say 2 times 10 like that I typed
it properly 2 times 10 there we go and
there's our answer of 43 we're going to
be able to make comparisons of course
like you saw previously so that comes
back is yes we're also going to be able
to make comparisons between different
expressions so greater than or equal to
anything it's the whole bunch of these
so say 50 divided by 2 that and that
works once again because it's a little
bit weird just want to show you exactly
what it means whenever we check for
something being not equal 10 like that
and there you can see that comes back
we'd also be able to check for equality
between expressions maybe we do this in
a little bit of a weird way we go equal
to : equal to and then we could just do
4 plus 5 or something like that and then
likewise we could do in equality between
Russians by going equal sign and then
the backslash and equal sign four plus
five like that that's going to come back
as no of course we'd also be able to
check for multiple different comparisons
with an or operator the or operator in
this situation is going to be the
semicolon and you can also use those or
operations in your rules and so forth
instead of putting a comma put an or in
there and then it would come back as
true if either or though the goals is
met and you can play around with this
you can see that that works if one or
the other comes back is true we're also
going to be able to come in and say X is
and get the modulus or the remainder of
a division of 7/2 there you can get one
and let's come in and create ourselves a
predicate as well let's say we want to
do something like double digits and it's
going to get a value of x and y like
that we could say if and then we could
perform some calculations inside of here
we'll say Y is x times two and then we
could say double digit and let's just
double I don't know a thousand and pass
in Y which is going to be the value
that's returned with our answer and you
can see we got two thousand there
we're also going to be able to do a
whole bunch of other different things
such as generate random values so let's
say we want to generate a random value
between zero and ten and store it in the
variable of X well there you go
and you can see there that this is
indeed random could also you know see
more about this as well later on get all
the values between zero and ten let me
just go zero ten and let's have them
stored in X and you can see all those we
could cycle through them one by one by
typing in a semicolon just so you see
exactly what that looks like semicolon
semicolon semicolon say enter that
leaves going to be able to add one and
assign it to a value so let's say we
want to go to and
we want to assign that to the value of x
you can see that it increments the value
that's used a lot also in Prolog where
you get an absolute value absolute and
just pass in eight and there that is we
get the largest of two values so we can
say X is and then just pass in max and
then say something like ten and five
there that is we could also in a very
similar way get the minimum value and
there that is we can round values or
convert floating point values into
integers let's just go ten point five
six and there that is that's going to
round it up and if it was ten point four
it would round it down we'd also be able
to come in and truncate values we could
say truncate got ten point five six and
that's just going to knock off the
decimal places there and there's a whole
bunch of these different guys we can get
the floor which is going to give us the
same exact result as we just saw
previously we're also going to be able
to come in and get the ceiling which is
going to round up we could go and get
two to the power of three two and we'll
just put two multiplication signs and
three in that situation and you can see
that you can do all kinds of different
things like let's say we wanted to
create a predicate over here that's
going to tell us if something is even or
not so it's going to get some value
passed into it and that value is going
to Y is going to get the value of X and
we can do a division by two and then
also check for the expressions equal to
x Y we could save that jump over here
load that and then just call is even
that and throw in 12 or something is
even and that comes back as yes so as
you can see there's many different math
functions here's a whole bunch more and
there's even more aside from these guys
that I have listed here on the screen
feel free to pause if you want to go and
explore and play around with all those
different guys so let's take a look at
input and output now I already showed
you right what rights basically going to
be able to
is output whatever you put in between
quotes onto the screen and of course a
new line is going to give you a new line
and you can see there that is we're also
going to be able to come in here and go
right cue lowercase and say something
like I show quotes right like this and
that's going to show the quotes around
exactly the way they are displayed there
we'd also however be able to read input
from the user so let's say we want to
create a predicate called say hi and
let's do something like what is your
name and then we could use read to read
in the information that is entered from
the keyboard and then we could come in
and go right and say something like hi
and I showed you format already I'm just
using right here just so you can see
different things and we say right X and
then I can come in and do say hi right
like this and it's going to say what is
your name and you're going to enter in
everything that you want entered in
there and we're going to enter it in
between quotes like this and we're going
to follow that with a period and you're
going to see that it comes back as hi
Derek
likewise other different ways that we
can work with characters let's try that
we can do something like favorite
character equal to and when we can say
right what is your favorite character
put a comma and then use get get is
going to be able to receive one
character that it's going to save as an
ASCII value to X in this situation and
here we'll use format gets formats a lot
easier to use and we'll say the ASCII
value and here we're going to put tilde
W is and throw our X inside of there and
then to output a single character we say
put X and new line and then we could go
favorite character what's your favorite
character a and you're going to see the
ASCII value is 65 or the ASCII value of
65 is a okay so there's a couple more
functions we can play around with here
if you'd like to write to a function
that's actually rather easy let's create
another one of these guys here we could
just go call this write to file and say
that it's going to get a file name
passed into it
and the text that you want passed or
saved in the file what you need to do is
get a stream for this file so you're
going to pass it in the file if you want
to write to the file you have to type in
write and then this is going to be the
stream that we're going to be referring
to over and over again and then we could
say to write to the stream we just go
write stream text the text you want to
write to it and let's throw in a new
line and then to close the stream or the
connection to the file that's all stream
is you would just do that now we want to
check that we were actually able to
write to the file and the way to do that
is to read to read from the file so in
this situation we'll just pass in the
file we want to read from course we're
going to need to open the file so file
and we want to read this time so type in
read there instead of write then we're
going to need to do is read in
characters from the file so I'm going to
go get character pass in the stream and
it's just B character 1 or what have you
and then we'll say process stream which
is a function I'm going to create here
in a second character 1 because what I'm
going to do is I'm going to need to
check to see if we get to the end of the
file or not and then after we're all
done with that we will close our stream
of course so now what I need to do is
process my stream and if I ever get to
the end of file I know that I need to
stop getting anything out of there and
one way to do that is with what is
called a cut and there's a cut right
there and the cut is used anytime you
want to end backtracking through all of
these goals to see if they're true or
not just basically stops execution for
us so it's saying we want to keep
processing the stream until we get to
the end of the file and then we don't
want to do that anymore
otherwise what we're going to do is
we're going to get a character and a
stream passed inside of here and what
we'll do is we'll write out that
character and then we'll say get
character from the stream character to
just differentiate from those two and
then we'll call a process stream again
so we're going to keep calling process
stream basically asking for another
character from our file writing it to
the screen over and over
again until we get to the end of the
file so process stream and in this
situation pass in character to that we
got from our stream and there that is
and there that guy s so if we want to
work with this of course you have to
update everything here everything is
fine we're going to say right to file
like that and we have to tell if the
file we want to write to so we'll just
say something like test one I'll put
this between quotes test1 dot txt and
then whatever we want to write to it
we'll just say random string that works
well when I spelled random wrong random
string good enough now that is you can
see it wrote to it because it popped
back yes and if we want to read from the
file we just go read file like that and
we can say test1 dot txt what we want to
read from and you can see random string
came back so that's how we can accept
input from the user how we can output to
the console in multiple different ways
we can output two files and how to read
from files now let's take a look at
looping now I'm going to use recursion
here and how I'm going to end the
looping inside of my little application
here is I'm going to count to ten like
this and say that if the value is equal
to ten I'm going to call right ten like
that and then I'm also going to end the
calling of count ten over and over again
so we can go count to ten and say if
it's anything other than ten what I'm
going to need to do is go write X print
our value then I'm going to say Y is X
plus one and then count to ten once
again and pass the value of y inside of
it and you can see there we are and we
go count to ten like this and throw a 5
inside of there and it's an account from
five up to ten but you probably want to
do something a little bit fancier than
that so let's say we wanted to be able
to work with a lowest value and highest
value and have them count
between those so we'll do something like
how to count down from a value so we
could say just call this count down like
that and it's going to perceive the low
value as well as our high value and then
what we're going to do is use between
like we used before and this is just
going to assign the values between low
and high to why for us just like it did
previous in its last example and there's
why then I'm going to assign the
difference between high minus y save
that to Z and then I'm going to write
the value of Z to the screen followed by
a new line and now with countdown what
we're going to be able to do is come
over here and go count down like that
and we can do anything so let's go low
zero and we'll go the high is 15 like
this and you can see right there we got
15 14 13 and it's going to continue
going the whole way until it's zero
likewise we could do a count up which is
going to be very similar so we'll just
go copy this guy and change this to
count up still going to receive low and
high still going to need to use between
here the only thing we're going to
change here is basically to switch us
around we're going to say Z is y plus
low and then print out everything just
as we did before and then count up give
it a SAR low value and then give us our
high value and there you can see a zero
and it's counting its way up until it
gets to the end so there's another way
we can loop and one we just go and do a
little bit fancier loop yet again let's
do a guessing game so let's say we
wanted to use her to guess numbers over
and over and over again until they got
the value of 15 I'm going to create this
guy guess number and it's going to call
our loop predicate we're going to create
here in a second and the value of start
is basically just there as a dummy value
that's going to be used to start looping
and since our secret number is 15 we're
going to say that we want to continue
looping over and over again until the
user guesses 15 and whenever they guess
it you can come in here and say
something like you guessed it and close
that off otherwise where you're going to
loop so any other value is going to call
this version of loop and we're going to
say well we want X
to not be equal to 15 of course just as
a check we could then say something like
right guess number and then we're going
to read their guests from the input and
then we'll write out the guests on the
screen and we'll just go something like
write is not the number we know it's not
the number because otherwise it wouldn't
be here if it was 15 it would go and
call this version of loop up here and
then we'll just call loop guess again
another situation which we have
recursion and we could go guess number
is that a guess a number I'll type in 10
10 is not the number okay how about 1100
how about 15 and you can see that I
guessed it I guess I should have put
this is not the number up here at the
top but either way you get the point of
how to loop so let's go in and take a
look at how we can I write these this
code largely out of my head so little
bugs slip in there everyone so on so
well we go and check exactly how we can
change our database yes indeed we can
change our database from over here over
inside of our database only thing you
need to remember here is anything you
plan on changing any predicates you're
going to have to mark as denied dynamic
at the very beginning your faul or at
least before they are ever used anywhere
in any way and what we're doing here is
we're saying this is the father
predicate that is going to receive two
attributes that's what that means if
there was predicate here that received
three attributes we've put a three there
instead so that's exactly what those
mean and there's just a little bit of
information about Romeo and Juliet and
I'm going to go in here and mess around
with it and update my database as I go
and update all this information
let's leave the stabs part inside of
here and let's throw some information in
there that we can play around with okay
so you can see in this situation in
which we would use 3 because there are
three attributes down here for that guy
now let's jump up here and look at this
now you can see right here I'm defining
the friends of Romeo now I could also
come through and go Mercutio is friends
of Romeo and switch all these up but
let's say that I wanted to automatically
update that and didn't want to type that
information and I wanted to instead do
that over here on the right side of the
screen and our terminal I could add a
new clause to the database at the end of
the list so if I'm going to create a new
friend predicate it's going to come in
right here if I
use asserts like that certs is going to
put it at the end and I'm defining a new
rule and I'm basically saying that I
want to assert that Venn volio is also a
friend of Mercutio so you can see I went
and place that in there and if I come in
I can also verify that it's in the
database but I can verify it so ben
volio is a he a friend of Mercutio yes
it comes back is true I could also in a
very similar way instead add the clause
at the start of the predicate list by
instead of typing asserts which puts it
at the end I could instead type in
insert a and then likewise I could go
friend Mercutio Benvolio and if I check
that you're going to see that that also
comes back is true so that's the only
difference between asserts and assert a
you can think of it or remember it
because a comes at the very beginning so
assert a is going to put it before right
here while asserts is going to put that
additional information afterwards could
also delete a clause so let's say I
wanted to go retract likes let's say
that Mercutio's decides that he does not
like dancing anymore
no I can do that and I could verify that
that indeed has been changed because
that comes back as no I could also come
in and retract all situations like let's
say that Romeo and Juliet decide they no
longer want fathers at all so there we
are
I retract every single father that is
defined inside of this guy and they are
gone and I could verify that also by
going Lord Montague Romeo you can see
that comes back as know even though it's
defined right there and let's decide
that every single character decides that
they no longer like dancing at all I
could also use retract all and call
likes for everybody and revoke dancing
from it and you're going to say that
nobody likes dancing I could even do
that with
anonymous variable dancing and that
comes back is now so that's way is to
update our database from our terminal
right here pretty cool now let's take a
look at lists now you're going to be
able to store Adams complex terms
variables number is another lists in a
list and they're basically used to store
data that has an unknown number of
elements now you're going to be able to
add values to a list with what's called
the list constructor and I'm just going
to go right and the final list so there
you are Albert if I wanted to add Albert
to the beginning of the list that has
Alice and Bob inside of it close off
that list right like that there you can
see how it's been added and that's with
the list constructor this guy right here
the pipe or the overstatement or
whatever you want to refer to it as
we're also going to be able to get the
length of a list quite easily one two
three like that and let's say we want to
store that value inside of X there you
can see we got that you're also going to
be able to divide a list into its head
and tail parts so let's just go like
this again use the list constructor
inside of there and then pass it a list
and it's going to get you the head in
the tail a and B and C and the head is
going to be the first letter inside a
list of the first element inside of our
list and the tail is going to be the
last ones you're also going to be able
to come in here and get more values by
just adding them to the left side of
your constructor there so say X 1 X 2 X
4 pipe inside of there this is going to
be the T of the tail B C and D and you
can see got all those different values
out of there we're also going to be able
to use anonymous variables of course
like we've used in so many other
different situations which we don't care
about the value so we could do X 2 and
then say we want the tail port is equal
to and there you can see it popped back
or it grabbed the second element inside
of the list and ignored everything else
and we're also going to be able to use
that pipe character again to access
values of lists inside of less so let's
come in here and get
those x/y there's another tail and then
we could do a little bit more elaborate
list here it's equal to and then we
could go a B throw another list inside
of there c d e half let's make this big
G and H and there you can say it went
and grabbed all those different pieces
inside of there and exactly how they
line up with all the different list
elements and you can also notice here
that we can just pretty much jump all
over the place
Prolog isn't very picky when it comes to
whitespace we could also come in here
and define a list let's go back and
check if a is inside of our list and you
can see that it indeed it was and then
we use member for that we could also use
member to get all of the different items
in the list by passing X inside of there
is going to cycle through all those for
us
you could say that it's going to give us
all the different values that are
available you do all sorts of things
there's tons of different functions we
can use we could reverse these guys
there's a list items pass in X and there
you go you got the absolute reverse of
it you could also use a pen to
concatenate two lists and then let's
create another one forgot to put the
variable it's going to be assigned to
there's X there you can say concatenated
those lists together now let's do
something a little bit interesting with
a list let's I'll show you how to cycle
through a list so that we will be able
to perform operations on list items so
this is going to handle our empty list
for us and then we'll say something like
write list and then we're going to get
the head as well as the tail that is
going to be passed inside of here or
list item and then we'll just in this
situation we'll just keep it simple and
we'll write out our list to the screen
and then we're going to use recursion
again and in this situation pass the
tail or the remaining items in our list
back into it again and by doing that we
can just go write lists and pass in some
values inside or pass a list and 1 2 3 4
5 or whatever you want it could be
anything and you can see that it printed
out every list item we could also
perform operations on all those list
items as well so here is a whole bunch
of information
in regards to lists and how we can
operate and work with those now let's
take a look at strings now it's very
important to understand name and how
it's going to operate let's jump over
here the terminals is easier name is
going to go and take a string and
convert it into a series of ASCII
characters so let's say we have a random
string it's very important to remember
how this works because we're going to be
using this do a whole bunch of thing and
there you can say there's the ASCII
values for all of those different
characters we're then also going to be
able to convert the ASCII character list
into a string itself just have to put
the X ahead of time right like that and
if you do that you're going to go and
grab this guy paste that inside of there
and you're going to see a random string
pops back out on our screen for us when
we go in here and create a little
function that's going to allow us to
append or join our strings together
let's just call it join string and it's
going to get three strings passed inside
of it make sure you keep those uppercase
there they are
and now to convert it we're going to
call name on these to convert them into
our ASCII characters and we'll store
those in our string list let's do that
for both of these values and we'll just
change this to two and then change this
to two now we can come in and combine
our string lists into a new string list
so we'll go append string list 1 and
then string list 2 and then string list
and this is going to be 3 and now we can
come in and go name string 3 and pass in
string list 3 it's going to convert it
from those ASCII characters back into a
final string and now we'll be able to
commit here and go join string like this
and then we'll just pass in two strings
together another and random string make
sure you put quotes around this
otherwise it's not string and then at
the end of it we'll just throw in the
variable we want the result to be stored
in which is X and you can see another
random string and that's how we were
able to append those strings we can do a
whole bunch of different things here
with strings
I could also come in here and get
different characters out of a string by
just going name and just throw in a name
and store that in list like this and
then I could call N and then put
when there are zero inside of there and
we'll say I want the first which is
going to be the zero index and list for
that and it's going to be stored in F
character like that and if I wanted to
output a character I just go F character
you can see the D came out and it also
went and printed out the entire list and
then finally let's also go and show you
how to get the length of a string just
type in atom length X and there you go
there you go guys there is a heck of a
lot of information about Prolog
definitely enough to get you through any
book and hopefully it made sense out of
a lot of problems that you guys are
having with Prolog up next I'm going to
cover Scala and please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
