asking me questions about ipad apps that
i really like and today i'm going to
show you one that i totally love and
it's called blogs ii it's 299 and no
they're not paying me to do this review
it's a really great way to post
information on your blog if you click on
the lower right hand corner it's
extremely easy to set up everything you
need it allows you to connect to your
flickr account picasso youtube and is
well google image search you can set up
blogs e to work with either wordpress
com or a regular wordpress blog and it
also works with blog or you have that
account so that's pretty much all you
need to know to set up everything and if
you want to actually come in here and
make a post for your blog you just click
on the little plus sign upper right hand
corner and then let's say for example i
want to go to my website you click on
this little button over here and it
opens up a browser right here on screen
and if you want to copy some information
just come right in here select it copy
that information and then it's really
important there's a rich part of the app
and then they have the writing part of
the app well whenever it's a black bar
this is the rich part and that's how you
add images and video and edit text over
here is where i would actually paste in
the information that i want to paste on
the screen so there's everything right
there and then if I'd want to come in
here for example and take these bulleted
items and make them bulleted I just come
in here and select and click right there
now everything's all bulleted I want to
go back to this part of the screen you
can see everything right here if I want
to come in for example and make this
text bold just highlight it it bold now
it's bold and then let's say for example
if I'd want to come in here put this
inside a block quotes very easy to do
click like that now everything's in
blockquote so if I wanted to go and get
an image i go to my flickr account right
like this find an image that I'd want to
take and of course I can take images
from anywhere on flickr just dropped it
right in there you can just click on
this image I could resize it if I'd want
to say I want to line it left come in
here give it at alt text works real easy
very very easy to change the size if I'd
want to do that whenever I'm happy with
it I just click there I could also like
i said if i had a picasa account i could
come in there and get any images out of
there inside a flickr i could also come
in here
and perform any types of searches that I
want and will provide me access to all
them and it automatically seems to get
small images which is kind of smart then
you can also jump over into my youtube
account for example you could also
perform a search just like with all the
other things and get other people's
videos but if I wanted to get my videos
click on my uploads you can stay here
I've spot a scam and again I just drag
it over here till where I want it to
show up drop it in I want to edit the
size of it I can either click like this
or come in here for example and type in
for 25 x 350 or whatever and old and bed
is flash an iframe obviously as I frame
and you could change all these different
things if you'd like to do that turn on
related videos or turn it off whenever
you're done happy with it you just click
like that and everything's fine and
there's all the information whenever
you're done with it just click on this
little button up here in the upper left
hand corner type in your title click on
categories you can either add a new one
if you wanted to do that or you could
take one it's previously had back out
put in tags decide if you want comments
to be allowed you want to publish it now
or publish it later do you want this to
be public or private and then this is
your blog down here whenever you're
happy without everything's set up just
hit on publish click OK and of course
like I said before you can come in here
youtube and also do searches inside of
YouTube you could also get embed code
you can do pretty much anything super
super super fast and you're only
restriction of course will be copyright
restrictions so if I come in here and
type in scam again you can see different
videos that I could drop in there just
as easily as before and if I jump out of
blogs II and jump into my atomic web
browser which in my opinion is the best
browser for ipad then I can jump over
into my website you could see everything
automatically posted right in there and
here's the blog post with the video all
embedded there's the block quotes and
there's everything else so it's a really
really cool apps only 299 but they keep
threatening that they're going to raise
the cost of it so if you like it you
should probably check it out and in
regards to games that I like of course I
got angry birds probably my favorite
game however is filled runners I hate
this one even though everybody likes at
this osmose then you have all the
obligatory news things some I like some
I don't like CNN keeps getting deleted
and then readd it over and over again
but mainly whenever I
use my iPad they use tools like blogs e
I occasionally use the word press thing
that's free but pretty much anything I
think that's good for is commenting or
answering common and then these are the
two best apps for babies in my opinion
so there is my review of blogs Eve any
questions or comments leave them below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
