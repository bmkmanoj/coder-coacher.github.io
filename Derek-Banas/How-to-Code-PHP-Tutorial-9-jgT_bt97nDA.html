9 of my how to code PHP tutorial today
I'm going to show you all of the script
code that would go into creating a
forgotten password script you of course
need to include the code that connects
to the database along with all your HTML
CSS and JavaScript code all of this code
would reside between the body tanks of
your HTML a script asked for an email
address we then check that the email
belongs to a valid user we changed the
user's password and email back does go
to your checks of the form below has
been submitted then it checks that an
email address has been entered with the
empty function if not we warned the
visitor we're checking that the email
address the anode is valid the Cori asks
for the user ID from the table users
where the value is equal to the email
entered the escaped data function cleans
up the information entered for more
information on this function refer to
the previous PHP tutorial with this code
here if there was a positive response
from our query we'll retrieve the user
ID we assign the results using the list
function as if they were an array but we
will only get one result because we only
have one account for each email address
if the email address wasn't found with
our query we alert them to that fact if
the query was successful we create a new
32 digit password for them more
information on what these functions do
refer to the previous PHP tutorial they
basically just create a new random
password for temporary use though this
query updates the record in the database
by setting the new password based on the
record having the value of the entered
email address here what we're simply
doing is just preparing all the
information that we plan on sending
through the email here we're closing
database connection and the overall
script here we're alerting the visitor
that we couldn't change their password
because either a system error occurred
or because they entered the wrong
information and here is the remaining
HTML code that would go into the web
page for this script
and import 10 of my how to code PHP
tutorial I'm going to cover how exactly
you would set up a user account
activation script till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
