2 of my how to make a featured content
slider slash gallery slash lightbox
laughs whatever you want to say in this
part of the tutorial I'm gonna finish up
everything and I'm gonna make this
wonderful thing and this is where I left
you after I created all the HTML and the
JavaScript in the last part of the
tutorial and like I said in this part of
the tutorial I want to fix everything up
so let's jump into the code alright this
is the final part and of course you need
the code a slide or tool that I talked
about in previous tutorial if you didn't
see that definitely watch it and now all
we have to do is style all the CSS so
that everything looks beautiful as I
change things on the right side of the
screen you guys see everything changed
on the left side of screen okay so as
I'm going through the CSS code I see
this insignificant stuff for demo
purposes well what that means to me is
delete it okay so that's gone and pretty
much anytime you ever seen anything
insignificant that pretty much means
delete it then I'm just gonna walk our
way through here and change things as we
do alright go to slide a wrapper this
wraps around everything well I didn't
see no reason for there to be any
padding at all that I personally don't
want to create so I'm getting rid of
that also I want to change the
background color to just a plain black
of course you can change it to anything
else that you would want to change it to
so I got that change down and then we
scroll through and there's really nice
descriptions of exactly what the code
does so that's one of the reasons why I
use the code of slider as a basis for
creating everything well I know that my
pictures are seven hundred sixty two
pixels wide so down here I'm gonna
define seven hundred sixty two pixels
and of course this slider allows for
auto sizing and so forth but for this
point I'm not going to take advantage of
that but you of course could and then
762 here and then down here this is the
code of slider wrapper arrows and the
slider itself they're throwing a margin
in there of 10 pixels well again I don't
want any of those margin so I'm just
gonna get rid of them and then we come
down to arrow styling which is these
guys down here if you can't see this you
can watch this full screen I'm gonna
come in here and make a couple little
changes here and there mainly once again
that I'm gonna set the padding to zero
and I'm also gonna change the width to
zero and then we keep on scrolling down
here and I'm basically as you can see
I'm just getting rid of all these extra
extraneous padding's that I don't feel
that I need and then we scroll down to
this part where it says don't change
anything below unless you know what
you're doing well I'm not certain that I
know what I'm doing but I know I do not
like this part right here where it says
clear:both what this does is that a
limit
the ability to put objects next to the
slider well I of course want that
capability so if I want to put
additional divs on the left or the right
I want that capability so I'm gonna put
it on in there so I guess I know what
I'm doing and then down here where it's
doing the same exact thing I'm also
gonna come in here and say none and then
down here in the final part of the CSS
code that they provide with the slider
you can see here code and nav left
a what that is is in these arrows and
code a now write a well here it has
text-align:center and I don't really see
any reason for that to be there in this
situation so I'm also gonna get rid of
that and I'm sure you know what that
means so I'm gonna put this semicolon in
here okay so now it comes to the part
where I'm actually gonna start styling
things using my own CSS code so I'm
gonna get myself some room alright so as
I look at the left side of the screen at
this mess I'm gonna slowly try to put
everything together here well what I'm
gonna do first is I'm gonna properly
style this left arrow which is this guy
up here and I'm gonna put that in a
position where I want it so I'm gonna go
coda now left a and also what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna file save this and let's
reload it and see what we got all right
you can see a lot of things are coming
together I'm looking pretty sharp so
that's cool all right so I'm gonna move
those arrows in there I know basically
where they are one of the reasons is not
shown on a screen is they're being
hidden okay so I want to position this
relative this is sort of an eyeball
thing from the top I want to come down
320 pixels from the left I want to go
over towards the right 30 pixels I want
to increase my overall font size for
that arrow to 200% and I want to change
or set my color to make sure that it's
white and then to make sure that it pops
up on the screen and you can see it I'm
gonna set my Z index to 100 and load it
and you can see the arrow is right here
you can't right in this general vicinity
alright so now what are we gonna do
basically gonna do the same exact thing
with the right arrow so I'm just gonna
put that in there and I'm gonna go right
and again everything's gonna be 3 or 20
pixels because I want everything to line
itself up however from the left
this guy's gonna have to change since it
was on the right side of the screen I
want to move it towards the left so I
get a give it a negative number in this
situation I'm gonna put 40 pixels in
there and see how that lines itself up
and everything else I can leave exactly
the same now another thing that's going
on here is that these arrows are
actually surrounded by a div and I want
to take those divs and
want to in essence kind of get rid of
them or make them insignificant and this
is the quick and dirty way of doing this
and this is basically what I do whenever
somebody comes to me and gives me an
idea or a job like create a featured
content tool and I need it in three
hours this is kind of stuff that I do
it's not considered exactly a way to do
it but I am almost always on strict time
constraints so this is sort of stuff
that I end up doing left okay so that
takes care of the situation with those
divs on the screen now what do we want
to do now let's file save it make sure
our arrows went the right place okay so
you can see an arrow there and then
there's an arrow over here
well now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
put a hover effect on these guys also
and if you want to put a hover effect on
something basically let's just put that
side there then you go call one and you
go hover and then since I want to do it
for both of them let's put left in here
instead of right colon hover and now I'm
just simply gonna change the color of
the arrow on the screen whenever our
mouse hovers over top of them so I just
type in color which is a reference to
text and I'm just gonna put 39c because
that's used elsewhere inside of this
plugin
it's nice okay so now we come into the
nav thumbs area that's these guys right
here I want to properly position that is
on the screen so I'm going to go after
the nav Tom's div that surrounds all of
my thumbnails on the screen and I'm
gonna define that I want to width of
those four 300 pixels of course this is
gonna change depending upon a number of
thumbnails you have ie 60 pixels display
I'm gonna use inline block again and
what inline block does is it allows me
to set things like the width to the
heights the top the bottom margins and
padding's and all those different things
but it doesn't force a line break like
the regular display block would do so
it's all the benefits of block without
the negative of block that's in essence
what it is and then I want to position
it relative because it's not in a good
position where it is currently and from
the left side of the screen I wanted to
come over 230 pixels and from the top
actually it kind of looks good where it
is I'm just gonna put 5 pixels in sir
reload and you see it's getting in there
pretty good let's see what else we can
do here which one of these thumbnails is
of the class X trig and that's a class
that I was provided by the code a slider
and I just decided to use it because I
don't like changing names especially if
they're embedded inside a code so if I
want to move these around here a little
bit on the screen I can do something
like padding
ten pixels and padding-left
of ten pixels and also what I want to do
with these is I want them to have an
opacity kind of be translucent and
dimmed by default that's so that
whenever they do get emphasis that they
show up better on the screen and I'm
just gonna say show them 50% and then
for Internet Explorer it doesn't have
the opacity so we're gonna have to say
alpha acid II is equal to 50 and that'll
make them all show up grayed out as
default which is good
now of course whenever I have my current
phone when let's file save this make
sure it's looking good and it is it's
looking very very centered but you can
probably not see them because they have
opacity filter on them so what I'm gonna
do is go current thumb right and current
thumb is gonna be whatever is featured
currently up here in this part of the
screen right there in this situation if
it's current I'm going to say opacity is
equal to 1 which is 100% or filter :
alpha opacity is equal to 100% then as
these change everything else is gonna
change and as you can see as an auto
slide Sloan is now highlighted and Sloan
is up here TNS is highlighted and TS is
up there so that's coming together also
well and these guys down here whenever
they change these powered says panel 1
panel to panel 3 panel four let's zoom
in as these guys change they're
automatically changing these thumbnails
up here so eventually what I'm gonna
want to do is get rid of them and why
not just get rid of them right now if
you want to get rid of those so that
those panels don't show up there anymore
it's real easy they were all surrounded
by a div called coda now and if you
don't want them to show up on the screen
it's real simple you just say
display:none I'll say reload hey you can
see they don't show up on the screen
anymore so that's cool and then I just
have to do some basic touch-ups you see
how quickly that came together what I
want to do is do the code of slider and
panel wrapper so I just want to make
sure they're padding bottom is equal to
zero and this is something I'm kind of
doing so that this is more cross browser
because sometimes that little problem
sneaks in there and then if I also want
to make sure the dh2 title doesn't show
up at all see there's a black spot up
side here I can just go h2 dot title
which is its name and I can say
display:none reload and you can see that
that black line went away so I get rid
of that and for the most part I really
don't have to change anything else
inside of this I mean it looks perfect
it does the job but idea I'm gonna do
again for a cross-browser problem chrome
is perfect that's what I'm using here to
look at this but again there's problems
namely Internet Explorer that will mess
up if I don't go in here and say arrows
again this is just a div that wraps
around all the arrows I need to set the
width 762 pixels because that's the
width that I have to find it's on here
and my padding is equal to zero pixels
and then finally my page wrapper which
wraps around everything that's there on
the screen just to be safe I'm gonna
float it left which as you can see you
don't have to do in good browsers but in
bad browsers you sometimes have to and
if I reload it you can see that
everything works absolutely perfect just
the way that we plan before and if you
want to turn this into a lightbox I
provide a link to a tutorial or you can
just pretty much embed this code right
directly inside it and it's at the top
of the screen you can turn the center
well lightbox or it works as a gallery
and hopefully just by watching this
tutorial you know that you can move this
up here real easily
or you can move it on the right side of
the screen or on the left side of the
screen or make the image is bigger or
get rid of this bar here and altogether
and do all kinds of cool things leave
any questions or comments below
