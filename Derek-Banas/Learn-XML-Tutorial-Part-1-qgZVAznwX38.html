complete tutorial on using XML to better
organize your data in the next set of
tutorials I'll completely cover XML and
all of its capabilities XML stands for
extensible markup language I'll get back
to the extensible part in a minute first
you have to understand that XML is no
more a programming language than hTML is
let me repeat that XML is not a
programming language it is a markup
language that is very similar to HTML if
you don't understand HTML stop reading
this article or watching this video and
instead read or watch my HTML w3c
tutorial people really struggle to
understand exactly what XML is and I'm
going to explain it in an unconventional
way that has never failed in the past
I'll explain XML by comparing it to HTM
HTML is used to perform some very
specific and limited tasks for you it
provides web developers with an easy way
to link to their web pages as well as to
the pages of others
it describes the basic structure of the
web page concerning placement tightly
controls how the document is displayed
allows the information on the page to
display across a wide variety of web
enabled devices and it provides
information in a wide variety of media
form HTML defines how elements of the
web page are structured by surrounding
them with HTML tags there are a limited
number of tags available for your use
however since CSS and XML of code on
there are even fewer tags available in
HTML on the previous slide I use two
jargon terms that I'll explain now being
tags an element this is a paragraph tag
it is used to surround paragraphs of
text you define that paragraph has come
to an end by placing closing paragraph
tag after the last character in the
paragraph the closing paragraph tag
looks like this in regards to an element
the whole paragraph tags and all is
known as an element it would look like
this with an opening paragraph tag which
encloses all of the words that go into
the paragraph and a closing paragraph
tag so what makes HTML and XML similar
as well as different
xml is also a markup language and uses
tags to construct a very specific
document structure both also views
attributes in their tags the real
difference is that XML just facilitates
the exchange of data it is not limited
to the web and can be opened in any
software package that recognizes it and
there are many while HTML defines how
text and other elements are displayed in
a browser
XML tells the browser what elements mean
XML doesn't care how the elements are
displayed XML separates the content into
smaller descriptive pieces while HTML
and CSS worry about the presentation XML
also is not limited to any fixed set of
tags or types of elements if you want to
create a tag called customers just
create a customer type you can then
define different tags that further
organize data related to your customers
then you CSS to define the styling of
this new tag XML does one thing really
well it organizes and classifies your
data so that it is usable by a wide
range of devices and software packages
you can think of it as a database of
sorts if that helps you understand it
better the following is true if you get
your tags meaningful names and organize
that information logically XML will
allow you to easily transfer data
between multiple different devices and
software platforms it's kind of linking
Universal Translator advanced XML is set
up to facilitate transfer of information
in multiple different languages and
character sets you can make as many
different types of tags with your
specified attributes as you need the
data is easy to extract from XML because
it's so well organized XML works from
odiously with powerful web technologies
such as HTML cascading style sheets Java
Script databases exception XML data is
easy to understand because of the focus
on organization search engines can
provide the best results when deep XML
definitions have been applied to data
XML also provides web developers with
the ability to change data site-wide
instead of on a page-by-page basis so
what exactly does XML look like well I
have an example down here surrounded by
Y
the first line in every XML file is
called the XML declaration the XML
declaration tells the device opening it
that this file is XML compliant it must
always be the first line the attribute
stand alone in that line when given the
value of yes states that this document
is not dependent on any other file to be
considered complete this file could use
an outside CSS file and still be
considered complete however this is
concerning whether all of the content is
included in the XML file the encoding
attribute will specify what character
encoding was used to create this XML
file this is done so the information is
displayed properly with the second line
of code you're defining the location of
the CSS file you wish to use to style
your XML data you would style X and now
in the same way you style HTML with a
cascading style sheet declaration as you
can see here
you would then break the content down
into categories and sub-categories this
can sometimes be harder than you think
however you must spend a lot of time
thinking about what the key components
of the content are and how you should
structure it to make it useful reading
or watching my tutorial on making data
atomic might help you down the right
path I've included a link here to that
content and xml is broken down into two
groups being data and text intensive
when i talk about that on referring to
information that would normally be found
in a database like a database you would
want to match up this data with a unique
identification number when i talk about
text content and referring to links text
and collections of words after your
opening xml declaration you will define
the root element the root element will
contain all other elements in the xml
file all of your xml markup will lie
between its opening and closing tags all
other elements within the document are
then labeled based off their contents or
the elements that contain them for
example parent elements or any element
that surrounds other elements child
elements are the elements that lie in
the parent elements and sibling elements
are two or more elements that lie on the
same parent element in the next part of
my learning XML tutorial I'm going to
cover xml rules
xhtml well for amoenus and DTD
