my c-sharp video tutorial and this part
of the tutorial we're going to cover
structs classes fields methods
constructor static static classes
nullable types and a whole bunch more
like always all the code and a
transcript of the video is available in
the description underneath of the video
and I have a lot to do so let's get into
it okay
so basic setup again this is visual
studio of course if you are on a Mac you
can use the marin now the very first
thing I'm going to talk about are
Struck's now outside of main and down
still inside my class I am going to
define a struct and a struct is just a
user-defined type that is going to allow
you to contain multiple fields as well
as methods so we are going to create a
struct and we are going to call it
rectangle and inside of this guy we are
going to define some different fields
and a field is just a way of describing
whatever you are creating here here
we're describing rectangles so I am
going to define both a length as well as
a width now you are also going to be
able to create what is called a
constructor method and it will allow you
to set values to these fields that you
have right here and the constructor
method has exactly the same name as your
struct so that will be rectangle and I'm
going to define a double here and length
and I'm going to give it a default value
of 1 and then I'm going to create
another one called W and it will have a
default value of 1 as well now inside of
here I can then take in any passed
values or lack thereof and assign those
to these field values right here and as
you can see a constructor is just a way
to initialize a new struct that is being
created and then like I said we can also
come in here and create methods and I'm
going to create one that's going to
return a double and it's going to be
called area and it's just going to
return whatever the length is times
whatever the width is very simple now up
inside of main now we are going to be
able to
in here and go and create a rectangle
struct so we'll go rectangle now let's
just call this rekt one we're going to
be able to come in here and add values
to it like I said like you saw right
there I did not create one using this
constructor but I'm going to show you
how to do that in a second so I'm going
to be able to go rect one and length and
give this a value of 100 or 200 or
whatever you want it to be and then go
and also define the width and let's make
this 50 and now what I'll be able to do
is come in here and go and print out the
area so we can go area of rect one and
go and get that value and how we do it
is just go rect one and we call our area
method and that's going to output that
on the screen now what we're going to do
also is we're going to create another
rectangle here but this time we are
going to create one using our
constructor and to do so you just go new
rectangle we can pass 140 inside of
there or whatever you want you actually
don't need anything there because we
define default values in our constructor
and another thing that is important to
know is if you assign one rectangle to
another you are going to be setting the
values and not creating a reference so
if we would go something like rectangle
2 is equal to rect one and then change
the value for length in rect one to say
33 or something like that that that is
not going to affect anything that occurs
in rec to just a couple different things
and we can go here now let's go and
print out the length instead so we'll
say rec two links and then let's go and
get the length from rec two and that's
also how you would get values out of a
struct Boop's I want to make sure this
is set to rec too and what we're going
to do here is just verify that rec twos
length is not 33 even though it was
assigned to the value of rect one just
to prove that it's not reference and
it's a value and now if we run this I'm
going to see right here that the area
was calculate
dated for our rectangle and also that
the link stayed at 200
just like we defined whenever the rect
was first created all right so there's a
rundown of how to create a struck how to
define struct a struct constructor
struct methods and how they pass by
value instead of reference and a whole
bunch of other different things and now
what I want to talk about is
object-oriented programming or more
specifically how classes work now a
class is going to model a real world
object by defining the attributes of
that real world object which we are
going to call fields and as well the
capabilities of that real world object
which we're going to call methods now
unlike with structs you're actually
going to be able to inherit from a class
and create a more specific subclass and
as an example let's say we have a class
called animal and we go and hair it from
that and add additional capabilities to
create a canine class and we're going to
get more into that in the next part of
the tutorial right now I just want to
focus in on classes and how you create
one is you come over here to project and
you come down here and click on add
class and that's going to create one and
what I'm going to call this guide is
animal like I just said there before so
let's get rid of that and go animal and
click on add and it's automatically
going to open up all this stuff I don't
need any of this so I'm just going to
get rid of it to clear up of the desktop
all right so the very first thing I'm
going to do here is I am going to show
you how to create the attributes or
fields that all of our animal objects
are going to have and also what I'm
going to do here is I'm going to make
these public right now in this part of
the tutorial I'm going to explain some
things about classes and objects and
then in the next part of the tutorial
I'm going to explain how to improve upon
what we cover here I'm just going to
keep everything very simple right now so
what we're going to say is every animal
object we ever create is going to have a
name and also that it is going to have a
sound that it can make so very very
simple course there's more things an
animal can do but our animals are going
to
just do these two things now also I am
going to be able to create a constructor
which is going to set default values for
fields whenever any objects are created
and there is a default constructor that
is going to be created for every class
that you create but I'm going to
override that right now and I'm going to
say that I want to go public and once
again just like we did with Struck's
the constructor is going to have exactly
the same name as the class name and then
inside of here I'm going to define some
default values so I'm going to say no
name is going to be the default value
for name if it isn't passed in and sound
is going to have a default value of no
sounds now you're going to be able to
create additional constructors as well
and because I defined both these default
values in here I technically don't have
to create them but I just want to show
you the fact that you can create them
and you can overload constructors just
like you're able to overload any other
type of method like we saw previously so
I'm going to go public and animal and
string and with this one I am going to
come in here and define what happens
whenever they pass in only one strings
which is going to be no name in this
situation and how we're going to handle
that now the very first thing I want to
do is I want to be able to refer to my
objects aversion and name but I also
want to be able to refer to this version
and name this attribute up here how I
can do that is I can come in here and go
this name is equal to the name that was
passed inside of it now if this was
called n like that I could just come in
here and call this and and get rid of
this and everything would still work as
you can see there's no errors however I
would prefer in this situation have the
names be a little bit easier to read so
I'm going to leave them exactly like
that and then I'm also going to come in
here and define the default sounds equal
to no sounds because with this
constructor they didn't pass in a sound
all right pretty simple stuff and then I
can handle the situation in which they
passed in both a name and a sound
remember don't need to do these because
I
I hope these default values up here just
doing it just to show you that it can be
done all right so then we can say string
and sound is equal to no sounds like
this and then we'll be able to come in
here and have this B sound as well okay
so a little bit of extra information in
here that's not needed but just want to
cover it just so it makes sense and of
course make sure you have that quote in
there now I said that our objects are
going to define the capabilities for
these different objects we're trying to
model and one of them that would make
sense here is to be able to allow our
animals to make a sound so let's do that
and it's not going to receive any
parameters and it is just going to
whatever is called anyway is going to
come in here and print out whatever the
name of our animal is and says and
whatever that animals sound is and then
if we want to go and get those guys we
can just say name and sound we don't
need to be this part in that situation
we're also going to be able to have what
are called a static fields as well as
methods and these of course belong to
the class and not the objects created
for the class and it's very important to
remember that a static field has the
same value for all objects of the animal
type that means if its value changes for
one animal object it is going to change
for all of them so let's say I want to
keep track of every single animal that
was ever created I'm going to give this
a default value of zero and then I want
to be able to operate or get that value
out of the class so I'm going to say
that I want to create a method that's
going to get the gnome of animals that
were created and also I am going to well
we can just go return and here we can
just say no more animals exactly like
that well one thing we're going to have
to do is go an increment number of
animals inside of our constructor so
that we know that a new animal object
has been created and we could paste that
right and we can
this right here again there's a lot of
repetitive code just because I'm trying
to keep everything very simple next part
of the tutorial I'll show you how to
streamline this stuff a little bit just
want to make it very easy to understand
though ever now what I'm going to be
able to do is come up inside of our main
area or leave this file and go back into
program dot CS and now I can create an
animal object so let's say I want to
create a fox I can zoom in here and I
can go animal and fox is equal to new
animal and this is going to call the
constructor for us and then what I'm
going to go do is say define our
different values so I'm going to say
name is red and the sound is equal to a
wrong that's what a fox sounds like if
you ever did wonder and you can do that
and then throw a semicolon here at the
end of it you'd also be able to come in
here and just create animal Fox and new
animal and then come in and do something
like Fox name is equal to red like that
but I like to do it in the other way
just so that everything is all nice and
neat okay so you can do it that way or
you can do it this way you can do it any
way that you makes you happy now we want
to go and call our static method and
output information on the screen about
how many animal objects have been
created so we're going to go number of
animals and let's say we want to go and
print that out on the screen just to
show you how that static method is going
to work and how you refer to static
methods is you have to put the class
name first and then get numb of animals
and then of course it's a method so we
put the parentheses there at the end and
that is going to print that information
out and if we run this guy let's see
exactly what's going on a number of
animals is equal to one and we would
also of course be able to come in and
let's print out let's refer back to this
guy remember we created a method inside
of here called make sound and it prints
that information out we could be able to
come in here back in the program and we
can just go Fox make sounds that and
it's automatically go
print out the name and the sounds so
read says wrong like that alright and if
we create more animal objects this
number is going to increment as well so
there is an example of a static method
in a static field inside of a class but
I also want to show you how to create a
static utility classes you're going to
do it the same way you're going to go
project and add class and there this
comes up and let's say that I want to
call or create a utility class called
shape math and let's go and create it
and there it is I don't need any of this
stuff
alright so here is shape map and just so
you're aware well anytime you create a
static class I'm going to call this
public static class anytime you create a
static class everything inside of it has
to be a static method or a constant
value so we're going to do is we're
going to create a public static double
and this is going to be called get area
and it's going to receive a shape string
which by default we are going to set to
nothing and then it can receive this is
some time just right now to my head so
it can receive a length which is equal
to zero and it can receive another
length which is also we're going to set
by default equal to zero then inside of
it make sure you have this public here
otherwise you won't be able to call this
from outside of the class itself and
here we can do for an example let's say
we want to do a string comparison and
ignore case we can go string equals and
let's say they pass in rectangle as the
beginning of the string we want to
compare that to shape which is this guy
right here was passed in obviously and
then we want to define our string
comparison and we're going to say
ordinal and ignore case because we want
them to be able to type in any type of
rectangle and if it comes back that that
indeed is true we are going to say
return length one
times length to see just a real simple
example we're also going to be able to
come in here and let's say we wanted to
be able to work with triangles we could
say else if and we could say string and
we're going to do exactly the same
things when let's just copy this equals
to the little blue let's go to get all
that paste that in there and if it comes
back that this is going to be triangle
well then we're going to be able to
handle that as well and here we can just
say return length one times and then we
want to go length two divided by two
of course we can do the same for other
guys here now let's just go copy all
this again if and let's say they type in
a circle that is everything else there's
fun and in this situation where you can
go return 3.14159 times and here is the
power function for our math functions
and you just pass in whatever you want
it to be to the power of two in this
situation and otherwise I'm going to say
else and I'm going to do something like
return negative one just to return
something all right so there you go
there is an example of a static class
and a static method inside of that now
let's jump over into the program and use
it alright so inside of main once again
here we can just say console and right
line and we can say area of rectangle
and we're going to get that from our
static class and to do so you just go
shape math and call the function you
want to work with and I can throw a
rectangle in here like this and then the
length and the width and if we run it
we're going to see that that indeed
works area of a rectangle comes back in
30 okay so there you go static method
static class of static everything now
because I have a little bit of time left
I want to talk about nullable types
now data types by default cannot have a
value of null and why that's sometimes
bad is null is often needed whenever we
are willing to work with databases and
it is very easy to make it so a data
type will be able to hold a value of
null
all you need to do is put the question
mark after it like that and then we
could do something like random number is
equal to null and that's going to be
okay if we got rid of this you're going
to see that that's not possible
so the question work inside of there
like this and then we'll be able to
check for the value of an oldest by
going if you can do it in a couple ways
I'm going to show you two you can say
equal to null like that and in this
situation we could come in and put
something out on the screen
something like ranch num is null and
also let's go and copy this we could
come in and do something like if and
then we'll put an exclamation mark there
remember exclamation mark is going to
turn throughs in two falses and falses
intros here we're going to have random
number and here we're going to command
and go has value which is going to tell
me if this actually has a value or if it
is an all by default and here we're also
going to Reeve random number is null and
we're going to save it and run it and
you're going to see it comes back as
null both times so there you go guys
that is an introduction destructs as
well as classes and nullable types and
all the static classes a whole bunch of
other different things and in the next
part of the tutorial I'm going to get
very heavily into object-oriented
programming and like always please leave
your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
