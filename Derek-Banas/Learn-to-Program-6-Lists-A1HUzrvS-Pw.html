6 am I learn to program series in this
bro to toriel we're going to take a very
close look at lists you're going to see
your very first algorithm and whenever
we take a look at the bubble sort and
we're going to talk about list
comprehensions and a whole lot more if
you haven't watched previous parts of
this tutorial you pretty much have to
and I provide a link here in the video
to the first part so definitely take a
look at those so that we can build our
understanding of how to solve problems
in programming and in the description
underneath the video I have a link to
the transcript and all code in this
video all completely free of course and
I have a lot to do so let's get into it
alright so the very first thing I want
to do here is I want to import some
modules that we will use I'm going to
use the random module as well as the
math module and with lists what we're
going to be able to do is refer to
groups of data with one name because
very often it is very easy and makes a
lot of sense to group like data using
just one name and each item in the list
is going to correspond to a number or an
index and you can think of them like
this so basically you're going to have
boxes inside of this list and this is
going to be the index or identification
number for each piece of data here just
like how people have identification
numbers and products and so forth and by
default the very first item in your list
is going to have the index or the
identification number of zero and the
great thing about Python lists is that
they can grow in size unlike other
comprar gramming languages and they can
also contain different types of data as
you can see here we have strings we have
floats we have int sand we have
characters so let's go in here and we'll
create our very first list I'm going to
call this random list and you're just
going to go equals and then you're going
to throw in the data that you want and
the indexes will be automatically
assigned and there you go so there you
go you know how to build lists now you
could also come in and create a list
with a range and what this is going to
do is populate it using range so we'll
say let's say we want to generate a to
the list and it's going to have the
values
of zero through nine we would just throw
a ten inside of here and there you go
now you're going to have that
automatically created for you another
awesome thing about lists is that you
can use many of the same functions with
them that you've already learned in
regards to how to manipulate and work
with strings because strings are lists
of characters versus a list which can
contain more than just individual
characters so we can come in and we can
combine our lists just by going random
list or concatenate if you want to use
the fancy term one to ten you're also
going to be able to get the first item
inside of your list quite easy so let's
say a random list again and that first
item is going to be marked with the zero
index and you can see that that is
string we're also going to be able to
get the length of the string in exactly
the same way that we were able to get it
with strings just by typing le n and
then random list and there is the list
of there the length of it we're going to
also be able to use slice so let's say
we wanted the very first three items
inside of a list well we we just type in
random list like that and then we would
start at the zero index and get the
first three items inside of there we
would then be able to cycle through all
of these items first three like this and
on top of that we can get the indexes
and have those print out as well so
let's just go and use the format here
with this format and then if we want to
get the index we would just type in
first three dot and index for I and then
outside of there we can just get the
actual item itself and run it you can
see right here prints out the index then
prints out the data that is stored along
with that index you would be able to
also repeat in items so let's say you
wanted to print one of these list items
out multiple times you could do that so
let's just say we want to get the first
item inside of there and have that
printout on-screen three times well we
can do that of course I don't know if
you'd actually ever use that but there
it is anyway
we can also check if and
item is inside of a list so let's say we
wanted to find out if string was inside
of our list we would just type in the
thing we're searching for where you
could put a number there or whatever and
then follow that up with your list
you're searching Florence come back
either as true or as false then once we
know it's inside of there we could come
in and find the index of string for
example in exactly the same way that we
did previously whenever we said index
and then inside here type string inside
of there and there it is index of string
is 0 could also find out how many times
an item is contained inside of a list so
we could say out how many strings and
that is that we come back as one of
course and to do that we go first three
and count and then the specific thing
that we're looking for it comes back as
one as you can see they're changing list
items is also going to be very easy you
just target the index that you want to
change and then you could do something
like a new string and then we could jump
up inside here and copy this paste it
just to see that that did indeed change
and then the final thing I'm going to
talk about is append which is just going
to put another item at the very end of
our list and how we do that is just by
typing in append and then you can type
in whatever you'd like to put inside of
there so that's how that works and if we
do that and we run it you can now see
another's inside of there alright so
those are some of the basic things we
can do with lists and now we're going to
get to our very first problem alright so
what I want you to do is generate a
random list of a random list meaning a
bunch of random values inside of a list
and I want you to generate five values
and I want those values between the
number one and nine and to be able to do
this you're going to have to of course
know how to create a list you're going
to have to know how to create a for loop
and you're going to have to know how to
generate random numbers between the
values of one and nine you can pause the
video and go back and look at the note
in which I talked about random values
right now alright so hopefully you were
able to do that and not that big of a
problem we're going to very first come
in here and generate our list and then
we're going to create a for loop inside
of here and we are going to generate
five values so throw five inside of
there and then we will come in and
create or append each random value into
the number list list and how we are able
to come in and generate random values if
you remember from previous parts of the
tutorial and we want values one through
nine and that's how we do it and then of
course we can come in here and print out
these values I in and then this will be
number list instead and we will print I
and you can see right there we generated
five random values do it again and we do
it again and we can do it again and
again and again and again and actually I
slipped up this should be a ten and
we'll run it again again and now you can
see the nines inside of there
so there you go guys that is our very
first problem hopefully you got it right
and now I'm going to jump in and talk
about the bubble sort
now the bubble sort is just a way for us
to be able to sort a list and it is one
of the very first algorithms more
advanced algorithms that people learn
whenever they're learning how to program
basically how a bubble sort works is
you're going to have an outer loop
that's going to decrease in size each
time that it loops and the goal is to
have at the end of each cycle is to have
the largest number at the end of the
list whenever the outer loop completes
one cycle now if this isn't making sense
don't worry I'm going to create the
bubble sort and I'm also going to show
you exactly how its run so you're going
to have a complete understanding here in
just a couple minutes meanwhile you're
also going to have an inner loop so
you're going to have two loops and it's
going to start comparing indexes at the
beginning of the loop it's going to
check the first item inside of the list
that we're working with and it's going
to see if it is greater than
the next item inside of our list if it
is it's going to swap those values so if
this right here the first item in our
list is a three and this right here is a
one it's going to take the one and store
it in front of the three and put the
three over here then whenever the inner
loop completes the largest number is
going to be at the end of our list and
then we're going to decrement the outer
loop by one all right so let's come in
here and let's create it and then I'm
also going to show you a way of testing
to see and this is going to be a way
that you can test all of your code if
you ever have errors or if you want to
better understand your code I'm going to
go through exactly how we can do that so
the very first thing when I need to do
is create the value we're going to be
decrementing in our outer loop so I want
to get the link of number list actually
let's come in here and let's grab our
number list that we created previously
so flip it up above there it is alright
so there is our number list it's going
to be random five values and this is
what we're going to be working with so I
want to get the length of our number
list and then after that I want to
subtract one from it and the reason why
is they're going the list is going to
use a zero index so the length of this
what I'm doing here is I'm trying to get
each index number for each item inside
of the list and so because this guy
starts at the value of zero I don't need
to you know get the full length that
would give me an array out of bounds
error and I don't want one of those okay
you're going to see here if it doesn't
completely make sense so I said I'm
going to have an outer loop and it is
going to cycle through as long as I is
going to be greater than one then I'm
going to have an inner loop and I'm
going to have that have the variable
value of zero and here is the inner loop
and I'm going to say wow J is less than
I I want to continue cycling through
this guy and if I get a situation in
which
number list J is going to be greater
than number list J plus one what I want
to do is swap those so how do I swap
values well we only to have to
temporarily store one of the values in a
temporary variable so I'm going to say
that I want to store the value that is
inside of the index for number list and
then I'm going to go number list J is
going to be equal to whoops go outside
of there it's going to be equal to
number list J plus 1 and then I can take
number list J plus 1 throw that inside
of there is equal to whatever I
originally stored in temp so that's how
we can swap values in programming very
important concept to understand if
you've never seen that before
now I'm going to throw an else statement
inside of here I'm not going to use it
for this but we will see it later well
actually let's just throw in a print
statement inside here just so that we
can use that later for testing so that
we can see exactly how this is working
and then at the end of my inner loop I
want to increment the value of J so that
we can continue moving from left to
right inside of that loop and then
outside of this I need to decrement I so
we'll go negative equal to 1 and then
after our bubble sort is all done I'm
going to go for K in and I'm going to
print out my number list and we can say
print and K and then let's say that I
want each of these values to be
separated with a comma and a space I
could do that and then finally we can do
a print that's going to give me a new
line and if I run this you're going to
see exactly that it prints out right
here 4 5 5 6 7 run it again 6 7 8 9 and
you can see that it's properly sorting
all of these values but you might have
no idea why it's working that way so
what I'm going to do for you here and
the reason why you get all these weird
spaces there is because of this print
statement right here we're going to come
in here and we're going to throw in some
testing code so that we can see exactly
how the bubble sort works
all right so if I'm trying to figure
this guy out what I'd like to do is as
I'm stepping through here all this is
pretty understandable but I'd like to
see exactly what's going on here
whenever there is going to be a change
to my code so what I want to do is I
want to print out exactly the values for
these two indexes to check out exactly
what's going on and as you program
you're going to do this a lot so I'm
going to say something like is and I'm
going to get the first index greater
than and then get the second one and
then I'm going to call for format and
then I'm going to go number lists and
I'm going to get J and then I'll get the
second item inside of here and that's
just going to be J plus 1 another thing
that I'd like to know is whenever any of
these values are going to be switching
so basically what I'm doing in here
is I'm just thrown in some print
statements they're going to execute
print information out on the screen
whenever some type of change is
occurring with my list so right there
now I know that there is a switch being
taken place in which we're going to be
switching values whereas the next place
well there is a situation in which these
values or this value isn't greater than
that well in that situation I'd like to
come down here and be alerted to the
fact that nothing has been switched and
what else might I want to know well
after this loop has exited I'd also like
to know the current state of my list so
that I can track changes inside of my
list during each of the loops so here
I'll say for K and number list and print
out some information we'll do a print
and we'll print out each of the
individual items inside of there and I'm
also going to go and is equal to and
throw in a column in a space and is
there anything else I'd like to do yeah
I'd like to come in here also and print
a new line and that's going to do that
for me and also I'd kind of like to be
alerted whenever it is going to be the
end of a round of checking all this
stuff and that would be whenever this
guy right here is going to be
decremented down here so I'm going to
come in here also and
to a print and let's put some extra
emphasis on this I'm going to say and Oh
round and now let's run it and see
exactly how a bubble sort works okay so
here is our bubble sort and as we're
going through it you can refer to the
code here on the left side of the screen
the entire bubble sort is right here for
us to look at so the very first thing
that we're going to see here is it's
going to be checking is 5 greater than 6
don't switch that's the logic and you
can see right here 5 &amp;amp; 6 stay exactly
where they are next time through we're
going to check if 6 is greater than 5
this is the comparison it's making right
here well 6 is greater than 5 so we're
going to switch and now you can see the
5 and a 5 and the 6 and how the list has
changed then we're going to check is 6
greater than 1 you can see that 6 has
moved from this position right here up
to this position right here is 6 greater
than 5 and you can see right here that
it's got to the very end the biggest
number on the entire list after one
iteration is at the end of the list and
that is the end of our cycle and then
the cycle repeats it checks these two
values right here then it's going to
check these two values right here then
it's going to check these 2 values right
here and you can see right here it now
got to the end and it knows that 5 is
the greatest value right there and round
is 5 greater than 1 Dada Dada and we
switch that and then you can see that
it's worked its way down it's only going
to be checking these final groupings of
values is 5 greater than 5 don't switch
and then it knows that it got everything
in the proper order and that is the end
of the round and that is the final list
that has been properly sorted and you
can run this numerous different times as
many times as you'd like to analyze
exactly how the bubble sort is going to
work with sorting of your lists so
hopefully now you have a good
understanding how the bubble sort works
and you also have a pretty good
understanding of what to look for in
regards to the code and what types of
information to print so that you can
properly test your code and better
understand exactly how code that you may
not understand is actually working and
now I want to jump in
show a couple more list functions and
then do a couple more problems okay so
this guy up here is going to generate a
list just like he's previously saw and
this is going to print out information
about the list and inside of here I'm
going to show you a couple different
list functions so if you want to sort a
list actually Python comes pre-installed
with the ability to do that and we're
just going to call the sort function
like this and you can see that
automatically sorted everything real
nice we're also going to be able to come
in here and reverse sort these different
items and maybe for homework you could
go in there and figure out how to make
the bubble sort work and reverse hint
hint hint
you're only have to change one character
which is pretty cool and you can see
right here that it did a reverse sort
pretty neat you're also going to be able
to come in here and change a value at a
specific index just go number list and
then you're going to go insert and let's
say that I want in the 5th index which
doesn't exist the value of 10 to be
stored inside of there there you can see
that worked out I'm also going to be
able to come in and remove one of those
items just by typing in remove and
specifically I'm going to go and remove
the value of 10 you can see now it's
gone we're also going to be able to
remove an item at a specific index and
to do that we use pop and let's say I
want to get rid of whatever's in the
second index there went and got rid of
that and I think that's pretty good
rundown of the different functions that
are available to you inside of Python so
now I'm going to talk about list
comprehensions which are really neat and
then finish this off with another
problem now list comprehensions are just
another way for us to construct lists in
interesting ways and you perform an
operation on each item in the list that
is how a list comprehension works so for
example let's say we want to create a
list of even values well we could come
in here create a list called
even lists and then this is the
operation we want to perform on each
item inside of our list and here we are
going to generate the list so in range
and let's say that we want to go in
get 10 values so what this is going to
do is it's going to cycle through all
these different items and the I that the
range is going to generate so this is
going to start off at zero this is going
to give you 0 times 2 which has a value
of 0 the 0 is going to go in the list
then this is going to cycle to 1 2 times
1 and 2 will be the next item in the
list and we can see that indeed this is
going to work in even lists and in
prints and I and run it whoops forgot to
put my eye there sorry about that
run it and you can see it automatically
generated all of these even values
inside of that list so in essence this
is a really cool way for us to take what
would just be a static list which we
generated here with range and multiply
or do any type of calculation on each
and every value that was generated by
range so pretty neat stuff and really
quick one-line ways to generate really
interesting data another thing that's
interesting is let's say we wanted to
perform multiple different calculations
to generate our list
so let's come in once again and let's
create a number list and it's going to
have values 1 2 3 4 &amp;amp; 5 and let's say I
wanted to get the power for each item
inside of that list ^ 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 how would
I do that
well we could just create lists of
values is equal to and then we're going
to go math and power and M is going to
be the value that our range or how we're
going to refer to each item inside of
this list and then we just separate this
by what we what different calculations
we want to perform so throw that in
there throw that in there
and we'll just change this to three and
we'll change this to four and we'll move
this over so we can see what we're doing
here and then right here after this
bracket we could actually go down to the
next line if you'd like to keep
everything nice and new and here is
where we're going to cycle through each
of these items so each numbered list
like that and then we could of course
come in here and generate our for loop
for I in number list and print out I and
then throw in a new line as well and we
would run this whoops and this is going
to be list of values and run it and you
can see that it automatically performed
those calculations on each of those
items and created a list of lists so
each of these is a list item on its own
which is really nice meaning we can
create what are called multi-dimensional
lists or just simply lists of lists just
like I called them here previously and
in regards to that let's say we wanted
to generate a 10 by 10 list of lists we
can call this a multi D list and how we
would do that is let's say we wanted
each of the lists inside of the list to
have a value of 0 we could do it like
that and we said that we want ten of
them so there were those go and then
we'll just say for I in range and throw
10 inside of there so that's how we can
create a 10 by 10 list and we would be
able to come in and change values in
this multi-dimensional list just like we
did with our regular lists we're just
going to stack these boxes so let's say
we wanted the 0 and 1 I'm going to show
you an example exactly how these indexes
work here in a moment we could throw the
value of 10 inside of there and of
course we're also going to be able to
refer to those items in exactly the same
way 0 and there's one and run it and you
can see there is the 10 we threw inside
of it and you'd also be able to likewise
be able to get any of the different
items that are stored inside of here
like that and of course that's going to
come back at 0 because up here we said
we want a 0 inside of
one of those guys so let's take a closer
look at a multi-dimensional list and
I'll set it up so that you'll be able to
see how the different changes in the
index values are going to affect the
different parts of our multi-dimensional
list so I'm going to come in here and
I'm going to create a list I'm going to
do it exactly the same way I'm going to
have everything populated with 0 at the
very beginning and I want ten of them
and for I in range and I want to
generate ten of those guys so that's
going to create the list for us and now
what we're going to do is populate it so
I'm going to say for I in range and I'm
going to start one and go to ten
actually it's take this eyes we can just
leave this at ten just to keep
everything nice and simple and then what
we'll do is throw another loop inside of
it to change the second value inside of
here so we'll say range and ten and now
it's time to populate these different
list items inside of here so we'll go I
and we'll go J and then if we want to
see what is inside of there it's quite
easy all we need to do is throw what I
and J as values are inside of there so
we'll say format and I and J and then we
can jump outside of here and print all
of this information so for I in whoops
range throw a ten inside of there like
that and then for J and range throw a
ten inside of there like that and now
we'll print out all the individual
pieces and then you'll have a better
understanding of exactly how the
different changes in the index values
are going to affect the different places
inside of our multi-dimensional list do
like an end and then let's say we want
to separate that with like an or just to
show how those blocks are set up and
then a print statement for a new line
and if we run it you can see exactly how
they're structured see here is our
multi-dimensional list actually let's go
in and let's make it a little bit
smaller let's change this to four and
change this to four and this the four
this is what happens when I ride just
right coat out of my head and don't
script things sometimes get a little bit
unwieldy alright so this is exactly how
these are going to be structured in the
upper left hand corner of our
multi-dimensional list you can see that
the indexes are 0 and 0 and then as the
second item inside of our list
increments up it's going to move across
into the individual columns of the row
we then want to target this part down
here we then increase the very first
part of the multi-dimensional list and
so forth and so on
and that's how we're able to create
matrices and be able to store boxes
inside of boxes but just remember that's
what these are this is just an
identification value to indexes for a
box inside of another box and that
brings us to our final problem of the
day what I want you to do is I want you
to generate a multiplication table and
what do I mean by that I want you to be
able to generate all of this code right
here so we're going to create a
multi-dimensional list and inside of
this multi-dimensional list you're going
to have each of the values of multicast
so this is going to be your one row your
two row your three ro dah dah dah the
whole way through nine and you should
have no problem doing that based off of
the previous little examples I gave you
especially with the last one so you
could pause your video right now and go
and create that otherwise I'll give you
a couple hints basically you're going to
need two for loops to fill the cells in
your multi-dimensional list and that's
actually just about enough information
if you want even more information I'll
walk you through step by step here let's
say what you're going to need to do
first is create the multi-dimensional
list and then the next thing you're
going to have to do is increment with
one of your four loops so increment with
outer four then inside of this you're
going to have another one increment with
inner for your that of course
going to have to assign the value to the
cell for each multiplication and then of
course you're going to have to output
all of your data and you're going to
output your data pretty much using the
same for loops and just changing this
guy right here into instead a piece of
code that's going to output the
individual pieces of your
multi-dimensional list all right so now
I'm going to show you how to do it so
we'll just come in here and we'll go
multiplication table and how we created
a multi-dimensional list as zero and we
said that we want to generate ten of
them because we want to go and print all
those out on our screen and then we're
going to say for I in range and this is
going to give us the whole way through
nine then down inside of here we're
going to have a for loop that's going to
cycle through these values I in range
one through ten and then you're going to
have another one for the second part of
the multi-dimensional list and this one
is going to have J everything else here
is going to be precisely the same down
here we're going to then come in and
store our value inside of it so we'll
just go I and J and the value we're
going to store is going to be I times J
and then we'll come down here and I'll
put our data so we'll say just go for I
in range and we'll do one through ten
again create another for loop for I in
range and one through ten and here we
just want to print out the information
that we have inside of here so we'll say
multible and I whoops
make sure you put I inside of there and
J and then I'll throw an end statement
on here and let's say we want to
separate everything with a comma and at
the
each one of those throw in a new line
and there you go that is all the code
that is required and if we run it you're
going to see that it just printed the
nines row and why is that actually
you're gonna see here pycharm is giving
us a little hint variable I already
declared in for loop or with statement
above uh-oh that means I need to come in
here and change the I into a J and that
error message goes away and now let's
run it again and there you can see
here's the ones column two is three is
the whole way through nine and there is
our multiplication table so hopefully
you guys got that right hopefully you
learned a lot in this tutorial if not
please leave all of your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
