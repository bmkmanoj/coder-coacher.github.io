how to code PHP tutorial this is part
two in a series of currently seven
videos in this tutorial I'm going to
cover math functions arrays if
statements conditional and logical
operator here's a listing of most often
used math functions available in PHP we
have the absolute value we have the
ceiling which returns the value of a
number rounded up to the next highest
integer then we have a function that
will return e to the value of x floor
returns the value of a number rounded
down to the next lowest integer is nan
returns true if the value passes a
number and false otherwise LCQ value
returns a random number between the
values of zero point zero and one point
zero obviously if you want a larger
random number you would just multiply
your random number of times that random
max returns the number with the highest
value of the two numbers you send it
minimum does the opposite of max power
returns the value of X to the power of Y
round returns the value of x rounded to
the defined number of decimal places
square root returns the square root of a
number and there are also many inverse
trigonometric functions if you don't
know what that means don't worry about
it and if you do then you will know how
to use them an array is a variable that
can hold multiple separate values if you
think of a variable as a box that holds
one value and array is like a big box
with many boxes inside of it all with
their own values inside of them arrays
are structured as a series of key value
pairs the key part is like a note on the
box that says underwear in the case of
an array you could give each box a name
like underwear and other things like
that but by default the first value you
enter has the key value of 0 and
proceeds upwards numerically you assign
a value to an array like this as you can
see what I'm doing here with this array
name dogs I'm assigning the word German
Shepard to it now the fourth box in the
array has the value German Shepard
remember the boxes start with a value 0
that is why the third box is actually
the fourth box get it down put the value
of an array you can just simply use the
echo function here followed by that
array
name and whatever value you want to have
put that's it
you can cycle through and output the
values i'm gona ray with the for each
launch and here is an example of using
the for each function the for each
functional will keep adding one to the
value of the array and then the echo
function prints them to the screen what
this little block of code does is the
for each function will keep adding one
to the value of the array and then the
echo function prints them to the screen
in this example the name of the array
dogs is followed by the keyword as and
then the variable you want to
temporarily use to hold the current
value being issued by the array dog name
when placed in the for each function
every statement called between the
opening and closing curly braces will be
called you could also create arrays of
data inside of other arrays let us say
you want the dogs array to be part of
your animals array this is how you would
do that here we assign the keys to two
arrays named dogs and cats and then pass
them into the array named animals if I
wanted to echo a value from the dog's
array I just do it this way follow echo
then the variable animals followed by
dogs and then three within the brackets
this would pronounce the value German
Shepherd that I assigned to it above it
is common to use arrays and strings
together so here are a few commonly used
functions the explode function turns a
string into an array you define what
character in the string you want to
separate the values that will be
inserted into the array then also pass
the string to separate the separator is
normally a comma space tab semicolon or
other whitespace or punctuation mark the
implode function turns an array into a
string here you define what you want to
separate the Raye values that will go in
the new string the separators used are
the same as I just described above with
the function explode it is also common
to sort your array values just
understand that when you do your keys
will stay the same and just the values
will be sorted that is why most people
allow their key
to remain the default numbers like I
described above the sort function will
sort the values in ascending or
alphabetic order while the are sort will
sort the values in the opposite
direction every language provides
programmers with the capability to react
differently based off of different
conditions with the PHP engine you
handle conditions using either that
if-then-else or switch statements this
is the format of an if condition handler
this if statement asks if a certain
condition is true perform all the
actions contained between the curly
braces if they are not skip all the
actions and tests to see and if another
condition is true and if that condition
is also false then perform the last set
of actions here is a real-world version
of the if statement here we're checking
if the variable age is greater than 45
and if the variable age is less than 65
if both of these are true we will echo
out to the screen you are a baby boomer
and so for our ten different operators
you can use in PHP to test for different
conditions here is the list you have the
equal to not equal to greater than less
than greater than or equal to less than
or equal to here we have the Nault
logical operator if it is placed before
a condition it'll provide the opposite
results the conditional five greater
than two would return a value of true
and then the not operator would convert
the result to the value of false the
logical and logical operator is used to
perform more complicated comparisons
used to test that two or more conditions
return a value of true for the logical
and to return a value of true the
logical or operator is also used to
perform a complicated comparisons it's
used to test that one or another
condition returns the value of true if
either or both of them return the value
of true then the logical war will say
that the logical operation is true these
conditional and logical operators are
used not only for if statements but also
with switch
or while and do-while statements as you
will see in part three of my how to code
PHP tutorial I'm going to cover the
switch for a while do-while and how to
include files in your PHP scripts till
