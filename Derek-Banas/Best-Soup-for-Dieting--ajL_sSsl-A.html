time for many people but this is
specifically for Beth who requested this
video for recipes that will help you
lose weight that people have never heard
of today I'm going to show you how to
make leek soup which is extremely
healthy and extremely good tasting the
reason why people don't eat leaks is
because they are kind of hard to clean
basically what you do these are leaks by
the way you don't know what a leak is
and you can get them at most grocery
stores cut off the top of the leak first
off and these guys are absolutely
covered in mud but leaks are what what
are called diuretics and I think you
know what that means however I'm not
talking about a really explosive
situation here I'm talking about
something little just kind of ease the
mine and you can see here i hope the
dirt that's all over the leeks leave
this is the hard part of the recipe
cleaning the leeks everything else
afterwards is extremely easy now of
course you want to chop the top off the
leak and I can't even explain how
extremely delicious this soup is then
after you chop the tops off you want to
split the leak down the middle like so
I'm using for leaks here and then
discard all the extra leaves then what
you want to do is take the leeks and
wash them in a sink with water it's not
as bad as it seems
and for the most part you have to clean
the most exterior of leaves that's where
you're going to have your mud issues and
I'm of the opinion that most americans
are obese not because they're lazy like
a lot of people say but it's simply they
won't take the time to make themselves
good food and food the taste so
extremely good and is so extremely low
in calories you can eat this soup you
can eat as much of this soup as you
could possibly want to just have to take
a couple minutes to make yourself a good
meal believe me you we have you did and
I lost 80 pounds in five months by the
way by eating food like this I look
specifically for delicious meals that
were very very low in calorie and then
if it had added benefits such as the
tire right again I also took that into
consideration okay now that you got your
leaks all clean which it took me I timed
it about three minutes to clean all the
mud off of these leaks then you want to
shock your leaks up like this nice
pieces and just chop them up and don't
worry about shopping them up a ton
because all of this stuff is going to be
blended in a blender and that's pretty
good right there got some the bigger
pieces in there but I just basically
wanted to chop it up so that everything
was fairly even you're also going to
need chickpeas this is 15 ounces normal
size can and to make this healthier I
like to take them out of the can and
brush them off water to get some of the
sodium off of the chickpeas or garbanzo
beans depending upon what you want to
call them then I heat up a big pot and
add about a tablespoon of olive oil and
I'm like garlic so this is about two
tablespoons of garlic put that in the
bottom and it's gone high by the way and
then I get my leeks and dump them
in the pot he's going to shrink down and
you want to leave the top off the pot of
course and then just let the leeks cook
in this pot until they become tender and
this is what the leaks will look like
after you cook them in a pan for about
five minutes now you want to add this is
potato and I'm just by microwave this
for three and a half minutes in a
microwave after I peeled it of course
and then I want to take my chickpeas and
dump them also into the pan then I want
to stir this up again we're blending all
this so we don't need to worry about
chopping things up or anything like that
then this mixture after you've stirred
this up and let it cook here for about a
minute and a half I want to add two cups
of chicken stock this is homemade
chicken stock that's for another video
you could of course get a low calorie
low sodium chicken stock and use that
instead or use even a vegetable stock
that's not going to matter now we're
going to let this simmer for 15 minutes
occasionally checking it and stirring it
okay after i boiled or simmered whatever
you want to call it i have the oven on
high for 10 to 12 minutes the soup is
essentially done I just need to dump it
into a blender
dump it all down inside of there and
then you want to blend it
and the other chicken stock that I had
is actually to be used to thin the soup
it's too thick
you
and I'm moving I'm moving the blender by
the way
and that for me is the perfect
consistency I wish you could taste this
I know it looks like creamed spinach or
something it is absolutely to die for
and this was a key staple in my diet in
which I lost 80 pounds in five months
and I instead of most of the Guru's like
to provide this information for free to
actually help people instead of charging
for it so if you have any questions or
comments leave them in the comments
