your comments and watching all of your
videos and I have some answers on why
your diets are eventually going to fail
first let me prove to you that I know
what I'm talking about
in November of last year I've weigh 248
250 pounds whatever you want to
categorize it as I now weigh 171 and I
pretty much met that weight within six
months of first dieting today I'm gonna
tell you how I did it and guess what you
don't have to buy exercise equipment you
don't have to buy supplements you don't
have to pay me anything I'm gonna tell
you everything right now in this video
this is me last year November at 248
pounds and this is what I look like now
one mistake you're making is in reading
in comment section how you hate the
exercise and how it's causing you a lot
of pain dieting is a lifestyle change if
you plan on keeping the weight off long
time so what you need to do as
psychologists say is find a positive
replacement in my diet I said to myself
positively I will give up fat
cholesterol sodium and only eat
low-calorie foods my positive
replacement was that I could eat as much
food as I wanted to as long as it fit
those other requirements C+ replacement
many of you guys are trying to give up
multiple things at one time
don't do this focus on one if you're
trying to lose weight or be healthier do
not try to give up pop and cigarettes
and computer games and everything all at
one time just focus on losing the weight
you have to understand the mind cannot
process a negative what I want you to do
now is try as hard as you can to not
think about pizza see you can't do it
your mind just cannot not process
something so you have to stop telling
yourself to stop thinking about food
what that's doing is making you think
about food now I'm going to show you how
to figure out how many calories you
should eat to lose weight you could tell
them really serious I actually drew
myself to demonstrate this you hold your
arm up like this you're gonna feel two
bones
ones there and there's another bone
right here what you want to do is
measure the distance between those bones
exactly as I drew this line based off of
that you'll be able to figure out your
frame size and now I'll explain exactly
how to calculate frame size based on
that measurement if you look on the left
side of your screen you're gonna see
Heights and on the right side of your
screen you're gonna see a elbow
measurement now I am 6 foot 3 and my
measurement was 3 inches and 1/4 of an
inch so that means I have a large frame
because if you look in the 6 foot 2 6 3
category it only goes up to 3 and 1/8
inches so I have a large frame if your
measurement fits into these requirements
that means you have a medium size frame
and if the measurement is less than that
that means you have a small frame and
this is the information for men and here
is the information for women of course
you can hit pause and here I'm gonna go
through the ideal weight for women based
off of whatever your height is and
whatever your frame size is so you're
gonna know what weight to shoot for and
here's additional weights for women
based off of height and frame and based
off of that information we now know the
required number of calories a woman a
stuff of height and frame size would
need to consume to maintain their weight
and it would fit like so for example if
you're 4 foot 10 your required calories
would be twelve hundred and sixty to
fourteen hundred and twenty the minimum
calorie level was found by multiplying
0.55 or 55% to the smallest required
number of calories to maintain weight
I'm gonna give an example of this in a
minute if it's confusing but you would
never want to go there because you're
flirting with starvation mode and I'm
gonna be talking about that a little bit
instead I actually consume 70 percent of
my required calories throughout my
entire diet and you should probably want
to shoot towards 70 to 65% but you also
want to pay attention to a laries loss
through exercise since I didn't exercise
I need to worry about that and here is
the same information in regards to ideal
weight for men and again find the
minimum amount by multiplying I would
say 0.7 times the smallest weight level
based off of your height and your frame
size and you can see all that
information right here and this is
information that is specific to men and
here's me as an example of six foot
three my elbow measurement was 3 and 1/4
inches so what that tells me is I
require 2330 calories to maintain my
current weight so I aim it
assuming 0.55 times 23 30 or 1282
calories per day again if you decrease
the amount of calories through exercise
this number is gonna change and on top
of that I wouldn't multiply at times
0.55 that's the bare-bones minimum I
would instead shoot for about point
seven point six five at the absolute
lowest in regards to starvation mode if
you eat less than 55 percent of your
required calories to maintain your
current weight you will go into
starvation mode what does this mean your
body will start powering itself by
devouring lean tissue and muscle mass it
will also start to store fat on top of
that it'll start turning carbs and sugar
into fat you absolutely have to weigh
yourself and this is the reason why if
you've been heavy your entire life every
time you look in the mirror you're gonna
see yourself as fast a psychological
thing it's hard to get over so do not
starve yourself you must eat this
minimum amount of calories also on top
of that a lot of you guys are
restricting your sugar and carbohydrate
intakes this is also bad your body
easily burns healthy sugars such as are
found in fruits and vegetables the
second easiest thing for your body to
burn are carbohydrates so think about it
this way in relation to starvation mode
sugar is burned like gasoline fat burned
like a candle and lean muscle mass is
actually burned like a log if you
continue down this path you'll get sick
and your diet will fail so what
specifically do you need to avoid in
your diet first msg without a doubt msg
is put in foods to make terrible nasty
food all your tastebuds into thinking
it's high protein and healthy a
byproduct of msg is within an hour to
two hours actually stimulates hunger and
makes you hungry whenever you're not
hungry
so avoid msg you also want to avoid high
fructose corn syrup high fructose corn
syrup which is hard for me to say it is
a sweetener that's put into food because
it's cheap and cheaper than sugar what
high fructose corn syrup does in
comparison sugar is whenever you consume
it which it contains tons of calories it
does not tell your body at any point in
time that you're full like sugar does so
avoid high-fructose corn syrup a lot of
you guys are also consuming as much
protein as you can you don't want to do
this there
my high protein diets were created is if
you consume a large amount of protein
it'll stimulate HGH levels in your body
which will cause your metabolism to
speed up by consuming large amounts of
protein and avoiding carbs and sugar it
forces your body to burn fat but this is
not maintainable high-protein diets
cause a lot more problems in their worth
so stop trying to increase your protein
levels I also hear a lot of talk about
eating healthy fat there's no such thing
avoid eating fat under all circumstances
believe me you'll get enough also you
guys are worrying about your cholesterol
intake avoid cholesterol under all
circumstances if you want to succeed
believe me again you'll get enough
everybody thinks you need to consume
2,000 calories as I preview literally
I've shown that it's not true either
everybody thinks you need to lower your
carb intake again wrong whole-grain
carbohydrates are one of the healthiest
things you could possibly consume what
you need to do instead is avoid
carbohydrates that are enriched or
processed also you need to weigh
yourself because how are you gonna know
you're not losing weight it's positive
reinforcement so weigh yourself please a
lot of you guys are also eating lots of
nuts
the healthiest nut that exists are
almonds they are 79 percent fat remember
fat equals bad don't eat nuts everyone
out there is exercising insanely I never
exercise and I didn't exercise during
this entire diet so you don't need to
unless you enjoy and in fact women's
bodies are set up to go into starvation
mode for between two to three weeks once
they start excessively exercising so
women specifically are going to be
penalized if they try to go through a
high exercise regimen and diet also
there's a lot of talk about good oils
all oils are fat if you want to eat
healthy roast or bake your foods instead
of frying them they taste delicious also
hear a lot of talk about cleansing don't
cleanse it'll throw you into starvation
mode you also especially if you're
exercising like a maniac need to consume
a large amount of water many people
think they're hungry when in fact our
bodies are saying they're thirsty not
hungry so if you're starting to feel
hungry
don't reach out and eat something
instead drink a glass of water I also
have continually heard people say don't
drink coffee
I drink coffee like a madman that's why
I'm not shaky all the time so what
exactly should you eat you can see here
what you should be snacking on these are
extremely healthy foods that are very
high in fiber and delicious you want to
make a vegetable taste a lot better
roasted in the oven for 25 minutes at
425 but you want to really focus in on
high fiber low calorie low fat low
cholesterol and low sodium here's an
example meal plan I followed whenever I
first started dieting this is my exact
breakfast and below this video you'll
see a link to a ton of recipes this is
my 1,500 calorie day and you can see
here what I ate for lunch
I eat huge amounts and I was normally
never able to actually eat all of this
food because it was so overloaded with
food that makes you feel full and also
it was very very high in fiber while I
was eating I made sure I spent a lot of
times chewing also a big tip and here's
what I ain't for dinner you also want to
monitor everything you eat My Fitness
Pal is an iPhone iPod application they
also have a website and it's free go
there get it monitor everything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
