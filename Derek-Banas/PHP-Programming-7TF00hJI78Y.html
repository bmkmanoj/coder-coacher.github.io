have asked me to do a PHP tutorial like
I did with JavaScript and Java and so
here it is in this tutorial I will teach
pretty much the entire PHP language in
one video so I have a lot to do so let's
get into it
okay so this is going to be the basic
format for this video tutorial over here
on the Left I have a basic text editor
over here on the right I have Google
Chrome and it is going to run everything
for us now what I did ahead of time was
I went and created a basic HTML file
called enter info dot HTML and right
here you can see I have the PHP script
that we're going to be making and it's
going to process meaning the PHP script
is going to process every bit of
information that is in this basic HTML
file so when the user comes over here
and enter some information like that and
clicks on submit it's going to jump over
to learn PHP dot PHP and it's going to
execute everything and all I have here
basically is just a form and I'm going
to be using the post message which is
going to send the data input into this
form via a separate message first is
using the get method which is going to
send the data entered by appending it to
the end of the URL I am proposing that
everybody watching this video knows HTML
but if not I have a link in the
description underneath the video to my
HTML tutorial you learned HTML in about
15 minutes with that one then I have a
basic table here and name and address
and the ability to input this
information and then at the very bottom
here I have a submit button so very very
simple so let's start writing the PHP
code okay so as you can see here it is
still HTML even though we're creating
PHP files here and you basically just
embed PHP code between tags and those
tags would be PHP just like this and
then it would end at the bottom with a
question mark and a closing tag and it's
just as simple as that now one thing to
remember is the PHP code that you write
here in this file isn't going to show if
the user tries to view source and very
very important you're going to have to
put a semicolon to finish every PHP
statement now of course if you have
multi-line comments you're not going to
have to put a semicolon after those and
also you have single line comments and
also there's another
line comment which is just the number
sign so just another okay so those are
the different types of comments you can
use inside a PHP now if you use the PHP
statement echo it is basically just
going to output on to your screen
whatever you put between the quotes so
you could say something like data
processed and then put a closing tag
here and then a semicolon at the end and
that's going to output that on the
screen let's just come over here hit
submit and you can see data processed
shows up right there now one thing to
note here is I'm using double quotes
here and basically what double quotes
are going to allow you to do is use
escape sequences so for example if I
want to put double quotes inside of here
around data processed I'd have to come
in here and put a backslash and a double
quote and another backslash and a double
quote and you can see that those showed
up here on the right side of the screen
if however I was going to use single
quotes I would not be able to do this
because single quotes ignore escape
sequences and you're also not going to
be able to print out variables directly
inside of this statement with the echo
I'm going to show you that here in a
moment let's do something right here out
of the gate that's a little bit
interesting just to show you how cool
PHP can be let's go and print out all
types of date information onto the
screen let me go date default timezone
set and I'm going to use here the
coordinated universal time which is a
standard to use and then what I'll be
able to do is come in here and use all
of these different symbols to define
exactly what type of date I want to
print out on our screen so let's just
come in here and let's just create this
basically what I'm going to do is I'm
going to use echo again and then I'm
going to call date and let's say that I
want to put the hour well you can see
right here our 12-hour format so I'm
going to put that there I'm going to put
a colon inside of it then I'm going to
want minutes which is I as you can see
above seconds and then you would be
milliseconds I could then type in a for
lowercase am and p.m. I could put a
comma inside of there then put an L for
the full text for our day capital F or
full text for the month day of the month
and then if I wanted to put a suffix on
it like 1st 2nd 3rd I just put a capital
S there put the Year in with a capital y
and then an e will print out
actual time zone that I'm going to use
which is going to be UTC close that off
with another single quote and there you
can see date processed and then it's
going to have the exact time in
milliseconds p.m. Saturday August 19 is
2014 UTC I just want to show you real
quickly how to do that and of course all
the code that we have here is available
in the description underneath the video
now whenever we look back at our HTML
here you can see that I have the names
defined for username street address and
city address
well they enter that information how
exactly am I going to be able to go in
and grab it and use it inside my PHP
code well it's rather easy I'm going to
put a dollar sign in here which is how
you start all of your variable names
which is where you're going to store
your information I'm just going to call
this user's name then because the HTML
used the post way of passing information
I'm going to type in dollar sign
underscore post put a bracket and then
I'm going to type in the username which
is the name that was defined in the HTML
code and then go write like that and
that's going to be able to get me all of
that data that was passed in there quite
easily and then I could get the street
address and the city address in exactly
the same way now it's very important to
understand how to define your variable
names basically they're all going to
start off with all their signs and then
the very first letter here is going to
have to be a letter and then they're
afterwards you're going to be able to
use letters numbers or underscores to
define them another thing that's
important is users name is going to be
different than user's name with a
lowercase n because variable names are
case sensitive and another thing that
might be really weird is whenever you
create a variable it is automatically
going to be given a data type whenever
it receives a value and all the possible
data types are either going to be
integers which are going to be whole
numbers without decimal numbers
afterwards floats which are going to be
decimal numbers strings which are going
to be just a series of characters
boolean x' which have the value of true
or false arrays or objects and arrays or
just boxes inside a box there's a whole
bunch of different items inside of those
and we'll get more into that later on
the tutorial and if you're wondering by
default a variable will get the value of
null so that pretty much covers
everything about variables
and let's go and echo some more
information out on a screen like our
user's name that the users type in there
so you just go users name just like that
and their chose up now you can do
something called string concatenation so
let's say I wanted to put a break after
every single one of these strings that I
print on the screen which would be very
useful and very helpful and be able to
see everything I could then just put a
period inside of here followed by
whatever I went to show on our screen
then let's say I want to do street
address and city address make sure you
have a lowercase a right there and then
save this jump over here and there you
can see it printed everything out on the
screen and also put the line breaks
inside of there another thing you can do
with text is use what's called a here
dock syntax which is basically let's
just come in here and create a basic
string what you could do is have your
string go over multiple lines and all
you're gonna have to do is put these
little sideways carrots inside of here
then you're going to have to define
pretty much anything that won't show up
in your string then what this is going
to allow you to do is go the customers
name is and just keep going and then you
just type in users name and they live at
and then we type in street address in
city address and you can throw your
break statements in there if you'd like
and at the very end you have to make
sure you do this make sure there's no
white space before this and then you're
going to type in EOD exactly what you
have it above and then you can just come
in here simply and go echo and string
there you can see customer's name is
Derrick and they live it 1 2 3 main
street in Derry come and get rid of some
of this stuff another thing you can do
of course is to find constants and they
are pretty much exactly what you think
they are values that cannot be changed
so if I want to put PI inside of here
there we go and then I would simply be
able to come in here anytime I want and
go echo the value of pi is and then
uppercase and you would want to use
uppercase with all your constants there
you can see that it printed out just
like that of course like every other
programming language you're going to be
able to do all types of different forms
of arithmetic I'm going to show you
other different ways to print stuff out
here on our screen here in a moment so
let's say that I wanted
a printout on screen whatever five plus
two is equal to that period inside of
there I'm going to go five plus two now
let's do this for a whole bunch of them
so let's do a subtraction and let's do a
multiplication which is star and it's do
a division and modulus which is going to
return the remainder of a division and
of course change these guys over here as
well
and then throw it in another break
statement another thing you can do also
is let's say you wanted to cast to an
integer so let's come in here and we do
this division here it's going to come
back two and a half of course because
five divided by two is two and a half
let's say however I wanted it to show up
as an integer or cut off the decimal
place I would just put integer inside of
these brackets like that and of course
you're going to be able to do that with
all the different data types so if you
wanted it to show up as a change from an
integer to a float or a double for
example which is just the number with a
decimal place you would just type in
double inside of here instead but we're
going to leave this integer you could
also do the same thing with string of
course just type string inside of there
and there you can see all of our
arithmetic show up there on the screen
right there and you can also see this
doesn't show to point five it just just
to another thing we can do is let's come
in here you can use a shortcut so let's
say that we have a random number and
let's just give it the value of five and
we want it to add five to random number
and then output it on our screen plus
change the value of random number well
we could just come in here and go random
number and then plus equal five or we
can change that to ten just so it's not
confusing so what this is going to do is
take the value of random number which is
five add 10 to it and then save it back
to random number and there you can see
it shows 15 on the screen and of course
you're going to be able to do that not
only with the plus but you're also going
to be able to do it with the minus and
multiplication and division and modulus
so those are some shortcut ways to add
numbers to themselves another shortcut
we can have here is we can auto
increment by one very very easily
there's actually two ways to do it
though so let's go in here and let's
just do a random number is equal to and
show that on our screen and let's just
go plus plus random number and I'll
throw a break statement in there as well
make sure it's between quotes and then
we're going to use the other way to auto
increment or add one to a value in a
shortcut way we're going to put the plus
plus after it and we can take that right
there and you're going to see here in a
second the difference between the two of
them and there you can see it now
whenever you put the plus plus before
the actual variable name what that's
going to do is it's going to add one to
it immediately and that's the reason why
I chose on the screen if Oh wherever you
put the plus plus after it's going to
use the original value for random number
in whatever you're doing and then after
it's done using it it's then going to
add one so if you would then do an echo
down here like that now it's going to be
seven and there you can see it is seven
other thing is kind of interesting is
you can kind of make either create a
reference to a variable or make a copy
of a variable however you want to look
at it so let's say I wanted to go
reference to number I could then go
equal to put an ampersand inside of
there and then point at random number
right like that I could then go into
random number and give it the value of
100 and then come down here and call
echo again I'm going to put single
quotes in here this time because I don't
want the value for my variable to show
up here in here I want the actual name
to show up inside of there so that's why
I'm using single quotes this time and I
could go reference to number and you can
see 100 shows up so if the value for
random number changes this is going to
change as well because I went in here
and turned this into a reference to
random number so I'm covering pretty
much everything here another thing let's
go in and talk about if statements now
there are many different ways to compare
values inside of PHP just like most
other languages you have equal to you
have not equal to you have less than you
have greater than you have less than or
equal to and finally you have greater
than or equal to so let's go and use
those guys and then we have a couple
other ones that are a little less known
we have the 3 equals in a row and what
this is going to do is say if two values
are equal and the same type and another
thing you could do is go put the
exclamation point in there and this is
going to check if it's not equal
or the same type all right so let's use
these comparison operators in a useful
way so what we're going to do is execute
different code based off of different
conditions and an if statement works
great for that so let's say if five is
equal to ten in that situation we're
going to want to put our curly brackets
here and then inside we're going to have
all the code that's going to execute if
that is true so we're going to come in
here and just say 5 is equal to 10 which
we know is not true another thing we
could do is let's say we want to check
another condition or let's go and just
talk about the default first if you put
else inside of here if five is not equal
to ten then this code is going to show
up and we'll go echo is equal to five
not equal to 10 right like that and if
we execute it you can see that five is
not equal to ten now what I started to
allude to there is the situations in
which we would want to actually check
multiple different conditions and
perform multiple different operations
based off of that so let's say we have a
grocery store and it offers discounts
based off of the number of purchases so
let's say somebody went in and wanted to
purchase four oranges of course put two
equal sign inside of there and then
another thing the store sells is bananas
and let's say somebody wanted to buy 36
bananas now the store owner wants to
come in here and see if the user goes
and buys more than 25 oranges and also
more than 30 bananas they're going to
give them a 25% discount how are we
going to do that we're going to come in
here and we're going to say if and we
put multiple brackets around that num of
oranges is greater than 25 but how do we
check for and multiple different
situations multiple different
comparisons well we just put the end
symbols inside of there right like that
and that's going to allow us to check if
both things are true and these are Co
logical operators these guys right here
and I'm going to show you the other two
logical operators in a second and we'll
go numb of bananas greater than 30 so if
they want to buy more than 25 oranges
and more than 30 bananas we're going to
give them a discount and in this
situation we're just going to echo out
on the screen 25 percent discount right
like that let's say they want to offer
other discounts however in situations in
which they don't buy enough and those
two
we're going to type in else if let's
save ourselves a little bit of time
let's just copy this paste that in there
and let's say we're going to give them a
15% discount if they buy more than 30
bananas or this is how we're going to be
able to check and get a true response if
either of these are true so if they buy
more than 30 bananas or they buy more
than 35 bananas we're going to do a
couple of their nice discount things for
them and in this situation again we'll
go 15% discount and let's go in here and
do one more so I can show you the final
logical operator that's available and
that is not so what happens we want to
check if something is not true well you
just put the exclamation point in there
like that and then I'm going to check
num of oranges less than five so if
they're buying at least five oranges or
they're buying at least five bananas
we're going to give them a discount and
in this situation that discount is going
to be a 5% discount and then we can use
our else statement again here to handle
any default situations and we'll just go
like this and we'll just say no discount
for you and you can see right here
15% discount and the reason why is the
bananas I weren't ordered for oranges
which in this situation doesn't fit this
condition however I ordered 36 bananas
which does fit this condition and as the
reason why 15% printed out and inside of
PHP we have another thing in we get in a
situation where we want to assign a
value to a variable based off of a
condition is true or false and it is
called the ternary operator and
basically the way it works is you have
your condition followed by a question
mark and then you're going to have the
value that's going to be assigned if
true or value if false is going to be
assigned and the basic way that this is
going to look is let's come in here and
let's say we have biggest number we're
going to store inside of here and equal
to then we have our condition so we're
going to have 15 greater than 10
of course these could be variables and
not just straight numbers and then we're
going to say that we want to store 15
inside a biggest number if it's the
biggest or 10 if it is the biggest
then of course we could go Ecco biggest
number and there you can see 15 showed
up another way we could do conditions
inside of PHP is using a switch
statement and you're going to use a
switch statement whenever you have a
very limited number of possible values
so let's say we want to make different
decisions or print different things
based off of the username that gets
passed in our HTML well you're going to
type in the variable you're going to be
checking for users name in this
situation and then you're going to type
in case the user's name has the value of
Derrick and you can use doubles or
strings or anything inside of here well
in that situation we're going to type
out hello Derrick and then we could do
the same by creating in a couple more
case statements or let's just create one
more that'll solve it let's say it is
Sally and you're also going to want to
come in here and type in break which is
going to throw you out of the switch
statement and continue executing code
afterwards but it's not going to come
down and check if it's Sally and waste
time and then of course type in hello
Sally and then we want to come in here
and also type in a default answer or
code that we want to have execute nest
situation and we're going to type in
echo and we'll say something like hello
valued customer and then type in brick
and there we go and we know that I
entered Derrick previously and now you
can see hello Derrick shows up so that's
a switch statement now very often you're
going to want to perform actions until a
certain condition is met and a while
loop works great for that
but one thing we have to do is first
come in here and define some way for us
to get out of the while loop and what
we're going to do is we're going to
continue incrementing the value for
number until it is greater than 20 and
of course this is going to have to be
created or initialized where we want to
refer to it as outside of the while loop
then you're going to type in num and
we're going to continue executing code
inside of this loop which is defined by
these curly brackets right here and then
inside of it we're going to type in
let's go in and auto increment that by
one each time and you can have to always
do that inside of a while loop as well
and then let's go and put commas inside
of here we're going to print out these
inside of the browser and there you can
see it was an easy way to be able to
print 1 through 20 another thing you can
do is go and use a for loop which is
going to pretty much perform exactly the
same actions that you saw with a while
loop but it's going to do it in
a somewhat more compact way so let's
just leave the while loop there and I'm
going to show you how to do exactly the
same thing with our for loop but we're
going to use for loops again later on in
the tutorial and an example so we're
going to define number is equal to one
in this situation and I use 0 up here
only because I use this increment right
there and that's the reason why it's
going to switch to 1 and then it's going
to print remember that's the way that
works then I'm going to come in here and
define the condition I'm going to keep
doing this as long as number is less
than or equal to 20 and then I'm going
to define how the variable is going to
be incremented each time through our
loop I could just go echo and num then I
could print comma out inside of there
but one thing sort of bothers me is
after this 20 right here I have a comma
it's also going to give me an excuse to
go and talk about something else so
let's say I wanted to come in here and
say F is not equal to 20 well in that
situation I'm going to print out my
comma however if it is equal to 20 I
could come in here and end this in a
couple different ways one way to stop
looping
is to use that break statement just like
before what that's going to do is jump
us out of our for loop immediately if
I'm going to be really crazy I could
come in here and type exit what exit is
going to do is stop executing my PHP
script all together I don't want to do
that I just want to stop executing the
for loop in that situation and you can
see here if I jump over execute it's
going to print 1 through 20 again but in
this situation it got rid of the comma
at the end of the 20 another thing it's
very useful I talked about them for a
brief second before and that is arrays
and make sure you don't have any of
these little trailing little Jib Lee's
here because that will cause all kinds
of errors make sure you have everything
cleaned up now on array like I said
before it's going to allow you to store
multiple different types of values so
let's say I want to come in here and
type in my best friends and store them
all in one place
well an array is just a box boxes and
I'm going to put joy inside of here and
I'm going to put willow inside of here
and I'm going to put I the inside of
here there you go that is an array boxes
inside a boxes now each of these boxes
is going to have a label the very first
one is going to be 0 and then
one and then two and that's the way it
is however in PHP you can change that if
I want to echo out onto the screen some
information that is inside of an array I
just type in the array name and then put
a box and then the label for the box
close that off and there you can see it
printed out on the screen just like that
can also come in here and add items to
our array quite easily just go best
friends and let's just give it an index
it doesn't exist right like this then
let's say I got a new friend named Steve
there you go and he's in there right now
with all my other friends stew it in a
more interesting way however and that
more interesting way is a for each
statement which is going to allow me to
cycle through all of the different items
inside of my array I know I need to do
is give it the array I want to cycle
through and then don't put that little
column inside of there instead you're
going to put as then I got to give it a
temporary holding field or temporary
variable which each of these items is
going to be stored in temporarily then I
could do something like echo and friend
and there you can see a printing them
all out on the screen all in one place
so that for each block is just for
arrays another thing you can do is
create key valued pairs for the arrays
which is very much like all of the other
arrays or this one array we created here
except in this situation this has the
key of 0 or the index of 0 this has one
that says 2 and this has 4 if I wanted
to define what the keys are going to be
I could do something like customer is
equal to and I'm going to create an
array again then I'm gonna give it the
specific key I want this data at half
equals sign of that bracket right there
and let's say I want to have the user's
name be stored inside of there put a
comma I could then go Street that's the
key and you could store basically any
type of data inside of here it doesn't
have to be using variables in a
situation like I have I could type in
city and you're going to be able to
access this data using the keys just
like you use the indexes before and then
close that off and there's the whole
thing right there and in this situation
I could still use a for each block as
well and I'm going to show you how to
use that we're going to type in customer
which is the array I want to work with
as and then key and value key value
Aires was that there and then I could go
echo key concatenate this and put in a
colon and then I could type in also my
value and execute that over here it's
going to print out my name my street and
the city
another thing you'd be able to do is
combine arrays this is so easy to do
let's just say we want to store this
information in bestfriends whether this
makes sense or not so if I want to take
the customer data and put it in best
friends like let's say I decided that
one two three Main Street was the best
friend whatever let's just go best
friends and just put a plus sign and
customer and now they are joined they're
all one array at but they have different
keys you can also do comparisons between
arrays to find out if they are equal in
that situation just use the equal sign
not equal there you go it's the same
thing if you want to check if they have
the same values same order and same data
type however you're going to have to put
three equal signs so there's a way to
compare arrays another thing we can do
is come in here and create a
multi-dimensional array just just get
rid of all of this so let's say we want
to go and create a customers array is
equal to and again you're going to type
in array right like we did before then
you just put an array inside of an array
that's what a multi-dimensional array is
and then we could have like customers
names for example and one two three main
and we could put in a zip code or
something one five two one two or
something and we want to create more of
these guys go in here and just copy this
save some time and let's say that we
wanted to have Sally be in here
one two five main data and then make
sure you close that off of the proper
brackets we could then cycle through
these using a for loop so we'll just go
for and we'll say that we want to get
our row is equal to and row is just a
name just like any other you can put
anything inside of there I'm just typing
in row because it makes sense so as long
as Rho is less than three remember we
start at zero one two and then we're
going to auto increment row with our for
loop then we're going to put another for
loop inside of here so we'll be able to
cycle through our columns columns going
to start off with zero Wow columns is
less than three we're going to continue
cycling through here and here we'll
increment it and then we'll close off
for loop right like this and then we can
go echo and customers which is the name
of our array and if we want to print out
the row data do that and the column and
then let's say we want to put a column
in here between all this different data
we have and then we want to come in here
and throw in a break statement you'll
see here in a second what's going to
print out on the screen and there you
can see it printed everything out there
on our screen so that's
multi-dimensional arrays now there's a
couple other very common array functions
let's say you wanted to sort your array
well you would just type in this is a
function which we're going to get into
later on what you do is just type in
sort and inside the brackets put your
array name and this is going to sort in
ascending alphabetical order if you
would come in here and put another comma
in right there and type in sort numeric
it will sort in numerical order or if
you type in sort string it's going to
sort everything as if it is a string of
characters a sort is going to sort the
arrays with the keys it's going to keep
the keys together case sort is going to
sort by the key names instead of the
actual values and you could put an R in
front of any of these guys right here
and it is going to give you a reverse
sort just like that now let's get into
strings which are just a series of
characters and let's go in here and
create a random string and let's throw
some empty space here in the front and
then type in random string right like
this and put some white space down here
now let's say you wanted to make sure
you close off with the same quote that
you started with now let's say you
wanted to go and actually trim off the
white space on a string how would you do
that well another thing is very useful
is to be able to see the length of the
string so you just use STR le N or
string length and we're going to type in
random string and it will throw a break
statement in there now if you want to
trim off the left space what we're going
to do is with this guy we're going to go
L trim that's going to go all the
whitespace off of the left side of our
string if you would want to do pretty
much the same thing on the right side of
the screen you're going to type in or
trim not very common to use those guys
though and the number one way I'm using
string lengths here just to show you how
the string change is based off of using
these trim functions let me use trim
that's going to get rid of all of the
way
space and there you can see the original
string length was 29 after we got rid
all the white space on the left it was
19 after we got rid of the white space
on the right it became 23 because there
was more white space on the left than on
the right and then after we call it a
full trim which got rid of all of the
white space on the left and the right we
have a total string length of 13 now I
have been using echo for everything so
far but there is another way to print
information on the screen and that is
called print F and you're going to use
print F because it's going to allow you
to format strings on your screen just
like echo does so let's go in here and
show you the difference in what echo
would look like versus print F you're
going to be of use all kinds of
conversion coasts convert your data as
well so with echo I'm going to go the
random string now if I would put a
dollar sign inside of here because this
is double quotes this would actually
show up here instead of random string
reason I didn't do that is random string
I throw a break statement at the end
there and this is the print F version of
it with printf you're going to put the
bracket inside of there then you're
going to say the random string is and
you're going to put a % and s because
we're dealing with strings then you're
going to put your bracket inside of here
and then at the end of it you're going
to define what you want to show up where
that % and that s is which is random
strength close that off and they look
identical there you can see right there
well if I would have spelled random
string right there you go
identical on our screen one thing is
very useful though with printf is printf
is going to allow us to use conversion
codes for decimals for example so let's
go decimal number is equal to two point
three four five six whatever now we can
go in here with printf you do all kinds
of other things with printf but I'm
going to keep this somewhat basic so
let's get a decimal number is equal to
and then let's say only wanted two
decimal places to show up inside of here
I can just go point two and F for
floating-point number or a number that
has a decimal place inside of it
close that off and then decimal number
and it's going to just show me two
decimal places like you can see right
there now there are other conversion
codes if you want to convert an integer
so if decimal number was actually an
integer into binary code you would put a
B inside of there instead of an F or an
S like you saw before integer two
characters you just put in a C it's
going to automatically do it for you
integer to decimal double to float
integer to octal number string to string
or integer DEXA decimal those are the
different types of codes you would use
no situations another thing that is very
useful in regards to strings anyway is
we're going to be able to change the
case of the different letters quite
easily so let's say we go echo string to
uppercase so if we want the whole entire
thing to be uppercase just str2 upper
and then we type in random string which
is a string we have here if we wanted
every character to be converted into
lowercase string two and then change
upper to lower and if we want all of the
first letters to show up in uppercase we
would type in UC first uppercase first
and there you can see they did exactly
what you thought they did you could also
come in here and convert strings to
arrays or convert arrays back into
strings so let's say that I want to take
my string I have here and convert it
into an array
well you just type in explode and think
of an array exploding and all the pieces
falling into boxes what you're going to
do is type in here what is going to
divide these strings and it's going to
be a space because random string has a
space inside of there and then you're
going to type in here the string that
you want to explode and let's say you
wanted to also define a maximum number
of pieces that go into an array type a 2
inside of there in that situation or you
could leave it off all together and then
let's say you wanted to convert the
array back into a string you just go
string to alright is equal to and you
would type in implode and again you have
to define what is going to separate all
of the different parts that are in the
array and then you're going to pass
inside of it
array for string and in that situation
you don't have pieces and make sure you
spell implode right if you wanted to
just find part of a string let's just go
part of string you would use sub string
like that
we come in here and let's just type in
random string you could use variables
but and then let's say we wanted to go
from the zero index and get a maximum of
six characters put that out on the
screen for us and you can see it started
at the zero index and got the first six
characters and printed those out on the
screen
you could also compare strings so let's
say I have man and give it a string of
man and then I have man whole like this
like a manhole cover and man hole and I
could do something like echo string
compare so these are real easy to
remember after you use them a little bit
because the names are very logical we
can compare the different strings here
see what it comes back with comes back
with negative four now what this does is
if these two strings are identical what
it's going to do is return 0 if it
returns a positive number which here it
did not it returned a negative four that
means the string 1 or man is greater
than string 2 it's just alphabetical
order if it returns a negative that
means that string 1 is less than string
2 and then you could also come in here
and go string case compare if you want
to completely ignore the case of the
letters couple of the ones we can use
here little string functions is string
string so let's say we go echo and the
string string string what this is going
to do is return every character after
the string that we are going to be
looking for so in this situation dollar
sign and let's type in random string
that we had before it's going to return
everything in the string after it
locates the word string inside of it or
the string inside of it the string
string see that's the string of random
string so it found string and it's going
to print out everything that fall is
there after and you could of course come
in here and put an eye inside of there
and it is going to be case insensitive
again another thing we could do is let's
say we wanted to get the location of a
match you would just type in string
position in this situation and execute
and it's going to come back with seven
which if you count over it is string the
S starts as the seventh character inside
of this string we have right there and
then we could
also come in here and replace strings so
let's say we go new string is equal to
string underscore replace and let's say
we want to replace string with the word
stuff in the string called random string
and we could go echo and now it says
random stuff instead of random string
and I guess that basically brings me to
the final thing i'm going to cover which
are functions if you want to create a
function which is going to allow you to
reuse your code over and over again you
would just type in function and then you
could do something like add numbers
which is going to be the numbers or the
name of the function and then the
different attributes you're going to
allow to be sent into this function to
be executed and you're going to have
your curly brackets again and then you
could have a return statement which is
going to return numbers after you can
put any code inside of here but let's
just say that we want to come in here
and add these two numbers together and
then return them to whoever calls for
this function to execute and then to
call this function we could just go echo
we do something like 3 plus 4 is equal
to and then a period and add numbers 3
comma 4 and that's going to pass it in
there and it's going to echo all of that
information out on the screen and there
you can see 3 plus 4 is equal to 7 so
there you go guys that is a rundown of
pretty much everything about PHP except
for regular expressions and object
oriented programming if you guys want me
to cover those just leave a question or
comment down below otherwise till next
