age-old question of where a vegan gets
their protein will be making barbecued
settin barbecue sauce sloppy joes and
sweet potato fries so let's get cooking
very first thing I'm gonna do is show
you how to makes it an or wheat meat
what you're gonna need is one cup of
vital wheat gluten throw that in a
blender or a pot did you plan on
blending together then you're gonna get
yourself two tablespoons of nutritional
yeast and it's very important to add
some seasonings like 1 tablespoon of
paprika and a nutritional yeast to give
some flavor to this set and then we're
gonna get ourselves some onion powder
put 2 teaspoons of onion powder in there
and then we're gonna get 1 teaspoon of
whole dried oregano and as well as 1
teaspoon of garlic powder and then
you're gonna blend this up until it's
well combined and now we're gonna be
adding our wet ingredients I have some
vegetable broth I'm gonna start off by
adding 1/4 a cup of vegetable broth and
then I'm gonna add 1 tbsp of either
Liquid aminos or soy sauce whichever you
prefer and then I'm gonna blend this and
then as I blend it I'm gonna add in the
other 240 broth until everything is very
well combined alright and now this is
what its gonna look like whenever it's
done and you're gonna of course have to
dump it out and knead it by hand for a
little bit and after your knead it on to
a pan for a little bit put some flour
down so it doesn't stick it's gonna come
together and look like this and be very
very stretchy and now we're gonna put
together the liquid that we are going to
be boiling our Satana together with
we're gonna have five cups of veggie
broth and then we're gonna add 2
tablespoons of once again of liquid
aminos or soy sauce and then finally 3
tablespoons of nutritional yeast and
we're gonna bring this to a boil and
then we're going to simmer this at an at
25% for 30 minutes and now I'm going to
make my barbecued sauce I'm going to add
15 ounces of tomato sauce and then I'm
going to add 1/4 of a cup of apple cider
vinegar as well as 1/4 of a cup of
regular white vinegar and this is just a
generic barbecue sauce that I
particularly like then we're going to
add 1
third of a cup of agave nectar as well
as 1/4 of a cup of molasses molasses is
very sticky of course to make sure you
scoop all that out of there and now that
my pot is coming to a boil I'm going to
take my sliced up settin that's cut into
little tiny pieces and throw it in there
and once again I'm gonna let that boil
at 25% for 30 minutes back to the
barbecue sauce in which I'm adding 1/4 a
cup of tomato paste and then I'm going
to add 2 tablespoons of liquid smoke
as well as 1 teaspoon of garlic powder
and then we'll finish off the barbecue
sauce with 1 teaspoon of powdered
paprika any type you have available and
1/2 of a teaspoon of onion powder and
then we will heat up the barbecue sauce
in a pan on about 20 to 30% of whatever
your ovens power is until the desired
thickness is reached then you'll take
your asset and that has been boiling and
you're gonna dump your barbecue sauce on
top of that and then put that on some
parchment paper then you're going to put
this in your oven at 375 degrees and
cook it for about 30 minutes I
absolutely love sweet potato fries I'm
just gonna cut down the sweet potatoes
and I'm gonna sprinkle just some
Fabrique on top of it just enough to
cover and I'm put some pepper on top of
it then I like to get some dark brown
sugar and sprinkle that over the top of
it again it's just a taste and then
we're gonna cook this at 450 degrees for
30 minutes and now it's time to make
myself some sloppy joes I took two
minced onions with a little bit of water
and I'm gonna store that for about 5
minutes and then I'm going to add 3 cups
of water stir all that to combine and
then I'm gonna add two and a half cups
of textured vegetable protein which is
60% protein by the way I'm gonna stir
all that until it is very well combined
and although the water is soaking into
the TVP and then I'm gonna get my
barbecue sauce which are just made I'm
gonna get one and a half cups of
barbecue sauce dump that in and then
stir all of that very well until
everything is combined and then to
finish it all off we're gonna add 1/4 of
a cup of regular old tomato paste stir
everything once again until it's
combined hope you enjoyed these recipes
