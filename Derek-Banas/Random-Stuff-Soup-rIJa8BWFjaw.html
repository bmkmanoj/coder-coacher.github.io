you into a little predicament I found
myself and the other day what you see
before you is basically what I had
available to make some type of meal a
lot of people might look at this and say
wow there's just absolutely no way there
is a meal here but if you really break
it down into the idea that a good
tasting meal needs to stimulate all of
the different taste buds being sweet
bitter sour salty and savory I do cover
everything right here now you may have
thought okay well he's definitely going
to make a soup however where is his
stock I do not have any so I'm gonna
have to make it based off what I have
here on the table and as well what I'm
gonna show you in a minute which is
mayra garden in my backyard which i
think is the greatest investment anyone
could ever make what you see here down
the center is going to be the basis of
my stock which is what is called a
mirepoix which is twice as many onions
as you have celery and as well carrots
and this is the basis of most stocks I
also have some garlic and what this is
going to do is not only add both a sweet
profile but also is known as what is
called a menthol along with the basil
that I have in my backyard then I'm
gonna show you in a second and that
opens up your nasal passages which
enhances overall flavor then we have our
savouries which are the lentils beans
then you have your rice then it cooked
properly savouries definitely come from
the tomato and savories definitely come
from the Parmesan cheese the bay leaves
also act as a menthol as well as add
bitterness to the dish and the onions
that I am NOT going to use with my
mirepoix I'm going to caramelize to add
my sweetness and all the other flavors
are going to be made up based off of the
herbs in my backyard so let's go take a
look at okay the first order by half
here aren't chives if you've never seen
them before hand they're going dad just
an oniony flavor to the overall dish so
I don't want to add too much of it since
I'm already adding so much onions I'm
mad just about 1 tablespoon of fresh
chives then I have parsley here this is
flat leaf parsley which is a flavor
brightener and it is bitter so I'm
definitely gonna want to take some of
that but not very much you can see
there's basically just a rough handful
and this is basically how I cook
whatever I do this just the whole lot of
playing around then we have basil which
has a very lemony for a taste them as
well
is being very sweet a slightly peppery
aftertaste begin time eating it right
now just to pass along that information
and I'm going to use this to make a
pesto which is gonna add to my
savoriness of the old Row suit then I
have two different types of time this
time right here is extremely peppery it
is absolutely awesome because it has a
taste that's unlike many others whenever
your first taste it tastes lemony but
then as you chew on and it gets very
peppery so it's a very unique taste I'm
definitely going to get a nice big
handful of time as well and because this
is going to go into the soup and it's
going to be drained I don't need to
worry about pulling off each individual
Leafs a nice big handful of that as you
can see right there then I have a second
type of time which is very sweet this
guy right here it's a sweet lemony taste
very aromatic most has like wine
characteristics so I'm definitely going
to throw that flavor in as well because
it has a bitterness a sweetness and as
well as a savoriness so I'm hitting a
whole bunch of different flavor profiles
here with these different herbs and then
finally we have sage sage is a flavor
enhancer I don't really like to eat it
itself but it's great making soups in my
opinion so I'm going to take a big
employ this enhances the flavor and it's
gonna give me all the bitterness that
I'm gonna want for this overall so there
you go however much that as big a in
full stage ok so I'm back in my house
that I'm gonna make myself my pesto
again this is going to be used for both
the sweet aspects as well as the savory
aspects except i'm going to throw a
little bit of a twist here that's about
 a basil I just threw in there I'm
going to put in about a third of a cup
of olive oil a tablespoon of garlic and
then a fourth of a cup of Parmesan then
I'm gonna blend this guy until it's gets
into a paste sort of format
now to this guy I'm going to take my can
of tomatoes again I'm trying to build my
savory profile which is very important
I'm going to throw about a half of a can
of tomatoes into this guy and then I'm
gonna blend this as well so in essence
what I just made here is a not very
attractive but a pretty intense tomato
soup now I'm going to fry this in a pan
to really enhance both the sweetness as
well as the savory aspects of what we
got here and there is my tomato sauce I
just threw it on high and my goal here
is to turn this into a paste which
basically I want to boil out as much of
the water as possible which is going to
really really intensify this of course
make sure you don't burn it and i'll
show you whenever i think it looks done
then well i have the tomato sauce over
there cooking in my saying a little pot
I'm gonna throw all my onions in here
this is gonna be my mirepoix and I'm
gonna pull and this guy up there you are
done I used to chop it alright so in a
bowl I added two tablespoons of olive
oil then to that I'm going to add my
mirepoix and then just stir this guy up
cook it for about five minutes and help
burn off the excess water add in about a
teaspoon of salt Hey five minutes in i'm
going to add fourth cup of garlic and
then I loosely chopped all the herbs
except for the basil obviously because
that is in the past i'm just still
cooking away by the way it is over here
today still cooking trying to turn it
into a paste and then just stir the
herbs around inside of here right around
two minutes then you're gonna get
yourself eight cups of water and dump it
in stir it in keep it on high or you can
go in and taste that and you're gonna
realize it's not salty enough so put in
some salt two teaspoons of salt then
you're gonna would put in about a
teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper
or more to taste it on the side I have
my little sauce I'm gonna get about a
half a cup of this and dump it with oil
and stir it up and let it sit until it
starts to boil okay after boiling for
about 15 minutes we're going to take our
soup and strain it I take a potato
masher and
just mash all the juices out of it okay
now that you've taken your stock and you
put it back on the oven on high you're
then going to take your carrots this is
about a cup of carrots and here is about
a fourth of a cup of celery I'd actually
put in more than that but that's all I
have so that's what I'm going to work
with and then in a pan on high you're
going to fry a cup of onions for about
five minutes until they caramelize and
in a minute you're going to see what
that looks like and also to your pot of
stock you're going to add a half cup of
rice and a cup of lentils you're going
to bring that to a boil and then you're
going to turn it down to twenty percent
and then let it cook for 45 minutes and
then one of your soup is about 10
minutes from being done again it's
twenty percent on the oven the soup I
took a cup of onion and I tried it in
about a tablespoon of olive oil and I'm
gonna do that until it is sweet to the
taste and it looks pretty much like what
you see right here and in case you
didn't say it this was the tomato mix
that I had before you can see the
consistency is like a paste sort of look
to it but I'm just gonna take my onions
and throw them in the soup right at the
end and the soup is officially done of
course you probably want to stir those
in there and this is a hardy one heck of
a meal and pretty much right here for
the cost of about three bucks you get
able to feed about six people off of
this and here I go got myself my nice
soup all cooked up here and even take a
little bit of parmesan at the end it
sprinkle it on top so there is how to
make soup out of random things in your
house a lot of informational enjoy how
to just cook in general by trying to add
savory bitter sour sweet and salty
flavors to your meals till next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
