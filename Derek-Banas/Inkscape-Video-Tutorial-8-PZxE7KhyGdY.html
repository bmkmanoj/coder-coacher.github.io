8 of my escape video tutorial this is
going to be the final part of my xscape
video tutorial so that means I need to
cover all the things I haven't covered
previously so we're going to talk about
patterns clipping masking converting
bitmap tracing raster extensions and a
whole bunch of other different things if
you haven't seen any of the previous
parts of the tutorial I provide a link
in the upper right hand corner to them
as well as a link in the description
underneath this video so I have a lot to
do so let's get into it okay so here we
are inside of Inkscape and since we're
going to need to be doing a lot of
things with bitmaps in this tutorial
let's talk a minute about how we import
bitmaps so we're just going to go into
file come down here to import click on
that and then you're going to see all of
the different types of files you can use
inside of ink scapes click down here and
scroll through SVG PDF Adobe Illustrator
GIMP gradients da-da-da-da-da and of
course you can include bitmaps and pings
and texts and all sorts of other
different things JPEGs pretty much
anything you can ever imagine but I'm
just going to leave this set up here at
the top scroll Scroll scroll to all
Inkscape files and I'm going to find a
picture inside of here and I'm going to
click on it and I'm going to come down
here and I'm going to say open and that
brings us to the big decision you're
going to need to make are you going to
embed the image or are you going to link
to it now whenever you link to an image
or a graphic of some sort the downside
or the positive side of doing so is if
an outside graphics program changes said
graphic or image that is going to be
immediately translated inside of
Inkscape another positive of course is
if you link to images that is going to
bring down the size of your SVG file if
however you decide to embed the image if
that image is affected in any way
outside of Inkscape it is not going to
show up inside of your Inkscape file so
in this situation I'm just going to
embed and I'm going to hit OK and there
is a particularly goofy picture of one
of my babies now what we're going to do
is we're going to take a look at
patterns which I have previously talked
about basically what a pattern is going
to allow you to do is
easily crop an image inside of another
object so let's say that I want to draw
a star and I want to put my baby's
picture inside of said star in a kind of
cheesy type of way well if I want to
convert this graphic into a pattern I
just select it and we'll come up here to
object click on that and come down to
pattern and say objects to pattern
pretty easy now if I want to put this
picture inside of this star right here
all I need to do is open up the fill
stroke panel of course and click on this
little guy here now you can see the
baby's picture shows up inside of there
now the weird thing about this and it is
weird is how you're going to edit or
move around or rotate your pattern
inside of this object first off you have
to come over and select the node tool
they're going to see these random things
sort of floating here's an X here is a
circle and way down here is a square
each one of those is going to do
something quite different to your
pattern inside of the object you're
going to be able to move the pattern
around by clicking and dragging with the
X you're going to be able to rotate the
image by clicking and dragging with the
little circle and way down here you're
going to be able to enlarge and yes you
can hold down control to constrain the
enlargements by clicking and dragging on
the square and this is the square down
here and that is the basics no you
cannot click inside of here and move it
around if you want to move things around
you're going to have to click on the X
and move around that way so that is the
basics and that's pretty much everything
you need to know oh yeah one other thing
yes you can still come in here and grab
the node points and change them and that
is not affected and the pattern works
perfectly so there's the basics of how
to use patterns now we're going to take
a look at clipping now clipping is also
going to provide a way to crop images
and let's come in here and
in a bit so we can see it's a little bit
better now let's say that I want to crop
out just a part of this picture I'm just
going to use the rectangle tool right
here and let's go in here and draw over
everything that I want to remain on the
screen okay so I have that selected and
of course I'm going to have to also come
in here and select all this and then you
go up to object and come down to clip
and come in here and click on set and
you can see only the part that I had
highlighted or that I drew the rectangle
on is going to remain on the screen
however clipping is what we call
non-destructive so that means I can come
in here and click on object and click on
clip and go release and we are back to
where we started at and that is the
basics of clipping one thing you do need
to know however is let's say you have
numerous different objects and you want
to apply a clipping path to them make
sure you hold down ctrl + G after
selecting all the objects to group them
if you don't do that you might have some
problems so now let's take a look at
masking now masking is very very similar
to clipping the only difference is is
masking relies on the color of the
masked paths to determine the
transparency of what is left so since
we're using a dark grey here may if I
come in here and select this and go into
object and mask and set you're going to
see that I'm left with a
semi-transparent
image here on the screen if however
let's go back I click on this and I
change this to white you're going to see
that a mask pretty much just becomes a
clipping path so selected both object
mask and set and there you can see there
is no transparency on the screen and of
course if we went and placed a black
rectangle over top of this the whole
entire thing would disappear so now you
are an expert on masking and yes indeed
masking let's reapply this masking also
is non-destructive so if we go object
and mask and release you're going to see
that we are back where we started at so
we are just banging right through this
what would happen for example if we were
to create an extremely complex sort of
graphic with tens of thousands of nodes
and we're done with it and we want to
limit the screen size and we want our
files to load quicker and so forth and
so on and we know we never ever ever
ever want to change it well we would
convert it to a bitmap so let's just
draw something here let's say that we
want to convert this simple square we
have here into a bitmap how we would do
so is to select it of course and then go
edit and then come down here and click
on make a bitmap copy now if we would
come in here and select the node tool
well guess what can't do anything with
that only thing to remember however is
there are actually two rectangles here
on the screen this guy right here
underneath does still have the nodes
this one right here does not and you can
also see a hint in regards to what
you're dealing with see here I have the
rectangle with nodes selected well if I
come down here to the bottom the screen
you're going to see rectangle if however
I select this rectangle and come down to
the bottom of the screen you are now
going to see image so there you go so
now you are an expert in regards to how
to convert graphics into bitmaps so now
let's take a look at something a little
bit more complicated which is tracing
now Inkscape allows you to trace bitmaps
and to save time I went ahead and I'm
going to show you numerous different
examples on all the different ways you
can trace bitmaps but what you're going
to find is unlike some other graphics
programs
Inkscape whenever it traces a bitmap and
converts it into vector art it doesn't
necessarily try to make a vector
representation of the bitmap but instead
what it tries to do is provide vector
art that you can then go in and
manipulate and use however you would
like how you open it up and begin
tracing a bitmap is to just go into path
right here and trace bitmap pretty
simple click on that and there you are
going to see all of the numerous
different options that are available for
you now basically I'm going to run
through all these guys so that you can
see everything all at once and then I'm
going to show you sample images and
you're going to change the thresholds
and the colors and all that
get different results we're going to see
exactly how that works basically
brightness cut off if that is selected
and also you cannot select multiple say
you're only going to be able to select
one of these at a time
brightness cutoff is basically going to
create black and white vector art that's
what it does and as you're going to see
here the higher the threshold setting
the fewer pixels that will be considered
to be white so let's just take a look at
that real quick there you can see the
original image and here you can see if
the threshold is set at point for the
results and if the brightness cutoff is
set to 0.6 the results then of course
this is vector art after you trace it of
course you could then go in and change
this from black if you'd like to some
other color and that is basically how
brightness cutoff works and I really
really simplify this by using a pretty
simple image but if you use more
complicated images it's going to get
quite interesting however it can be a
little bit taxing on your computer and
that brings us to the second option
which is edge detection basically what
edge detection is going to do you can
see it right here there's the original
there is edge detection with a threshold
of 0.1 and there is edge detection with
a threshold of 0.3 and of course you get
dramatically different results by
messing around with the thresholds but
in essence what edge detection does is
finds edges by determining if a pixel is
near a contrasting color and then it
makes determinations on whether the
final result or the final pixels should
show up on your screen
color quantization which is right here
which is going to be changed or is going
to have its results change depending
upon the number of colors you include is
going to give you results just like you
see right there and in essence what it's
doing is it's going to generate vector
art based on the number of output colors
you define and then it is going to go
off on its own and determine how to
treat certain images as black or as
nothing you can see that kind of made my
baby look like a superhero there but you
could say that these are quite distorted
images but as you go in and mess around
with this stuff you're going to find
interesting ways to work with it invert
image of course if that's selected
that's
going to invert the image let's come
through here take a look at brightness
steps now we're starting to see some
things look a little bit more normal
basically what brightness steps is going
to do as you're probably guessing is
make a grayscale group of objects based
on the number of shades of gray that you
set with steps and let's take a look at
that bring it up here
brightness steps right here and eight is
going to determine the number of objects
that are going to be used and there's an
example if we use eight and there's an
example if we use 20 so as you can see
the more that you use more complicated
the math but the more like a normal
photograph you're going to get colors of
course is going to make a grouped bunch
of objects just like we did with
brightness steps however this is going
to be based on the number of colors that
you say that you want to include and
there is the picture with eight and
there is the picture with 50 and then
finally Grey's is sort of going to give
you a result somewhere between
brightness steps and colors or you could
just think of it this way it's in
essence going to be colors if they were
set to grayscale so there's a rundown of
all the different ways we can trace
bitmap so now let's go through all these
other different things smooth if checked
is basically going to apply a Gaussian
blur on the bitmap before it's going to
convert it into vector or stack scans is
going to stack colored objects to help
avoid gaps
whenever the vector art is generated
remove background is going to remove the
background layer when it's all done then
we can also go over here to options
suppress speckles as you may guess is
going to go in there and kind of ignore
spots that are in the bitmaps
smooth corners is going to smooth the
corner on their traces and optimize
paths is going to optimize the paths by
joining objects with the same or similar
colors and there is a run down pretty
much a complete rundown of how trace
bitmap works now something I get asked
about all the time is how to do photo
editing inside of Inkscape and really to
be honest
Inkscape isn't meant to do photo editing
however if you are in a bind something
that is done at times and I really just
don't even know how I'm gonna come in
here and edit this but let's say that we
want to well of course you can come in
here I mean with a graphic like that's
not a photo though one thing you can do
if you're in a bind and you want to make
a quick change without going outside of
Inkscape is something that you may have
forgotten that I covered and that's a
trick you can use with the dropper tool
so let's say and I'm just going to use
squares here just to keep this simple
and I'm also going to use greyscale
squares so let's just draw a couple of
these guys inside of here and like that
and like this throw in another one and
then throw in another one now let's say
that I have this guy let's go and let's
shrink him down a little bit
and let's also come in here and throw
him up on top there we are okay so let's
say this is our blemish that we have in
our image this one dot right here this
is the guy that we want to get rid of
and blend it into the background and as
you can see the background is pretty
doggone complex there's a whole bunch of
different colors here and if this is the
blemish we want to get rid of and we
want to blend it into the background how
would we do it well first off we would
select it and then get our dropper tool
that is over here and if we want to find
in color that is pretty similar to
everything that surrounds it what we do
is we click and we drag and you're going
to see that it changed that object that
we had right there and made it sort of
go away another thing we could do if we
are just looking at this guy right here
as a blemish is to come in here and draw
a rectangle over top of it and in this
situation that rectangle is not going to
have a fill and also use the dropper
tool in this situation to click and drag
to try to make it blend into its
background of course you could get
different results by clicking and
dragging in different places so in
essence that is something you can do
real quickly to photo edit a graphic but
like I said before Inkscape just really
isn't made for editing
photographs the last thing that I want
to cover is extensions and more
specifically now inside of Inkscape
there are numerous different extensions
and in a previous part of the tutorial I
went through every single filter that is
available to you and I'll provide a link
to that in the description as well and I
went through every single one of these
and showed exactly what each of them
showed up like all in a graphic on a
page on my website but if we go into
extensions you're going to see all of
these other different options that are
available to you and I decided to just
let you go and explore all that stuff on
your own because it's kind of
interesting but one thing that I did
cover you can see right here you can
come in here and generate bar codes and
calendars and all sorts of other
different crazy stuff but what I did
specifically for raster is on my website
I went through and got an image and
showed an example of what all of those
different raster extensions do to images
as you can see right there just to help
you along and so you could pretty much
easily say if there was anything here
that you'd want to do in regards to
raster extensions inside of Inkscape so
it's being fun going through all these
different tools inside of Inkscape later
on I might come back through here well I
definitely will come back and start
drawing graphics and so forth inside of
Inkscape but for now I thought this was
a good ending for the Inkscape video
