Susi video tutorial in this one tutorial
I'm going to teach you pretty much
everything you need to know about Susy
to start using it right now to create
really awesome websites now Susy is a
grid toolkit or framework that is
extremely easy to use it's gonna
integrate seamlessly with sass which I
have a tutorial on from that I covered
previously and it basically is just
gonna require a few settings followed by
defining what elements go where and it's
just gonna work Suzy is a great
alternative to bootstrap and in this
tutorial today I hope to show you all
the things that make it great now for
Suzy are gonna need Ruby as well as sass
installed and in the description
underneath the video I show you exactly
how to install those so I have a lot to
do so let's get into it okay so here I
am in the terminal and this is gonna
work equally well in Windows as well as
Linux as well as OSX pretty much
everything is exactly the same basically
inside of your web server you're going
to first off have to install Ruby so go
do that you know like I said in the
description there is a video on that and
then you want to make sure inside of
your terminal that you were using the
correct version of Ruby so we're gonna
type in our VM use default 2.2 and then
if you type in Ruby - V you're gonna see
that we have Ruby to point to anything
above that's going to be great then what
you want to do is check all of the gems
that you have installed because we're
going to have to have a couple new ones
installed here and I'm gonna show you
how to do that basically we're gonna
want this version of compass or anything
above it this version right here of 1.1
alpha that guy you're also gonna want to
make sure you have SAS 3.4 or above as
well as Siouxsie 2.2 so this is version
2 of Suzy that I'm gonna use here I'm
going to show you exactly how to install
all those right now first off to install
the version of compass that we're gonna
need we're gonna type in Jim install
compass and then - - three like that and
you can see right there there is the 1.1
alpha and everything is installed also
it's going to install the correct
version of sass for us automatically
then we're going to have to
and install Susi so just type in Susi
and there we go gem install Susi I also
want to come in here and use break
points in my next tutorial I'm gonna
cover a responsive web design I'm gonna
get a little bit more into break point
but we're gonna install that and I'm
gonna touch on it a bit in this tutorial
we're also going to install normal eyes
you can see everything here just
installs quite easy and then it's also a
good idea to go gym outdated to make
sure that all of your gyms are updated
and I swear every single time I do this
I end up having some things that are
outdated even though I do this almost
every single day and then if you have
some that are updated which you almost
definitely will you're going to go gym
update and load those in and it's going
to install everything for you right so
now everything is all updated I'm just
gonna clear that back now what I'm gonna
do when you just want to make sure you
have compass 1.1 SAS 3.4 or above and so
C 2.2 okay so to make sure you have all
those then we're going to install our
bundler and this stuff's just going to
make everything much easier so gem
install bundler and then we're gonna go
bundle an it and what this is gonna do
is create a gem file for us in which
we're going to make sure that we point
at the right gem so we use the right
gems so if we go LS you're gonna see
there is our gem file and I'm gonna open
this up in sublime so Jim I'll open them
up however you open things up then after
you do that you're going to go in your
gem file and define exactly what you
want to use so we want to use compass
and we want to use a specific version of
compass because you might have multiple
versions and this is a way that I've
been able to have other people easily
install this stuff and make sure that
it's all works and of course in the
description I'm gonna have a link to all
this stuff so you can just copy and
paste it
we got compass and the right version we
then want to make sure that we have sass
and the correct version of sass and make
sure that you use whatever version you
you know have installed type gem list
get the right one okay cuz your versions
might be slightly different than mine
they're just going to be newer that's
all people in 2.2 and breakpoint and
normalize and there we go and we can
save that then we can jump back over
here to our terminal and we're just
gonna type in bundle install it's going
to get all the
data and make sure that it's using all
the correct gems and the right versions
one thing to remember here is previously
in our sass tutorial when we were using
compass we would always type in compass
watch to make sure that it would
automatically update all of our CSS
files right now since we're doing things
the way we're doing Lumira instead going
to go bundle exact compass watch and
I'll be showing you that here in a
second as well and now what we want to
do is come in and make a Suzy project
and we're gonna do that by going compass
create and I'll just go Suzy X - R Suzy
- you Suzy and there we go and it
created all of our files that we're
gonna want to use there's everything
right there super and now we can come in
here and go LS and change over to Sue's
EE X which is the new guy we just
created and there are all our files and
we could go su BL for sublime and a dot
and it's gonna open everything up in
sublime alright so it's going to load
this here and remember to have compass
automatically update all of our CSS
files we're going to have to come in
here and go bundle exec compass watch
and everything's just gonna work on its
own over here you can see all of our
files that were created here are our
sass files grids that's where all the
settings for Suzy are gonna be there's
the style sheets and there's the style
and we're gonna be working with the
config file next you could see it
automatically installed Suzy as well as
compass we're also going to come in here
and say require break point and there we
go got that set up down here with the
HTTP path you might not have to do this
but I do I have to put two dots in front
of there just try them out see which one
works best for you and as well I'm gonna
have a couple other directories this is
gonna be the CSS directory which is
style sheets which is the same as right
there so you know that works sass we
also have a sass folder over here images
and Java scripts we have right here
let's just jump over here into our
terminal again see what directory right
end and you would type the dir to do
this instead of LS if you're on Windows
and so see e acts like this LS and I can
just come in here and make a images
directory as well as make a
Java scripts directory and there we go
have all our directories all set up and
we're gonna be watching this guy to make
sure that it installs everything down
here I want to use expand it I'm gonna
use compact or compressed later on we
use compressed later on what I'm going
to be able to use this in real world and
we're just gonna go like this and this
is just an example of how the
information is going to be output to the
CSS file again if you haven't watch my
sass tutorial a lot of this doesn't make
any sense I covered it all in detail
there and here I'm gonna also make this
true so that we will be able to target
my images folder and there we go it
doesn't make sense don't worry about it
I'm gonna cover this in a lot of detail
and provide a lot of sass examples as we
go on and that is all we're gonna have
to do with our config file and now I'm
gonna create a couple different partial
files which we're going to load into our
s CSS files or our sass files and then
I'm gonna bounce over into the terminal
again and go LS and I'm gonna change
into my sass folder and I'm gonna make a
couple other different folders inside of
here so make directory and this is going
to be where all my partials go
we call that partials and you can see it
opened up there inside of our sass
directory and I'm gonna create a couple
new files here first off I'm gonna
create a layout file I'm gonna call this
file underscore layout dot CSS and save
that and I'm just gonna cover some real
basic things so I'm gonna go HTML and I
want to be using the REM units and what
that's gonna allow me to do is have all
of my sizing be consistent all across
the entire web document based off of the
font size or one font size I'm gonna be
using so I'm gonna go main font size and
I'm going to define this guy I'm gonna
have to go into partials again and go
new file and I'm gonna save this guy as
variables underscore variables is CSS
and save that and inside of here I'm
gonna define the default font size like
I said it's gonna be used document wide
as well as a whole bunch of different
colors and it's all I'm gonna do with
variable so I can just close that out
and then dock
why'd also I want to use border box and
what border box is gonna allow me to do
is collapse the padding as well as the
margins and borders inside of the height
and width of any element so it's going
to make sure that elements don't sort of
like bounce off of each other and cause
havoc and once again we save that right
there and I covered that in the saps
tutorial as well so we're done with the
layout file as well so we can close that
and now let's go in and open up the
grids file which is the guy that's uh C
created for us and then let's add in a
whole bunch literally every setting and
I'm gonna walk you through every single
one of them but first before I do that
basically what this is saying here
columns is in our grid system by default
we're going to have twelve columns and
that's pretty much all I need to know
about that and that our gutters in this
situation are going to be 1/4 the size
of our columns I'm gonna change this to
one so our columns are going to be
exactly the same size as our gutters in
this situation okay so now let's go
through what every other setting here
does now you're not normally going to
use all these different settings
actually I'm gonna show you here in a
minute about what you're normally gonna
use but I want to let you know what all
the different settings do so columns
just defines number of columns in your
grid that's it
gutters are going to be the size of the
gutters in relation to your columns when
I have one inside of here that means
that it's gonna be exactly the same size
math for fluid down here what this means
when it's marked as fluid is that the
grids are going to be calculated as a
percentage relative to the container and
the container is literally going to be
the whole entire grid system so
everything inside of the container is
the grid system and I'm gonna create one
here in a moment if however you would
put static inside of here grids would be
calculated as a multiple of the column
width using e/m as a default you're
normally going to use fluid but we'll
get into that later on and of course you
could go in here and use the HTML and
CSS and then go in and change these guys
bit by bit and that will show you
exactly how they're gonna work I'm not
gonna do that but that's a great thing
you can do after you watch this tutorial
to sort of really learn about these
settings call them with we're gonna
define that as 40 pixels and that's just
what it is you can put in whatever size
you'd like for that output float
you're going to almost always have this
be output float which is just a simple
float layout otherwise it's going to use
isolate which is the other thing you can
put inside of here which is sort of an
absolute positioning for float it's a
little bit complex though and I
personally never use it so chances are
you won't either
gutter position when we're talking about
a grid system basically we're gonna have
columns which we're gonna line
everything up against and those columns
are going to be divided by another thing
called a gutter
so you're gonna call them gutter column
gutter you're gonna see here in a moment
but basically what we're defining here
is where we want the gutter to be
positioned and we can either have it be
before we could have it after we could
have it be split which means half on one
side half on the other side or you could
put it inside I'm normally going to use
after and I'm gonna use after in this
tutorial again how are things going to
flow on your screen left to right or
right to left that's all that means for
the container we can either have that
set for auto we could provide it with an
absolute width or a percentage so it's
up to you I'm gonna leave that set at
Auto
container position this defines how to
align the container relative to the
parent so whatever element is
surrounding the container that is what
this is going to define I'm gonna have
this also set for center in this
situation you could have it set for left
which means that the container would go
to the left justification and the parent
have it Center of course or right this
is going to be last flow is going to
define the float direction of the last
element from is gonna float to the left
and two is gonna float in the opposite
direction which is going to be to the
right
so two is going to float to the right in
this situation global box sizing I'm
gonna use border box again I'm gonna put
border box here as well as putting
border box over here inside of my layout
this guy right here and once again
that's just going to whenever you define
an elements height and width it's going
to enclose the padding and the borders
and the margins inside of that area so
it makes everything easier to layout and
that's most of the settings you're ever
gonna worry about then you have the
debug section which is just going to
define whether you want to show the
grids on the screen or not which of
course you
wouldn't do in production and the color
that you want to have for your grids
this guy right here is going to show the
debug image as a background or as an
overlay so you don't want it to be in
background you want it to be an overlay
just type in overlay and that's whatever
you want it to be then this guy right
here is going to position a toggle to
show and hide overlay options so I'm
gonna have that be in the top right hand
corner then you have used custom inside
of here we're gonna have background
image which I'm gonna have set to true
which means that it's going to use the
provided background image for debugging
background options I have this set for
false which is gonna output the
background options to the CSS again
nothing you don't really need to be
concerned about box sizing I have set to
true which means that we should go out
and look for the existing box sizing
clear fix gonna be marked as false if it
was marked as true that would mean that
we want it to look for an internal clear
fix before using it don't worry about
that and then finally we have RAM and
whenever you have this set to true we're
finding that we want the unit circle
we're going to be using to be based off
of RAM which as I mentioned previously
are going to be relative to the font
size of whatever the root element is and
we already defined that see there's the
font size and every single thing on our
web page is going to be based off of
this size right here and again it's just
gonna help us with consistency so that
is all you need to know about the
settings actually it's way more than you
need to know about the settings with
Susy normally what you can do to easily
set up this stuff is just go Susie and
lay out how many columns you want the
gutter size fluid layout float and
outside that's normally we need to do so
a lot of people probably left this
tutorial whenever look at all these
settings in fact you can get away with
using this pretty much every single time
but I'm gonna use all the settings I had
previously and let's go and start
writing this website okay so I went in
and created my index.html file and
that's just going to be stored in the
main Sussex directory or whatever the
name doesn't mean anything of course and
you can see everything here is really
simple we didn't have to use any kind of
crazy class names none of these names
mean anything they're just names I
picked wrapper and here's our header
section right here
navigation sector here's going to be
where the grid is going to be affecting
things as you can see first row has no
meaning it's just what I gave it so you
don't need to use specific class names
or anything you'll see here I have a
picture gallery and content bars and
everything it basically just have to
divide everything up based off of how
you want your content to be laid out and
the grids are just going to work on
their own and that is all the HTML right
there and of course in the description
and get a copy of it so now to style
everything I'm going to go into style
dot s CSS remember we want compass to be
able to create everything for us and
inside of this guy there's grids which
is where all of our settings are for
inside of Susy and we're just gonna come
inside of here and we need to import a
couple more things will go import and
will import all of the partials that we
have created so there's normalize and
these are note in no specific order
variables which are going to have our
default font size as well as all of the
different colors that we wanted here's
our layout file and you may notice this
says layout and over here see it says
layout with an underscore just remember
that well we need to also go import
break point I want to demonstrate how
break point works and now I'm gonna go
and just paste inside of here all of my
generic CSS data so this is just all the
things that do not pertain at all to my
grid system it's just how everything is
going to be colored so here is our
header it's just the height background
color margins all that different stuff
none of this pertains to Susy you can
see here I'm using the sass nested way
of styling everything here and you can
see it's very very simple it's just
basically the size and if there are any
background colors so now let's save that
and let's go and see exactly what that
looks like in the browser the one thing
that happens every once while things
will not update and all we need to do in
those situations is to just hit ctrl C
over here and then reload this guy and
this happens every once a while it's not
really a big deal and then whenever we
reload it it gave me a little bit of an
error I forgot to put normalize inside
of here so let's create that of course
we're going to do that over in partials
so new file and we're gonna paste in our
normalized file and
call that underscore normalize dot s CSS
just as I have right there save it in
the partials and save and that's going
to satellite in two faults across my
whole entire website something close
that and reload this and now you can see
everything is laid out here on the
screen but it's very very sloppy so
we're gonna want to fix all those
different things for us and to do that
we're gonna do everything in style dot s
CSS and we'll get into the Susy specific
type of things now if I want to target
the header I just take that header just
like I would do it any other time and if
I want the header to span the entire
area that's available and eliminate any
floating issues I would just type in
include and full what's going paws here
for a moment and actually set it up so
that the grid shows up on our screen and
to do that all we need to do is to
assign the container to our wrapper
which goes around to every single thing
on our screen so include container and
that's how easy that is and we save that
and reload it and now you can see our
grid right here one thing you can know
is you could also set the size for the
container just by passing in let's say
we want to pass in 800 pixels you could
do that but I'm just gonna leave it the
way that it is right now we can now go
into the header section and let's say
that we want to position the logo a
little bit different I'm gonna use sass
of course and just target the logo like
this and then let's say that I want the
logo to take up you can actually take up
percentages of size so if I wanted to
take up one column I would just type in
include span and I can put one inside of
there and reload it
but let's say I thought that was a
little bit too small I could actually
put a percentage inside here like I said
let's say it's like one point three five
and there you can see it lines up a
little bit nicer another thing we can do
inside of here is add in wide or wider
if we type in wide it's gonna take up
one gutters worth of space we typed in
wide or like that it's gonna take up two
gutters worth of space reload that there
you can see takes up some space I'm just
playing with some things just so I can
show you a whole bunch of different
styles and ways that we can use Susy I'm
also gonna come in here and use the sass
shortcuts image height where I point out
the actual logo that I have
here and image width so that they size
properly and now if I wanted to position
this h1 tag here so that it floats over
here on the right side of the screen I
could also target that that's also in
our header section so I'm just gonna say
h1 and if I want it to go into the last
two columns or start displaying in the
last two columns I just go include spam
and then last - and you can see it
bounced over there and we can move it
around you can see right here here's the
last two columns and that's where it
starts off at if I wanted to do
something with breakpoints just for the
heck of it so that this guy is going to
be moved any time the size of our
browser window changes I could just go
include breakpoint and let's say that I
wanted to find whenever the max width
goes anywhere below 50 e/m I want to
move our little header guy for example
meaning this h1 tag over here I could
come in and just change it that easy so
let's that one to move it over 4 spaces
or 2 spaces I could just go last 4 and
now it'll be just assumed at the last 4
spot now you can see that's it right
whenever it gets beyond that 50 e/m mark
right here it's going to automatically
jostle over that h1 tag right there on
our screen so very very useful and I'll
get more into breakpoints later on the
nav section here I want this to take up
the full section and not have any issues
with floating on the left or the right
so we can just go include full now for
each one of those navigation items if I
want each of the items to take up 3
columns of the total layout area I can
just go nav item and then include span
and then say that I want to take up 3
columns actually let's go and create a
brand new layout for this because we can
actually have multiple suzi layouts here
that we're going to be able to use and
in this situation I want to create one
that is not going to display our gutters
on our screen so that there's not any
gaps between our navigation items so I'm
gonna just call this now Suzy layout and
then just define layout and let's just
keep the columns the same 12 and then 0
for the gutter and then let's use fluid
and float and then have this set for
inside and then jump back and I did this
in underscore cribs dot s CSS jump
over here and now I can just define
three of and point at that different
layout that we just created so now Suzy
oh yeah like that and there you can see
all the items lay out there on our
screen now let's go in here fix some of
this other stuff maybe something else I
want to do is add a margin to the bottom
of this guy I could actually use the
width of one column as the margin size
so say that I wanted to do something
like margin bottom if I wanted to use
the value for that to be one column and
its size I just type in span one and
there you can see it's sort of moved
down you're gonna see this Morris we
correct all this other slop that's on
here it's a little bit messy right now
not what it can do is go in and really
start styling these guys and I'm going
to target this first row right here and
then all of these other columns right
here and what I want to do is I want to
have this guy take up one column and
then I want to split these two guys into
another column and these two guys into
another call so how hard is that to do
well let's come after the wrapper
section makes a little bit more sense
we're gonna target first row first off
I'm gonna call clear both from those get
rid of floating issues then I'm gonna
target first which is gonna be the first
column that we have here and if I want
it to take up the first four total
columns on a screen at include span and
I'm gonna say first four and I'm just
gonna keep going here so that you'll see
the final product now if I want to take
these columns that are inside of this
div called second right here I can just
come over here and go second then I
could say I want to place these in the
last eight spaces that are available on
the screen so I include span last eight
because remember the first four are
going to be taken up by there's other
div that we had here so right like this
and then I could come in and place all
the individual divs inside of here let's
go ix child and let's point at the first
one and then we'll say that we want to
take up two columns starting at the
first of the eight that we have so I'll
go span I want to take up two columns
starting at
first of the eight that we said we
wanted to work with put a semicolon
there they were basically going to do
exactly the same thing let's go and open
this up so you can see this really well
we'll do this for the other four and
we'll target the second child the third
child and the fourth child and you're
gonna see what this looks like in a
moment then we're gonna say that we want
to target three of eight and this is
gonna be five of eight and this is going
to be seven of eight save that and if we
reload it you can see that they all line
up this guy's taking up four spaces this
one's going to take up two columns you
could see the columns there are two
columns two columns two columns so
that's exactly how we would go in and
place all those now let's go in to this
guy I'm going to demonstrate how
galleries work and at the same time how
to take columns or elements that are in
columns and spread them apart and do all
kinds of other different things another
thing just because I'm here I could also
come in and let's say I wanted to put a
break statement to throw this child
element underneath of it I could just
come in here and go @include break and
that would pop that child element down
below and you can see it's sort of went
down there it looks a little bit ugly
though I just threw that in there just
to talk about break you can experiment
with that on your own basically it just
splits the child element down but at the
same time it's going to keep them in
five of eight like we defined here so
play around with it something to explore
so now what I want to do is come down
here to the picture gallery and I'm
gonna place this in here as a gallery so
go pick gallery and include clearfix I
do this all the time just keeps
everything nice and neat another thing
we could do is we could define let's say
padding I talked about how to use column
sizes as an element or a value you could
also do the same thing with gutter think
with twelve inside of here like that I
want to add padding to the sides of this
guy as well so you can go padding I'm
just gonna set this to zero ten pixels I
just throw things out there as I think
of them or remember them so now I'm
going to target two divs inside of my
picture gallery it's going to contain
all those divs and here what I'm going
to do is I'm going to say each one of
those divs needs to take up two of every
12 for all of the
different pictures that we have let me
say gallery 2 of 12 there you are
logical I could also come in and do div
just to do something a little bit funky
and I could target the 5th child like
this and let's say that I want to make
it the last element even though it
doesn't take up all 6 spaces well I just
go last like this however to make sure
that that works for us I'm gonna have to
come in here and make sure that I import
compass so let's save that and that's in
my grids dot s CSS just another import
clear fix is just going to make sure
that the element the picture gallery is
going to completely surround all of the
elements that are inside of it make
everything line up okay so here we are
and here you can see if I reload that
how these are all going to line up in
our gallery and it's just gonna take up
two of the twelve total columns you
could also see how I moved over the
fifth div into the last position right
there and now what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna get content one and content two we
can jump over here you can see these two
guys right here and I'm just gonna have
them line up and take up half of the
total space that's available underneath
so they're gonna both be on the same row
so this is going to be content bar
that's what we're gonna be targeting
this time just come over here again
we're gonna dot and content bar but
actually since I'm here why don't I play
around with some stuff here that I
didn't cover I'm also going to come in
and I'm gonna target the first item
right here that guy right there pick one
sorry I'm jumping around I'm just
thinking of different ways to
incorporate all the different things I
wanted to teach here because there is a
lot of it let's say that I wanted to
take this guy picture one that's what
I'm targeting here and I want to move it
over one call what I could do is I could
just go include and then free and put in
one like that and you can see it moved
over I can also pretty much in exactly
the same way or a complete opposite I
could go pull save that it's gonna move
it to the left one space and there you
can see it moved over different ways to
move these guys around we also have
prefix which is gonna move our content
one column and by content I mean
whatever is inside the element so you
can see pick one there is moved over and
you could also move it to the left by
putting in suffix shoe elf and there you
can see pick ones
over to the left a couple other
different ways to manipulate your
elements using Susy now let's get back
to content bar once again I'm gonna add
padding to the sides so let's go padding
and then zero and let's say we want to
add 10 pixels to the side we could also
go margin top and get our gutter like we
did previously to add that as the margin
and now I'm gonna go in and get our
first child inside of there which is
gonna be content 1 and if I want it to
take up 6 of 12 we just go include span
6 of 12 we could also add a specifically
sized gutter before after inside or
split which means part's gonna go on one
side and one's gonna be on the other
side here I'm going to say that I want
to add 3 am inside I must say gutters 3
am inside we could also do the
breakpoint thing so that this content 1
and content 2 are going to be on the
same row except in the situation in
which we have our browser sort of shrink
down and then it's going to have them
take up all the rows could do that by
just going include breakpoint these
breakpoints don't have to be the same
either and here we'll have that this
will take effect whenever this is less
than 40 e/m and in that situation we're
gonna say include span we'll say 12 of
12 which means it'll take up all the
columns and then we'll go in and do the
same sort of thing for the last content
or content 2 over here just by targeting
this and you've probably guessed it it's
gonna be include span and I want to take
up the last 6 of the 12 spaces that are
allotted total for the entire grid and I
could do the same exact thing I could
take this breakpoint and make sure that
it takes up 12 of 12 in a situation
which the browser windows Strunk down
and there you can see that guy is going
to take up all that space the reason why
we have them included together or push
together is because this gutters part so
if I take that out of there I want the
gutter to show you can see the gutter
shows and also you can see that if I
shrink down the browser window up see
the content split down and that is being
caused by the breakpoint so there you go
guys hope you guys enjoy Susie it's it's
a
a lot of fun it's a very nice grid
layout framework that I personally think
is much better than bootstrap and please
