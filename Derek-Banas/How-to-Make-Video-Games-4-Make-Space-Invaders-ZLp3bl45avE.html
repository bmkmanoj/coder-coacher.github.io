of my how to make video games video
tutorial series in this part of the
tutorial I'm going to show you step by
step how to make space invaders and also
I'm going to get in depth using GIMP and
how we can create pixel arts and
everything of course is going to be done
in unity and like always all the code
all of the sounds and all the images are
available in the description underneath
the video and now I'm going to jump into
the future and show you what the final
game looks like okay so here is the
finished game and we're going to play it
just so you can see what it looks like
and here it goes so we're going to be
able to run around here and shoot a you
can see it's a little bit more
aggressive than regular space invaders
you can see sound effects and everything
that's going on on the screen the space
invaders are or the aliens or whatever
are moving a little bit slower than
normal space invaders but whatever you I
set this whole entire game up so that
you will be able to change all of that
and make exactly the type of game that
you want to make you can adjust the
speed of the spaceship the aliens and
everything else so there's a quick run
down and look at our finished product
and now I'm going to start making the
game alright so now we are in Windows
and we are going to create everything
and what I have here is GIMP and what
I'm going to do is show you how to
create some pixel art whenever you
download gimp and just type GIMP into
google it's the only GIMP that's going
to come up and you're going to install
it and this is the Windows version and
everything works exactly the same on
immunity as well as with GIMP
whether you are on Windows or you are on
Mac OS so what I want to do is show you
how to set up everything because it's
kind of a pain very first thing you're
going to want to do if you're like me
and you want GIMP to look like a regular
application is to come up here and click
on Windows and then go single window
mode there you go now it looks like a
real application so let's open it up you
can see all the little tools over here
but we're going to be mainly using
shortcuts and the very first thing I
want to do is I want to create my sprite
sheet so I'm going to go file and I'm
going to go new and I'm going to
basically decide how big I want all of
my sprites to be and you want all of
your sprites to basically on your sprite
sheet be the same size so I'm
guessing that I am going to want my
sprites to be about 16 pixels wide and
20 pixel or 10 pixels deep or high so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
change my width to 160 and I'm going to
change my height to 20 so there's going
to be two rows and 10 on each row well
10 on the top and whatever alright so
there we go we created that so there we
are and there you can see our sheet and
what I'm going to do is if you click on
Z that is going to allow you to zoom in
that's lowercase Z and I'll show you all
these different little tools here the
shortcut you're going to need now
basically you're going to need a couple
different tools you're going to need
free select which is this guy up here
you can switch to that just by clicking
on F lowercase F and you see it's
selected you're going to need your
pencil tool which is down here and you
can go to that just by clicking on
lowercase n and you can see that's
selected you're going to need your
eraser tool which is uppercase e and
there that is and your and then you're
going to need your color picker which is
lowercase o alright so you're going to
need lowercase F lowercase n lowercase O
and capital e and for most part that's
going to be all you're going to need in
regards to shortcuts now I'm going to go
in here and actually select all these
guys and set them up
well you know what I'm going to do first
is I'm going to set up our layers so
that we can have ping files that are
transparent now how you do that is you
come up here and you click on layer and
then you click on transparency and then
you click on add alpha Channel
that's the very first thing we're going
to do and then you're going to come over
here which is where you have all of your
layers you're going to click on this guy
right here
there's the layers menu and then you're
going to say new layer and then down
here make sure that transparency is set
like that you can leave everything
exactly the same and then you can click
on OK then you come over here and just
get rid of this all together with delete
layer alright so there you go now you
have a transparent pink file that you
can work with now what we want to do is
come in and set up all of our tools so
that we will be able to properly use
them for pixel art so to do that I'm
going to come over here and I'm going to
find my pencil
there's my
so it's already selected I want to come
down here and sighs I'm going to set
this to one and then I want to click on
the brush area here and select the pixel
all right so all that set up properly
I'm also going to want to come down here
to dynamics and I'm going to
specifically say that I want dynamics
off
so there's dynamics off and now that's
selected my opacity I want that to be
100% so that's already 100% so I don't
need to change anything then you're
going to want to do the same thing for
your eraser so you either can click on
uppercase e or you can just click on
that whatever you want to do and you can
see that this is already set for one
pixel this is one pixel opacity is 100
diamonds are off so everything is good
right there up no you want also you want
our hard edge checked and everything
else is perfectly fine and then we have
our free select tool this guy right here
little lasso lowercase F is how you get
that and here you want to make sure that
anti-aliasing and feather edges are both
checked to off all right so now we got
that all set up now what I want to do is
go in and set up my backgrounds so what
I'm going to do is go up here and go
view and this is just the way I like to
do it some people are fine with what's
on here but I'm going to say show grid
then I'm going to go up here again and
I'm going to go image and configure grid
which is this guy right here click on
that and then you can define exactly how
you want these set up you can see the
grid over here on the right side of the
screen I like to have my spacing set for
one pixel so I'm going to have that go
down to one pixel now you can see
there's one pixel over there on the
right side of the screen in my line
style you can do whatever you want um
you know there's - that's kind of nice
you could have intersections that's kind
of what I like and that's one we use
yeah it's all personal preference
whatever you want to use of course
there's no you know guaranteed perfect
way of doing anything I don't want to go
to edit and then come down here and
click on preferences this nice little
gap pops up I'm going to click on
display and I'm going to edit my
transparency to the way that I like it
like again once again I just you know
I'm just showing you what I like and I
prefer dark checks and then I like also
check size medium mm I don't know
basically I'm going to set that to large
and that's going to basically be one
whole pixel and I'm going to click on OK
alright so now we have everything set
up here pretty nicely and I want to
specifically come in and well let's go
and zoom remember just a Z that's going
to zoom everything in and then I'm going
to come in here and drag over everything
oh that's going to start at zero and I
want my each of my pixel art pieces to
be 16 pixels wide
except 11 12 13 14 15 16 right there and
then I'm going to drag this guy down
here until I get to 10 all right so all
of these are going to be 16 by 10
alright and I'm going to drag some more
of these guys out so this is going to be
32 and then this is going to be 48 and
so forth and so on you guys know how to
do math I don't hate to go through all
that alright so switch back to Z and I'm
going to come in here and I'm going to
draw some pics Lord I'm going to draw
one of them on Oh a lot of waste
everybody's time so I'm going to click
on lowercase n and I want to get a color
here so I'm going to click on the black
right here and let's just say this is
going to be like a blue color that looks
perfectly fine let's just let it be
green whatever click on OK that's all
good and then we're going to come in
here and we're going to basically just
draw a picture okay so I'm going to come
in here and one row down I'm going to go
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and I'm just going to draw
like a Space Invaders type of character
inside of here and I'm going to go over
two more spaces and draw another one
inside of there and come down on one
more row and draw another one inside of
there and then I'm going to go one two
and there's going to be like eyeballs 1
2 2 more eyeballs and there you go and
then fill out the rest of this bottom
like this going to spaces and fill that
right there and fill that right there
over a little bit draw that there draw
that there
let me fill this guy in right there and
fill that like this okay there you go
there's a space invader guy and you have
the general idea of how those are going
to work and then what you're going to do
is well you can just get my were at work
and use it or you can come in here and
draw all these guys out and just try to
Center them inside of these boxes but
I'm just going to leave it like that and
of course you're going to save it as a
ping so you're going to go file and
you're going to come down here to export
as and you're going to call it whatever
space and they
blah blah blah blah and then select file
type by extension you're going to click
on this and I'm going to save everything
as a ping file so you just want to go
through here until you find ping file
and there's ping image and that's great
and then you're going to click on export
and then what we're going to do after we
have exported all that is we're going to
open it up inside of unity all right so
here's unity I'm going to go new and I'm
going to give this a name so I'm going
to call this space invaders and this is
going to be 2d and I'm going to or I'm
going to save this let's just click on
this and see where I got it all right
that looks good click on unity you can
see right there are my space invader
assets going to I'm going to be loading
in here I'm going to click right here
and go new folder and I'm going to call
this space invaders and it looks
perfectly fine and whoops space invaders
select it and then I'm gonna come down
here and click on select folder and then
click on create project alright so
everything loaded up very first thing
I'm going to do is I'm going to select
main camera right here and I'm going to
come over and make a couple little
changes I'm going to change my
background color to black so just click
on that and then this little guy comes
over here and we're going to select
black way down here to very bottom and
then close that off so everything's
gonna be black and you can see it's
black down here now and then going to
change my size to 40 which is actually
80 it's just like half of your viewing
window area and everything else here
looks pretty good so I don't need to
change anything else there so there we
go we have our camera already set up now
I'm going to come in here and get all of
our folders that we're going to need I'm
going to do this in the assets section
so I'm going to click on that and go
create and I'm going to create a folder
and we're going to be doing a lot with
prefabs this time so I'm going to create
a prefabs folder and don't worry about
it I'll explain them in massive amounts
of detail we're also going to have a
scene and we are going to also have
sounds and we're going to have sprites
and that sounds about good ok so that's
good now what I want to do is I want to
just save my scene right here so I'm
just going to go save scenes and I want
to give this guy a name of main scene
good enough and I'm going to click on my
toons folder and that's where all my
scenes are going to be saved and I'm
gonna click on save and if you come over
here and click on scenes you can see
main scenes in there already now I'm
going to go and get all of my assets and
drag them in here so I have all of my
assets right here so I'm going to select
my different sounds that I have so I'm
just like guy and there's another
way of filing another way I found out
with and those are all the different wav
files that I have I'm going to get that
drag that over here and drop it in
sounds and then I'm going to come in
here and get all of my images so there
is that that's a pullet there's a
horizontal wall there is a space invader
sprites that's what I created in GIMP
create all this in GIMP and there's all
these other things so we got all of our
different images and drag those into my
sprites folder and drop that in there
alright so got all that set up and let's
just minimize this and you can see all
the sprites right there I'm going to
come in here and I'm going to select my
space invader sprites and I'm going to
go over here to where it says sprite
mode because right now these are all
images and I want to split them up so
I'm going to go sprite mode and we click
on single and I'm going to change this
to multiple and then come down here and
click on apply then I want to click on
the sprite editor button and the sprite
editor is going to open up over here and
they might be kind of blurry but not a
little kind of cool all right that's
good then I want to break them into
individual images so I'm going to come
up here where it says slice click on
that and no I'm not using automatic I'm
going to go grid by cell size and then I
know how big these are because I you
know already did them in GIMP so I'm
going to go 16 well I can just go like
this that's actually too slow so let's
just do this
let's go 16 by 10 and then I'm going to
click on slice and whenever I do that
you're going to notice that it is going
to break all those images down into
individual sprites and and then after
that you click on apply' forgot to do
that and unity warned me and told me and
what's cool is all of my sprites are now
right there and you're going to see if I
click on them that they are going to
show up well very very tiny up here
they're actually blurry if I really zoom
in I don't know if you can tell but
they're very very blurry so what I want
to do is I want to select these guys and
I want to do this with all my images I
want to go pixels per unit select that
and make that one and then
and I'm going to come down here to
filter mode and I'm going to click on
points and that's going to make all my
images really really short and I'm going
to do the same thing for the bull oh
yeah click on apply' okay click on the
bullet do the same exact thing so I'm
going to go one and bi-linear and change
that to point and then click on apply
remember that time horizontal wall do
the same thing select it one come down
here by linear points and apply I
already did that for the sprites the
square pixels per unit one and bi-linear
points and apply and vertical wall one
and points and apply all right so I got
all of my sprites all the proper size
now what I would need to do is go and
set up all of my walls so I'm going to
go up here I'm going to grab this
horizontal wall that I have here drag it
over inside of here and look you can see
that's all messed up so let's go in
let's zoom out of this guy and you can
see right here is our camera and I'm
just going to position this in a
position that looks about right so zoom
in a little bit whoops that's good a
little bit more all right so now I can
grab this and sort of drag it around
move it around the way that it looks
right all right so that's going to be my
top wall and I could do this as a prefab
which I'm going to talk about later on
but I'm not going to do it because
everything's perfectly fine the way it
is right now so I'm just going to drag
that in there and it looks about right
and then I'm going to grab a vertical
wall and there those are let's drag it
over here and position it I'm just
eyeballing this by looking at the game
at the bottom you normally would do this
very very exact I just want to it's
perfectly fine the way it is so and then
grab another vertical wall and drag that
in there and pop it in basically the
walls are just going to act as collision
centers for our bullets and other random
things in our game alright so there we
go we got all those set up inside of
there and now I'm going to give these
better names so we selected that this
guy right here is going to become top
wall so let's just go in there and
select it and change it to top wall and
we'll select this guy and that's the
bottom wall so let's go and grab that
and bottom wall and
we'll select vertical wall that's going
to be our left wall so come in select
that as well there's left wall and then
this guy of course is going to be right
wall now I want the like I said before I
want my spaceship at the bottom of the
screen to collide with my walls on the
left and the right and also I want to be
able to catch bullets that the aliens
shoot as well as my bullets and like
kill them so what I'm going to do is
select all of my walls all right like
this and then come over here and click
on add component and physics 2d and box
Collider and that will put box colliders
on all of them and it will automatically
handle all of the collisions and we can
leave everything set as default
everything's going to work exactly the
way I want it now what sorts of things
am I going to need script wise inside of
here whoops I forgot to put scripts so
I'm going to go in my assets right and
I'm going to go folder like this and
then I'm going to create a scripts
folder there we are how do I forget that
and then I'm going to think about all of
the different types of files that I'm
going to need so let's go in here to
scripts and what types of things am I
going to need well I'm going to need
aliens of course so create c-sharp
script and this is going to be alien so
there you go that's perfectly fine I'm
also going to need to have alien bullets
so let's go alien bullets the aliens
need to be able to shoot me and let's
create another one creates and c-sharp
script and I'm going to need bullets for
myself so there's my bullets and of
course I'm going to need a spaceship to
represent myself so space ship and
that's going to be for the bottom of the
screen and then I'm also going to need a
sound manager so those are all the
things that I can think of that I need
script wise inside of my application now
I want to come in here and go and
actually set up my spaceship and test
some things out so I'm going to go into
sprites and where's my spaceship well of
course my spaceship is hidden inside of
here space invader sprites so I
specifically have it in the 8th section
and you can see it's right there so what
I'm going to do is just grab this guy
and throw him
roughly where I think it makes sense for
my spaceship to show up now this is
taking up way too much space so I'm
going to have to resize it and I'm
thinking that probably about half of
what it is is where it should be so
let's change that to half over here in
the inspector and there we go
so yeah the spaceship looks much better
we can zoom in here and sort of move the
spaceship down further to the bottom of
the screen so there's our spaceship
looking really good now I'm going to be
doing a lot in regards to layers and
what I mean by layers is let's say I'm
trying to think of an example let's say
that my spaceship is going to shoot
bullets of course it is well if a bullet
comes in contact with my spaceship I do
not want my spaceship to explode or
react to said bullet in any way by going
and giving objects layer names and then
saying that the different layers should
not interact or they should ignore each
other that is going to save a lot of
collision error problems that you're
going to have with your game so right
now as I have my spaceship set up here
and I'm also going to come in here and
change the name of this so let's go
space ship and there it's a real name
now so as that is selected whoops as
that's selected I'm going to come over
here and I'm going to start creating
some different layers I'm going to use
tags to say if an alien bullet hits my
player I want it to explode so I'm also
going to create some tags and you can
see here there are nothing set up that
you know what why don't I just use
player that works perfectly fine for
that and layers I have nothing here that
works so I'm going to select that and
I'm going to come in here and give this
a layer name I'm going to call this I
could call it player but I'm just I'm
gonna call it spaceship so spaceship and
like I said you layers are going to
allow us to say this game object should
ignore this game object and the tags are
going to allow me to say hey what did I
just collide with what was it this
specific tag name and if it is then use
that okay so there we go I got the
spaceship all set up there's a lot of
things I'm going to have to do with my
spaceship so let's select the spaceship
here I have my sprite renderer and I'm
going to be changing the sprite renderer
to an explorer
oceans by Trender where's that at that
is what I save it at there it is there's
the spaceship explosion but I'm going to
do that in code and I'm not doing that
in this part of the tutorial all right
select spaceship and I'm gonna come in
here and add a whole bunch of different
things we have our sprite renderer and
everything's perfectly cool with that
we're also going to need a rigidbody
because we need to be able to move our
spaceship so click on that click on
rigidbody 2d I do not want my spaceship
itself to interact in any way with
anything so I'm going to set its mass to
a very small number no gravity I'm going
to move it on my own I don't need
anything being figured out collision
detection continuous and interpolation I
want that to be nice and smooth so
that's the reason that's going to be
selected and everything else there is
going to be perfectly fine I could come
in here since I'm already setting all
this up and go scripts and go spaceship
drag that down here and drop it inside
of there that'll work perfectly fine
then whenever I add that code that'll
all work and also I'm going to need a
box Collider because I'm going to have
to track whenever my spaceship gets hit
by the walls as well as by alien bullets
so I'm going to go throw a box Collider
inside of there and the great thing
about that well I am going to use is
trigger and that is just going to call a
specific method it for my spaceship that
is going to wait for triggering events
don't worry you're going to see that so
nothing to worry about I'm also going to
go into rigidbody here and goes
constraints and freeze rotation Z so I
don't want that set all right so there
we are spaceships all set up everything
except for the actual code so why don't
I come in here and actually go and get
my spaceship script and let's go write
some code just to test that out and this
is automatically going to open up Visual
Studio you need Visual Studio community
2017 for this tutorial it's free so just
go download it if you haven't already
okay so here is my spaceship and I'm
gonna start writing some code so what
sort of things am I going to need to
know about my spaceship
well we always anytime we have we are
going to be moving anything we are going
to need a float that is going to
represent the speed of said object and
I'm going to use 30 because that's a
default that I use a lot and it normally
works I'm also going to make it public
so that I will be able to set it
in the inspector outside of here my
spaceships also going to be shooting
bullets I don't really have I don't have
a bullet game object yet though so I'm
just going to put it inside of here and
as a comment so I'm going to go public
and game object and I'll just call it
the bullet because that works perfectly
fine for me for now I'm then going to be
moving this guy on my own so I'm going
to come in and I'm going to call fixed
update anytime you have a rigid body
you're going to be using fixed update to
move it and then this is going to be
moving on a horizontal plane so I'm
going to want to get the horizontal
presses key presses on keyboards so I'm
going to go and get that is equal to
input and I showed this in the pong
example so you go access raw horizontal
if you want to be able to get input in
regards to horizontal commands that are
done on a keyboard here let me jump into
unity and remind you of that if you've
never seen that before so you go in here
you're going to click on edit project
settings and then input right over here
and whenever you do you're going to see
access show up right there click on that
and here's horizontal and you can see
right there so if I want to move to the
left I mean we're going to click on the
left arrow button or I'm going to click
on a if I want to move to the right I'm
either going to click on the right arrow
button or I'm going to click on D ok so
that's what I'm referencing code wise
right there to jump back in there and
that's what I'm doing I'm saying hey are
they clicking on a are they clicking on
D if they are then I want to do some
stuff which is move the spaceship now be
able to do that I need to get a hold of
the rigidbody component attached to this
so I'm going to go get component and
then I say exactly what component I want
I want the rigidbody component and then
I'm going to set my velocity which is
going to move it around on the screen so
velocity is equal to and then how you
move things are with vector vector twos
anyway especially whenever you're doing
a 2-d game then you're going to pass
inside of it horizontal move I'm only
going to be moving on the X plane not
the Y plane so the Y plane is going to
be zero
I'm going to multiply that times speed
and that's going to define how quickly
my spaceship moves on the screen I'm not
going to need a start I'm not
initializing my spaceship in any way so
I might as well just get rid of that
altogether however I am going to need
update so let's come in here for my
update basically what this guy is going
to do is it's going to fire bullets
anytime a space bar is going to be
clicked on and then it's also going to
play a sound effect whenever the space
bar is clicked on so what I want to do
is I don't have the bullet created yet
so I'm just going to come in here I'm
going to say if and I'm going to once
again check the same input that I
checked up here except this time I'm
looking for a space bar click and to do
that to get a specific button click you
go get button down and there that is and
then you specifically look for what
you're looking for and jump is going to
work for me in that situation so I'm
just going to use jump and jump once
again is in the input just like we saw
previously and then jump is represented
with a space bar it's kind of a dirty
way of doing it you really should go in
there and create your own input and then
assign it to the space bar but I'm just
doing it this way perfectly funny and
then inside of here I want to both fire
our bullets as well as make a bullet
firing sound well I can't do either one
of those because the bullet hasn't been
created and the sound manager hasn't
been created so what I want to do to
finish off this tutorial is actually go
in and create the sound manager so I'm
going to save this guy for now and come
back to it so here I am back in unity
and I'm just going to double click on
sound manager to get that to open up and
there it is now for the sound manager
just like I did in the pong I want there
only to ever be one sound manager
because there can't be any more so I'm
going to save that inside of the class
itself so public static and sound
manager and this is just going to hold
all of my sounds and I'm going to define
them inside of here and then I'm also
going to play sounds you're going to be
able to say hey sound manager play sound
and roll automatically clap I'm going to
allow the user to come in here and store
their different audio clips that they
want to be able to use so audio clip and
here are the audio clips so let's come
in here sounds and what do we have we
have alien Buzz one alien Buzz - alien
dodge bullet fire and ship explosion so
let's define those names inside of here
so alien buzz one and I'm going to have
a whole bunch of those so copy that five
to be exact and there's going to be
alien buzz - an alien dies and we have a
bullet fire and I'm going to have ship
explosion all right those are all good
I'm also going to have to get a
reference to the audio source it's going
to be added to the sound manager to play
my sound effects I'm going to make that
private because that's not something
user would change so I'm going to go
audio source and then sound effects
audio then down in start I'm going to
initialize everything which is basically
just going to create a single instance
on my sound manager so I'm going to say
if my instance is equal to null well
then in that situation I want to create
a sound manager so I just go this and
there it is and then otherwise I say
else if there's a sound manager that's
not equal to her that is not yeah not
equal to null well then I want to
destroy it so I'm going to say instance
is not equal to this then I want to
destroy it it's very easy to destroy
things in unity game objects and the
game object that I'm destroying here is
the sound manager that I don't want to
exist then after I have that all set up
to find my audio source and then I just
get the component assigned to that so
get components audio source and then
sound effects audio is going to get the
source that I just created okay whoops
the source there it is then the last
thing I need to do for this I do not
need an update last thing I need to do
is provide a function that any other
game object will be able to call to play
sounds so I'm going to say public void
play one shot and this is going to
receive an audio clip and there is the
clip and then to play the audio clip I
go sound effects audio whoops play
whoops
keep clicking on your own button play
one shot there
it is and then I play the clip that they
sent in which is also going to be
assigned to my cell manager so let's
save that jump back over any unity here
we are going to get my Sound Manager or
create one anyway and how I build my
sound manager is to go into our
hierarchy and go create and then create
empty call this Sound Manager sound
manager select it again come over here
and go add component and specifically
I'm going to look for audio and audio
source I'm going to go and get my Sound
Manager script that I just created so
there that is drag it over here and drop
it right inside of there you can see all
the sounds show up then I'm going to
open up my sound folder and drag all
these into place so I'm going to go
alien Buzz one goes right there alien
buzz two goes right there alien dies
goes right here bullet fire goes right
here and ship explosion goes right there
I don't need to loop anything all these
sounds are going to be one offs and I'm
not going to have any background music
this time and the last thing I want to
do before I forget is to go and select
all of my walls so there's all my walls
and I want to go and give them tags so
I'm going click on that click on add tag
and then just double click on this and
click on wall there we are and save once
again top wall bottom all left wall
right wall untagged let's change that to
wall and then go into layers and once
again add a layer for this and this is
going to be a wall layer and that it
looks good once again select all of my
walls go into the layers section here
and then select wall alright so there
you go guys that is a lot of information
I promise next time I'm going to do a
lot more with prefabs for all of our
different alien ships and prez anything
you want to see in regards to future
games and so forth of course leave those
in the comments and like always please
