and writing reports and doing a lot of
research and analysis I thought I would
be a reliable person for you to receive
information on in regards to how to
study so in this video I'll go over the
core methods used by successful students
and I feel very comfortable in saying if
you follow this study plan you'll
increase your overall comprehension with
less effort and time and stress and I'll
also go over exactly how I'm able to
create these long tutorials in just
about two hours a day here's the overall
breakdown of this study method video I'm
going to cover the basics of studying
how to manage your time the best
environment for studying how to take
notes taking notes in non-technical
classes how to study for science and
math classes studying the day before the
test how to take a test and how I
specifically study most people study by
reading their notes over and over
normally the night before a big test
this brute-force method doesn't work and
instead just tires your brain all the
techniques I'll cover here just require
you to create more order in your life
and note-taking if you do that you'll
score higher grades with less time and
stress most successful students have
very good time management skills they
break down their study and fun time into
small organized bits they understand
that we have become multitaskers by
Nature so to maximize their ability to
retain information they focus on
studying for 50 minutes at a time with
breaks in between these are the most
important concepts that you need to
understand you can never miss a class
tests are based off of what the
professor's thinks is important and not
the textbook you will minimize your time
studying by getting your questions
answered in class as well if you ask the
professor questions until you completely
understand the solution this will also
save you a lot of time studying also you
want to focus on internalizing
information over time rather than
through all-nighters use cliff note
books or online videos like this or the
Wikipedia to avoid reading entire novels
you'll also learn easier by breaking
study time down into 50-minute intervals
with 10-minute fun breaks in between try
to do most of your studying during the
day and schedule your classes later in
the day if at all possible here are some
great ways
manager time so you can maximize your
ability to study keep a calendar of your
to do's and stick to it
include everything on your calendar even
fun activities and grocery shopping make
accurate assessments on how long each
activity will take in your calendar
don't allow yourself to break your
schedule when you do break your schedule
note why you did it
if procrastination caused a bad grade
look at the reasons you broke your
schedule get your friends to keep
accurate schedules and force each other
to stick to them make sure that you
always fill your studying time
throughout the day with both subjects
that you enjoy studying and subjects
that you do not enjoy studying you don't
want to ever have days where you're only
studying concepts and ideas that you do
not like and here is a simple sample
calendar you can see that I broke down
basically everything into little blocks
and of course I have essential things
that I have to do that don't relate to
studying and of course some of these
might be taken up with work I know
whenever I went to college
I was working and in my modern day life
obviously I work a lot as well but
always scheduling fun and remember that
whenever you do have one of these blocks
where you are going to be reviewing
history notes for example you're going
to be reviewing from 4 to 450 and then
have something fun or interesting to do
thereafter you must remember to take a
break every 50 minutes because it has
been proved that this is the best way to
keep you stimulated and keep your brain
working properly whenever you do take
these breaks you want to make sure that
this break will stimulate another part
of your brain so you could do something
like exercise or scanning the internet
listening to music chatting with a
friend solving a problem from another
class a totally different subject just
make sure that you keep your break to no
more than 10 minutes so what is the best
environment for studying well part of
your environment is what you put in your
body a healthy diet will dramatically
improve your ability to think so make
sure that you do the following drink
lots of water if you do drink coffee
start off drinking straight coffee and
then slowly slip over in the decaf as
quickly as possible so you don't get too
jittery that also impedes your ability
to study and of course avoid foods that
contain high fructose corn syrup fat or
large amounts of
and caffeine and to maximize your study
time you should study alone in a place
with no outside sound or distractions
look for places that nobody goes to
avoid areas where any conversations are
going on any musics playing any TVs or
playing anything you want to search for
complete silence the worst places you
could possibly study are in your bed in
your dorm room or areas where large
numbers of people meet or even areas
where just a few people are meeting
because you want to avoid any
distractions as I mentioned before it's
best to study early in the day and not
late at night so how should you take
notes when you're in class organize
note-taking is extremely important use a
laptop if possible and if not organize
all your notes in a composition book
instead of a bunch of stray pieces of
paper composition books are those black
and white spotted ugly books but they
are very good for organizing information
there are two different types of classes
and each requires a different form of
note-taking you have your technical or
your science classes and then you have
your non-technical classes in non
technical classes you want to focus on
the big concepts instead of copying down
everything the professor says your notes
should focus on the following the main
questions proposed by the professor the
answer or conclusion to that question
and in between all the evidence that
leads to the final conclusion the
ultimate question and answer are
normally made very very clear by the
professor so you just need to make sure
to ask the professor to list exactly all
the evidence that got him to the answer
if it is not completely clear to you if
you gather all this information in class
in an orderly manner using an outline
which I'm going to give you a
demonstration of here in a second you
probably can skip most of the required
reading and then go on the best
internalize that information by skimming
through the required reading while
noting the questioned evidence and
answers using Cliff's Notes Wikipedia
online articles and videos and other
things that you come across and then you
want to turn all of these notes again
into an orderly outline and here is a
very very simple example of an orderly
outline here's the question that will be
proposed what type of restaurant has the
best possibility of success and I'm just
pulling this out just to give you an
example and you can see here I have
pizza has a very high margin meaning
that the cost to produce pay
very inexpensive while the price that
you can charge for pizza is very high
pizza's easy to make pizza doesn't
require a large investment machinery and
etc and then end that off with the
conclusion selling Pizza increases a
restaurants chance of success that's an
example of how I outlined things after
you gather your outline you want to ask
the professor or TA for any specific
dates facts etc that you will need to
memorize in sciencebase classes you want
to focus on how problems are solved and
what tools are used to solve them when
you're copying down the solution takes
special care to document exactly how the
problem is solved if you miss any part
of the solution make sure you ask the
professor to explain what you missed
you're paying them it's their job to
teach you even though sometimes you have
to force them to do so you must
completely understand how to solve every
problem in science classes if you don't
get it work on these issues and groups
focus on what makes a specific problem
hard to solve figure out what core
principle you do not get take these core
issues to TAS and have them explain them
TAS or teacher's assistants have the TA
explain what specific formula solves the
problem and why it is used at the TA
make notes on why they are solving the
problem the way that they are break down
the problem-solving into a series of
steps that you can internalize take
sample exams - TAS and have them work
through the concepts you're struggling
with as well now that you have the steps
outlined do the following to completely
understand them memorize formulas by
using flashcards or by recording your
own voice and then listening to all of
these things that you're trying to
memorize but make sure that you spread
memorization over time only try to
memorize a couple core principles at one
time then have problems set aside that
you can work on during to your 10-minute
breaks I'd also like to make a special
note that you should utilize supplement
books that focus on explaining
complicated subjects in simplistic ways
for example I don't think I could have
made it through eight different calculus
classes without calculus made easy for
example now force yourself to not only
solve the problems but also to explain
why you solve the problem the way that
you did what you need to do here is to
become the professor after you can do
this the test will be a breeze now we
get to how you should study the day
before the test since you've taken the
time to prepare
this will be very easy for you the day
before the test review each problem and
explain to yourself how it is solved
solve the problem by writing it out
explaining it out loud and through
pictures in your head think of it in
every possible way possible make sure
you're aware of the format of the test
of course is it going to be an essay
multiple-choice etc just ask your
professor for specifics the main focus
of your review then should follow these
rules review the questions you wrote
down in class and then write down from
memory the evidence that leads to the
final solution speak these answers out
loud while visualizing them if you feel
yourself getting distracted walk around
or go off and think about something else
for a little bit and then come back and
as you completely understand each
concept check them off then go back and
review those concepts you're having
trouble internalizing for science
classes create a problem for each core
tool you need to use solve these
problems until the steps are
internalized you can explain them step
by step if you can't explain step by
step how to solve a problem you must
focus on it until you do
well now it's test day and you should
have no problem with the test when you
get to the test scan through all the
questions this will prepare your brain
for what lies ahead
this will also relax you and allow your
unconscious mind to work through the
problems ahead of time remember as
you're scanning if you see an easy
question go ahead and answer it to
manage your time take the amount of time
provided to finish the test subtract ten
minutes and divide by the number of
questions after your time is up move on
to the next question and then use the
remaining ten minutes to go back and
sharpen up your skipped questions and as
a final note before you write an essay I
personally found that it's very helpful
to actually write out your bulleted list
your outlines that you created starting
with the questions the evidence and
finally the final answer I receive
emails asking also all the time how I
create these articles in such a short
period of time well I pretty much use
the above techniques - the professors of
course and the only difference is that I
know how to speed read I actually
developed the ability by accident
because I used to scan almost every
single thing that I read speed reading
is not some weird voodoo skill is just
developing the ability to quickly grasp
the main concepts on each page of text
the easiest way to do this is to force
yourselves to stop sub vocalizing what
you are reading some vocalizing is when
a person speaks the words that they are
reading either out loud
or in their head after you're able to
eliminate this need to sub vocalize read
by moving your finger at a consistent
speed over the words like this that's
alright I'm talking about just like that
slowly increase your speed then increase
your ability to skip over descriptive
words or conjunctions
so in conjunctions are connecting words
like and or above above the block so you
just want to just moving finger
consistent speed increase ability skip
descriptive words you want to just skip
out all the things that are garbage in
here like this stop localizing that's
really all that's important here stop
vocalizing while reading as long as you
know it's like vocalizing me then you
want to focus on the core concepts start
moving your finger over entire
paragraphs instead of just sentences and
after you have nailed these skills
you'll be able to move your finger
vertically down the page and capture all
the core subjects as I am doing here
well I hope this strategy is very useful
to you I've everybody that I see who
succeeds normally in education and so
forth follows these core principles and
it's really just a matter of organizing
both time and notes and it leaves tons
of time to have all kinds of fun well if
you don't know these questions actually
come from you this whole entire YouTube
thing and videos on my site all come
from people submitting questions to me
so if there is a topic you would like me
to cover or question that you have I
will do my best to answer anything sent
to me just so you know my upcoming
tutorials are how to make cartoons how
to make iphone apps how to write secure
code how to cook healthy recipes how to
knit how to read financial statements
and a whole bunch of other things and if
you want to be alerted to when my next
tutorial comes up which pretty much
comes up every single day make sure that
you subscribe if you have any questions
or comments leave them in the comment
