15 of my programming with python 2.5
through 2.7 tutorial today I'm going to
show you how to develop GUI applications
with the TK interface well to do this
first off we're going to have to import
said interface and I'm positive you know
how to do that if you didn't see the
other tutorials definitely look at them
I accidentally put another import in
there and pour it and then we're going
to also import another module that is
going to allow us to pop message boxes
up on the screen to create a basic
interface with Python and TK interface
and there's a million with different
ways that this is pronounced I just
pronounced a TK interface I do not know
the definitive name from the inventor of
Python and then I'm going to define what
I want my GUI interface to be named and
I'm just going to call it GUI example
then you have to define how big you want
your applications show up on the screen
and you use the geometry method for that
and I'm going to make it 450 and make
sure put an X in here 300 plus 200 plus
200 this is an arbitrary thing you can
make it whatever you want obviously and
then main loop and that's all you have
to do and you can see GUI example popped
up here on the screen with the right
dimensions and everything and you're
probably saying boy that's really boring
so I'm going to show you how to make a
button because that is quite impressive
of course actually first I'm going to
show you how to make a label I'm going
to define label text and this is going
to be the string value that is going to
show up inside of said label and to
actually set that value you have to call
the set method and I'm just going to say
click button okay then you have to
define the attributes that you want your
label to have by calling the label
method and starting off with app which
comes from up here if you're wondering
and text variable this is going to set
the value that is going to appear in the
label and I'm going to find a height
equal to 4 and then this is very
important you want to type call the pack
method
and if we run this you can see right
here click button but there's no button
to click so let's make ourselves a
button as you can see this is all very
very simple and I'm going to show you
here in a minute you're actually going
to be able to call all kinds of
different methods based off of
interaction that you have you can also
create a check box and check box val is
my variable name it is not a specific
name and let's say i want to enter only
integer c this allows you to enter
strings this allows you to enter
integers well of course i could allow
for a string to be set if somebody
checked my checkbox but let's just say i
didn't want that to happen and I'm
pretty much doing the same thing here
again and this is actually a label
that's going to appear next to the check
box and let's just keep this simple on
that you can see the check box happy
appears over here now what I'm going to
do is create a bunch of different things
you're right in a row like let's say we
want to be able to accept information
from a customer and it's going to be a
string and we're going to have the
original value being done and I'm going
to name this your name equal to entry is
very important you have to call the
entry method and I'm going to have the
value that shows up in here be equal to
customer name well since you didn't
enter anything that's going to show
nothing on the screen and then call
pac---- again and that will throw it
there could also create some radio
buttons and this time I'm going to make
the value stored based off of the input
equal to a string and I'm going to set
them by default to none so that they do
not show up checked this is very
important with radio buttons you could
only select one of them so all my radio
buttons are actually going to have the
same name here even though they're
separate and let's just say we're doing
single all the codes available at new
think tank by the way it's all free and
it's all whatever you want to do with it
I don't care and this time what I'm
going to do is I'm going to call a
method with command here so that means
whenever one of these radio buttons is
clicked it's going to call a method
called been clicked and then just to
show you you can pack
at the end of the screen here and I'm
actually going to just copy this and
copy and paste that in there and this
time gonna see married
copy paste okay same thing all over
again and I'm going to show you what
this method been clicked is going to
look like here in a second but first I
have to create a button and there's
going to be another tutorial that
follows us to explain all the things I
couldn't Jam pack into this one tutorial
it's kind of complicated and I'm going
to give it the default value of click
here this is for the button again and
I'm going to give it a fault width of 20
and with command I'm saying if this
button is clicked I want to call a
method called change label and with
command and defining that if this button
is clicked I want to call a method
called change label and then close that
off and then button 1 dot pack and here
I'm also going to define the position by
default it's just going to continue to
put these down here so actually
technically don't have to do this but I
want you to know bottom I could also put
top left or right I'm also going to show
you how to use padding so that the
button shows up real nice on the screen
and it's just padding for X and padding
for Y and make that 15 and I'm going to
screw up here and I'm going to create my
methods that are going to be called then
clicked so previously where that's going
to be called and whenever it's clicked
what I'm going to do is I'm going to set
the value for the variable radio value
equal to I'm going to call Arielle's
status remember where I did this say
arielle status and then I have variable
right here is Oriel status the
relationship status is what that stands
for and I'm going to say get from that
what it's going to do is again it's
going to call the bin click method and
then the value of radio one is going to
be stored in single and then up here
that's what I'm getting from it so
that's what's going on there and now I'm
going to call message box show info
these are all methods that you have to
call these are all not invented names
these are real names so definitely use
these very specific names I'm going to
say you clicked and then radio value and
return then there was another method
that I called down here called command
change Lai
so I have to create a method called
change label and this is just going to
change this label right here name is
equal to thanks or the click and I'm
going to call the get method to get the
value they entered down here see your
name your name get that's how I get that
and then I'm going to set label text
using the set method and I'm going to
set it to this string that I just
created here should actually be label
and then what I'm going to do is call
I'm showing you a lot of methods here so
I know this this is something you have
to kind of digest but I never looked at
a bunch of video tutorials and while I
don't like to say bad things about other
people I didn't find them to be quite so
terribly useful and this might not be
useful for you either
and what I'm doing here is I'm saying as
in essence I want to delete everything
so when I delete what they currently
have set in the name field that's what
this method does and I want to delete
from the from the zero index to the end
and then you need to say at what index
point you want to start whatever you're
going to put in here and I'm going to
put in my name is dark and return if we
run this you can see all these little
things popped up here on the screen so
you see here let's just go through it
one by one click button this is the
label text this is the label that you
created it has click button set as its
default I haven't done anything to this
yet so that's what it's going to be
default then you have the check box that
I created see text happy and I can check
this or do whatever I want because I
don't have a command set like I do down
here and then this is where I'm asking
for the name right here customer name
string value none see there's nothing in
there right now that's because I have
none right here and then I'm using
customer name for the value inside of
here which you're going to see in a
minute then you have a radio button
single and married and whatever one of
those is clicked let's just click it
see that's whenever the message pops up
in that message box right here this is
where it it shows up you clicked and
then the value of radio value pops up on
the screen and then you have the guy
that does a whole bunch of different
things which is the button you can see
bottom so it is set for the bottom of
the screen and it's going to call change
label you can also see it's nicely
padded and everything
on the screen so what's going to happen
change label when I click this button
it's going to say thanks for the click
and it's going to get the value that I
put in here so let's just type in Paul
and it's going to create this string
called name thanks for the click and in
this situation it's going to return the
name Paul here and then what it's going
to do is it's going to set the label
text begin this guy up here to this
string that I created right here and
then what it's going to do is delete
Paul out of here with this method and
insert this string instead all with one
press of the button boink thanks for the
click Paul my name is Derrick so that's
a rough sort of quick way to work with
methods calling methods and GUI tools
with TK interface if you have any
questions or comments leave them below
otherwise till next time where I will
talk a little bit more about the TK
interface</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
