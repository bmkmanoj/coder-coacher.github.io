presentation on distribution of wealth
in America I'm gonna explore net worth
of individuals in the United States to
the utmost detail and for the most part
almost all of this data comes from the
most recent version of the Federal
Reserve Board survey of consumer
finances however I did take some
information from the IRS tax stats
website as well can look up both of
these things online they're very easy to
find and my goal here is to get you to
look at the facts and come to your own
conclusions about how we got into the
current situation on which we are if you
want to see my presentation on the
current state of the United States
economy I provide that here as well as
how we got ourselves into this situation
because of the financial collapse and in
this presentation I did my best to turn
thousands of documents into very easy to
follow pie charts and graphs you can see
right here in this simple pie chart
exactly how wealth or net worth is
distributed throughout the United States
by net worth I mean all assets - all
liabilities that's not worth and you can
see in this handy dandy little pie chart
here that over 70% of all the net worth
of the United States is controlled by
the top 10% of the nation and here I
further broke those numbers down the
bottom 25% have average net worths of
around $4,600 and to the utmost extreme
you can see people in the top 400 which
is basically all the billionaires in the
United States have a combined assets of
over 1.7 trillion dollars and in my
opinion and the opinion of many others
this Forbes number is drastically below
what the real number is you can see here
from 1989 through 2007 the increase of
net worth of all individuals within the
United States and this gray bar right
here represents the top 10% while these
bars down here are increments of 20
below that so that you could see here
from 1992 through 2007 which is the most
recent data that I have we've seen a
dramatic increase in overall net worth
of the top 10 percent here I break down
those numbers further showing the
precise numbers so people in the top 10
percent 1989 at an average net worth of
seven hundred and ten thousand dollars
and that has since grown to 1.6 million
while those in the bottom 25 percent
went from 2500 to 4,600 as I previously
stated and here I further illustrate net
worth divisions between the different
income group
sort of the different networth groups
and you could see just how dramatic the
overall net worth of the top 10% is in
comparison to the other net worth groups
so how exactly did we get in this
situation well I went back as far as
1947 and you can see here demonstrated
the difference between income this
number right here represents the top 5
percent of all income earners in the
United States in 1947 and here you can
see that same group controls now 43
percent of all earned income this number
right here represents 25 so this will be
the top 25 from the next bottom 25 this
is the bottom 25 you can see here that
overall incomes haven't really changed
that dramatically so how have we've
gotten ourselves into the situation
where such a small percentage control
such a large percentage of net worth
taxes that's what it comes down to in
1960 the average person in the top 5% is
expected to pay nearly 70 percent of all
of their income to the federal
government that number since now has
dropped quite dramatically as I believe
you can see here this red line then
here's all the other different income
groups I'm gonna get into them as well
and then this would be the top 20
percent this line right here and then I
divided everything down into 20s just
like I did before
so as you can see from this chart the
amount that the different networth
groups are actually expected to pay has
dramatically fallen who ever what a lot
of people don't realize is these groups
don't pay anywhere near the 35 percent
for example that the top 0.1% is
supposed to pay top point one percent
pays right around thirteen percent in
2001 and down to just over 11 percent in
2008 and then you can see also the top
one percent is gone from paying around
34 percent in 1982 about 23 percent the
top five percent went from 27 down to
around 20 and this is true for all the
different income groups the top 5 to 10
percent are supposed to pay around 30
percent can see that they pay actually
right around 12 the next 10 to 25
percent are paying right around 9 or 10
top 25 to 50 percent are paying right
around 6 and a half and then the bottom
50 percent are paying right around 2
percent of their total income to the
federal government so you can see right
there that nobody is really paying what
they should be paying to the federal
government now I'll explore net worth
divisions using numerous different
factors
you can see her on the left the
difference between white networth versus
all non-white and Hispanics in the
United States you can see here the
division of net worth depending upon
where you live in the United States the
wealthiest people living in the West and
northeast while the poorest living in
the Midwest see here net worth based off
of job category and see it's much better
to be self-employed than it is to be
employed by someone else over here you
can see net worth based off of job type
if you are employed by someone else it's
best to be in management net worth of
homeowners versus renters this is quite
dramatic and this is the reason that
many Americans were quite literally
crushed during the economic collapse and
then you have net worth based off of
education level so there's at least a
little bit of proof that it is worth
going to college and you can see here
exactly how the housing collapse
affected overall net worth you can see
here in this chart on the Left home
equity as a percentage of household net
worth in 1999 about seventeen and a half
that means that seventeen and a half
percent of the total net worth that
people held was equity that they had in
their home then in 2007 at the height of
the housing peak this number actually
did touch 26 percent and then you can
see the failed fall off here and you can
see in the chart on the right side of
your screen the average value of homes
based off of net worth and this is in
2008 numbers average value of retirement
accounts again based off of net worth
this representing the top 5% average
value of car based off of net worth I
threw this in here just for fun average
value of stocks based off of net worth
and bonds based off network this chart
represents all non-financial assets and
this chart represents all other assets
and in this chart here I'm demonstrating
average income changes based off of
overall net worth and you can see here
again top 5% average income in 1989 of
about 275 thousand and that number
jumped the whole way up to four hundred
thousand but remember it was an income
that caused this and I was quite amazed
just how much debt these individuals
also had I find it quite amazing that
the top five percent of individuals in
the United States hold over $350,000 in
debt on average these are all average
numbers these aren't medium you can also
see here just a dramatic amount of
credit card debt that people hold and
then here the average owned on home
equity loans which are loans against the
person's home well I
you found that interesting leave any
questions or comments below and I have a
link in the underbar to this full
presentation as well as links to
numerous other different topics related
to the US economy
