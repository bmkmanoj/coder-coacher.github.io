4 of my electronics video tutorial in
this part of the tutorial we're going to
focus in 100% on transistors but we're
also going to review everything that we
covered in all of the previous parts of
those tutorials so if you haven't
watched those you probably should watch
those first otherwise you might be
confused and I have a lot to do so let's
get into it and here you can see the
different schematic diagrams that we
have for transistor and a transistor is
a semiconductor component that is used
to amplify or switch electronic charges
and we could switch charge flow on and
off and we can also amplify small
signals into large ones required to use
other components and it uses a small
current to control a larger current an
advantage of a transistor is that many
of them can fit on a small piece of
silicon and their discovery actually led
to the discovery of integrated circuits
as we're going to see in later parts of
this tutorial and two of the most common
transistors are bipolar Junction
transistors and field effect transistors
and we're going to see a lot of them in
circuit diagrams as a tutorial continues
now we're mainly going to focus on
bipolar Junction transistors you're
going to see a whole bunch of circuit
diagrams in regards to those and bjts
contain both a p-type which contains the
positive charge carrier and an n-type
semiconductor which contains a negative
charge carrier now NPN transistors
contain a p-type between two n types and
PNP transistors contain an n-type
between two P types and by changing the
voltage on the base and the emitter you
control the flow of the current through
the transistor and examples we're going
to show here are going to show exactly
how this is going to work in practice
and now we'll take a look at field
effect transistors now they're going to
contain either a N or P type
semiconductor from top to bottom which
going to conduct charge when the
opposite end or P types on the side
allow for conductivity and whenever the
gate has a voltage applied to it charge
flows from the source to the drain now
to use a water analogy a transistor is
kind of like a faucet that controls the
flow of water with a shutoff valve now
the flow can either be on off or
partially on and in this way it acts
almost like a variable resistor
and here we have a model of an NPN
transistor basically the current is
going to flow through the collector and
base and then flow out of the emitter
and the vbe is going to represent a
diode VCE is the voltage that will
change depending upon the amount of
charge flowing into the base and then
the current that flows out of the
emitter is going to equal the sum of the
current from the collector and base and
if voltage flowing into the base is
below a certain level normally about 0.7
volts no current will flow through the
transistor and as the base voltage
increases resistance is reduced
incrementally and the current through
the collector is going to increase and
whenever the resistance is at zero the
current through the collector will be
equal to the current through the emitter
and here I'm going to demonstrate how
the transistor will break the circuit if
a current isn't applied to the base
which the base is the center part of our
transistor and I'm going to put in an
SPD T switch inside of here
connect this all up and then I'm going
to put in a 10 kilo ohm resistor and
then I'm going to get my transistor and
make sure that that resistor goes to the
base for the transistor as you can see
right there the emitter which is the top
part of our transistor is going to
connect over to the negative terminal
and then we're going to put in the LED
which is going to connect to the
collector and then we're going to put in
a 1 kilo ohm resistor and connect that
to the plus side and we're going to be
using a 9-volt battery and whenever we
switch it on you can see the base is
getting a current it lights up and here
it is not and here I demonstrate the
same with a PNP transistor and an NPN
transistor and we're using a transistor
here as a switch by cutting off the
charge to the base and as long as the
voltage of the base is below 0.7 volts
in the design it is still essentially a
switch and this is why transistors make
great switches because they are small
require little power and can turn on and
off billions of times per second and
those are just a few of the reasons why
they are also used in integrated
circuits and now I'll talk about how a
transistor can use to amplify a current
whenever a transistor is used as an
amplifier you're basically going to
provide just enough current
low to the base to make it functional or
to put it another way the small signal
you want to amplify is going to flow
into the base and the transistor is
going to turn it into a larger signal
now first we're going to put in a 1 kilo
ohm resistor and then we're going to put
in a 100 kilo ohm resistor and I have to
move that up because I put that in there
in wrong place but I'll move that in a
second put my transistor in and there
you can see I have the resistor which is
now going to go in with the LED the long
end is going to go up towards top the
short end down towards the bottom and
then we're going to put the other LED
short end and then long end and this is
going to connect into the collector at
the bottom so it's going to go from the
led into the base and then we're going
to flow our voltage from the negative to
the emitter part of our transistor and
now you can see after we connect this
exactly how it's going to work here we
are using two LEDs to show it how
exactly a transistor amplifies when the
transistor receives a low voltage that
just turns it on fluctuations in the
signal received by the base get
amplified so you can see one LED is
brighter than the other and you want to
use resistors to make sure the
transistor isn't saturated so that this
signal stays stable so as you can see
here let me turn lights off you can see
there is a little bit of light in the
top LED and an amplified light in the
LED underneath and here is a schematic
diagram of the circuit that you just saw
and notice how the low current is going
into the left
LED and also the right LED is lighting
up here and here we're going to slow the
charge and discharge of an LED with
capacitor of course using a transistor
and I actually plug that into the wrong
part of the switch but we'll connect
that and fix it in a second and we start
off with a 680 kilo ohm resistor and
then we're going to plug in our
capacitor and make sure that the shorter
leg goes towards the left and then we'll
connect power to our capacitor and then
we're going to put in a 470 ohm resistor
and plug in our transistor then we want
to make sure that we have current going
to the emitter part of our transistor
and then we'll put in the LED and
course connect our 9-volt battery and
here I'll make a little correction to
make sure that the resistor and the lead
wire there connect to the switch
properly now basically the 680 kilo ohm
resistor is going to control how long it
takes to charge the resistor and the 470
ohm resistor controls the discharge now
when the switch is flipped the charge
goes towards the charging capacitor and
whenever the capacitor voltage reaches
0.7 volts approximately the transistor
turns on the LED the current Rises
through the LED because of the
transistors current gain this allows for
a slow charge time but still a bright
LED and then when a switch is turned off
the capacitor discharges and the LED
dims until the voltage to the
transistors base goes below 0.7 volts
and then the LED eventually turns off
and here you can see a schematic diagram
for the circuit that we just built and
here's our switch here's our capacitors
resistors there's the LED and here is
our transistor and if I close this
switch you pay attention here as I close
it you're going to see current starts to
flow and then the capacitor is going to
get a charge and then whenever I shut it
off it's going to continue to charge it
actually charges longer than that but
you can see here that the capacitor is
actually charging and allowing the LED
to continue lighting up thereafter and
now I'm going to use two transistors and
what is known as a Darlington
configuration as you'll see and we're
first going to hook up our SPDT switch
and then we're going to put in a
resistor this is going to be a 100 kilo
ohm resistor and make sure that the
capacitor the negative lead or long lead
is facing towards the left side of the
screen and then we're going to put in
our transistor then we'll connect a lead
wire from the emitter part of our
transistor and then we're going to
connect the another lead wire to the
collector part of the transistor place
another transistor in make sure you put
your LED in properly and then I'll be
placing in a 3.3 kiloohm resistor and
we're going to
plug that into the positive terminal of
course and then we're going to put in a
470 ohm resistor with a 9-volt battery
and we're going to connect all that up
now this circuit is the same as the
previous except this time I use two
transistors in the Darlington
configuration where they are basically
leading into each other and here are the
current flowing through the emitter of
the top transistor flows to the base of
the bottom transistor so that the
current is being amplified twice and
since we were using two transistors we
require a voltage of one point four
volts to power the LED and here is a
schematic diagram using the Darlington
with the two transistors right next to
each other and you can see here that we
have our switch on and we close it
you're going to see that the current
continues to flow for much longer so
that we're able to continue lighting our
LEDs using the power that's stored up in
the capacitor now we're going to create
a Volta meter which in a pretty neat way
and it's going to allow us to measure
the difference between voltage and any
two points of a circuit first we're
going to put on a potentiometer and
connect that all up here from the
positive sides and the negative sides of
that and make sure you put your LEDs in
properly remember LED long wire is going
to be positive and we're going to put
two LEDs inside of this then we're going
to put in our transistors once again
using the Darlington configuration in
between these two LEDs just as you can
see right there we'll then add in a 470
ohm resistor inside of here to protect
our LEDs and then we're going to have a
lead and then what we're going to be
measuring are these two resistors at the
bottom past the twenty five line or row
on our breadboard and as I said before a
voltmeter is going to measure the
voltage difference between two points in
a circuit now the circuit is going to be
representing the Volta meter and it's
going to lie to the left of the 25 row
here and we are going to measure the
voltage on the right of that 25 row and
we can adjust the resistance of the 50
kilo ohm potentiometer we have here
which is connected to the base of the
first transistor and then as we do this
the LEDs change in brightness because
the resistance is at the basis of both
transistors are going to be equal and if
we turn the dial on the potentiometer
until the LEDs have an equal
rightness we can determine the voltage
by subtracting the percentage turned on
the potentiometer from 100 and multiply
that number times 0.09 to get an
estimate on our voltage now we have a 10
kilo ohm resistor at the top and a 33
kilo ohm resistor at the bottom and if
we measure this with our multimeter we
get six point six five volts we can
verify that with a formula here we just
take those two resistors we had there so
we can take the top resistor and divide
it by the top resistor plus the
resistance of the second resistor and
multiply that times the battery voltage
which is nine volts and you can see here
that comes out to approximately a
voltage of six point nine volts now
using another calculation based off of
the little circuit design the voltmeter
we created in our circuit what we can do
here is if we estimate that the dial was
around 30% it's a rough estimate and
then we subtract that from 109 we get an
approximate voltage for our little
circuit here at six point three volts so
pretty cool little experiment here just
thought it would be fun so there you go
guys there's a rundown of all the
different things you can do with
transistors there's many more things and
we'll be exploring those as the
tutorials continue just want to send a
special thank you out to my patreon
