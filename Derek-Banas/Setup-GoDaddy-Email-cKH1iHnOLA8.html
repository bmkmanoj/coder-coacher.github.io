to set up an email account on GoDaddy
and then I'm going to show you how you
can hook that into whatever mail package
you have on your local desktop and your
home first off type in user ID and
password hit go this is where people get
confused if this is not showing right
here in my products area click on my
products then click on email then come
over here and say use credit under
personal email every domain and hosting
plan gets one free email account then
what you want to do over here you can
see select the domain accounts you wish
to associate so I'm gonna pick one that
I don't have an email selected it hit
continue
email added successfully may take
several minutes for your new product to
become active in your account when it's
ready to log into your account manager
and set up your new email it closed as
you can see it didn't take anywhere near
as long it's already here on the screen
new account so I want to set up account
add email addresses view all so I'm
gonna do an add email address here's the
new account that I just created right
here I'm gonna scroll over here you can
see one available click add email
address type in whatever user ID name
you want they're got that type in a
random password space some mailbox
available make this mailbox a catch-all
what that means is everything that goes
to new Justin or whatever your domain
name is will go directly here so if
somebody types in happy person hat who
just didn't calm it'll go there if they
type anything in it'll go there so we're
gonna say yes we want to do that hit OK
and it's set up ready to go not only is
the domain that I set up set up but any
address or anybody who sends any mail to
this domain at all will go directly to
me so let's say that I want to now take
this information and put it into my
personal desktop and this works on Macs
PC is anything because almost every
email client
system is set up exactly the same so how
do I find out how I'm able to connect to
this it's pretty easy what you want to
do first is come over here to launch
webmail as you can see here this little
envelope with an arrow click on that and
a lot of people can't find this but
basically what to do is put your mouse
over help email client settings click on
that and here you will see your incoming
pop3 server address right there and in
your outgoing and I think these are
always the same I'll zoom in real close
pop dot secure server dotnet I believe
on GoDaddy this is always the results
that you'll get because every account I
have there that's the way they work ok
now I'll go over all the information
that you need to set up your email
account in your client email package
that's on your desktop what you have to
understand is most email clients are
different so I'll just list everything
you need to know to set up the account
all email clients have an option however
in the top bar menu that's called add
account or add mail account or something
like that what you want to do is click
that then you want to choose the option
of setting up a pop3 account your
incoming server is gonna be pop dot
secure server dotnet your outgoing
server is gonna be s is in Sam M is in
mail T is in top P is in pot out dot
secure server dot and et you'll need the
right email address and password
obviously to set up the GoDaddy account
choose the option don't log in with
secure password authentication and then
choose the option check server requires
authentication then normally under any
tab labeled advanced in the window
that's open on your screen you have to
set the port for your incoming and
outgoing server under outgoing you want
to set it for 465 if it's not already
set and for incoming you want to set
that for 995 and that's pretty much all
it takes to set up the whole entire
account on GoDaddy I know it's kind of a
weird tutorial I'm doing it only because
I was asked this question many many
times I wanted somewhere to point people
to till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
