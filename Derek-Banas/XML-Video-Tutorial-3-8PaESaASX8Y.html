3 of my XML video tutorial today I'm
going to cover XPath a ton of functions
more on templates and a whole bunch of
other different things what you see here
on the screen is my new TV shows dot XML
file we used previously and all I did
was I added a description for the TV
show and then I also went in and added
additional elements for actors and then
individual actors the real name their
profession on the show and you can see
all of those elements and how they're
all laid out here on the right side of
the screen along with all of the
different attributes for said elements
so now let's create our XSL file now of
course I went and also reference my new
XSL file which is called TV shows to don
XSL then over here inside of source I'm
going to right-click on this go new you
can't see this view at full screen and
all of the code that's here on this
video is available in a link underneath
of the video then click on other then
this little wizard is going to come on
the screen you want to click on XSL and
then click Next we're going to call this
TV shows two TV shows two XSL and then
click finish so here's our new XSL file
I'm just going to delete this right here
and this right here this template XSL is
going to match for the entire document
but of course I'm going to need to come
up here and say that I want to output
'html so I'm going to go XSL output then
I'm going to say method is equal to HTML
and then close that off I'm going to go
inside the template area and like I said
before XSL template with the match for
this is going to match for the entire
route as well as all the elements inside
of the route and TV show is the root
element for XML file now I'm going to
use apply templates and I'm going to say
select is equal to TV show and then show
which is all the individual show
information then whenever I pay
reference to show underneath here it's
going to automatically print out on our
screen here then after that I'm going to
go XSL and I'm going to do some
unconventional things this time so that
I can show you how to grab different
elements inside of our XML file here I'm
going to match for show and then here
I'm going to go XSL apply templates and
I'm going to say select name and this is
the unconventional thing and I'm doing
it like I said before just like
show you how to grab a whole bunch of
different nodes or elements what
everyone refer to the mass now outside
of this I'm going to go XSL and this is
going to be where a lot of the heavy
lifting is done but I'm going to be
using multiple different templates here
to edit what's going to end up on the
screen so I'm going to match for name
and I've been asked a couple times this
yes you could actually go TV show
/o /name instead of just typing name
here the reason we were able to use name
is the guy calling this is going to be
show which if you go to show it show
obviously knows where name is so that's
the reason why we don't need to use this
long thing right here then I'm going to
create a div inside of here and I'm
going to style it this is going to
contain an image and I'm going to float
it left yes you can do that and then I
need to create my image like I did in my
last part of my tutorial believe me
there's a lot of new stuff coming and
just like before if you want to style an
attribute for set image which is on the
screen just go XSL attribute and then
say what attribute you want to change
which is going to be source in this
situation and then inside of this you
have to say what value you want to
assign to it so XSL value - of select is
equal to okay so now we need the H
reference but remember we're inside of
name so we are right here so if you ask
for the attribute H reference which is
assigned to poster down here it has no
idea how to get there so you're going to
have to first jump out the show and to
do that we're going to go to dot dot
forward slash and then we're going to go
poster forward slash @ sign since it's
an attribute and now we can grab that
attribute that's why I'm doing the
unconventional stuff and there you go
now it's going to pull in that image and
set everything up right after this div
I'm going to throw in another break
statement and then we're going to create
a span and I'm going to style it equal
to and this is how you would change the
color of the text inside of the span but
I'm just going to leave it black and
that's black right there and then if you
want to put multiple different styles
inside of here you definitely can so
let's say I want to go for incise and
fourteen points and there you go and you
don't need that final semicolon and
that's going to create our span for us
now let's start throwing some things in
here so let's say that we wanted to take
the name which we are in name again just
like this if you want to reference what
we're matching for here you just use a
dot however let's say that I want to
capitalize all the letters for that how
do I do it well I'm going to go XSL
you of I'm going to say what I want to
select is equal to but before I get to
that I'm going to go translate and then
I put in what I want to select which is
just a dot
since we're inside of the name field
then I'm going to jump down in the next
part and then I'm going to define what I
want to change so ABC so u X Y Z I'm
going to put in all of these lowercase
letters and say that anytime you see one
of them I want to replace all the
lowercase letters with uppercase letters
and there you go and that is how you
would go in there and make sure that
everything shows up as uppercase letters
and then we're going to close that off
now if you want to reference say a
sibling of the name element I'm going to
put a space and then I'm gonna say was
release in and then I'm going to need to
do XSL value of blah blah blah blah blah
like I've done before except I'm going
to change this was released in so
there's no confusion and now I'm going
to paste that inside of there now if I
want to access release again where are
we we're inside a name and name has no
way of getting released it's a sibling
so I'm gonna have to bounce out to the
root to be able to access released and
that is exactly what I just did right
there and then put a period at the end
of that and I'm going to show you a
whole bunch of other different ways to
access different child nodes and
attributes so let's say I want to go the
star and then paste that inside of there
again and I want to access actor this
time I want to bounce out to show and
then come down here go into actors and
then actor and then real name and
character just like you see right there
so I'm going to go bounce out to the
main element I'm going to go actors and
I'm going to go actor and then I'm going
to go character and then like that and
then we go was played by paste this in
here again and we're basically going to
do the same thing so I can just copy
this right here paste that in there
except this time I want to put the
profession inside of here for the
character in the show so that's how you
would access that pretty simple and then
we'll close that off now another thing
if you would want to see I keep putting
spaces inside of here well if you have
one of these element calls like we have
right here there's no way to just put a
space in there and have it register
however if you want it to show up a
space that is you just type in XSL texts
right like that and then put your space
inside of there now you're going to be
able to put spaces between different
things and then we'll be doing this
again
so just copy that and we can jump down
in the next line just keep this neat and
then after actor we're going to say real
underscore name just keep referring to
this over here on the right-hand side of
the screen you'll see what I'm doing and
then we're going to close off our span
and throw a couple break statements in
here now let's say that I want to get
some other additional information inside
of here so I'm going to create another
span this time I'm not gonna do any
styling to it let's say that I want to
get the release date pretty simple you
probably guess what it is
dot dot and it's going to be release
right like that and then we're going to
throw a break statement in then let's go
and copy this and grab a couple other
different things let's say that we want
to go canceled here we are this
situation where you go and date and then
we want to get the description maybe
again pretty simple and then let's also
say we wanted to get the number of
viewers and let's do some neater things
here so let's go like that and we're
going to go average viewers and then
throw viewers inside of here and there
you are I'm actually going to get rid of
this break statement let's go in here
and grab this guy again which is going
to do nothing except put a space in
there let's just throw it in there jump
down to the next line and then we're
going to go excess so we're gonna go a
value of select is equal to viewers and
then let's say we want to get the unit's
millions again Soho units and that's
going to show the total number of units
as well as viewers and let's throw
another break saving in there then we'll
come down here let's say we want to list
the two main stars that I have inside of
there well we'll just go stars break and
then I'm going to throw them in an
unordered list so I'm gonna go ul and
then I'm going to call for for each
which is going to cycle through
everything here on our screen select and
then I'm going to pay reference to all
the things that I want to sort through
so I have to go actors and actor so that
is from inside of the name element now
you bounced out then grabbed actors then
grabbed every single actor say I tried
to figure out a way of doing this so
that I covered pretty much everything
kind of weird I know well then I'm going
to go Li then we're going to do our
excess so value of select is equal to
I'm going to say character close that
off and then I'm going to say played by
and we can jump to the next line and we
can just copy this paste that there and
then this time remember we don't have to
give the full definition for characters
we're calling it from actor so if you're
wondering why I did that well that's why
and then I'm gonna say real name and
that's going to print out that unordered
list for all of the different stars that
are inside of it and then let's just
leave this span here again and let's
throw a couple more breaks date and
scent just for the heck of it and then
if I file save that and look in my
browser that's built into the editor you
can see that everything's lining up
there and all that different
informations coming out there on the
screen it's a little bit jumbled up but
we're going to fix that a second let's
scroll way back up here right before we
called for it the template assigned to
name to be shut out on the screen and
yes indeed you can come in here and put
other additional information inside of
this template even though you're calling
the other template and let's say that
you wanted to find out what the node
position for show is which version of
show is going to be shown on the screen
right now just type in node position or
whatever you want it to be and then you
just do XSL value of select and we're
going to call a function called position
like that and that is going to shoot out
on screen where the position is for the
node now let's go out of I'm down here
again and I'm going to come into this
part and I'm going to say last and last
is going to give you all of the nodes
that there are which is an output for in
this situation and let's just go nodes
another break statement now let's do
something more difficult so we're gonna
go ratings and I'm gonna say averaged
XSL you might as well just always keep
that ready to be pasted and this time
we're going to go yours then I'm just
going to type in million I think you get
the point of how to grab that attribute
type in viewers versus the average of
the rest how to better say that I'm
going to show you how to format numbers
so let's just paste that in there again
and then let's give us a space here so
that we can see what's going on because
it's going to be a little bit more
complicated so I'm going to select and
I'm going to call another function
called format number and inside of that
I'm going to sum all of the other
television shows so I'm gonna go t v--
show and show and then viewers right
like that and then I'm going to say
divided by and another way to find out
how many different nodes are is count
and that's going to count all the TV
shows and then right after that remember
we're using the format number
function I'm going to say this there's
no chance of this ever happening but I'm
gonna do it just so that you can see
what's going on now if I wanted to be
able to handle thousands and I wanted to
use a comma I would put in this number
sign right here followed by a comma and
then I'm going to put two additional
number signs now you use number signs
whenever you don't know if a number is
going to show up or you don't want to
force number to show up and you use
zeros whenever you want to definitely
have at least one whole number in this
situation and then you put in wherever
you want your decimal to be and then you
put in the number of decimal places you
want to show up on the screen so that's
what that right there means so now we
did something kind of complicated and
then I'm just going to type in million
in a break statement a couple other
different functions that we have like
let's say when to go 3.14 and rounded
and guess what we're going to use XSL
value of select except inside of here
we're going to use the round function to
go 3.14 and you of course you could
throw different attributes inside of
this and you can round in a couple
different ways and I'm not going to go
over every single function here as this
tutorial continues I'm going to cover
more of them but let's just say that we
wanted to get the ceiling and that's
going to round it up and we just call
ceiling instead of round like that
that's going to kick that out and then
we could also do floor which is going to
round down which is also what rounded
does but whatever and then we just need
to change this the floor like that and
that's going to kick out even more
functions and then let's say also that
you'd like to extract the first name of
the actor their real name from the whole
entire name so if we jump over here real
quick see I have all the actors names in
here's real name I have Jason O'Mara in
this situation let's say I just wanted
to grab the first name which is Jason
how would I do that
pretty simple and let's say I wanted to
say something complimentary about the
actor so I'm going to go XSL I'm going
to cycle through all of them I'm going
to go for each select is equal to and
then I'm going to go actors forward
slash actor I'm going to cycle through
all the actors and say something
positive about them using their first
name and then paste that inside of here
get rid of this of course then I'm going
to go value of select and then inside of
this I'm going to use another function
called sub string before and I'm going
to say real name is what I want to be
grabbing out of the
and then I'm going to divide the first
string of the real name element wherever
there's a space because that works
because there's a space in all of the
different names that I have inside of my
XML file and then I can leave everything
else exactly the same I'm going to take
out this break statement and then I'm
going to put and bounce down here and
then allow the for each block to end I'm
going to say are good actors and then
throw my break statement and then as the
final thing we always hear that there is
no I in team so let's see if that's true
I in team come in here get rid of that
of course and then in this situation
basically what I'm going to do is I'm
going to see if one string is in and out
another string so to do that you're
gonna call a function called contains
and then you're going to put your first
string again I'm going to use just a
real string here but you could of course
use one of the elements here by just
putting in value of blah blah blah and
I'm going to put I is in team and then
just for the heck of it another break
statement let's file save it and see
what that looks like and there you can
see if i zoom in here
here is where we capitalize the name of
the show this is all that release
information the star or st. Tyler was
played by detective Jason America
everything shows up beautifully there's
a description average viewer some point
a - here's the stars here they are in an
unordered list here node position 1 out
of 4 and if we scroll down here you'll
see also note position 2 out of 4 nodes
average ratings versus all the other
different shows also over here you see
where we're rounding using all those
different functions also be able to pull
in Jason and Mike or good actors and is
I in team and the answer that came back
is false leave any questions or comments
below otherwise the next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
