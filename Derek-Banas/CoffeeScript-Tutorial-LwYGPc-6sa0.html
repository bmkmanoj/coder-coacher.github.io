CoffeeScript video tutorial in the last
tutorial a whole bunch of people asked
for CoffeeScript videos all of a sudden
so sure I decided I would make them they
in the over the next two videos I'm
going to teach you all the basics you
need to know to start using CoffeeScript
now the first thing you should know is
CoffeeScript compiles into JavaScript so
you might say well why would anybody use
it well it's a language that tries to
improve on JavaScript by taking less
code to do the same things that
JavaScript already does and it uses a
style that is similar to Python and Ruby
that many people prefer also many people
prefer it because of how it uses classes
and because of how it solves global
scope pollution which is caused with
JavaScript CoffeeScript you may not know
is extremely popular and we're actually
ranks higher than more profile languages
like swift Scala Visual Basic and Lua
and now I'm going to jump over and show
you how to install it first thing you
need to do whenever you want to work
with CoffeeScript is you're going to
need to go to node.js org and download
your version of node.js based off of
your operating system everything in this
tutorial is going to work no matter what
operating system you are on and after
you download and install node.js you're
going to open up either your command
prompt if you're on Windows or your
terminal if you are on OSX or on Linux
now inside of your terminal to install
CoffeeScript you're going to type in MPM
install - gee coffee - script and hit
enter and everything's going to install
for you then after that you're going to
go and load up whatever directory inside
of your terminal or command prompt where
you are going to have all your
CoffeeScript files and now I'm going to
jump over and start writing that code
the very first thing I'm going to do is
I'm going to create an HTML file it's
just a basic HTML file and I'm going to
be putting everything inside of a span
so let's come in here and let's just
start typing that in so I'm going to
give it the ID of CS output just to keep
everything nice and simple and
everything is going to work exactly like
JavaScript already works for you in
regards to where you use your different
scripts and so forth and then of course
we're going to load our CoffeeScript
file which is actually going to be a
JavaScript file and that is all we're
going to need to do to be able to load
all those and show everything in the
browser right here I have sublime text
here I have Google Chrome and down here
I have my terminal I'm going to open up
another file called CSV and let's take a
look over here at how we're going to
compile our CoffeeScript files into
JavaScript now if you just want to
compile one of the files all you're
going to do is go coffee - - compile and
then see us Tut dot coffee which is the
name of my file it would be whatever the
name of your file is hit enter and it
will compile but I much prefer to have
everything Auto compiled and to do that
I just type in coffee - WC and then put
a star dot coffee and it will
automatically compile all of your
CoffeeScript files as soon as they are
saved and convert them into JavaScript
files so the very first thing we want to
do is get past the basics if you want to
have a comment just put a hash like that
and whatever you want your comment to be
if you want to have a multi-line comment
you're just going to use three hash
symbols and then three more hash symbols
and that is it so that's how we're going
to comment it's very important to know
that there is no var used whenever we
are creating variables and there are
also no semicolons we're going to be
using white space to define exactly what
we want to do so let's just do a basic
let's create a variable called name and
let's go and type in fill inside of
there now to get access to that span
that I want to output information to I'm
going to go CS output is equal to
document dot get element by ID and most
of the things you're already doing with
JavaScript you can automatically put
inside of CoffeeScript and it's just
going to work so we're going to a CS
output because that is the ID for the
span that I want to output information
to again no semicolons then I'm just
going to go CS output dot enter HTML is
equal to below and we're going to use
something called string interpolation
and this is going to allow us to go and
throw in a variable inside of there
save that you can see it automatically
compiled and if we reload the screen
hello Phil pops up right there
so that is very very basic sorts of
CoffeeScript let's get into more
complicated things basically variables
are going to be strings numbers boolean
to raise objects undefined or null those
are everything you can use so let's
start off with a string and I'm going to
say I'm a string and find that we're
also going to be able to come in here
and check the data types for everything
I want to output some new information to
my span so I'm going to go see s output
and I'm going to say here insert
adjacent HTML and I'm going to say
before end which means that I'm going to
put whatever text I have here at the end
of the span so let's say I say something
like a string is a string and we're
going to verify that I'm going to throw
a break inside of here and let's say I
only want this to output if the variable
a string actually is a string how do I
do that well I could say if type of a
string is string and we could save that
and you can see print it out a little
fill and a string is a string we can
correct this right here just way
throwing a break statement inside of
there and there you go so that's how we
use an if statement as well as how we
check the type of our different
datatypes in regards to numbers and how
big they can be we're going to have
precision issues which I'm going to get
into here in a moment but all
programming languages have precision
issues so let's say one to get the
largest number you're going to be able
to do that in exactly the same way you
would with JavaScript so max value and
let's go and also get our minimum value
so it will say smallest number and to
get that we just change this to min and
let's play around here a little bit
let's go large num string is equal to
the largest number is and then we can
just go and get largest num and
let's do exactly the same thing for our
smallest number small and small and
small once again and here what I'm going
to do is put large num string and of
course all the code that I have here is
going to be available to you in the
description for free of course and will
do exactly you can see here that I'm
able to connect these two strings just
by putting a plus sign so that's how we
do concatenation of strings or combining
of strings and you can see the largest
number is and the smallest number isn't
exactly how those all work out for you
now let's take a look at boolean because
they're a little bit weird you can do
something like are you happy this is a
boolean now all the possible States for
a boolean value inside a CoffeeScript
are not only true and false the true
possibilities are actually true yes or
on and the false statements are either a
false no or off so we could come in here
for are you happy and put no inside of
there if this person is feeling grumpy
and that is completely valid we could
then come in and let's change this up a
little bit and verify that we have a
boolean here so we could say something
like are you happy is a boolean and of
course we would be able to come in here
and check the datatype for this as well
if type of are you happy is boolean and
that will work and if we reload it you
can see are you happy as a boolean pops
up there on the screen so that all works
out perfectly so that's a rough overview
of variables we're going to get into all
the other variables in a little bit why
don't we jump over and take a look at
some of the math functions that are
available to us so let's go and do some
just basic mathematics right here if we
want to perform some mathematical
operations we're going to do it in a
very similar way so we could come in
here and do something like five plus two
is equal to and another thing to note is
if you're using string interpolation or
putting your variables inside of strings
you want them to output you have to put
double quotes around them I'll show you
what it looks like whenever you do not
do that
so we'll just go and perform our
arithmetic inside of there and you're
going to see that yes indeed that's
going to work for us as well let's just
reload it and you can see five plus two
equals seven now let's
here and let's put in single quotes to
see how that differs and you can see
there that the calculation did not take
place so that's just something else to
know about we're also going to be able
to come in here and do subtractions of
course as well as multiplications and
also divisions and then also modulus
which is going to return the remainder
of a division and you can see there how
all those work out for us you're only
going to be able to rely on 16 digits of
precision whenever you are working with
floating-point numbers or decimals
wherever you want to call them so let's
just go create precision test and then
let's come in here and try to add
numbers to it that are past that 16
digits of precision and you can see
right here all we did was add 1 1 at the
end of they're going past that 16 digit
point and you can see that the addition
was actually incorrect so just make sure
this isn't anything special with
CoffeeScript all programming languages
have precision issues it's just good to
be aware of them another thing we can do
is come in and round things so let's say
somebody has a balance of 1563 dollars
and 87 cents and they want you to come
in and tell them how much they would
have to pay on a monthly basis to pay
that off we can come in here and round
that down so only two decimal places
show all we're going to need to do let's
come in and do something like monthly
payment is equal to and inside of here
we can go and say something like balance
divided by 12 and then if we want to
make sure that this only has two decimal
places whenever this calculations
performed we'll just go to fixed and two
you can see there that it went and
perform that calculation and cut it down
so that we have our sense properly
structured there without the to fix that
would have created some big giant long
decimal place thing another thing that's
important to know is there are shortcuts
we can use whenever we're performing
calculations so let's just create a
random number five and then we'll take a
look at what would
and if we go Rand numb and we could just
go plus plus and that's going to
increment that value for us but it may
not increment it in a way that you would
prefer or it makes sense whatever you
can see here is the whitespace I'm using
so that's very important here we're
going to increment it in a completely
different way and then we're going to
take a look at exactly what happens
whenever we use these different ways of
incrementing and why don't we just come
in here and also decrement these so I'm
going to change this to negative
negative and same thing here in there
and here reload it and you can see right
here we started off with a value of five
so why is this five well the reason why
is whenever you use the plus plus after
the variable what that is saying is that
you want to print the current value of
random number which is five and then
increment it afterwards so that's the
reason why it doesn't show but random
number after this line right here is now
having the value of six
and whenever we come down here what this
is saying is that it wants to increment
random number and then print it so up
here it got a value of six right here it
got a value of seven and that's the
reason why prints out seven and whenever
we decrement that's going to do the same
exact thing we're also going to be able
to come in here and perform a similar
type of shortcut addition or subtraction
or modulus or what have you so let's say
we come in here and go random number
plus equals two right like this
and you can see that these calculation
is going to come out as ten so anytime
we want to take random number and add it
to another number and then save it back
into the variable random number we can
put plus equals or we could put a
negative or we could have a
multiplication or a division or modulus
inside of there so that's just another
shortcut that is available to us
whenever we're performing mathematical
calculations using CoffeeScript another
thing it's important to understand is
order of operations so let's say we come
in here and perform some calculations so
we could say something like 3 plus 2
times 5 well if we then come in and put
parentheses around the 3 plus 2 and also
of course did it here otherwise it's not
going to show you're going to say that
we get completely
different information and there you can
see that right there
and the reason why is multiplication has
a higher precedent over just simple
addition so that means in this situation
it's going to multiply two times five
and then add three to it that's the
reason why you get 13 down here however
parentheses have a higher precedent over
multiplication so with that saying is
the 3 is going to be added to the 2
multiply it times the 5 and that's the
reason why we get 25 so it's very
important to pay attention to how we use
parentheses when we're performing
mathematical calculations now there are
a whole bunch of built-in properties and
functions built into CoffeeScript and
they're exactly the same as they are
with JavaScript so we're going to be
able to get the value of e pi we're
going to be able to calculate absolute
values cubed root ceilings floors rounds
log log 10 power square roots and so
forth and so on and you can see exactly
how all those are going to work for us
the absolute value of course is going to
get rid of that negative sign ceiling is
going to round up no matter what it is
that's why we get 7 here floor is going
to round down no matter what the value
is well round is going to round up
whenever this is a 5 it's a 4 so it
doesn't get rounded up there's log love
10 power 4 to the power of 2 and square
root of 1000 and you can play around
with those along with all the other
different math functions that are
available and built into CoffeeScript
and also of course we're going to be
able to come in and get a random value
and how we would go and generate a
random value let's go random number is
equal to we're going to say math and
floor because we want this to round down
then we're going to call the math
library to get us a random number we are
then going to say that we want a maximum
number of 100 and we want a minimum
value of 1 that is exactly how we would
calculate that and then of course we can
help put this on our screen is equal to
and then we'll just
in round Nam reload it and you can see
random number 69 random numbers 98 and
so forth and so on every time you reload
the browser window you're going to get a
different random number there's an
overview of how we can use mathematical
functions in CoffeeScript now let's take
a look at how we can use strings to
start off I'm just going to create two
strings so I'm going to have first-name
and this is going to be Derrick and then
last name and that's going to be baÃ±os
now you're going to be able to
concatenate or join two strings just by
using the plus sign so here what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say first
name plus and I'm going to put a space
between there throw in another one and
I'm going to say it last name plus you
can see right there I went and connected
or concatenated those two strings for me
I could then come in and create a longer
string perform a whole bunch of other
different things so let's say that I
wanted to come in here and get the
string length go get in here and we'll
just say string length and to get it I
can just go along string followed by
length and you can see string length
comes back as 42 we could also get the
index of a matching string and let's say
that we were specifically going to be
looking for the word goes inside of here
and the index for where it goes starts
so we can go index of and then pass
inside of it the string that we were
specifically looking for and it'll pop
back the starting index for it now that
we have that starting index we could
also get a character add an index so
let's say we that we want to get a
character that is in index eight just go
character at and eight and there you can
see a is at the index of eight you also
go and get a substring so let's say we
want to get word at 27 this situation
we're going to use a function called
slice so we want to start at the 27th
index and we want to get up to index 30
so in that situation we're going to type
31 in there because it's going not going
to include this is going to go up to
that point you can see there we got the
word goes could also come in and get
every single care
that comes after a certain index will
say we want everything after the 27th
index we'll just use a more simplified
version of slice you can see it gets all
of the characters that follow thereafter
we're also of course going to be able to
come in and replace different strings so
let's say that we want well let's do
this in a different line we'll get a
long string is equal to and long string
replace and let's say we want to replace
the word for the string forever with a
string that is and on forever we could
do that and then we could come down and
go a new string and just output our new
string and there you can see I went in
and replaced forever with on and on
forever we're also going to be able to
come in and easily convert our strings
into arrays so let's just create a new
variable called string array on string
and then we're going to say split then
we're going to define how we want it to
be split so all of our words are
separated with spaces so we're going to
say we want to split everything based
off of that and I'll give you a brief
introduction to for loops for loop is
going to be used here to cycle through
all of our different array items we'll
get more into for loops in a second but
basically it's going to go to the first
item that's in the array and it's going
to output it then the second then it's
going to output it and so forth and so
on so let's just come down here and
simplify this dramatically instead we're
going to come in and we'll just put the
value of X inside of there and reload
and you can see that all of those
different words are all printed out
there on their own line all because the
break statements right there we could
also come in here and put in a whole
bunch of extra space
save that reload it and you're going to
see there's a lot of additional space
here well what would happen if we wanted
to get rid of that additional space what
we could go a long string is equal to
long string dot trim and all the white
space in the front and the back are
going to be eliminated and we'll also be
able to come in and do a whole bunch of
other things let's get rid of that and
we'll go a long string say we wanted to
convert everything to uppercase letters
and we could also convert everything to
lowercase letters just by changing this
to
though and made a little bit of a bug
here let's go ahead and make sure this
is uppercase with capital C and capital
say I make the mistakes you don't have
to and once we do that you can see
everything's in uppercase and here
everything's in lowercase so there is an
overview of strings now we're going to
jump over and take a look at
conditionals now conditionals with
CoffeeScript is going to work very
similar to JavaScript except we're going
to be using indentation instead of curly
brackets and the different comparison
operators we have available in
CoffeeScript are going to be equals not
equals greater than less than greater
than or equal to and less than or equal
to and the one thing that we need to
know here is in CoffeeScript we're going
to be using equals equals and not equals
and they are exactly the same as in
JavaScript
one two three and one two three not
equals so these guys right here in
CoffeeScript are equivalent to these
guys right here and how they are differ
is in JavaScript
normally this just checks the value
while this checks the value and the type
and the same thing is true with a not
equal wing come in here and we can
create age three and we could do
something like if age we don't need to
use parentheses if we don't want to if
the age is greater than or equal to 18
and then let's output some different
information on the screen so in this
situation what we're going to do is
we're going to say you can vote can vote
also I don't think I mentioned this
before before and means you're going to
put this at the end of the span you
could also come in and type in before
begin and that would put it at the
beginning of the span we can also of
course come in here and also perform we
could use parentheses of course if we'd
like to and I often like to just because
it feels good you can also put multiple
different if statements inside of here
and know that if this comes back true
not only this is going to execute but
also this is going to execute so here we
can say if a is greater than or equal to
16 we're going to say in that situation
we're also going to output you can drive
also of course I know that if H is
greater than or equal to 18 the
that they're definitely going to be
greater than 16 I'm just doing it this
way so that I can demonstrate we can put
if statements inside of if statements
we're also going to able to come in here
and say else if and age is greater than
or equal to 16 if this comes back as
negative let's say they are 16 years old
well this is never going to be reached
so what it's going to do then is it's
going to come down here and check your
age is greater than or equal to 16 and
not situation so this else if is tied to
this zip statement not this one
so in this situation we're going to come
in here and we're going to say you can
drive and then if neither of those come
back positive we can say else and we
could say something like you'll but what
are we going to do in a situation in
which these are single quotes like this
well we wouldn't know whenever or the
one ends and the other one doesn't it
situations in which you want to use
characters in that situation we're going
to back slash them so that's how we'd be
able to use our single quotes inside of
there and here we'll say something like
you'll be 16 soon and get out that extra
little quote and you always want to make
sure that your indents right here are
all indented like that and we can save
that reload it and you'll be 16 soon
shows up right there and if we want to
see how this works we could come in and
change the age to 16 and see that you
can drive pops up there so that guy goes
in there could also use another similar
statement called unless and unless is
going to execute if the test returns
false so what here we'll say unless the
age is greater than or equal to 19 well
I'll put some information here we'll say
you are in school else we can also use
else with the unless statement and here
we'll say you may go to college and you
can see how that works and now let's
take a look at logical operators now
your logical operator is going to be and
or or not and I'm going to show you how
exactly all of those is going to work
for us so we could do something like if
not age is greater than 4 so in this
situation if this comes back as a true
the knot is going to turn it into false
or if it comes back
false gonna turn it into true we're also
going to be able to say or age is
greater than 65 so if the person has an
age that is less than four or an age
that's greater than 65 we are going to
say whether they can go to school or not
and of course people that are over the
age of 65 and go to school just using
this as some example and here will say
you don't remember back slash that you
can use the single quote go to school so
if either of those come back positive
this guy right here is going to execute
and that's what the order statement does
for us then we can say else if age is
greater than or equal to five and when
we will use and that's going to say that
this condition is going to have to be
true as well as this condition right
here age is less than or equal to six so
if both of those are true then we're
going to output more information and
that is going to say go to kindergarten
then we could also say else if age is
greater than six and age is less than or
equal to 18 perform a calculation inside
of here say school grade is equal to go
to grade and we'll get their age minus
five and throw a break statement inside
of there as well and then output some
information on the screen here we'll
just go and get rid of the quotes all
together and instead just put school
grade here and then finally as a default
we can say else and I'll put some stuff
on the screen when we'll just say go to
work and if we save that and reload it
you can see go to grade 11 shows up
there on our screen
another thing comes up a lot is the
ternary operator so let's say you wanted
to set a value to a variable depending
upon a condition so we'll say something
like if the age is greater than eighteen
then I want to assign to the variable
voting age the value of true else I want
to assign to it the value of false that
is exactly how that would work then we
could come in here and voting
and reload it you can see it comes back
as false so that's a ternary operator we
also have a switch so let's create a new
variable here called child age is equal
to 7 this is going to perform certain
conditions on a limited number of
possible values so we'll say if the
child's age is equal to 5 that's what
the wind 5 does then we want to output
some information on our screen in this
situation that information is going to
be go to kindergarten else we can come
in and say when and we could use
multiple values here we can say 6 7 8 9
or 10 so if the value of child age is
any of those different values then we
want to output different information and
in those situations
we'll say go to elementary school and
then finally as a default we'll say else
I'll put that information again and we
don't know where they're supposed to do
or whoever they're supposed to go so
we'll just say someplace I don't know
and you can see there comes back as go
to elementary school other things kind
of neat is let's say we want to do
something if a variable has a value but
not do something if it doesn't let's say
in this situation if age doesn't have a
value what we're saying here is if age
has a value we want to output some
information that's what the little
question mark there does and we could
just say something like age years old
and if age doesn't have a value it will
not do anything but make sure we put
double quotes on this and there it works
that's called the existential operator
that guy right there and we can use it
to do a couple other different things
like let's say we have a variable called
chicken has a value of null and we
wanted to assign a value to chicken name
and we want that value to be equal to
whatever the value of chicken is unless
chicken doesn't have a value and in that
situation we would want to instead
assign the value of Fred that's how we
would do that just a neat little thing
we can do here and you can see right
there chicken named Fred comes back and
then as a final example what we can do
with this existential operator let's say
we have a hold on
different values and we want to go and
perform an operation only if certain
values have a value once again will say
if hat and we can use and or we can use
and I'm going to use and in this
situation just to show you something
different
so we'll say only if hat and coat have a
value do we want to output information
and the information we can put is hat
and then coat but what happens in the
situation we should we have gloves that
doesn't have a value Oh what we can do
is we can say if gloves has a value
that's the text attentional operator
does we're going to output it and
otherwise if it doesn't we're going to
say something like winter gloves and we
can do that reload it and you can see
exactly how that works so that's the
existential operator and conditionals
and a whole bunch of other different
things and I'm out of time in the next
part of the tutorial I'm going to teach
you all the rest of the other different
interesting things we can do with
CoffeeScript but before I let you go
just want to let you know that after I
did about eight tutorials and only earn
3 dollars and 49 cents I decided I was
going to have to look for another way to
fund making my educational videos on
YouTube so I started a patreon account
and I want to specifically thank the ten
people that have currently signed up to
be patrons I greatly appreciate it and I
will be giving you a whole bunch of
exclusive video tutorials very soon and
if anybody out there would like to throw
a dollar at me I would greatly
appreciate it and just like always
please leave your questions or comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
