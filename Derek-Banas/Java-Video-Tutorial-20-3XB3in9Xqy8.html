20 of my java video tutorial series
today I'm going to talk about graphical
user interfaces using swing inside of
Java of course I'm going to be using
something new here someone they have to
import some libraries for somebody I'm
import here is Java dot dimension and a
dimension is just an object it allows me
to store Heights and widths that's it
and then I'm going to come in here and
get himself another library Java on
again and this one's going to be called
tool kits what that's going to allow me
to do is ask different questions of the
operating system and then I'm going to
go import Java X dot swing of course dot
star meaning I want everything and
that's going to allow me to make all
these different components for my
graphical user interface well then if I
want to use or create what are called
frames inside of Java or what everyone
else calls windows Java calls and frames
if you want to create a window or a
frame you go extends J frame we need to
extend this class and you can see
everything else we have down inside here
now what we went into is we want to come
in here and make a call to the
constructor file and you do that just
like that create a new Java lesson 20
object right here and then what you want
to do with our frame is we want to
define exactly how big it is so I'm
going to go this which is a reference to
that frame and then I need to give it
some sizes so I'm just gonna say 400
width by 400 height just to make it nice
and simple and to show you how simple
this stuff is to do I can then just go
this set visible to true and just like
that I am going to open a window on the
screen and as you can see there it is by
default it will set itself to 0 0 for
the screen and there it is up there now
let's say I don't like 0 0 as my default
what could I do
well I could also go this dot set
location relative to different functions
here and all the codes underneath the
video should definitely check it out to
better learn this stuff and this is
relative to and what this will do is it
will actually position everything based
off of what the screen is so there's
another way to make sure that everything
is centered no matter what the screen is
and as you can see there it is centered
right let's say we don't want to do that
and we also want to go through some
other different methods that are
available to us well this is where
toolkit comes in remember I said
toolkits just a superclass for the
abstract window toolkit that's what a WT
stands for and it allows us to ask
questions of the OS so I'm going to
create a new toolkit object type in get
default tool get and provide me access
to a whole bunch of different methods
that I can use here and then you're also
going to get into the dimension part so
here's dimension and I'm going to call
it dim you can go whatever you want and
what this guy is going to do is it's
going to hold the width and height for a
component being the actual screen that
we are going to display our frame on and
and get screen size which I'm going to
be able to call with TK get screen size
is going to return that height and width
well then I can start defining things
based off of what's on the screen so
let's say I go in exposition how I get a
hold of that I'm defining the exposition
for the frame I want to display so I can
just go dim width right like that it's
going to return the width of the screen
that I'm going to be displaying on of
course put a period inside of there and
I'm gonna go to come outside of this
then I'm going to say that I want to get
the width of my actual frame that I want
to display on the screen how do you do
that you just go this get width and then
we can divide that by two that's going
to get me the positioning so that
everything shows up in the center of the
screen
well I also need my Y positioning and
I'm going to be placing everything based
off of the windows upper left-hand
corner and if I want to get height I
just type in height instead of width of
course and height again so now I got my
width and my height of my screen and I
divided my width in my height of my
frame and that's going to be able to
Center everything so how do we position
it with those very very specific
information let's just go this and then
go set location and input X position
inside of here
in Y position inside of here and let's
say you wanted a position in any x and y
position of course you can do that so
that's just how that works and while I'm
at it I might as well just show you how
you would make it so that someone
wouldn't be able to resize your frame
when you put it on the screen just go
this got set resizable and change it to
false it is true by default you're going
to see that it shows up right
senator screen just like it previously
did so that's cool so we're going to be
getting into how to put different useful
components inside of this guy as well of
course one thing we haven't been
defining is exactly what happens
whenever we want this guy to close now
I've been clicking on the little red
button there which means closed but
technically even though Java eventually
going to shut it down as you can see
down here it has not shut any of these
down they're still down here in the
bottom right-hand corner of my screen so
I want to quit all of them this way what
this isn't good for your users you don't
want them to have to go through and quit
everything this way you want to allow
them to quit everything just by hitting
the close button like we did before so
how do we do that you just go this dot
set default close operation and then go
jframe and exit on close which means
when they click that close button it's
going to exit it's going to kill the
operation and then of course we can give
our frame a title let's go set titles
these things are pretty easy to remember
once you start working with them a
little bit and let's just say my first
frame but it's technically not because
we've made a couple other frames but hey
what are you gonna do let's execute it
and see all kinds of things and there
you go my first frame is right here if
you can't see it and there it is
centered and all that stuff and if I
click on the red mark if you look down
here in a little right-hand corner click
on the close button it also closes down
there so there's a whole bunch of things
you just learned about frames and pretty
much the only things you need to learn
about frames now we come to panels
panels are a totally different animal
now you technically could put all of
these comment components directly into a
frame but it's considered bad for what
you want to use or a panel so that means
the frame is the window itself and the
panel is going to surround all of the
components inside of your GUI interface
so if you want to create a panel you
just go J panel and I'm going to call
this the panel is equal to new J panel
right like that now if you would want to
create like a label for something you
know to provide more information how
would you do that well you just go in
here and go J label and I'm going to
call it label 1 you're going to see what
I mean by label here in a second I'm
gonna go new J label and I'm just going
to name my label tell me something just
to put something random inside of there
then I want to add this new label to my
panel I just go the panel
cause that's what it's called right here
the panel and you just click on add and
type in label one and then of course now
I added the label to the panel but I
need to add the panel to the frame
please don't get confused here how you
do that it's pretty much using the same
thing you just go this and then you go
add and you add the panel to this guy
and you'll see here if we execute this
my window shows up but also tell me
something shows up right there and if
you can't see this you can view it
fullscreen it's an HD video so let's
close that let's start adding additional
things to our panels and before we go
let's go over some of the other things
the label system can do so what else can
you do well you could change the text of
a label after it's been created and
pretty simple to do that lets put it
inside of here just to make it a little
bit easier to understand so let's go
label one and then call methods set text
and you use pretty much the same methods
over and over and over again for all
these different components so I'm going
to change the text for this label to new
text after it's already been created and
then I could also create like a tooltip
that means whenever you put your mouse
overtop of it it's going to put up a
little message and let's just say it
doesn't do anything and then we can run
this again and you can see how the
changes are affecting this guy and there
you aren't new text has been set and if
we put our mouse overtop of that there's
a little tool tip that pops up that's
pretty much almost everything you do
with labels inside of here so let's go
on start creating some additional things
how about we create a button real easy
same sort of format that's why this
isn't that hard to remember this stuff
because you're doing pretty much the
same exact thing over and over again so
I'm going to create a new button I just
call it J button and then I have to
define what I want the default text on
it to be I'm going to make it send of
course come in here and put an equal
sign so there you go scroll that up so
you can see everything all at once if
you would want to hide the button border
I'm like I'm going over it like
everything here right now
so why you would ever want to do this I
have an idea of it if you wanted to hide
the puttan border you would just set
border painted to false and that would
hide that border but it's god-awful ugly
as you're going to see here in a second
what else can you do call button 1 and
set content area filled to false that's
going to get rid of the background for
the button which is going to make it
look like
it's not really a button of course you
can go button one set text right like
this and just say new button that's how
you can change the text say sir send
here now it's going to say new button
because I just changed that just like we
did with the label system and then of
course you can also come in here and do
tooltips in exactly the same way you do
labels and you could come in here and
say it's a button and then of course
don't forget to add the button to the
panel and of course that's how that's
done and you won't see that there's a
button now but it's not gonna look like
a button see this is technically a
button but it's really not a button I
mean it doesn't look like a button so
let's make it look like a button how
we're going to do that is just get rid
of this where we eliminated the border
and we eliminated the background just
want to show you everything but as
you're gonna see doing everything
doesn't always make sense and there you
can go now you can see that this really
does look more like a button than it did
previously you're gonna see all kinds of
other styling things I can just only
create so many different things inside
of one tutorial how about a text field
guess what J text field is what we're
going to use here again 1 is equal to MU
J text field and inside of here you get
a define what's going to be inside of
the text field by default so we'll just
say type here and then you have to
define how wide it is I'm just going to
put 15 inside of there and you could of
course come in here and decide that you
want to change the size of your text
field at any point in time how you do
that is call set columns let's say you
want it to be 10 instead of 15 you know
you changed your mind another thing you
could do is change the text of course
and how are you going to do that you're
going to do it the same way you did it
before set text just like that and type
again I don't know I'm just throwing
some text inside here and then of course
you could also set the tooltips and I'm
just going to shave myself some time
copy text field one blank don't put
doubles in there it's a and I'm just
going to type in field and we can
execute that oops what I forget I forgot
to go in here and add it to the panel of
course we need to do that the panel dot
add what are we gonna be adding we're
going to be adding text field 1 and
everything was just going to lay itself
right in there and there you can see now
you have a text field that's pretty
useful
get rid of that now we'll come in here
and we're going to do some more stuff
like let's say you wanted to create a
text area that's just a big giant text
field sometimes with scroll bars in this
situation they are going to be total
scroll bars and it's just J text area
text area 1 is equal to nu J text area I
like that and here we're going to define
how big it's going to be I'm going to be
15 by 20 but this is going to be pixels
of course it's gonna be like letter
sizes or whatever and then I could set
my default text for this guy by calling
set text you've seen that before just a
whole bunch of text that is important
whatever so there's some just random
text adjust through inside of there and
then I can also set exactly what I want
to do with line wrapping and you're
going to see two different types of ways
of doing that so I get a set line wrap
to true and all that means is that I
whenever it gets to the end of the line
I want to skip to the second line just
by default just do it for me you know be
real nice then before you can actually
use this guy you have to create your
scroll bars how do you do that J scroll
pane and I'm going to call this scroll
bar 1 is equal to nu J scroll pane and
then I'm going to say what I'm going to
be adding these scroll bars to which is
going to be text area 1 and then I have
to define exactly how I want the scroll
bars to show up on the screen J scroll
pane and I'm going to say vertical
scroll bar as needed comma like that and
you could also have spurred a cool
scroll bar always or vertical scroll bar
never so those are the 3 different
options and those options are identical
for the horizontals and I'm just going
to use exactly the same thing here
whenever I create the horizontal so I
just come in here and type in horizontal
and this doesn't look like that's
capital nope it isn't alright good and
then at the end of this just put in Sam
a colon of course and then jump up here
and I'm going to say da an old don't add
and type in scroll bar 1 and we can
execute it you can see a text area and
there it is there's your text area and
there's all the other different
components I promise this going
much prettier in the future so don't
worry about that now remember I said
about line rap whenever you saw that
before it didn't look pretty let's let's
execute it see here it cut off important
so let's say we want to have our line
breaks occur but we don't want to split
up the words whenever that happens how
do you do that come in here make a
little tiny change of course it's easy
text area one and then in this situation
we're going to say set wrap style word
to true that's just going to make sure
that the words don't get broken up and
while I'm here let's just also show you
another thing num of lines is equal to
text area one you can use get line count
but it's not technically going to get
you line count it's going to give you
new line count that's what this is but
you know you might need it or something
and another thing you might eventually
need is text area one if you need to
append some information to a text area
which of course you will eventually and
we can just go a number of lines and
pend that information right there and go
plus and then go numb of lines for this
variable we just created here and then
just for the heck of it let's throw in a
new line up here just to make sure that
it comes up with a more than just one as
a number of lines it's going to show us
two and there you can say say number of
lines two and it's the reason why it's
reading the new lines and as a final
couple things here I can show you how to
have focus go on something specific and
you'd actually do this after the frame
and the panels have been created and all
the components like let's say you want
your text field to get focus with the
mouse
whenever the guy opens we just call
request focus right like that and if we
execute you're gonna see that that text
field is gonna get focus immediately oh
yeah see it's highlighted if I start
typing say didn't have to click on it
and then of course you could do the same
exact thing for the text area just by
changing the name this guy right here of
course all the other things are the same
and that would give you focus on text
area there's a ton of things about swing
inside a job and leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
