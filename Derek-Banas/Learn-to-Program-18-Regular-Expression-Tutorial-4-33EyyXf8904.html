18 of my learn to program series this
time we're gonna finish up regular
expressions we're gonna cover or group
we're going to cover some match object
functions that we haven't covered so far
name groups and in this part of the
tutorial we're going to have a bunch of
problems for you to solve to make sure
you understand regular expressions if
you haven't watched in the previous
parts the tutorial I provide a link
above to the beginning of the regular
expressions tutorial and of course if
you haven't watched any of the regular
learn to program series watch those as
well all of the code is available in the
description along with a transcript then
I have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so this is everything we have
learned so far
you've probably heard regular
expressions are so complicated well
right here I have pretty much everything
we have learned all right here in this
one little bunch and of course you can
pause your screen and write this down or
you could go and click on the
description and download the entire
cheat sheet but you can see everything
here I just wanted to show it to you so
that you can see that regular
expressions are really not all that
complicated alright so now we're gonna
jump over and talk about the or
conditional alright so now what we're
gonna be able to do is use this guy
right here we call this the or or the
pipe or a whole bunch other different
things it's over on the right hand side
of your keyboard and what we're gonna do
is we're gonna use it to define the
different matches that you will accept
so let's say we have random string is
equal to and then inside of there we
have a number and then we have dog and
then we have cat and then we have turtle
now let's say we just wanted to be able
to grab the cat dog and cat out of this
guy how could we do that
well let's create a regular expression
and compile that and of course you
probably know that we should come in
here and type in backslash d because we
want to target the numbers and then also
we want to target the period inside of
there and then on top of that we want a
space but how specifically do we come in
here and target either dog or cat well
inside a parenthesis you would just put
dog or cat right like that that's how
simple it is and you can do that for
numerous different types of things and
you can put different types of regular
expresses in there they don't just have
to be just basic strings you know we
could come in and we can find all of our
matches that we have here so far so
regular expression and the random string
that we're gonna be searching for and
then we can go and print this out
matches and then prints and I and there
you can say dog and cat popped up over
there so pretty easy stuff that I'm
going to be doing some more examples
here using or but now I want to jump in
and cover a problem alright so for the
problem or what I want you to do is
create a regular expression that is
gonna match four five digit zip codes or
zip codes with five digits ace - and
then four digits so in this situation
this will be valid and this will be
valid however this will not be valid and
neither will this be valid so you have
all the knowledge that you need to be
able to complete this so pause the video
and try to create it otherwise I'm gonna
create it for you right now
alright so we're gonna be using the or
inside of here and what we want to do is
we want to target any digits that are
five in length so that's what we don't
do for that I'm gonna put a dash and
then another series of digits that are
gonna be four in length like that or we
are going to come in and target just the
number of digits with five and then at
the end of this we could throw a
backslash s inside of it and let's
surround everything that we have here
with parentheses and if we run this guy
boom you're gonna say that disregarded
these two right here that are incorrect
and it grabbed these two which were
correct so hopefully you got that right
if you didn't that's okay but you
probably should at this point after four
videos on regular expressions but either
way we're gonna jump in and now talk
about group alright so we're going to be
able to use group to retrieve parts of
regular expression matches so let's say
we had something like birthday and we
ask the user to enter your birthday and
then we tell them we want it to be month
day
and year with the little dashes in
between there and now we want to go in
and grab those individual pieces so what
we're going to do is I'm going to do a
birthday regular expression it's gonna
be equal to and we could call search in
this situation and then inside of this
what we're gonna do is we'll put our D
like that and we expect this to be two
in length and the parentheses are very
important here so make sure you have the
parentheses around it like that we're
then going to have a dash and then we're
going to go back slash D and we're gonna
put one to two in length for that
actually we should put one to two for
the month as well and the parentheses of
course and then another dash and then
we're gonna come in and also get the
year so let's go like this and we're
gonna make that mandatory for and if you
just want to come in here like this and
do that like that that's perfectly fine
as well and after we get outside of this
we're just gonna go BD for our birthday
and now what we're gonna be able to do
is grab this information in groups so if
you come in here and you say you were
born on and you wanted to grab the
entire thing you would go BD regular
expression and group like that and
likewise in a similar fashion if you
wanted to grab each of the individual
pieces of data you could say something
like birth month and then change this to
one because this is gonna be the first
match inside of there you could also do
birth day and change that to 2 for the
second one and then you could say birth
year and change that to the third and if
you run this guy it's gonna say that it
wants you to enter in your birthday and
you could do something like 1 - 1 - 1990
it's gonna come back you were born on 1
1 1990 and there's the birth month
birthday birth year and you could do
that for any of the other different
options that you have available so there
is another way for us to group and
dissect regular expression matches so
now let's jump over and talk about some
match object functions that we
covered so far alright so there's gonna
be some functions that are gonna provide
more information on your matches so what
we're gonna do here is we're gonna say
match is equal to re search and we're
going to keep this nice and simple let's
just do backslash D and say we're
looking for a two digit number in the
regular expression and we'll just say
something like the chicken weighed 13
pounds now what we're gonna be able to
do is print the match out onto the
screen so we can just print and match
and if you wanted to print out what
matched that specific regular expression
you're gonna use group once again that's
gonna get that just like group got the
answer for you previously we're also
gonna be able to print the start and
ending index of a match and to do that
you use a guy called span and you just
type in span here and said you can also
get the starting index start and how you
get that is just by typing in start and
you could also get the ending index and
how you do that you just come in here
and say end and if we run it you're
gonna see indeed that it works so it
goes in there and it gets the match 413
for that two digits we were looking for
it's also gonna give us the span with
the starting and the ending index and
then you can get those individually
there's a couple other different little
functions we're gonna be able to use and
now I'm going to talk about named groups
now you're also gonna be able to sign
specific names to your matches once
again let's come in we'll just keep it
simple and we'll go random string in
this situation and I'll say December 21
1974 and let's say I want to grab the
month of the day in the year out of here
and let's sign it to what's called a
name group so go regular expression is
equal to and we'll do raw string and say
we want to get the beginning of this
string and then we want to come in here
and do a name
and you just put a question mark
followed by AP and then inside of these
brackets you type in whatever you want
the name to beso I'll say month and I'll
say that there is one or more of those
guys inside of there close off the
parentheses and then I'm gonna follow
that up with a space and then for the
next one do the question mark in P just
like you did before here we'll call this
day and we'll say this is going to be
digits and that's gonna be one or more
digits close that off then there's gonna
be another space and then we're gonna
have another P and inside of the
brackets will type in year and we'll say
digits and that's gonna be one or more
and then close off the parentheses we
can then come in man say matches is
equal to re search hash in our regular
expression and the string that we want
to search for and then if we want to
print out these specific things by name
we can say month and then we'll go
matches followed by group and then
inside of here we'll say month because
that's what we want
group and then of course we're gonna do
the same things for the other different
results so for the next one we could say
day I just change that today and here
and change that to year and run it and
you can see it comes out exactly as you
would think it would so another useful
thing to do because this makes a regular
expression a little bit easier to work
with and that is named groups so now
we're gonna jump over and cover a couple
more problems alright so for our first
problem what I want you to do is I want
you to be able to find the following
legitimate email addresses so you're
gonna have to look at exactly what we
have here this is a legitimate email
address this is a legitimate email
address and yes indeed
this isn't any legitimate email address
so what you're gonna have to do is
create a regular expression that's gonna
be able to grab all of these different
email addresses and then output them on
the screen so go ahead and pause your
screen otherwise I'm gonna create it for
you right now so I'm gonna walk you
through the process here and
there's multiple different ways to grab
email addresses this is just one of them
so I'm gonna say I want this to be a raw
string and then what do I want inside of
that we'll just look at what is asked
for so you can see that there are
letters in there and also there are
uppercase letters so we're gonna do that
you can also see that there's a chance
that there could be a number inside of
there so we're gonna cover that you're
also gonna see that there are
underscores inside of there and dots and
pluses and minuses and that pretty much
covers everything so then what are you
gonna say well you're gonna say that you
want one or more of what precedes that
so put that in there then of course
you're gonna have an app sign and then
you're gonna have the second part we're
going to go a through Z a through Z for
uppercase and then you're gonna say 0
through 9 for the numbers and then
you're also going to allow for dashes
and what do you want you want one or
more of those guys you're then going to
have a period so backslash dot and for
the final part here the domain extension
we're gonna say a through Z capital A
through uppercase Z 0 through 9 and then
a dash and then also a dot and you're
gonna say that you want one or more of
those so there is your regular
expression not that hard you just have
to walk through the process and just
word it out to yourself so we're gonna
say find all pass in a regular
expression pass in the random string and
then if we want to print it out do that
and print I and run it and you're gonna
see that was able to match for all three
of those different email addresses so
hopefully that wasn't too hard
and now I'm gonna give you a little bit
more complicated of a problem okay so
this time what I want you to do is to
match for all of these different types
of telephone numbers and you can see
that there is a wide variety of them
here and to do so all you're gonna have
to do is just say what things have to be
there and what things could be they're
very very important so take a second and
try that out otherwise I'm gonna create
it here right now all right so here's
going to be
regular expression this one's gonna be a
little bit longer than our previous
things so I'm going to walk through the
process so I'm gonna go call compiled
raw string all right so what's the very
first thing we could have here well
first off we want to be able to create
sub expressions but we also want to be
able to get our final results so that
means there's going to be parentheses
around all of this so that's the very
first thing you want to do then the next
thing there is the potential or the
approach potential sorry about that of
having a one at the very beginning but
it is not needed so in this situation
inside of the sub expression we're gonna
put a 1 and a question mark so that's
gonna cover that situation then what do
we potentially have well we potentially
could have a dash inside of here
otherwise or we could have a space
inside of here or we could have neither
in there that handles that situation put
another parenthesis inside of there and
let's go and just for now anyway put
spaces inside of here so we can see a
little bit better what we're trying to
do next thing we're gonna have is
potentially we could have a parentheses
inside of there so we're going to put
inside of a sub expression backslash
opening parentheses and then we're gonna
close not the parentheses off but the
sub expression and then after that we're
gonna put a question mark because we
don't know if that's gonna be there or
not then once again we have the
different digits so we're gonna have
three digits inside here that's gonna be
mandatory so put that like that
close off that parentheses and then we
are potentially going to have a closing
parenthesis but we don't know if we're
gonna have that or not we're also
potentially gonna have a couple other
different things as well so we could say
or and we could have a dash inside of
there or we could have a space inside of
there or we could have a closing bracket
and then a dash or a closing bracket and
then after we have that all defined
we're going to have our question mark
because we don't know if we're gonna
have any of those guys inside of there
or not then after that we're going to
definitely have three digits so let's
put that inside of there
those off that sub-expression and now
potentially we could have another - or a
space so we're gonna come in here like
that
we're gonna put a - or a space close
that off question mark and then we are
definitely going to have four digits
this is gonna be or and four digits and
then get rid of this bring these back
together and it's saying that I have
them unmatched parentheses here so let's
look and see what I may have slipped up
on here ah this guy right here I was
looking for the closing parentheses so
let's backslash that and my error went
away and now it's test to see if I got
this right
something to say match is is equal to
and do a find all on that with my
regular expression and random string and
then for I in matches and it's gonna
give me all the sub expressions I'm just
going to look at that here in a second
but then I'm gonna change it so that I
just get the telephone numbers and we'll
run it and it looks like everything came
out great except in this situation we
have spaces here and we also don't want
all these other sub expressions we just
want the very first one so we're gonna
come in and change this just slightly
we're gonna say print I and I just want
the very first index inside of there and
then on top of that I want to strip off
the trailing or the left whitespace and
run it and there you can see that I was
able to match there's six numbers and on
we have up here one two three four five
six numbers so there you go guys I hope
you got that right
and hopefully you have a great grasp on
regular expressions and how you can use
them if you have any questions of course
leave them in the comment section below
and in the next part of the tutorial I'm
going to cover SQL light or working with
databases so like always please leave
your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
