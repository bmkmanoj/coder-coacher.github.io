video tutorial in this tutorial you're
going to learn pretty much everything
you'd like to know about the groovy
programming language or what you would
normally find in a 250 page book in one
video in the description underneath the
video I have a link to all the code as
well as a transcript for the video and
also timestamps so you'll be able to
jump to whatever you want to learn about
and I have a lot to do so let's get into
it okay to use groovy of course we're
going to need Java so you're going to
want to go to java.com and download and
download at least Java 7 or of course
you can use Java 8 and this is going to
be true if you are on a Mac or you are
on Windows also if you are on Windows
you're going to want to go to groovy -
Lang dot-org download and then just
click on this windows installer down
here and click Next a whole bunch of
times and then you'll have groovy ready
and the rest of this tutorial is going
to work in regards to whether you're on
a Mac or you are on a OSX machine or a
Linux machine now if you are on a
Macintosh you're going to want to go to
brew dot SH and you're going to want to
install homebrew if you don't have it
installed and how you install it is you
just copy this guy right here and then
you open up your terminal and paste it
in our hit enter and that's going to
install homebrew now we're going to have
to do a couple other different things
here also in the terminal on OS X to get
groovy all set up here for you now more
than likely your Mac is going to have a
bunch of different versions of Java
installed so you want to make sure
you're using at least Java 7 for groovy
that is a must so inside your terminal
you're going to type in this line of
code you see right here and hit enter
and then you're going to pick whatever
the latest version of Java is on your
machine I have one point 7.0 underscore
55 you're going to want to copy this and
then inside of your terminal you're
going to want to type in export Java
home exactly as you see right here again
I have these this code in the
description underneath the video if you
want to just copy and paste just make
sure you put a backslash right here or a
back quote right there everything else
would be the same and this guy right
here is going to be what we copied from
what we previously did in the terminal
and you're going to want to
and then you're going to want to verify
that you are using at least Java 7 like
I said so you're going to type in Java -
version and you can see right there that
I have Java 7 set up then to install
groovy you're going to once again you're
going to need homebrew like I mentioned
previously and then you're going to type
in brew install groovy and I already
have groovy installed switch is going to
tell me Groovy's already installed but
you're going to get a message that's
going to say that it's going to install
groovy and then after you do that you
are ready to go now we get to the part
where we are going to set up Adam this
is the text editor that I'm using right
here you can use whatever you want to
use but I just want to show you how to
install groovy package it's going to
make the text look a lot prettier
whenever you're typing in your code so
what you're going to want to do in adam
is go to packages and command palette
click that guy right there you're going
to want to type in install like this
look for install packages and themes and
click on that and then inside of this
guy you're going to want to come in and
type in language and this is on Windows
as well as on Mac and groovy and
whenever you do it's going to open this
guy up and I already have it installed
but you're gonna see a blue install
you're going to click on that it's going
to install it and then everything's
going to work okay so we have Java as
well as groovy as well as the tools that
we need for Adam to be able to write
some good groovy code so now I'm going
to start writing some code all right so
what I'm going to do here is create a
whole bunch of different files this
one's called groovy tut dot groovy
groovy is the extension and I'm going to
create a class right here and I'm going
to call this groovy tut and then we're
all your code is going to run is going
to be in the static void main string
args and I'll show you what our altought
tell you what all this stuff means
static just means that this is a method
or function that belongs to the class
void means that it doesn't return
anything whenever this function runs
main means this is the main executable
function that is going to execute
whenever you call for this file to
execute and this right here is a string
array that's called args and on the
terminal if you would call this program
and pass in a bunch of strings or
numbers
whatever all of those are going to be
stored in this string array so that's
everything that goes on right there with
main so now what we're going to do is
create a hello world thing and to do
that you just type in print line what
this is going to do is come in here
print out whatever text you put inside
of there and then follow that up with a
new line to run your groovy code you're
going to come in and type in groovy
groovy groovy and hit enter and it's
going to run and there you can see a
little world and you're going to be
using the command prompt instead on
windows but everything else is basically
going to be the same now you're going to
be able to define variables or fields
wherever you want to call them by typing
in def DF and then you're going to start
your variable name with a letter and
then you're also going to be able to use
numbers or underscores for the rest of
the variable name now variables are
going to be dynamically typed so what
that means is we would be able to come
in here and define a variable called age
and give it a string name like that and
then come in and give it an integer
value a lot of programming languages
wouldn't let you do this but groovy says
that's all perfectly fine so let's do
some basic mathematical operations here
and here are some basic math functions
so I'm just going to use print line once
again you can see here how you add how
you would subtract how you would
multiply this is going to be using
integer division I'm going to show you
float division or division with numbers
that have decimal places and this is the
modulus and what this is going to do is
return the remainder of a division over
here execute it and you can see exactly
how those all work out
now let's take a look at floating point
math operators because they are
different and here they are and you can
see how they actually differ here if you
want to do addition and this is for
floating-point numbers you're going to
follow this with a dot and plus and
whatever you want to add to it and
there's your number followed by minus
and there that goes and multiply and
here you can also see division and this
is the difference between division with
floating-point numbers and division
using regular integers now order of
operations is going to work in Ruby just
like it lurks in most programming
languages and that just means that
whenever you put a multiplication
somewhere inside of your operation
you're trying to perform that the
multiplication no matter what the order
is here is going to take place if you
don't use parentheses and then the
addition unless we put in parentheses so
let's zoom in here and see exactly how
this all works out for us so we'll say
three plus two times five and then we'll
come in and we'll see the differences
between putting the parentheses inside
of here as well and all you need to
really think about is the fact that
whenever you are putting a
multiplication in here you're not using
parentheses or divisions that those are
going to take effect or those
calculations are going to be performed
before the additions or the subtractions
so that's just a little bit to know
about order of operations and how that
works out for us
now we're going to need to be able to
come in here and use shortcut increment
as well as decrementing of values for
our variables so let's take age here and
that is going to add one to age and
you're going to see here the difference
between putting the pluses before versus
putting them after like we have right
there and then copy and paste that in so
let's come in and move this from right
there to right here and put the pluses
right here and all this is doing is
adding one to age and we can also
decrement shortcut like this and then we
can of course decrement at the beginning
now what this is going to do is in the
situation in which the plus comes after
what it's going to say is I want you to
print the value of age as it is which is
equal to 40 as you can see right there
and then after you print it to the
screen then I want you to increment the
value of age so after this line age is
going to be equal to 41 even though 40
is going to print right here and there
you are you can see that 40 printed out
why because it gets the value of age
before we increment it and you can see
in this situation whenever you put the
pluses ahead of time that it's going to
first add the values remember it's 41
already right here and then afterwards
it's going to
and then print and that's reason why
it's 42 likewise age is going to work
the same way it's going to say hey print
out the value of age and then decrement
it and here it's saying first decrement
it and then print out the value of age
so that's like a shortcut way that we
can increment and decrement values it's
very easy to figure out how we can come
in here and and take a look at the
largest integers as well as the largest
floats and the largest doubles inside of
groovy all you need to do is type in
integer and then followed by max value
float max value min value double so
forth and so on and every single thing
if I didn't say this before inside of
groovy is an object so even age in this
situation is an object and also all
these other different guys and you're
going to see the maximum value so the
biggest integer is going to be that
number the smallest integer is going to
be this the biggest float is going to be
this number and so forth and so on and
as you can see these guys get quite big
and also unlike some programming
languages the decimal accuracy is very
very accurate inside of groovy so there
you go that's a great big giant number
let's come up here and let's do a view
and soft rap so you can see everything
so what I'm going to do right here is
I'm actually adding these gigantic
numbers together you can see how long
they are and there that is and there
that is in some programming languages
this would not properly add however as
you're going to see with groovy they add
perfectly fun and if you go and analyze
these you can actually say that yes
indeed this calculation this is actually
wrong here then I'm having numbers that
are way bigger but you can see that you
can actually very accurately perform
decimal calculations inside of groovy
and know that they're going to work out
for you so there that is and that's very
important as well in regard to math
functions let's come in here and define
another number so we got random number
and let's make this a floating-point
number
and floating-point just means as a
decimal sounds complicated but it isn't
and let's go and show you how absolute
value works and we'll say math to get
the absolute value absolute and negative
two point four five it's
going to go and get rid of that negative
sign and there you can see right there
and just to save us some time let's go
and take a look at all these other
different operations we have here we can
round basically what this is going to do
for us is this is two point four or five
and whenever we round that since it's
under five it is going to round down
words if this floor was a five instead
it would round upwards so that's how
round works power it's just going to
take whatever the value of a random
number is and take it to the power of
three in this situation here we are
checking equality between these two
floating-point numbers with the function
equals here we can also come in and
check if the value or the datatype of
random number is a float see here how we
can find out what the square root of
nine is the cube roots the ceiling what
this is going to do is raise this to
three floors going to drop it down to
two minimum is going to receive two
values and it's going to kick back
whatever the minimum value is and Max is
going to do the opposite and if we run
this you can see all of those operations
and exactly how those work out and it
might help you to click on pause every
once in awhile to take a closer look at
what's going on here
or just move along at your own speed we
have other operations we can perform so
we could come in and do a log function
as well so let's go and get math we do
log blaw regular log or log 10 so we can
go log two for example and to get the
value for that you just go math dot log
two to get that value and that is just
going to be whatever number you provide
to the power of E and you could also
come in and do log ten this is just a
base ten logarithm and that's how that
differs right there we're also going to
be able to convert from radians into
degrees and degrees into radians just by
calling two degrees or two radians and
the calculations you have right there
also we're going to have sine cosine
tangent arc sine X cosine arc tangent
and so forth and so on and that is how
easy those are going to be able to use
those functions and then finally I'm
going to need to take a look at creating
a random function so or a random value
so I'm going to go math and
absolute value I'm going to say new
random followed by next int and the %
and 100 and then outside of that I'm
going to add one to it and if you do
this what you're going to do or what
you're going to get in exchange is
you're going to get a random number
between the value of 1 to the value of
100 and let's come in here and verify
that all that works perfectly fine I'm
just going to come in here and copy this
guy right here
throw some parentheses inside of there
throw that right there put that right
there
execute this and you're going to see
that it kicks back a value of 93 for
that random number generation in here
execute again now it's 24 and now it's
68 so there's a rundown of a whole bunch
of different math operators that are
available for us with groovy now I'm
going to take a closer look at strings
now as per strings
let's go and create a string you say
that just like this and I can type in my
name for example and there you go it's a
string but remember we can throw
integers inside there just because
groovy is dynamically typed now there
are a couple different types of strings
it's going to create a print line let's
put single quotes now whenever we have
single quotes what is going to do is the
string inside of it is going to be taken
literally that means that if we come in
here and we say that we want to put in a
variable like this the variable is going
to be completely ignored
however the backslash or the newline is
not going to be ignored now let's go and
take a look at how that differs with if
we would come in here and put in double
quotes so throw double quotes inside of
here and we'll jump over here and you
can see in this situation name comes
back as just exactly what we typed but
there is a newline and here you can see
that the value or the variable actually
changed and also you can see that I
don't need to put these curly brackets
here I can also leave those off it's
just a convention sometimes people put
those in there and sometimes they don't
and I just want to make you aware of the
differences now there are other types of
strings we could also use a triple
quoted string and this is used for a
multi-line string so let's go and create
this and was just there you go there's
triple
and I could say something like I am a
string and I'm just going to close that
off with a triple string and then of
course whenever we print this out you go
multi string over here execute and it's
going to actually print exactly as you
typed it in on the keyboard across
multiple different strings and you can
see if we put that there
those that and execute that it comes out
exactly as you put it now you're going
to be able to access your string by
indexes we could say something like
let's say we wanted to get the third
index of name each of the string or each
of the letters in the string or whatever
it is characters in the string is going
to be stored in an index here I want the
third one to show up here and let's also
say that I want to get the index based
off of a letter that is inside of it can
also do that so let's say get rid of
this and we could say something like
index of our and to get that guy
we're instead going to say name index of
and then type in exactly what we're
looking for if we execute it third index
of the name is e how did we get to that
well 0 1 2 3 so that's the third index
and here we're asking for the first
letter or that is found inside and you
can see the 2 is returned in that 0 1
and 2
you're also going to be able to come in
and get a slice let's go I can do this
there we are let's say that I want to
get the first 3 characters of a string I
can come in and say first 3 characters I
can just go name and then inside of this
I'm going to say 0 and I'm going to put
2 dots and a 2 and that's going to
return those first 3 characters I can
also get a specific characters so I
could come in and say every other
character and instead of that I'm going
to type instead of 3 anyway I'm going to
type in 0 comma 2 and 4 I can get all
those you can see there that I grab them
say I'll grab the first 3 characters in
this situation and every other character
in this situation grabs D or K
from my name I can also get character
starting at an index so this would be
considered a substring so I want to get
a substring at one and say name dot
substring starting at one you can see it
skipped over the very first index and
printed out everything else I can also
more specifically get characters at a
starting index up to another starting
index so here we're going to say well
let's just change this guy here instead
we'll say substring at one two four and
to get that will just say name substring
leave it exactly the same and then start
this off at four you can see just grab
the e re out of my name will you come in
and concatenate strings quite easily so
let's say we want to just say my name we
can concatenate these guys with the plus
sign so we can just put a name inside of
there we could also come in and
concatenate with the concatenate
function either one is going to work
exactly the same and this situation will
say my name and put dot concat and name
and both of them do exactly the same
thing it could also come in and repeat a
string multiple times so we could say
something like what I said is and then
come in here and put a multiplication
sign and two and that's going to double
up the printing of that string on your
screen we can also check for equality
does Derrick equal Derrick and then
check for equality by saying Derrick
fold by equals and then put the same
exact thing inside of there and let's
copy this and let's do something else
we can also check for equality and
ignore case so here we'll say Derrick
and then we'll change this to a
lowercase D and we'll say equals in this
situation ignore case and then also
change this to a lowercase D and you can
see both those comeback is true we're
going to be able to come in and get the
length of a string so it's linked and we
can just throw a name inside of there
followed by the link and that gives a
total length of our string or the number
of indexes or the number of characters
inside of it I'm going to throw the
repeat string inside of here again so I
can just have a long
string that I'll be able to do some
things with let's say I want to remove
the first of currents of the word what
inside of here you just go repeat string
- and what I want to remove from it
could also split the string so let's do
a print line here and repeat string and
split and what I wanted to split on are
going to be the spaces inside of our
string and also we can come in and go
repeat and do exactly the same thing
read strength convert it to a list and
you'll see how those work out here we
went and split it with all the different
spaces and here we actually win split it
based off of every single character in
the entire list or in the entire string
we could also come in and replace all
strings so we'll go repeat string and
replace all and let's say that I want to
replace all occurrences of the word I
with the word she easily enough you can
also with a simple function come in here
and print all the characters in both
upper case as well as in lower case and
there you can save printed that and
upper case print that lower case and you
can see here where we replaced I with
she across the entire string and then
finally I'm going to show you this
operator right here that allows us to
compare strings
let's go print line and ant fit operator
in there and let's say I wanted to
compare ants to bananas I can command
ant and banana and what this is going to
do is this is going to return negative
one if the first string comes before the
second it's going to return 1 if in the
opposite situation and it's going to
return a zero if the two strings are
equal to each other and we can just come
in here change this to banana instead of
ant and then down here change this ant
and change this to ant come in here and
run and you can see exactly how that
works out we get a negative 1 we get a 1
and we get a zero there's a rundown of
pretty much most of the things you can
do with strings inside of groovy now I'm
going to take a look at input and output
now like I said before with double
quotes we're going to be able to insert
variables inside of our
strings so let's go and create a new
string here let's call this a random
string and let's just throw the word
random inside of here print line and
we're going to be able to say random
string with the dollar sign and you can
see it brewing and automatically took
the random value and juxtaposed it
directly inside of there you're also
going to be able to do the same thing
with another function that is called
print f but you're going to do it in a
different way so here we're going to
throw a string inside of here and then
in this situation going to have to put a
newline inside of there because it
doesn't have one inside but then you're
going to have to put the string that you
are referencing on the outside and
you're going to be able to do the same
thing with multiple different values
with printf so let's come in do
something a little bit more
sophisticated let's say that we want to
put a string inside of here but we want
to have some spaces inside of it we can
go and put a negative 10 inside of there
and you're going to see what that does
can throw a decimal or an integer number
inside of here we can also come in and
throw a float that has a maximum of two
decimal places again we're going to
throw a string inside of here that's
going to have some padding and in this
situation we're going to actually create
a list with all the different things we
want to put inside of here so we'll say
stop at ten and one point two three four
and then the word random executes and
you can see right here whenever we put a
negative inside of here it's going to
put some padding on the right side if we
have a positive number here for the
string it's going to put some padding on
the left side you can see here that it
went and just print a regular old 10
because there's nothing fancy going on
here and here it went and trimmed down
the floating-point number from one point
two three four to one point two three
because we said that we only wanted two
decimal places to show there's a couple
more different ways to output data now
let's take a look at inputting it let's
say we wanted to allow the user to come
in and enter their name so we'll say
something like what's your name we're
going to be able to get that name that
they enter in the terminal by going
system console followed by read line
it's going to read that input the day
sent to us
then we can output that information on
the screen of course so we'll say
something like a low F name and it'll
say what's your name I'll say Derek and
it'll say hello Derek very politely just
remember you're going to have to cast
the input to the right value to be able
to use it so let's say we come in and
with say prints enter a number and here
we'll define a variable we'll call this
one number 1 is equal to system because
everything that is entered in on the
system is going to be a string by
default so it needs to know that you
want it to be converted from a string
into a double before it can perform any
type of mathematical calculations and
likewise we're going to ask them to
enter another number so enter a number
let's just leave it that way we'll
change this to 2 everything else is
going to be the same we're going to
convert this to a double and then we're
going to come in and do a print out
let's go just to reinforce how this
works for us we're going to say do it
we only want 2 decimal places and
another 2 decimal place floating-point
number is going to be equal to and
another 1.2 floating point number and
we're going to go and create a list
let's just create it on the next line so
it's a little easier to see and here
we'll just say number one number two and
perform our little calculation and we'll
say number one plus number two and there
we go it's going to say what's your name
I'll just Derrick forgot to take that
part out enter a number we'll say one
point two and another will say one point
two and two point four comes back so
that's how we can work with output as
well as input inside of groovy now let's
take a look at lists now list is just
going to hold a list of objects with
indexes for each different object you
have inside of your list so I'm going to
create Prime's here so there's just a
list of prime numbers you're also going
to be able to put strings and numbers or
whatever you want inside of there we're
going to be able to get a value at any
of these different indexes inside of
here so let's say that we created this
and then we want it to get the second
Prime in our list easily enough we
justgo primes and - and we can get that
we could also in a different way if you
want to know multiple different ways to
do things inside a groovy well you're in
the right place we can just leave this
be third prime instead third prime and
we'll say primes in this situation
however we're going to say gets and it's
going to be index - in this situation
let's say this is actually going to be
index one so here we're getting the
second prime here we're getting the
third prime and you can see that just
come back it's three and five like I
said before your lists are going to be
able to hold anything so let's say I
create one called
employee and it's going to have a string
inside of it it's going to have an
integer inside of it it's going to have
a floating-point number inside of it and
it's going to have a list inside of it
we're then going to be able to come in
here and let's say we wanted to get the
second number of the list that is stored
inside of our list just do it this way
and we'll say employee like that
and we want to get the third index and
then from that list we want to get the
first number or the second number from
it and there you can see that we were
able to do just that we're going to be
able to also come in here and get the
length of this guy
so let's just come in here let's get rid
of some of this stuff so let's come in
and let's get the length of it and to
get that you just go Prime's and you
follow that up with size except you put
a dot inside of there and you put two
closing parentheses there we're going to
be able to add an index as well so we
can say Prime's and add 17 we'll be able
to append to the right another one of
these guys and to do that you use this
little funky thing and let's say we want
to throw 19 on there could also go and
put in Prime's
add it's going to do exactly the same
thing as that funky operator and we
could throw 23 inside of there likewise
we would be able to concatenate two
lists so we could say something like
primes and then throw in two more
numbers we could remove the last item
from our list by going Prime's - + 31
we'd be able to check if it is empty if
our list is empty and we'll say
is empty and say primes is empty don't
forget to put this little dots out of
there there you are that is a method or
a function that we're going to be
calling we'd be able to come in and get
let's say the first three items inside
of our list by going primes and we'll
put in a 0.2 so we're getting a slice
out of there and we can come in and
print out the whole entire thing and
there you can see the entire list based
off of all the additions and changes
that we made to it we're also going to
be able to come in and get matches so we
can say well we have this one list and
we want to see how it matches up with
another list no problem
so we'll say matches and then we'll say
Prime's
and intersect based off of another list
and this list is going to be two three
and seven
we'll be able to easily reverse our list
by going reverse and primes and calling
the function reverse likewise we'll be
able to sort our list just by putting in
sort instead of reverse and that's going
to sort it in alphabetical order I mean
technically reverse sorts it as well
so just sorting it in a different way
and then finally the last thing that I
can think of that we can do with these
guys is pop off the last item and how
you pop that off is by typing in pop and
if we come in and we run that going to
see all the different things we did
right there there you go that is a
rundown of all the things you can do
with a list inside of groovy now let's
take a look at maps now a map is very
similar to a list the only differences
is a maps going to contain a list of
objects with keys versus just regular
old numbers that are indexes with less
how you create one TEF again and let's
create a paul map that has information
about paul and here is the key so we got
the name and then follow it up with
Paul's name going to be able to store
all sorts of things inside of here we're
going to be
go age and say that Paul is 35 we're
going to be able to put an address or
string inside of here and say 1 2 3 Main
Street and then finally we can also put
a list inside of our map and this is
going to be 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 there you go you
just created a map and don't forget to
put your semicolon there at the end
you're going to need to be able to
access your map with a key
so let's come in do a couple different
things here and so let's say we want to
get name we can come in and just type in
Paul and map and here you're going to
put in a well bit like that you're going
to put in the key that you want to
search for you're also going to be able
to get this in a couple different ways
we're going to be able to use a function
called get so let's say we want to get
age and in this situation we want to get
age using the get method just go get and
then throw age inside of there and let's
also show you how to get a list item so
let's just go and get rid of this guy
and say we want to list item we're going
to go Paul map and you're going to type
in lists instead which is the key that
we are searching for and then you want
to get 2nd item inside of that and
because it's 0 index the second item is
going to be 1 and you can see that we
were able to go in and get all those
different things we're also going to
want to be able to come in of course and
be able to add keys and to do that we
just go Paul mount and put and whatever
you want to give the key name for it's
going to be city and let's so and say
Pittsburgh just because first thing came
to mind we can also check for a key to a
print line and we can say something like
does it have a city key inside of it and
then we can say Paul map and we're going
to say contains key and key that we're
looking for is city and that's going to
return true or false if that actually
exists we're also going to be able to
come in and get the size of our map just
by going Paul map and you guessed it
sighs it's come over here and check out
what we did there you can say all those
things gained by and I think that's
enough of a rundown of maps we're going
to revisit them here in
little bit but now it's going to take a
look at a range and how you would use it
ranges are going to represent a range of
values in a shorthand type of notation
so let's say we wanted to create a range
of numbers from 1 to 10 we just go like
this
and 1 dot dot and 10 and there you went
and created it you're also going to be
able to create another one let's say we
wanted to go from A to Z you could also
do that and just type in an A and dot
dot and a Z and likewise you would be
able to come in and do with this
backwards you could do the same thing
with numbers but letters are a little
bit weirder so I'm going to go and just
do this and experiment experiment
experiment and there you go that's how
we generate a couple different types of
ranges if you man here and take a look
at exactly how those all work out for us
so we can say one to 10 there we are and
you're going to see that it prints out
all those letters and all those numbers
and not just the two that we put inside
of there we can get a size for these
different guys so let's go and get a
size for our range by just going 1 to 10
and calling this size function we could
get a specific index so let's say we
wanted to get the second item in a range
we could do that let's say 1 to 10 and
we'll say get in this situation we can
check if a range contains any number so
we can say it contains 11 for example
let's do this for 1 to 10 and we'll just
say contains and then inside of the
contains method well throw what we're
looking for and we could get the last
item inside of here so get last let's
just use 1 to 10 again get 2 don't throw
anything inside of the get 2 and that's
going to give us our last function and
likewise we're going to do the if you
want to do this in a different way maybe
a the way that's going to work for us a
little bit better we could get the first
item inside of a range by replacing kit
2 with get from and if
run all those functions you're going to
see exactly how they work out there's
the size there's a second item does it
contain eleven no it doesn't this is
going to get so last item in our range
and this is going to get us the first so
there's a rundown of ranges inside of
groovy now let's take a look at
conditionals now the conditional
operators inside of Grove you're going
to be equals to not equal to greater
than less than greater than or equal to
less than or equal to there you go
there's all of them you're also going to
have some logical operators and those
are going to be and or and not
so there they are and I'm going to show
you some examples of exactly how they
work let's go and define ourselves a
variable and it's going to be age old
now with an if statement we're going to
be able to check if age old is equal to
five and if it is we can perform some
calculations and in this situation what
we're going to do is we're going to say
go to kindergarten now if age old is not
equal to that we will be able to say
else if just like you see in many other
different programming languages and
let's combine this up so we'll say age
old greater than five and then we can do
an and statement that just means that
both of these need to be true for the
statements between the parentheses to be
executed and we can just say less than
eighteen so if both of those are true in
that situation we're going to say well
let's go and use printf again print apps
feeling lonely we'll go go to grade and
we're going to throw a decimal place
inside of there and a newline inside of
there and we form a little calculation
here that's age old minus five and then
by default we can go and perform this
last grouping of calculations and in
this situation we'll say print line and
go to college will be the answer there
actually infants would be told to go to
college I just realized but that's okay
the infants go to college as well and
you can see here get it a one or go to
grade one comes back because this is a
six that's a little bit of a rundown of
the different conditional and a lot
operators let's look at a little bit
more on them let's say that we create
another function here and this is going
to be called can vote you can also use
boolean which have a value of true or
false inside of groovy and here is the
ternary operators let's say that one to
come in and get one or another answer
depending upon a condition so the
condition in this situation is going to
be is can vote a true or a false value
you can also put a condition in there
like we could say something like if age
old is greater than five what this is
saying is if this comes back as true
then I want it to say can votes to come
back as an answer otherwise if that or
it can another condition comes back as
false I am going to say can't vote is
going to be what I'm going to return
close that off and those that off up
give me a little bit of an error why to
give me an error oh I know why gave me
an error because I put this right here
let's get rid of that right there
execute again and you can see can vote
came back once again this can be a
condition it's going to be whatever and
if that is true it's going to come back
with a value of can vote where it's
going to go back with whatever this is
as true and this if it is indeed false
and we also have the switch statement
and how the switch works is we can come
in here and we can throw age old for
example inside of here and then we will
perform different code depending upon if
age old has a value of 16 so if it has a
value of 16 we're going to say something
like print line you can drive we could
also come in and go case 18 and we could
say print line let's go and throw this
on a new line here because one says
something else that's kind of neat so
say a print line you lucky devil
you can vote and make sure you put this
inside of quotes and then we're going to
throw a break statement in here now if
you do not put a break statement inside
of here it's going to check if age old
is equal to 16 and it's going to do this
and then it's going to continue checking
if it has a value of 18 and then do this
but what we're going to do
is we're going to leave that out and
it's going to effectively check if
age-old is equal to 16 or 18 and then
the default value if neither of these
are true is going to be print line and
have fun is going to be the answer for
that and then we come in and execute
you're going to see that have fun comes
back right there can also do a list of
options with switch statements so we'd
be able to come in and go age-old and
then to a case and say 0 between 6 if it
has a value of 0 or 0 to 6 and then we
can say print line and the output for
that would be child and we'll throw a
break statement in here on top of that
and let's go and do the same thing again
for a couple more of these then we'll
say if it has a value of 7 to 12 well
then we're going to say teenager and it
has a value of 13 to 18 we're going to
say young adults I don't know if that is
a fact that you're a young adult at that
age just throw it in there just for the
heck of it and then finally default and
we'll say print line and you are an
adult otherwise and there we are child
comes back there is a rundown of some
conditional offers you can use inside a
groovy now let's take a look at looping
now first I'm going to talk about is the
while loop here and with the while loop
you're going to go and define whatever
you're going to be incrementing or
decrementing or whatever with a while
loop outside of the while loop then
let's do something really simple like
let's say while I is less than 10 we
want to continue doing some things for a
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to use an if statement now that we
know how to use conditionals and we're
going to say if I modulus to what this
is going to do is if I is odd it's going
to skip back to the beginning of the
loop and I plus plus that's going to
increment and then continue is going to
skip back to the loop so it's going to
find out if I modulus 2 is equal to true
if it is it is going to increment the
value and then continue is going to jump
back up
here and ignore everything that comes
afterwards otherwise I can come in and
let's say I want to use another one of
these guys if I is equal to eight then I
want to jump out a loop altogether and
how I do that is I use my little break
statement again and if neither of those
comes back as true I am going to print
some information out on the screen which
is going to be the value of I and then
I'm going to increment that and with
those handy-dandy things I can print out
just my even numbers up to six and it
doesn't print out ten because the break
jumps us out and of course it doesn't
print out our odd numbers because this
guy right here takes care of that so
that's sort of a funky while loop that
we can use inside of groovy let's go and
create something a little bit more
simple like a for loop for loops going
to be very similar to what you have seen
already there's a couple different for
loops of course always has to be a
couple different for lips so we're going
to define what we're going to be
incrementing how long we are going to be
incrementing through this and then we
can just do a simple print line like
that and everything is self encapsulated
now let's go we can also do another for
loop that would work with range so here
we're going to say J in and the range is
going to be two through six and likewise
we can come in and do a print line and
in this situation throw a J inside of
there so that's sort of a shorthand way
to use range with for loop and we could
also use a for loop with a list so let's
go into final lists so we can say random
list is equal to and this would actually
work with a string as well you can do
that for homework and we could go random
list and print line and throw our J
inside of there again could also use a
for loop with a map so this command
and define customers but are a little
semicolon there at the end and here with
a list we're going to go for and it's
going to be individual cost for the map
cuffs to a print line right there and we
can say cust value when we get the value
from it and otherwise we can say cost
key and if we execute all those there
you can see all of them print out quite
nicely so there's a rundown of ways we
can loop now let's take a look at some
methods or functions if you will now
methods are going to allow us to break
our code into parts and also allow us to
reuse our code so we're going to do is
we're going to create a method here and
it's going to be called or we're
actually calling a method inside of here
called say hello and then outside here
we're going to actually define it and to
do so this is going to be a method that
is going to be part of our class we're
going to throw static inside of it and
we define our methods by using de up
again and say hello just like that and
here what we'll be able to do is go
print line and hello it's just going to
print out hello on the screen for us so
we're able to just call that function in
hello prints out even though we called
it from up here let's go and create
something a little bit more
sophisticated than that now what we're
going to do is we're going to allow it
to receive parameters and we're also
going to give those parameters default
values we can go define and let's say we
wanted to some values that gets passed
to values and we're going to sum them if
you want to give it to fault values just
go and put equals and whatever you want
it to be inside of there number two
let's give this a default value of zero
as well and then what we'll do is we'll
just return num1 plus num2 and then up
inside of here inside of our main
function we're going to call this so
we'll just say let's just do a print
line just to keep it simple and five
plus four is equal to and here we'll
call the function just by calling it by
name and then pass in five and a four
and if we execute it you can see that it
goes and sums those so let's create even
more complicated functions here I want
to demonstrate that whenever you are
passing values inside of drivi that
you're a sh
passing by value so I'm going to do is
I'm going to create a function here and
it's going to be called my name so let's
go throw a name inside of there and I'm
going to be calling a function called
pass by value and I'm going to pass my
name inside of there make sure we put
the right thing inside of there of
course and then I'm going to verify that
nothing changed even though the value is
going to try to be changed inside of the
function there's my name let's go and
get this and put this up inside of main
there we go so that's what we're going
to be checking and once again we're just
verifying that we know that everything
is going to be passed by value inside of
groovy just like we have inside of Java
so passed by value is going to be
function and here is going to be name
we're going to say name here and we're
going to call this in function just make
sure that the name has changed inside of
here and you're going to see that if I
go and go name inside the function that
it's going to print in function whenever
this is first called however whenever we
go and go back here it's going to print
the original Derrick so nothing changed
even though the value inside of passed
by value or this method down here
supposedly change that just remember
it's not passing the object itself
it's passing the value that can cause a
lot of errors if you forget that it's
going to create some more functions here
let's say that we wanted to borrow three
sive as well as return a list of values
so let's do something interesting what
we're going to do is we're going to
double the list that has passed inside
of here so I'm going to get my list
passed to this function I'm going to go
define new list is equal to this is
actually a closure collect what it does
is it performs a calculation on every
item in my list I'm going to do closures
next just give you a little sample here
just before we get to it so what it's
going to do this is going to take each
individual item inside of that list and
multiply it times two and then it's
going to return its new list and we'll
come up inside of here and execute it so
we're going to define a list let's call
it list two double one two three and
four so there's our list and let's go
and pass list to double and then store
inside of it the new list so we'll call
our little function called dub list and
we'll pass list a double inside of it
and then we'll go and print out our new
list this - double there we go we went
and passed in a list and we received a
new list we're also going to be able to
pass in an unknown number of elements to
a method fun nums and we're going to
pass in some all one two three and four
print line and this is just going to
pass or some an unknown number of
numbers how is that going to work well
down inside of here we're going to get
rid of this of course and some all is
the name of our function and this is
going to receive an unknown number of
integers you put three dots after that
and they're going to be stored in this
numbered list I'm going to define a
function or a variable called sum and
then I'm going to perform a calculation
on each item inside of that this is
another situation which we have closure
we're going to use each here and we're
going to say sum plus equal to each of
the items inside of that list and then
we will return some back to it if you
execute this you can see that it went
and sum those values and then we're
going to show you for the final thing
we'll take a look at how we would
calculate a factorial inside a groovy
that's just a function that calls itself
so let's just go and call this factorial
this is a situation or an example of
recursion so this is going to receive a
number and then how you get factorial is
if the number is less than or equal to
one you're going to return a value of
one and otherwise you're going to rule
go and call the factorial function again
we're going to say return and we're
going to say num times and this is the
return port or the recursion part and
you just get num - one and save that and
up here inside of this guy inside of
main anyway we can go so in fact
Rule four is what calculations Lissa's
call this factorial 4 is equal to
factorial call our function and we'll
pass four inside of there and print line
factorial 4 and then output our final
result save that and there you can see
it's 24 and if you're wondering exactly
how that works out this is an example of
it so the first time we come through
here it's going to have a value of 4 and
that is then going to call factorial of
4 minus 1 which is 3 let's just jump us
down here here's the 3 factorial 3 minus
1 is going to be equal to 2 that jumps
us down here so there's the 2 factorial
2 minus 1 is going to be equal to 1 this
guy right here is going to kick back the
value of 1 you can see the value of 1
right there you can see 2 is right there
this 2 over here is going to jump up
here we're going to take the 3 this 6
I'm going to jump up here and we're
going to multiply it times the beginning
4 and that's how we get 24 with
factorials so there's a rundown of
methods or functions inside of groovy
now let's take a look at closures now a
closure is going to represent blocks of
code that can accept parameters and can
be passed in the methods now let's use
let's actually just to be interesting
here let's create an alternative
factorial using closure versus what we
previously did with just a method so how
we would do that it was we would give
define and let's say we want to call
this get factorial and be equal to num
is going to represent a parameter passed
into our closure then what we're going
to do is we are going to just basically
structure everything exactly like we did
with a function so we're going to say if
num is less than or equal to 1 well if
that is true we're going to return a
value of 1 then we're going to come in
and go numb x call is actually going to
call our function once again the get
factorial function and we're going to
pass a non- one inside of there there
you go you just created a factorial now
what we're going to do is go print line
factorial 4 and we go get factorial 4
and save it and execute it and you can
see that we got the same
24:00 using this closure design versus
the method that made us jump all over
the place okay
so kind of cool experiment with closures
are a lot of fun another thing that's
neat about a closure is it's going to be
able to access values outside of it so
let's say we have something like define
greeting and this is going to be goodbye
this is stored outside of the closure
now let's go and define a closure that
says say goodbye so we can say say
goodbye equal to and it's going to
receive a name so let's just call it the
name and what it's going to do with that
name is it's going to say print line and
it's going to come in here and it's
going to get the greeting that is
defined outside of the closure and then
it's going to also include the name now
we'll be able to call it just by saying
say goodbye and throw in the value of
'dark and there you go goodbye Derek so
another example of closure is kind of
neat they're very commonly used to
perform operations on each item in a
list as you saw previously remember I
said I would get back to this so here is
a number list 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 we're going to
be able to perform a calculation on each
one of these guys or in this situation
I'm just going to print them out showed
you calculation last time so here we can
go print line and print out each of
those items in that list and there you
can see those are likewise we could do
the same thing with a map so it's
defined employees and just throw some
employee data inside of there and we can
say employees each and we could do it
we'll just print this out on the screen
as well you just go IT and let's say we
want to get the key and then IT and we
want to get the value off of this and
there you can see that is all so let's
go and create another one of these let's
go random noms do something a little bit
more interesting create a list let's say
we want to print only the even numbers
so we'll go random numbers and each and
when you get each of those individual
number items will say if num modulus 2
is equal to 0 well then we want
print it out otherwise we do not want to
burn it out and there you can see it
prints out only the even numbers find is
another function like each that's going
to return a match so let's say we have a
name list and we'll say match element is
going to be equal to throw a name list
inside of there
followed by find and here we'll say item
equal to sue and then we can print out
that information if we'd like so I'll
say match element you can see that Sue
comes back as a result because it was
found inside of that list find always
going to find all matches they'll say
something like random numbness and we'll
say one two three four five and six and
fine number of matches is equal to
random number list and we'll say find
all and we'll be able to do something a
little bit more sophisticated here we'll
be able to get each of those individual
items and match if the item has a value
greater than four so you can do all
kinds of different things here and print
out the number of matches we have and
five and six both come back as a result
of that and E is going to check if any
item is going to match let's just throw
this right inside of a print line just
so you can see that we can do things
like that so I'll say greater than five
random number list and any and then we
could throw item inside of there and
item greater than five every on the
other hand is going to check every item
in the list let's just go and copy this
print line here so in this situation
we'll say greater than one and we'll
change any into every and we'll change
this to a one and you can see this comes
back it's true and this comes back as
false collect and we saw collect earlier
is going to perform operations on every
line so let's just go paste in a print
line here again and here we're going to
say that we want to double everything in
a list we're going to double random
number list and this is going to be
collect and here item and what we're
going to do here is we're going to
multiply every item in list
times two and there you can see it
doubled all those guys and also we're
going to be able to pass a closure to a
method so let's say we create
closure and it's going to be called get
even and we can say numb which is the
parameter it receives and that's going
to return numb modulus to equal to zero
we're then going to come down here and
go define even nomes is going to be
equal to list edit is going to be a
function I'm going to create here in a
second and we're going to pass in a
random number list to it and also we're
going to pass in our closure and then
after that we're going to print out some
results and this is just going to be all
of the even numbers that are going to be
returned even nums let's jump down and
create that method down here here is the
function static do you find list edit
it's going to receive a list and the
closure and it's just going to return
list it's going to go find all closure
and there you can see it went and
doubled all those up so pretty cool
things we can do with closures now let's
take a look at file i/o now I have a
file up here called test dot txt and you
can see exactly what's inside of it I'm
going to come in here first I'm going to
open a file and read each line and
output them how I do that is I go new
file and provide whatever the name of
the file is so there it is test text and
then I can go each line and then I can
say exactly what I wanted to do in this
situation I want each line of text that
is read in from here to just simply be
printed on the screen so pretty simple
stuff and there you can say that it went
and did that so that was pretty simple
now let's say I want to overwrite our
file well I just go new file test text
and this is overwriting it that means
I'm eliminating what's already there
here I'm going to say that I want to use
UTF for writing information to the our
file and I'm going to say writer writer
right line and here I'm going to say
line for that it prints out what it
originally was there but if we come over
here you're going to say that
everything's been overwritten with line
four so
mean got rid of all that hard work we
went in there could also append to the
file and we could also go file file is
equal to new file object and here what
we're going to do is we're going to say
test text and then we'll be reusing this
guys we can save file here we went to
append and here we can put line 5 for
example line 4 does it uh and you can
see a line 5 is there now we're also
going to be able to get the file as a
string so just do a print line and we
can just go file text that's going to
give us the whole entire file as a
string and we could either print it out
or we could go and store it in a string
or do whatever you want with it
we'd be able to also get the file size
so we can say this file size and file
length in this situation and this is
going to be in bytes that's what's going
to be returned to us I in this situation
we have to put our little curly brackets
around this there you can see it comes
back it's 13 bytes we could also check
if a file is a file or is it a directory
and for that you're just going to put it
in file and then followed by is file or
is directory comes back as either true
or false we'd also be able to come in
and copy a file to another file so we
can say new file is equal to new file
and create that test to text and then
copy it we can go a new file and file
text and duct it up and you can see
right there test two shows up if we open
it you can see there it is because they
went and copied that information over to
it of course we can come in and delete a
file and go new file delete and that's
going to delete it and also get a
directory of files so say directory
files is equal to new file and lists
roots and then cycle through all of
those different results that we receive
with directory files each and then
output each individual item that we
receive print line and you go file
absolute path there you go so that's a
whole bunch of different things you can
do file i/o
now to finish off everything I'm going
to jump over and show you how you object
oriented programming works in groovy now
just like all other object oriented
programming languages classes are
blueprints that are going to be used to
define objects and every object is going
to have a tributes which are called
fields and capabilities that are called
methods now if we want to create some
objects what we have to do is come in
and define some objects so I'm going to
come in here I'm going to create a
animal object that we can work with and
I'm going to first off come in and go
import groovy transform and Sue string
this is a two string method that I want
to use here and if you want a method
automatically generated called two
string that's going to output some
information about your classes all you
have to do is import that and then go to
string and the information that it
outputs whenever this is called if you
want the names to show up you would just
go exactly like that include names true
and if you want the fields to show up
you can go include fields and also pass
the value of true or you're going to see
here in a second exactly how that works
for us now to define our class animal
I'm just going to go class animal right
like this we can define some fields that
all of our animal objects going to have
so let's say everything is every animal
objects going to have a name as well as
a sound well there you go you just
define them you can find the methods or
capabilities of these guys let's say
every animals going to have the ability
to run well there you go you can do that
also going to just throw the center if
you want to reference the name of our
object you can just go name and follow
that up with runs could also it's going
let's say that every animal is also
going to be able to make a sound we can
make a sound like this call this method
and here we'll just go print line and
name says and then throw sound inside of
here and then also we can create a
constructor so that the whatever the
animal object is created you're going to
be able to pass in a name and a sound
and it's
to be automatically created for us if
you want to reference the actual objects
name you use this like you do in many
other programming languages and the same
with both of those attributes and let's
leave that as sound and there you go so
there's a rundown of all the different
things you can do with those classes now
let's go and create an object back over
here let's say we want to create a
animal object and we'll call it King
well all we need to do is go new call
the constructor that we want to call
here
now if the constructor didn't exist we
could come in here and define these with
what are called named parameters so I
was some in here and type in name
followed by whatever the value of name
would be and then I would type in sound
followed by with whatever the sound
would be but since we have a constructor
inside of here we're not going to do
this part we're just going to come in
instead let's go and get rid of that and
we're instead going to come in and just
simply type in King like this separate
it from this and this is going to create
a new animal object and call the
constructor and create that object for
us we can come in and print some
information out on our screen for us so
let's say we wanted to go and get King
name says King sound save that and you
can see King says growl so it called
that or print it got the attributes for
us there and print those out on the
screen we're also going to be able to
change an object add a attribute with a
setter function they're automatically
created and they are set followed by
whatever the name of the attribute is so
let's say we want to change it to ger
well there you go
you just change that would then be able
to go print line and once again King
name says king sound and also we can of
course call the functions that we are
the methods inside of there there's the
run method that is defined for our
animal objects and there that is oh and
I also told you that I would show you
exactly what the two string thing does
for us we can go to string well actually
have to go print line there we go that
like that like that and that and this is
what print line does for us they prints
out the attributes and the values for
them now with inheritance a class is
going to inherit all the fields and
methods of another class so what we're
going to do is we're going to create a
dog object over here so if we want our
dog class to get all the attributes and
methods from the animal class just to go
and extend it and then we can say define
owner we can define a new constructor
for our dog objects by going to find dog
and let's say we're going to get our
name and our sound and our owner all
passed into this dog constructor we
would be able to call the super or the
animal class we inherited from its
constructor and pass in the name and
sound to let it handle adding those in
and otherwise we can come in and just go
this and owner right like that we're
also going to be able to overwrite
different methods inside of here if we'd
like to
so make sounds and throw that inside of
there and print long and then if we want
to print out the name says bark and
sound we can do that and save that and
jump back over here and then define a
dog object let's call it growver is
equal to new dog Rover anger and Derrick
is the owner of the dog and then we can
change show the difference here makes
sound versus the Grover dog object and
we'll save that and there you can see it
King says ger and Grover says bark anger
alrighty guys well I was gonna cover a
little bit on inheritance and exception
handling and so forth and so on but this
videos gotten really long and I think I
covered a heck of a lot love to know if
anybody watched the whole entire video
out there please leave a comment if you
did I would greatly appreciate it just
to find out how long people strung along
but if you want to see a really quick
example of exception handling and a
little bit more on object
and programming like I said in the link
in the description I'll make sure I
include all that information and just
like always thank you for everybody
tuning in and please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
