Macintosh owner eventually you will see
this window pop up whenever you took
tried to delete something in your trash
bin today I'm gonna show you how to
permanently delete your trash bin and on
top of that how to clean up a lot of
other harddrive issues that occur often
with Macintosh computers what I tried to
delete here was a folder from Time
Machine
it was in my time machine backup folder
and it will not allow me to do that
unless I download a program called on X
it is free and you can get to it
at apple.com /downloads Mac OS X system
disk utilities slash onyx or just simply
type O and Y X into any search browser
like I did here and it's going to take
you to a page to download it then you
would want to click on the download
button open it with disk image mounter
it's going to download and then you just
simply drag this little guy to your
Applications folder and it is installed
so what this onyx do let's open it up
whenever you open up onyx it's going to
ask you if you can perform certain tests
on your main hard drive I'm choosing to
cancel because that's already been done
it's gonna ask you for your password and
then if I want to force delete the items
in my trash can I just click on
utilities click on trash right here
click on delete and then hit X you and
of course I want to continue and it will
go to my trash bin and delete everything
in there no matter whether there are
permission conflicts or if the items in
the trashcan are in use or if they are
locked so watch out what you delete
because it is deleted permanently okay
after it is done you will get this
message right here trash emptied and
every single time it will empty your
trash you don't need to use the terminal
options you do not need to go in as a
super user for example in terminal and
delete things and maybe accidentally
delete things you don't want to just use
onyx it's free hit OK alright now as if
that wasn't enough if you click on the
cleaning option inside of onyx you can
delete catch options for any of these
things right here what's really
important is under internet it allows
you to delete your catch
and history and searches and cookies and
so forth and so on
system-wide just by clicking internet
and hey execute there's a couple other
options here which I do not personally
use because I don't like messing around
with my phones or my logs under the
maintenance option very often Macs have
problems with permissions you want to
correct those just click on permissions
hit execute problem solve under
automation you can check off many
different options all at one time and
automatically it executes and it will
perform a number of different fixes all
from the automation button then under
parameters it gets really interesting
generally you can define how you want
your scroll bars to be set up from this
option if you want to define what format
your screen captures are saved as you
can define that here that's really
useful as well
you're gonna fine the number of recent
items to display in the finder you can
also decide to animate your background
which is also really neat so let's
choose cosmos and hit start now
constantly in the background of my
computer I'm able to have this animated
background and it will animate
constantly no matter what it is hoping
on the outside and there's many other
different options that are available to
you
let's choose for us and you can see just
provides a nice neat little option to
Mac users I personally tell me use it
though because it drives me absolutely
mad what I see all those things moving
around in the background if you click
the finer option under parameters again
it allows you to define how you want
certain graphic effects to occur within
the finder allows you to choose whether
you should be able to view hidden files
and folders by default and also allows
you to define many background options in
regards to your menu bar under doc it
allows you to change very quickly and
easily how the doc will show up on your
screen and how it will operate and then
there's multiple different options for
quicktime Safari iTunes logins and other
miscellaneous things
so that's onyx not only does it clean up
and permanently delete anything in your
trash can it also has a number of other
different options I think any Mac user
will find useful
so next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
