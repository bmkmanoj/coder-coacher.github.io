31 of my how to make videogames tutorial
series this is going to be the final
video in this tutorial series so I want
to go out with a bang and pretty much
cover a whole bunch of things I've never
covered before so that you will be able
to make just about any type of game so
what we're gonna do is I'm going to show
you how to destroy bushes pick up gems
throw boomerangs or animate weapons or
animate any you know anything in general
as well as stun villains create a whole
bunch of different animations and a
whole bunch more like always the code as
well as a link to the finished project
files and sprites and everything are
available in the description underneath
the video totally for free and I have a
lot to do so let's get into it okay so
I'm gonna start off of course I'm in
unity and the very first thing I want to
do is I want to allow link to destroy
these bushes that are right here and
currently we can also walk through the
bushes and do all kinds of different
things so what I want to do first is I
want to come in here and select sword
and then I want to come up here and I
want to go to the tagged area and I
don't have a sword in here no so I'm
gonna add a tag and it's going to be
called swords I just click on this and
sword and save of course and then select
sword and then there we go now we have
this with the sword tag now what I want
to do up sorry about bouncing around
there I'm gonna open up my bushes I'm
gonna select all my bushes and what I
want link to do is to collide with said
bushes as well as to be able to break
the said bushes so I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna had two colliders to the bushes so
add component physics 2d box Collider
and one of them is gonna have is trigger
and the other one is going to have is
not gonna have its trigger so there we
are box Collider
and there we go so that is all finished
up and is there anything else yes I want
to also come in to my sword
I'm gonna have the box clutter for it
also be is trigger and I think that's it
so what I'm gonna do is to show the
bushes actually explode I'm gonna go
into the scripts area create a new C
sharp script and I'm gonna call it bush
and then I'm gonna write all the code
that is going to basically show what's
gonna happen whenever the sword hits the
blush all right so what do I need to do
here pretty simple actually I'm gonna
get rid of starting update and this is
Bush dot CS and the very first thing I
want to do is I want to get a reference
to my sprite renderer for my bush so
render where I'm gonna do something very
simple I'm just going to change
temporarily to a different sprite and
then delete the bush altogether
I'm also however as the tutorial
continues I'm going to show you how to
go and do an animation if you'd want to
do like a bush exploding animation I'll
show you all that here in a minute I'm
also gonna go and of course have a link
to the bush exploding sprite and I made
that public of course so that I could
just drag and drop it in there I'm going
to come in here and in awake I'm going
to get a reference to my sprite renderer
so sprite renderer and that is gonna be
equal to get component and sprite
renderer and there it is
and cut off and this is gonna be very
simple and then what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to go into on trigger
enter and this is why I had is trigger
set on these of course so ontriggerenter
2d and I'm gonna get a reference to
whatever collided with it
and we are and what do I want to do well
you could of course come in here
well first I'm gonna check if the tag
that is associated with what I just
collided with is equal to sword cuz
we're doing this for Bush of course and
then you can put like a sound effect
inside here or something I'm not gonna
do that I've already covered sound
effects so anybody that's followed this
tutorial knows how to do that so you do
that and renderer and I'm going to set
the sprite for this guy to be equal to
Bush exploding sprites and that's all
set and then what I want to do is I want
to wait 5 seconds and then destroy the
Bush object all together so I'm gonna go
object destroy and game object which is
gonna be the bush itself here and in
let's see like a half a second and we
have that saved now I'm gonna go and
select all of the different bushes
inside of here all of them and then I'll
go get the scripts and drag Bush down
here and drop it inside of there go and
save all that stuff and then let's test
it out all right so here is Zoda and I
have to go up here to find a bush and
there's a bush and there we are so we go
and the sword hit the bush and destroyed
it so now what I want to do is I want to
go and I want to be able to collect said
gems so I'm gonna do that next so for
the gems what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to add a Collider to all the gems and
set is trigger once again I'm probably
gonna shrink the gems down a good bit
also
so let's come in here to the gym area
select all those and then I'm gonna go
into add components physics 2d and box
Collider and I'm let's see where the
gems are right inside of there let's see
if I can get rid of the bushes you know
what let's just come in and just shrink
it down
let's have the X be like point five
that's the big part that's the port it's
gonna matter so that's going to be on
the sides of the gyms and I'm also gonna
have his trigger set for all those so is
trigger set on that and I think that's
all I really need to do and then what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna select the
bushes and get rid of that and then
select a gym yeah you know that looks
perfectly fine I actually would probably
shrink this down the lake let's go and
select it and do it the right way let's
say something like 25 just very nominal
and yeah that works better so there is
the collider for the gems so now what
I'm gonna do is I have that set up I'm
gonna be able to go in there and collect
the gems by creating a script and that's
gonna be called gem dot C yes so Jim
there it is and let's open it and here
we are so what are we gonna do inside of
Jim now pretty simple I'm going to keep
this simple just like always I'm going
to just do a void on trigger enter and
of course you could come in here and do
sound effects and increment values and
things but I will let that for you I
know you can do it anybody that has
followed this tutorial will easily be
able to do that alright so what I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna say if and
what I collided with tag is equal to
whoops
link well now I know that they German
needs to go what so um like I said you
could add sound effects inside here the
Jim getting selected and then updating
or whatever what I'm gonna do just to
keep this nice and simple
it's just destroy the gym like this
after a half a second wait time alright
so I got that save jump back select all
my gems right here and grab the gem
script and drop it inside of there
didn't get it I guess and drop it as out
of there
and we will save it and we will run
alright so here we go
I'm gonna come up here oops I forgot to
turn on the bushes again so let's go and
select all the bushes
wait a minute they should be turned on
hmm what are you wrong oh I see all
right turn them back on all right so
let's run it now and here is link and
links and go up here and link is going
to smash that and then go over it and
you can see the gem disappeared and that
gem disappeared perfect alright so got
that done and now what we're gonna do is
I'm gonna allow link to attack the
villain all right so to go in a he'll a
link to attack the villain I'm first off
gonna select the sword here and look at
it I'm gonna increase my Collider on
that a little bit so that it is a little
bit easier to hits um let's just go in
and increase the value of y so let's
take that up and something let's just
make it one whatever okay so that's fine
and I think that's a good enough leeway
to make it a little bit easier to hit
the villain you're of course gonna want
the sword to have the is trigger set on
it and um what else am I gonna want to
do the villain I don't have a tag for
villain so let's go and create that add
tag and just select this and type in
villain and there is my villain tag and
then I will select villain and select
villain for the tag so you can just see
that right there is there anything else
whoops sorry about that
anything else I'm gonna need to do oh
you know what I was thinking wrong
what's the collider look like on the
villain so here is the collider see
office honey the collider is the
collider for the villain needs to be big
and the collider for a link needs to be
smaller now this is something of course
that you're gonna have to tweak and so
I'll let you do that it's easy just
increase it and decrease it until it is
you know easier or whatever the level of
difficulty you're looking for so I'm
just gonna increase it say - that looks
like a good enough size so one point 16
1.15 that looks pretty good and then for
link just come in and select link and of
course I'm gonna shrink that so links
Collider is pretty big and
I'm going to find that Collider and then
shrink it down so let's try something
like you know that point there are point
sevens what I put in and I think points
that one's pretty good
so that's all I did point seven for the
size of the collider all right so now
that I have that all set up what I want
to do is create a new script and it's
gonna be called sword and it's just
gonna do some light interaction with the
villain and then after that I'm gonna
create boomerang alright so just create
C sharp script and we're just going to
call this sword and open it up and start
writing some code alright so what am I
gonna do inside of here I'm gonna keep
it pretty simple also so um I'm just
gonna do like a light amount of force
it's basically just going to temporarily
pause the villain when it gets hit maybe
move it back slightly or something
ontriggerenter 2d collider 2d and there
is what we are going to collide with if
this is the sword dot CS file again
remember if the tag is equal to villain
then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get
a reference to the rigidbody for my
villain so I'm going to say rigidbody 2d
and villain rigidbody is gonna be equal
to game object kits components and
rigidbody 2d that is alright so I got
the rigidbody for my villain and now
what I want to do is I'm just want to
add a slight amount of force to it and
whenever I do the boomerang which is
gonna be here in a minute
let's have the villain just go in the
opposite direction where he is and I'm
not gonna worry too much about tweaking
this I'm just gonna I'm just gonna push
him back slightly from where he is and
um I'm just gonna that's what that is
it's saying whatever the velocity is I
want him to go in the opposite direction
and then I'll do something real simple
like time.deltatime and there we are if
the sword hits a villain I just want to
push him back a little bit alright away
from the sword and
what else do I want to do you know what
that's it I think that's all I need to
do with that so let's go and save it and
let's go test it and let's go and get
our Zelda and what should happen is he
just slightly pushes the villain
backwards yeah say it's just a real
slight see just a little bit of pressure
and that's all I want to do with them
then you know and we can change that and
so forth so now what I'm going to do is
do something a lot more fun I want to
allow link to throw a boomerang and also
show you how to go and create animations
for said boomerang alright so the very
first thing I'm going to do is I'm gonna
go and get my sprite and because I want
to the boomerang to sort of rotate off
of a central point I'm gonna go in and
click on my sprite editor and open this
guy up and then I want to zoom in here
and find my boomerang and I'm gonna
change the pivot point to the middle of
the boomerang see the pivot point is
right here and then I'm just gonna go in
and say apply and then close it and then
I'm gonna start playing around with a
boomerang so I'm gonna go and I'm gonna
put the boomerang you know what
the boomerang is gonna go into the
weapon area right here but not right now
so I'm gonna go and sprites and I
believe it's 49 so let's go and get this
and drop it and I believe that's
boomerang I'm gonna go and put it on the
same layer as link yes that's the
boomerang and X Y zero zero zero all
good let's go and have our sorting order
B one just to make that be good and
let's go and change the name of it to
boomerang and what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to animate it right here on the
screen and then attach it to link all
right so let's go you know what I can
put it in here right now
so boomerangs inside of there and I'm
gonna change this to zero and change
this to zero so there it is the
boomerang is gonna start right in the
middle of link which is good now to
animate it I have link already selected
so I can just go or I have the boomerang
already selected I mean I can just go
and click on animator or no it's going
to be animation
in this situation well maybe I don't
have a boomerang selected alright let's
do this and let's drag it out of there I
think it's getting confused so let's go
get that and now let's go animation and
there you can see to begin animating
boomerang create an animator and an
animation clip so I'm going to say
create and I'm gonna call this boomerang
but of course I want to make sure that
it is in my animations folder and the
name of it is going to be boomerang and
let's select it and save alright so we
got that set now the very first thing I
want to do is I want to create a whole
bunch of different boomerangs I'm gonna
go like this
create new clip and the very first one
I'm going to create is boomerang right
so boomerang right and save that and
then I'm gonna define what's gonna
happen well I got this all set up here
I'm going to go find the forty-ninth
sprite which is my boomerang I'm gonna
drop it down inside of there in the very
very first frame and I am on the dope
sheet part right here so I'm gonna come
up inside of here I'm going to change
this to three samples so that we will
slow down the animation quite
dramatically actually and then I am
going to have it go from left to right
to do that I'm gonna have to add
property and transform and the positions
gonna change it's gonna go from the zero
position onto the a certain number of
positions on the x-axis now to do this
I'm gonna actually set it using curves
so I'm gonna go curves select curves and
you're gonna see how long this is I am
going to want this to be one point one
so I'm gonna grab the very last one of
these whoops there's too many of them
isn't there let's say I want it to be
one : 1 and length what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna come down here to 1 : 1 and go
add key and then right around the middle
area is where I am going to define the
curve and it's just gonna be like a bell
curve now I want it to go to the right
so that means I want to increase the
value of X and I'm gonna have it go and
increase the value by let's say 3 that's
more than enough and so I can see on the
left side of the screen here with that
is and there this is and that's gonna be
perfectly fun and this is gonna be down
in the zero area so I'm gonna grab it
just so it's approximately at the zero
point
alright that's perfectly fine all right
so good stuff and we can click and
animate it just to see and you can see
that it is indeed animating so that's
good alright so the next thing I want to
do is also want it to rotate so I'm
gonna go add property and transform and
rotation you can see it right there
click on the rotation and it's gonna
rotate on the z-axis so I'm gonna select
Z and that's gonna give me this guy
right here and I'm going to say that I
want that guy to be 180 so I'm gonna
select 180 or I'm gonna select the you
know the blue guy right here and I'm
gonna drag it until it is at the 180
mark which or I'm also gonna click in
the middle of it and click on add key
first and then drag it to the 180 mark
so I'll just drag it up there and it's
gonna be very very very very very high
cific room in here and do 180 like this
and there this is and let's go and see
what it looks like when we animate it
and you can see there we go saying it's
gonna fly out and animate itself now it
should it's starting at this point right
here where it's starting to the left of
link so oh the reason why is link is at
1:1 so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
go and have the boomerang and drag it up
inside here inside of weapon and now it
should come off of link but it's not oh
I know why boomerang right select that
and now do it and that looks fine it's
coming on the x-axis it's fine but it's
above Lynx head so I'm gonna change that
to boomerang and let's just go back to
the regular game area boomerang and stop
that let's just hit the play button and
then undo it
alright so boomerang and hmm still at
the zero zero mark and let's play around
with that and I know why it's doing that
for some unknown reason the position for
Y is set the one on
so I'm just gonna set it to zero and
then hopefully that's gonna take care of
that for forever let's just play it
again and yeah it went up I'm gonna just
do it by hand let's grab it and move it
down to zero so what I'm gonna do is
just zoom in real far and make sure that
all of these are set for zero select Y
and then I'm dragging them all into
place it's all though and I must've
accidentally changed the position on X
so that's gonna be let's select the X
position right here and you can see also
here you can identify the different
lines for the animation by the colors
this is red and this is green so it's
gonna be 4x that's gonna be for y so
what I'm gonna do is just grab the
export and let's raise it once again to
32.9 or whatever and that should be
perfectly fine right around the that
middle point right there and run it and
there it goes out and it's rotating and
that is pretty good and of course you
can tweak that more and more and more
now what I want to do is basically do
exactly the same thing for a whole bunch
of other different Clips okay and after
i whent and drag some positions around
so forth you can see here is the curve
for boomerang up and you can see that it
goes up to 180 and then back down to its
original position and also for up it is
going to change on the y position which
is going to be up to 3 that's what this
middle point is and then also for
boomerang down it's gonna do the
absolute opposite it's gonna go down to
negative 3 however the rotation is gonna
stay exactly the same all right so that
is how we do our animations for our
boomerang and now I'm going to actually
animate the boomerang and make it stun
the villain gonna want to select my
boomerang here and make sure that I have
a box Collider on it and is trigger is
also selected I went and created a
boomerang script and now I'm gonna open
it alright so what am I gonna do with my
boomerang script basically what I think
I want to do is I want to set an action
that is going to say that the villain is
stunned and the boomerang is going to go
in and change that but to do that I'm
gonna need to go into the villain file
and
a couple things there first all right so
here I am in the villain CS file and I
want to add a bowl that's gonna be
called stunned and let's say I want to
put it somewhere like right here
so just go in and I'm gonna make it
public so anybody can access it I'm
gonna go public bull stuns and by
default of course it's gonna be false
and what else am I gonna need to do
inside of my villain class let's get
down into our update section I'm gonna
need a way to turn stun on and turn stun
off so the best place I can think of to
do that would be down inside of update I
would say so I'm gonna come down inside
of this guy right here
I'm gonna go create a I'm just gonna do
this a little bit sloppy just to keep
everything in the same place I'm going
to create a vector two and it's gonna be
the previous direction that my villain
was going in prior to you know coming in
here and trying to change that and then
I'm gonna go avoid and update and then
I'm gonna say if not stunned I went to
all wow movement so I'm gonna say if not
stunned then my villain is just gonna
move as normal so I'm gonna go and set
its velocity equal to the direction that
we previously had and that's what we
previously had and inside here and then
I also want to store my if that
direction was okay I want to store my
previous direction that I was going in
so that I will be able to stun or stop
and then also return to movement
afterwards and else if my villain is
stunned I'm going to call a start coding
and I'm gonna call a function called
unstoned villain which is going to on
stun a villain after a certain amount of
time let's say like three seconds or
something like that well I'm gonna have
to create on stun villain let's just do
it right here once again keep everything
in the same place and I'm gonna have to
call i'm numerator or
that's what this is gonna return course
and I'm stung villain and let's go and
stop the movement for our our villain
and to do that you just vector two and
then zero is gonna stop that movement
and then I want to wait a few seconds
and then continue the previous movement
that the villain had so I'm gonna say
wait four seconds and let's just say I'm
gonna wait for three seconds like I said
prior I don't know what's gonna you know
look good here let's leave it at three
seconds for now and then I want to set
my movement back to normal so just go or
be velocity and it's gonna be equal to
whatever the previous good direction for
my villain was and then of course I want
to turn stunned off so that the villain
can move again and there it is and I
believe that's home going to have to do
for that now what I want to do is jump
back into boomerang and stun the
villains alright so in the boomerang
file I'm gonna get rid of all this stuff
right here and I can just work with
ontriggerenter 2d so I'm gonna go void
on trigger enter 2d and Collider 2d and
I'm gonna get what I collided with and
I'm gonna say if it has the tag of
villain so this is the boomerang of
course it's gonna be hitting a villain
hopefully and the
and and if it does then it's going to
set that that is stunned so game objects
and gets component Oh notes and if
you're still hanging along here in this
tutorial series I don't appreciate it if
you drop me a comment say something
about I made it to the boomerang part
and I'm gonna say stunned is gonna be
true so that's how we can go and get the
villain component and then set the value
for that lets go and verify that it's
over there
save that let's come up here and let's
specifically look for stunned yeah
they're stunned right there and then
boomerang and stunned
yeah that's spelled the same way alright
so we got that set so there is our
boomerang and it is ready to go and now
I just need to go into the link part and
allow link to throw boomerangs whoops
but before I do I want to go get
component like that there we are
got it alright so now I got that set up
and now I'm gonna jump into a link and
fix that so he can throw boomerangs ok
so what am I gonna have to do inside
here basically I'm going to need the
direction link is facing and then I'm
gonna need the ability to create
boomerang game objects and throw them so
where am I gonna put this stuff alright
first first thing I want to do is I want
to store publicly the attack direction
so let's go and store that and also I'm
going to want to have game objects
boomerang and
then of course we're gonna have to set
those guys up oh no it's boomerang
spelled right
boom all rang okay there we go and to
properly set those up I'm gonna do that
inside of our awake function so I'm
gonna go boom a rang game object is
gonna be equal to and to get it I go
game object and finds as far as I know
there's only ever gonna be one boomerang
and there that is close that and then
I'm also gonna get the renderer which is
gonna allow me access to the boomerang
sprite so game object and I'm going to
go get components of course and this is
gonna be renderer and close that off and
enabled is equal to false so that's up
then I need to come down inside of here
and decide where I am going to wait for
a key to be pressed so that I can start
throwing things you know are throwing
koomer eggs anyway so let's say I want
to come down here I'm gonna do it right
at the very end of this guy so I'm going
to say if and input so it gets ki is
equal to em well in that situation I am
going to start co-routine because I'm
gonna have to do all sorts of pausing
and so forth and so on boomerang attack
is what I'm gonna call it and there that
is now I just have to create boomerang
attack let's just go and copy this
alright and I'm gonna go eye numerator
and boomerang attack let's go and put a
space there of course and boomerang
attack is basically just going to play
different animations depending upon the
attack direction so I'm gonna say switch
is attack direction and if the attack
direction is now this is going to be a
curly brace if
it's is attack direction down well go
and curly-brace I want to show my
boomerang on the screen because the
boomerang is not going to be shown by
default so I'm going to show it on the
screen and get components and renderer
and then enabled so that's how we're
gonna show a hidden object and then
after that I want to allow for the
animator to animate I'm just gonna copy
this so paste that inside of there so
boomerang game object and here it's
gonna be animator animator is also
enabled it to be able to be true and
then I want to tell it what type of
animation to play so once again animator
and here what I do is to play a specific
animation I just go like this I just go
play and then the name in the animation
well the name of the animation is
boomerang down as we create it earlier
okay so that's how we get all those sets
then I want to wait a certain period of
time that's gonna be 1.2 seconds because
that's how long I set for all of my
animations whenever I was creating them
before so wait 4 seconds and I'm gonna
just have this be 1.2 seconds I should
work out good and after I have that all
set up I want to disable my animator so
basically I'm just gonna copy this right
here let's go and just disable our
animator actually it's disabled them
both let's do it in the opposite
direction so I'm gonna go like this and
this is gonna be false so it's gonna
show the animation and then it's gonna
stop showing the animation afterwards
this and it's also gonna stop showing
the the picture of the boomerang on the
screen so there's all those and now what
I just need to do is do that for all the
other different attack directions so
come in here like that and we will
instead of this being down this is going
to be left whoops
left all uppercase and make sure it's
all uppercase there we go and everything
can be the same the other thing it's
gonna change is boomerang and I'm gonna
change this to left and I'm gonna go and
do this again for all of the other
possible directions so that I could have
here Oh make sure I have all these
clothes off right see yeah that's not
good let's go get rid of that curly
braket right there oh and let's also
make sure that we throw a break
statement in here so that's gonna be
important and break statement here also
there we go so it's telling me I got an
extra curly bracket inside of here oh
there's two right there and not maybe
not maybe it's all good okay let's just
let it go until it messes up and I'm
gonna just go and copy this guy and I'm
gonna do the same thing this is gonna be
right of course so just go paste this
inside of here so rights and boomerang
right is the animation that I use for
that and then of course our final one is
going to be boomerang down right Oh nuts
up stairs up and then this is gonna be
boomerang up everything else is exactly
the same no doubt I could streamline
this and everything looks good so let's
save it let's go test it and here's link
and if we throw it you can see the
boomerang is going out and coming back
and if we hit the villain you can see
the villain paused probably would have
been better to have the boomerang
actually stopped before it hits the
villain but either way just wanted to
make a whole bunch of different things
here all work inside of this game now I
feel very positive that you have all of
the techniques and skills required to be
able to finish the zelda game on your
own for homework so thank you to anybody
who actually made it through this whole
tutorial it was a very very hard
tutorial to make and
I I appreciate it to anybody who made it
through it I don't know if anybody did
but either way it was fun for me to make
and a nice accomplishment add to my tool
or my my grouping of tutorials so like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
