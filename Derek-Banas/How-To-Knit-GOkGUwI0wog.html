kinds of questions all the time some of
which I can't answer like for example
how to dance don't know how don't plan
on learning anytime soon second most
requested is how to kiss that solution
simple find somebody and practice a lot
the third most requested tutorial is how
to knit now while I do not know how to
knit my wife does so in this tutorial
she's going to teach you the basics of
knitting enjoy today I'm going to teach
you a little bit about knitting first
we're going to start off by talking
about some of the tools of the trade the
first tool you need is needles now
needles come in a variety of sizes and
materials in this hand I have a US size
one which is very tiny and it's also
Luminum the Luminum needles are really
really slippery which is nice if you
have a yarn that's not so slippery but a
lot of people complain about these
because they're cold in their hands then
here I have an extra large US 17 this is
made out of plastic plastic sites
because it's look for a tail but it's a
little bit warmer in your hand and then
have it in between size aus 9 these are
woods and what's usually the most
expensive but what really has a nice
feel
sort of like holding chopsticks the
different diameters of me at all
correlate to the different diameters of
yarns here I have a thin sport weight
here's the most common wait for knitting
a worsted weight yarn and then my
personal favorite super bulky Super Bowl
Keys maze because you can get up
something really really quick it's also
good for beginners then there are a
variety of fancy yarns that look really
furry and really soft and there's yarns
of the flight ribbon too first I'm going
to teach you how to knit using large
needles and super bulky yarn take this
opportunity to recommend the stitch and
bitch knitters handbook i got this when
i first learned how to knit a few years
ago and this is how i learned no one
taught me great book first what you do
is you hold your large i'm using a US
fifteen needle in your left hand and
create a slipknot wrap your yarn drum
two fingers and pull a loop through to
create a slipknot you take your Slipknot
and you put it over your left knee at
all
tighten it up a little bit we're going
to cast on a number of stitches onto
your left needle this will be the end of
a scarf that you'll be making so you
take your right needle you put it into
your Slipknot then you wrap your yarn
around your right needle and pull the
right needle and the yarn through your
Slipknot and then take that loop and
stick it back on your left needle you
now have two stitches cast on your left
needle for this scarf I think it's going
to be sort of long and skinny so I'm
going to cast on twelve stitches using
that same method that we just talked
about
I am sticking my right needle through a
loop on my left knee at all goofing
around my right needle pulling it
through and then sticking the loop back
on my left needle from different angles
I'm going to show you how to make your
slip knot wrap your yarn around two
fingers and then pull Luthor to create
your Slipknot stick your slip knot on
your left needle tighten up a little bit
so it doesn't fall off take your right
needle stick it through the Slipknot
wrap your yarn around your right needle
and pull through to create a new loop
stick your new loop back on your left
needle now let's try that again to cast
on another stitch stick your right
needle through a loop that you just
created on your left needle wrap around
your right needle pull it through make a
loop on your left needle now you have
three cats on stitches I'm going to
continue until I have about 12 cast on
stitches
and the cast on stitches will represent
the width of our scarf you will cast on
a number of stitches and you'll see in
the patterns a number of stitches that
is recommended to cast on for that
pattern today we're just making a simple
scarf using the garter stitch which is
the most common stitch used indenting I
have 12 2 4 6 8 10 12 up 13 I have one
extra so what I want to do is just pull
next run off and pull it through okay
now we're going to learn how to do a
knit stitch
we have cast on 12 stitches I'm going to
take my right needle stick it through
the first cast on stitch wrap my yarn
around my right needle pull it through
and then I'm going to let the cast on
stitch drop off my left knee at all so
now I have one stitch on my right needle
for lemon on my left we're going to
continue another netbook wrap around
pull through and let it drop off stick
my right needle through the cast on
stitch wrap around pull through and drop
off now we want to continue creating
these knit stitches all the way to the
end of the row
we want to make sure that your cast on
stitches aren't twisting around on your
needle that you're putting your bright
needle through the cast on stitches at
the same place for each stitch
okay now is knit twelve stitches and all
the stitches are on my right needle to
continue the garter stitch patterns
we're going to start over I'm going to
put the right needle in my left hand and
begin making more knit stitches wrap
around pull through then search my
needles wrap around pull through it's
important that while you're doing this
that you keep an even mention a lot of
people hold their yarn in the right hand
in different ways to keep this even
tension I hold mine like this and I can
tell you from reading books that this is
not the recommended way the recommended
ways usually involves wrapping it around
your pinky but I know this is just
comfortable for me continue creating
knit
yes
okay everybody here is what the garter
stitch pattern looks like after eight
rows there are many different patterns
that you can create but you'll need to
learn a purl stitch as well as the knit
stitch that you already know different
combinations of knit and purl create
different patterns the nice thing about
the garter stitch pattern created
entirely out of knit stitches is that
the front and the back of your scarf
will look exactly like this way there's
no wrong way to wear it keep on knitting
and before you know it you'll have a
finished scarf please leave your
questions and comments below so next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
