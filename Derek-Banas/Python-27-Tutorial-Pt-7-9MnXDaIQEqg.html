7 of my programming with python 2.5
through 2.7 tutorial but that was a
mouthful today's tutorial is brought to
you by this guy who informed me that his
teacher is forcing him and other
classmates to watch my videos I want to
commend this teacher and I believe
everyone out there should force people
to watch my videos only wish I knew the
name of the school today we're going to
focus on object-oriented programming in
the next tutorial I'm going to do it as
well I normally try to cram this into
one video and I don't really think I do
it justice so today I'm going to explain
what an object is what an instance is
what encapsulation is and how to make
your attributes and methods private by
attributes I am referring to what we
previously called variables inside of
object-oriented programming this is the
name that you're supposed to use for
variables and as well functions are
called methods so you can look at those
two things as being equal and it's just
a jargon term so I wouldn't get too hung
up on it unless you're taking the test
on it I guess well to create a class
which is just a blueprint on what every
object must have in regards to
attributes and methods all you use is
the first name class followed by the
name of the class that you want to
create followed by a colon and I'm just
going to set a generic attribute here
being hungry and I'm going to give it
the default value of yes then what I'm
going to do is create what is called a
constructor function and this is a
function that will be called every
single time you create a new object and
it performs just basic upfront
maintenance that you would want to have
created these are two underscores I NIT
and then two underscores self is a
reference to the object you create so
whenever you create an object that
objects actually passed up here and
different changes and so forth or
performed upon certain attributes of
said object I'm just going to pass on
this because they don't really need to
perform any row operations here at this
point in time and I'm going to jump up
here and define another attribute called
name and every animal is going to have
the default know name and owner o owner
then we're going to jump down inside of
here and talk a little bit about
encapsulation through encapsulation what
you're trying to do
do is make it hard for people to just
come in here and willy-nilly change the
values of Hungary name and owner so what
you do and I'm going to show you a nicer
way to do this in the next tutorial but
I'm going to do it in a simple way right
here you normally would use the word set
followed by the value that you plan to
change self again reference to the
object and this is going to be the
owner's name that is going to be passed
to this method and I'm sorry if I say
function every once in a while here I'm
just going to define the value of the
owner for this object
and return and these are referred to as
access ER functions meaning that they
provide access to attributes that are
supposed to be hidden to create get
owner and I don't need to get any
information there and whenever this is
called it's just going to shoot back
whoever owns set animal and I'm also
going to create a method that I'm going
to call noise and it is just going to
print to the screen or okay there's a
basic class and now I'm going to show
you how to create an object from this as
you know from previous tutorials and if
you haven't watched the other tutorials
you probably already shut this off that
either way you should definitely watch
those this is looking for a function
main in here to call so I'm going to
create one and I'm going to create a new
object that I'm going to call dog and
how I do that is this line right here
I'm calling actually this guy up here to
create this new object called dog a
class it's just a blueprint for how to
create objects that's all it is
and if I want to set the owner I just
call this method and I'm just going to
say this su is the owner and then here
I'm gonna retrieve that value I just set
with get owner right like that and you
can see that su pops up see I set the
owner to su even though it previously
was set to no owner and you can see here
this method right here printed su out
onto the screen now this is kind of
encapsulation but not real encapsulation
for real encapsulation you have to make
it impossible for people to get ahold of
this or at least make it really hard
because as you can see I can get ahold
of the owner without calling this method
right here I'm going to do is type in
dog dot owner you can see su prints
twice now with true encapsulation you
want to make this very very
or to do and it's really simple to do it
all you need to do is come up here and
put two dashes and again two dashes and
two dashes now these were what we call
private attributes and if we come in
here and do the same you can see if I
try to print out owner errors errors
errors errors you can see the first suit
printed and then this one caused all
kinds of errors but this one's still
printed and this is encapsulation it
hides attributes away so that people
can't willy-nilly come in here and just
change variables that you don't want
them to change that's what it means it's
encapsulated it's hidden from the world
and now we can come in here also and
call the method noise just simply like
this hit f5 and you can see that error
shows up here on the screen I'm going to
create a couple new different methods
like for example let's say I want to
create a method that is also hidden real
simple again two underscores and I'll
just call this hidden method just to
give it a name print hard to find and if
you scroll down here and hit dog dot
underscore hidden method you can see
again that I got another error so there
is a way to actually encapsulate these
methods now to keep this simple I'm just
going to call this method that is hidden
from inside of one of these other
methods and that is in fact how you do
it and how you do it is so again the
object followed by the name of the
method that you want to print out if you
click on this you can see that that
indeed did print out to the screen and
again you would probably want to also
create different access or methods again
I'm going to show you a really intricate
neat way to do this in the next tutorial
for all of your additional attributes
inside of Python and you can do it just
that simple and there you have access or
methods that allow you to change the
name of the animal just that easily
and yes indeed there is what are what is
called ad constructor and it is of the
form of de L and basically what I mean
by DD constructor is that it's a garbage
collector it is called whenever you no
longer need the object and whenever you
call this method it actually deletes the
object from
Python but the Deconstructor method
unlike other programming languages it's
not often used with the Python
programming language there's just a
basic run-through of how to create
methods how to create private methods
and attributes and private attributes
inside a Python using this example again
in the next tutorial I'm going to cover
a lot more complicated things I'm going
to teach you how to make a really really
flexible like instead of having to
create all of these gazillion different
types of methods to change things I'm
going to show you a really neat and
interesting way to do this and I'm going
to show you how to create objects that
are actually made up from two different
classes and review a bunch of functions
that allow you to analyze objects and
classes and of course the granddaddy of
them all I'm going to totally explain
polymorphism using the same sort of an
animal example if you have any questions
or comments leave them in the comment
section below I do answer them til next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
