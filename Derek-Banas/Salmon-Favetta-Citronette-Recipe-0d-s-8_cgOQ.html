me for more recipes so today I'm going
to show you how to make my absolute most
favorite recipe it's salmon with a time
vivetta and a celery chive and radish
citra net sounds very fancy but it's
actually very easy to make and very good
and overall very healthy first you add a
fourth of a cup of olive oil then you
add one celery stalk about to commence
of chives and one radish chopped up 6
tablespoons of lemon juice and I'm
eyeballing here but this is about two
tablespoons of a brown mustard or of
course you could use a Dijon mustard
this is what I'm using you don't have to
use that you can use any brown mustard
or diesel and of course because I like
to blend things i blend it but first i
have to plug the blender in
done there is your citroen at that
sounds really fancy but it's very easy
to make then you want to dump that into
a bowl and throw that in refrigerator
and you don't have to clean the ball
dump it right back on there then I'll
show you how to make the vet with time
put 19 ounces of fava beans in your
blender I like to rinse them to get rid
of some of the sodium then to that I'm
going to put a fourth of a cup of
fat-free 50ml this is going to make it
rain here and then half tablespoon per
and two tablespoons of fresh thyme
I'm going to mix it around
everyone
scrape down the sides and of course you
could add oil to this mixture or you
could add more milk if you need to do
that and blend it until it has a
consistency of refried beans then I turn
a pan on high and I take the favela and
dump it into the pan and basically all
I'm doing here is heating this up so I'm
not doing anything else that's fancy in
any way don't do that in the pan and
that's basically going to cook for as
long as it takes the salmon to cook
occasionally of course you're going to
have to stir it around in the pan so it
does not burn or get any dry spots so
mix it around like this and spread it
out and heat it up that's all to it how
you want to get a pan really really
really hot you can put in about half of
tablespoon Volvo you don't need much
they although go around and im using
salmon that comes with the skin on
because it doesn't matter normally
salmon with the skin on cost a dollar
less and I'm going to show you how to
get rid of the skin basically just put
your salmon fillet and these are half
pound salmon Floyd in here and then put
a lid on them and let them sit like that
for about three and a half minutes
actually scratch that two and a half
minutes just about perfect you can hear
they want two scoops underneath the
salmon and the skin will come right off
there that's a savior dollar
anything with the other one skin comes
right off then let this cook for an
additional two minutes on the other side
then on a plate you want to place your
fava beans like a have right there take
your slice of salmon place that on top
and then cover the salmon with the Citra
not like so and there you have salmon
with time vivetta and radish and celery
