of my wordpress theme tutorial now we're
getting into the meat of how to create
themes in this part of the tutorial I'm
going to actually show you how to create
the HTML that goes into this guy right
here which is going to become a theme I
know it's not the most beautiful thing
on earth but if you understand the
concepts of how this goes together
you'll be able to create almost anything
and i created this basic look in
Photoshop that was extremely easy to do
if you understand Photoshop in any way
so that's why I'm not going to show you
how to actually draw that in Photoshop
and here on left side of your screen you
can see all of the code that is needed
to create an XHTML strict validated file
and all of the code is available in a
link in the underbar if you want to get
it and it's free of course so there's
all that information no reason to type
that out because I might mess something
up and then I'm going to jump right into
this and if you don't know HTML or CSS I
provide a link to tutorials on that on
the screen because you want to have to
understand them ok so I'm going to come
in here and i'm just going to define my
title and again this is going to be all
of the HTML that's required in the next
part of this tutorial I'm going to go
into all the CSS then we're gonna have a
completely working web page and then I'm
going to convert that into a theme you
have to do this piece by piece well I
know I'm going to have a style sheet so
I'm going to link out to it this is how
you do it just point towards where it's
located and all themes have a file
called style.css then i'm going to copy
this because i need to link to a couple
other style sheets one of those style
sheets is going to be specific to my
homepage and then the other one is going
to be in my includes directory or folder
and it's going to be called menu I'm
going to be specific to the menu system
and going to link to an external
javascript file and as we move through
this I'm going to have to make some
changes to the theme to make everything
work if you saw the previous parts of
this tutorial you understand the basics
of how WordPress pulls information using
PHP and right so there's the JavaScript
code that I need to link to and now I
can close off the head part of my HTML
and get into the body area and I know I
want to wrap everything inside of a div
so all of this is going to be wrapped in
one div so I got to create one and i'm
going to call it page wrapper why
because that's what I always call it no
other reason and then I need to create
the head
section which is this part up here so
I'm going to go to div ID because
there's only going to be one header as
if there's only going to be one page
wrapper that's why I'm using IDs instead
of classes later on i'll use classes
whenever there's going to be multiple
versions of whatever there is on screen
and then i know i'm going to have to
link to an image which is the logo so
i'm going to have an images folder and
the logo became logo too then i have to
use my alt text and i'm going to give it
a width equal to 60 pixels in height
equal to 60 pixels I know technically I
should do all styling in the CSS code
but this does validate doing this so I'm
doing it that way and then i have my
blog title right here ki care so what am
I going to do for that since it's going
to be the biggest text on screen I'm
going to have it be an h1 tag I'm going
to give it an ID equal to blog title and
teacher clothes off at h1 tag and I give
everything an ID let's scroll up here a
little bit and then I'm going to create
a paragraph tag and it's going to
contain the blog slogan and i don't know
if i set it or not but there's a link to
all of this code in the underbar and i
want to put any in sign but if you want
this to be HTML strict you have to put
this little code in here so that's an
ants on and close that off and then
close off the div for the header section
so there's your header section all of
this is done right here that's all
that's needed to be done course close
off the div and then I'm going to create
another div for my menu system which I'm
going to get back to here in a second
I'm just caught menu and then I'm going
to close off that div like I said get
back to in a second then what do we have
after the menu we have this featured
banner so I'm going to come in here
create another div everything is just
boxes in HTML and CSS featured banner
this is an image source is equal to
images I'm going to call that nurse
banner give it a height you could a 250
pixels width equal two thousand and this
whole entire page is a thousand and
width and give it an ID equal to
featured image so that I'll be able to
change it the future if I decide to
change it and then i'm done with that so
i can close off that div and then what
do I have well you might actually think
I'd create the content section next but
that is not the way it goes if you want
to float things right using CSS code you
have to create them before you create
whatever you're going to have over here
so i have to actually create the two
sidebars before i create the content
section no big deal create a new
give give it an ID first side and then
inside of there I'm going to have all
these information here so i'm going to
create another div class is equal to
sidebar widgets because that's what
they're called inside of wordpress
widgets all right then i'm going to
create another div and this is going to
be a class this time just like this
because there's going to be multiple
versions of this that i'm going to
target with CSS code so since it's not
going to be the only one the only
sidebar widget or the only sidebar title
it has to be called a class and i make
this an h4 tag title in sidebar just
like it says there and then i'm going to
close off this div and then next up
paragraph class is equal to sidebar
excerpt like that aah reference and
we'll leave this empty for now i'ma call
this click for more for now and then
close that guy off alright so then if I
want to create three of them like I have
there on the screen i'm just going to
copy this and paste those in there and
then i'm going to close off that div and
then i'm going to close off the sidebar
do all together so there's the whole
sidebar right there first sidebar this
is closing at off see and how easy it is
to read this whenever you indent
everything and then this div is closing
that Dave off so there's that sideboard
well I actually want to create to
sidebar so what do I did well I'm just
gonna copy and paste them copy going and
I'm just going to come in here and get a
second side bar and then since
everything else is gonna be exactly the
same I'm just gonna leave it like that
so I first side bar there and then I
have second side bar there so everything
else is the same and now since I have
that out of the way I can get into the
main content area here scroll up since
it is the main content I'm gonna give it
a day of ID is equal to main content
then what do I have their intro title
which is going to be here man this is
going to be a missed message from the
owner and then this is going to be some
posts that I pull in the call this intro
title again it's this guy right here and
since its second biggest thing on the
screen and we give it an h2 tag and I'm
gonna say welcome to my web site H to
close the div and then i have this lip
some text that's right here so i'm going
to create a paragraph give it an ID
intro burger now i need some lip some
code to throw into that don't jump over
here and grab some got it i'm going to
paste that in there just for now and
then i need to close off the power
and then I have to create all the
different titles and images and all this
content that's going to be coming from
the post how I'm going to do that is I'm
actually going to create an unordered
list puts lists is equal to y am i
create a list item do this a lot with
wordpress themes and then i'm going to
need a title class post title pose it'll
goes here and then i have to create a
paragraph class is equal to post excerpt
and then i need to lorem ipsum brother
blah unanimous throw a break statement
in here at the end of that might get rid
of that later on then I need a link each
reference is equal to and I'm just going
to put nothing in there for now glass is
equal to and I'm just going to call this
click for more supposing that I want all
my links tack the same click for more
I'm gonna close off the paragraph tag
and if you're watching very closely you
probably are wondering why didn't put
the image in their first and the reason
why it has certain amount to do with how
my CSS code is going to work out and I'm
just going to use the logo currently
right here what I'm going to do is with
CSS I'm going to move this over the
excerpt and then I'm going to move the
image up and to be able to do that you
have to have the image actually show up
after the excerpt you're going to say it
in the next tutorial then the alt text
ki care logo and I'm gonna give it a
width equal to 60 pixels and height
equal to 60 pixels and I'm going to give
it a class equal to post image these are
key holders to a certain extent so they
will change and then since this is a
list item I have to actually come in
here closed off that list item and then
i'm also going to come in here clothes
off the unordered list right like that
and then i'm going to jump up here to
this guy right here and i'm going to
copy it and paste that in there so now I
got two of those versions in there so
that's good and now I have to create my
footer section which is this guy right
down here and I'm going to give it an
ideal guess what footer create another
div and I'm going to give it an idea of
copyright and then to create the
copyright symbol that's down here to go
like this copy 2011 and I'm just gonna
type in my theme since that's what I
have over there but of course this is
going to change as well and then I get a
closed off that div right like that now
the only thing left to do is to get all
the menu code and in a previous tutorial
I
showed you how to create a menu bar
system so i'm actually providing a link
to that in this part of the tutorial you
can go check that out just no point in
me doing that tutorial over again but if
I jump over here here is a link to that
menu bar system that I had created
previously now of course I'm not going
to need this because I already have a
div so I'm going to select this and
scroll down to the bottom and highlight
this whole entire table system copy that
and then jump back into my index dot PHP
file and I'm just going to paste all
that code directly inside of here except
let's take out this comment right like
that and then take this out again these
are just placeholders all this
information in this menu is going to be
a hundred percent dynamic by the time
we're done with that and just to see
what this guy looks like I'm going to
file save him and then open up a browser
and just to check it out I have the
validator the HTML validator here as you
can see right here on your screen if you
go to this place you can actually paste
your code directly inside of here and
then hit check and it'll tell you if it
validates or not yes it did validate as
you can see right here there's one
warning and the warning has to do with
character types which get messed up
whenever you use this tool so this is
one hundred percent validated as you can
see past but to show you how ugly it is
in this current format I'm going to load
it up here on the screen and you can see
this is what it looks like on the screen
right now kind of ugly but in the next
part of the tutorial I'm going to show
you how to do all of the CSS code to
make this all pretty and nice so that it
looks exactly like what you see here on
the screen any questions or comments
leave them in the comment section below
otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
