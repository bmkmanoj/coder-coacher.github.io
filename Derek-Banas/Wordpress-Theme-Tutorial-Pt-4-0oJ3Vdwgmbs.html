my wordpress theme tutorial now we're
getting into the meat of how to create
themes in this part of the tutorial I'm
going to actually show you how to create
the HTML that goes into this guy right
here which is going to become a theme I
know it's not the most beautiful thing
on earth but if you understand the
concepts of how this goes together
you'll be able to create almost anything
and I created this basic look in
Photoshop that was extremely easy to do
if you understand Photoshop in any way
so that's why I'm not going to show you
how to actually draw that in Photoshop
and here on the left side of your screen
you can see all of the code that is
needed to create an XHTML strict
validated file and all of the code is
available in a link in the underbar if
you want to get it and it's free of
course so there's all that information
no reason to type that out because I
might mess something up and then I'm
gonna jump right into this and if you
don't know HTML or CSS I provide a link
to tutorials on that on the screen
because you don't have to understand
them ok so I'm gonna come in here and
I'm just gonna define my title and again
this is going to be all of the HTML
that's required in the next part of this
tutorial I'm gonna go into all the CSS
then we're gonna have a completely
working web page and then I'm gonna
convert that into a theme you have to do
this piece by piece well I know I'm
gonna have a stylesheet so I'm gonna
link out to it and this is how you do it
just point towards where it's located
and all themes have a file called style
dot CSS then I'm gonna copy this because
I need to link to a couple other style
sheets one of those style sheets is
going to be specific to my home page and
then the other one is going to be in my
includes
directory or folder it's going to be
called menu gonna be specific to the
menu system and I'm going to link to an
external javascript file and as we move
through this I'm gonna have to make some
changes to the theme to make everything
work if you saw the previous parts of
this tutorial you understand the basics
of how WordPress pulls information using
PHP all right so there's the JavaScript
code that I need the link to and now I
can close off the head part of my HTML
and get into the body area and I know I
want to wrap everything inside of a div
so all of this is gonna be wrapped in
one div so I got to create one and I am
going to call it page wrapper why
because that's what I always call it no
other reason and then I need to create
the
her section which is this part up here
so I'm gonna get a div ID because
there's only gonna be one header as if
there's only going to be one page
wrapper that's why I'm using IDs instead
of classes later on I'll use classes
whenever there's gonna be multiple
versions of whatever there is on the
screen and then I know I'm going to have
to link to an image which is the logo so
I'm gonna have an images folder and the
logo became logo two then I have to use
my alt text and I'm gonna give it a
width equal to sixty pixels and a height
equal to sixty pixels I know technically
I should do all styling in the CSS code
but this does validate doing this so I'm
doing it that way and then I have my
blog title right here key care so what
am I gonna do for that since it's going
to be the biggest text on screen I'm
gonna have it be an h1 tag and I'm gonna
give it an ID equal to blog title and
key care close off that h1 tag and I
give everything an ID let's scroll up
here a little bit and then I'm going to
create a paragraph tag and it's gonna
contain the blog slogan and I don't know
if I set it or not but there's a link to
all of this code in the underbar and I
want to put any in sign but if you want
this to be HTML strict you have to put
this little code in here so that's an
ants on and close that off and then
close off the div for the header section
so there's your header section all of
this is done right here that's all
that's needed to be done of course close
off the div and then I'm going to create
another div for my menu system which I'm
going to get back to here in a second
I'm just gonna call it menu and then I'm
going to close off that div like I said
get back to it in a second but then what
do we have after the menu we have this
featured banner so I'm gonna come in
here create another div everything is
just boxes in HTML and CSS featured
banner this is an image source is equal
to images I'm gonna call that nurse
banner give it a height equal to 250
pixels width equal to thousand and this
whole entire page is a thousand and
width and give it an ID equal to
featured image so that I'll be able to
change it in the future if I decide to
change it and then I'm done with that so
I can close off that div and then what
do I have well you might actually think
I'd create the content section next but
that is not the way it goes if you want
to float things right using CSS code you
have to create them before you create
whatever your going to have over here so
I have to actually create the two
sidebars before I create the content
section no big deal creating
give it an ID first side and then inside
of there I'm gonna have all these
information here so I'm going to create
another div class is equal to sidebar
widgets because that's what they're
called inside of WordPress widgets all
right then I'm gonna create another div
and this is gonna be a class this time
just like this because there's gonna be
multiple versions of this that I'm going
to target with CSS code so since it's
not going to be the only one the only
sidebar widget or the only sidebar title
it has to be a called
a class and I'm gonna make this an h4
tag title in just like it says and then
I'm gonna close off this div and then
next up paragraph class sequel su
sidebar excerpt like that hey H
reference and we'll leave this empty for
now I'm gonna call this click for more
for now and then close that guy off all
right so then if I want to create three
of them like I have here on the screen
I'm just gonna copy this and paste those
in there and then I'm gonna close off
that div and then I'm gonna close off
the sidebar div all together so there's
the whole sidebar right there first
sidebar this is closing that off see how
easy it is to read this whenever you
indent everything and then this div is
closing that div off so there's that
sidebar well I actually want to create
two sidebars so what do I do
well I'm just gonna copy and paste I'm
copy going and I'm just gonna come in
here and get a second sidebar and then
since everything else is gonna be
exactly the same I'm just gonna leave it
like that
so our first sidebar there and then I
have second sidebar there so everything
else is the same
and now since I have that out of the way
I can get into the main content area
here scroll up since it is the main
content I'm gonna give it a date of ID
is equal to main content then what do I
have there intro title which is going to
be here then this is gonna be a missed
message from the owner and then this is
gonna be some posts that I pull in to
call this intro title again it's this
guy right here and since its second
biggest thing on the screen am I giving
an h2 tag and I'm gonna say welcome to
my website h2 close the div and then I
have this lip some text that's right
here so I'm going to create a paragraph
give it an ID intro okay now I need some
lip some code to throw into that
don't jump over here and grab some got
it I'm gonna paste that in there just
for now and then I need to close off the
and then I have to create all the
different titles and images and all this
content that's gonna be coming from the
post how I'm gonna do that is I'm
actually going to create an unordered
list puts lists is equal to yeah I'm a
tree a list item do this a lot with
WordPress themes and then I'm going to
need a title class post
I don't those it'll goes here and then I
have to create a paragraph class is
equal to post mixer and then I need to
lorem ipsum brother blah
anima throw a break statement in here at
the end of that might get rid of that
later on then I need a link each
reference is equal to and then I'm just
gonna put nothing in there for now
class is equal to and I'm just gonna
call this click for more supposing that
I want all my link stack the same
clicked for more and I'm gonna close off
the paragraph tag and if you're watching
very closely you probably are wondering
why didn't put the image in there first
and the reason why it has certain amount
to do with how my CSS codes gonna work
out and I'm just gonna use the logo
currently right here what I'm gonna do
is with CSS I'm gonna move this over the
excerpt and then I'm gonna move the
image up and to be able to do that you
have to have the image actually show up
after the excerpt you're gonna say it in
the next tutorial then the alt text
little go and I'm gonna give it a width
equal to 60 pixels and height equal to
60 pixels and I'm gonna give it a class
equal to post image these are key
holders to a certain extent so they will
change and then since this is a list
item I have to actually come in here
close off that list item and then I'm
also gonna come in here and close off
the unordered list right like that and
then I'm gonna jump up here to this guy
right here and I'm gonna copy it and
paste that in there so now I got two of
those versions in there so that's good
and now I have to create my footer
section which is this guy right down
here and I'm gonna give it an idea guess
what footer create another div and I'm
gonna give it an ID of copyright and
then to create the copyright symbol
that's down here I have to go like this
copy 2011 and I'm just gonna type in my
theme since that's what I have over
there but of course this is gonna change
as well and then I get a close off that
div like that now the only thing left to
do is to get all the menu code and in a
previous tutorial
showed you how to create a menu bar
system so I'm actually providing a link
to that in this part of the tutorial you
can go check that out there's no point
in me doing that tutorial over again but
if I jump over here here is a link to
that menu bar system that I had created
previously now of course I'm not going
to need this because I already have a
div so I'm gonna select this and we're
scroll down to the bottom and highlight
this whole entire table system copy that
and then jump back into my index dot PHP
file and I'm just gonna paste all that
code directly inside of here except
let's take out this comment right like
that
and then take this out again these are
just placeholders all this information
and this menu is gonna be a hundred
percent dynamic by the time we're done
with that and just to see what this guy
looks like I'm gonna file save him and
then open up a browser and just to check
it out I have the validator the HTML
validator here as you can see right here
on your screen if you go to this place
you can actually paste your code
directly inside of here and then hit
check and it'll tell you if it validates
or not yes it did validate as you can
see right here there's one warning and
the warning has to do with character
types which get messed up whenever you
use this tool so this is 100% validated
as you can see past but to show you how
ugly it is in this current format I'm
gonna load it up here on the screen and
you can see this is what it looks like
on the screen right now kind of ugly
but in the next part of the tutorial I'm
gonna show you how to do all of the CSS
code to make this all pretty and nice so
that it looks exactly like what you see
here on the screen any questions or
comments leave them in the comment
section below otherwise til next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
