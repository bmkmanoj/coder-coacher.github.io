6 of my visual basic tutorial in this
part of the tutorial I'm going to cover
menu bars toolbars on a whole bunch of
other stuff I missed in the previous
parts of tutorial if you haven't watched
the previous parts I provide a link on
the screen to those right here and in
the description you'll find a link to
all the code in this video as well as a
transcript and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it alright so here we are
in Visual Studio
once again alright so to create a menu
strip of course you're going to have to
open up your toolbox down here and then
you're going to want to scroll until you
see menu strip you might have to go and
scroll up here let me show you here and
open up the menus and toolbars part but
we are going to be using the menu strip
here and to use it you just drag it and
you drop it and it goes right in there
it doesn't you don't have to tell it
exactly where to go now if we want to
use some of the standard items we can do
that quite easily just by right-clicking
this guy and then clicking on insert
standard items and that's going to throw
a file edit tools help and if you click
on these you're going to see all the
individual parts everything is made for
you already so that's super awesome so I
want to go in here and change some items
so I'm just going to click on this guy
and I'm going to come over here where
you see items and I'm going to click on
collection and then click on this little
doodad and this guy is going to pop up
right here and I want to add in a view
so I'm going to come in here and I'm
going to click on add and then I can
come in and change the name on this guy
so what I'm going to do is just click
right there
and I'm going to type in view and then
I'm going to get rid of that one right
there then I'm going to scroll down
inside of here where it says name and a
double click this guy and change that to
view as well and then I can move it up
just by clicking these guys so let's say
I want it right after edit I can throw
it right there
whoops I actually did this backwards
let's go and get this one copy that
right there and scroll down here and
where it says this one there for
underneath design put that there and
then come back up here and then change
this to view sorry about that and then
we will click on OK and now we will see
that view shows up directly right inside
of there now I'm going to select view
once again and come over here where it
says drop
down items and I'm going to click inside
of there once again and then with this
guy I'm going to click on add and then
I'm going to throw a thing inside of
here that is going to change whether a
toolbar is going to be displayed or not
just to do something random so I'm going
to come up here and I'm going to say in
here hide toolbar and then down here I'm
going to the same exact thing I'm going
to go hide toolbar and then I'm going to
get rid of the one at the very end of
that and there that goes I can also come
in and change shortcut keys so we can
come down here where it says shortcut
keys and it says none and I can click on
that and let's say that I want the
toolbar to be hid if they click on ctrl
alt + X I can do that so scroll down
here where we see an X way at the bottom
and click on that and just click
anywhere for that to take effect and
then click on OK and now you're going to
see hide toolbar shows up right there
now I'm going to come in here also
you're going to be able to just click
inside of here and type stuff inside of
there so let's just click there and we
could throw a separator in there or
whatever we want so just throw a
separator in there if you'd like doesn't
matter and then inside of here I'm going
to type in font click up here to
unselect it then reselect it then come
over here and we're going to change the
name of this actually font tool strip
menu item looks pretty good so I'm just
going to leave it there and now I can
come over here and add some different
fonts inside of here so let's say that I
want to have Ariel be a font I can do
that and I can also come in and change
this two times and then also come in
here and change this to carrier okay so
three different fonts that we have then
we can come in and also select Arial we
don't have to do a couple other
different things because I want to have
these be checkboxes because that makes
sense for me
so Arial tool strip menu item that looks
good and I'll come in here and go to the
check part let's say we want to have
Arial be the default font I'm going to
change that to true and then check on
click I'm also going to select this and
change that to true then for the other
fonts I'm going to select them and they
are not going the the other ones won't
be checked so I'm going to leave the
checked as false check on click however
going to change that to true and we'll
do exactly the same thing for the
courier as well so let's go in here
checked false check on click change
the true and when I change this to
carrier font just to give it a little
bit of a different type of name and
we'll do the same exact thing four times
as well so change that right there to
font and then we will do exactly the
same thing for Ariel she's just doing
you're all I'm changing is I'm putting
font inside of there now we can go in
here and set this up so that whenever
one of these is checked the other ones
go and are unchecked so let's just
double click on Ariel and I'm going to
come in and I am going to say if Arial
font tool strip menu item so just get
that guy and then I'm going to go
checked is equal to true I don't need to
be zoomed in so far then and this is
going to be triggered of course if
that's clicked on then I'm going to say
that I want all of the other ones to be
unchecked rotated times font tool strip
item and we will set that to false of
course this is going to be the checked
argument and then we're going to do the
same exact thing for courier so courier
checked is going to be equal to false
and once again that's just going to be
so that they are when one selected the
other ones automatically are unselected
and then I'm going to do exactly the
same thing for all the other ones so
jump back over into the forum and double
click on times and then inside of here
we will throw that in there and we will
just change this two times and we will
change this to Ariel I spelled Ariel
right oh let's check it Ariel
yeah that looks good and then we will do
this same thing for the courier so
double click on that paste that in there
and we will get courier and copy that
and we will throw that inside of there
and then we will come in here and go and
throw Ariel inside of there and we will
save that let's run it just to make sure
that it works out for us and here it is
and if we click on View and fonts you'll
see Ariel selected let's check on times
and then we come in here once again view
and you can see times is check the arrow
isn't and we'll click on courier and we
will double check alright so there is
every single one of those guys and they
are working exactly as we would like
alright so that is working out and now I
am going to make all that other stuff
work that
inside the menu but what I want to do
now is jump over and show you where you
can get a whole bunch of different icons
and so forth and then we will create our
toolstrip or our toolbar all right so if
you want a whole bunch of Microsoft
centric created icons to make your
application look professional you're
going to go to this web address
Microsoft comm da and there's a link in
the description if you can't see that
and then what you're going to do is
you're going to come down here which
says download and select download and
this is going to pop up and what you can
look at all these different icons
there's tons of them but this is
normally the one that I get so I just
get that one and click on next and
you're going to save it wherever you
want to save it just make sure that you
extract the file so that you will be
able to go and access those icons all
right so now we want to come in here and
we want to create our tool strip or our
tool bar Microsoft calls it a toll strip
so I'm going to come down here and I'm
going to grab tool strip and drag whoops
I missed it down there and grow up yeah
I got it and let's just drag it and drop
it anywhere and it's going to go right
in place you can see there is the tool
strip right there and I'm going to
change this to a different name I'm
going to call this TSP main so TSP main
like that that works out and guess what
you can also go and throw put the
standard items inside of there just by
right-clicking and then coming down here
to insert standard items and there they
are and I'm going to make those work
here in a moment the copy and paste and
all that other stuff now I want to come
in and add in another tool strip so
we're just going to grab it once again
drag it up here and drop it in and there
we go
and I'm going to call this guy TSP
format so TSP format that and that's
good enough name and now we can go in
there and I'll show you how to throw
those icons and that you just downloaded
we're going to come over here and we are
going to select items so scroll in
through here until you find items and
there's items and just click on that to
open that up what this guy's going to do
is just provide you for a way to change
the font color and other different
things so I'm going to click on add
there's that guy and let's go to its
name
and that is right there and I'm going to
change this to font color so let's just
do it right there and say font color and
get rid of that one right there and then
to throw in the icon we're going to use
I'm going to get the image right here
and I'm going to click on that guy click
on this it's going to allow me to import
images so as long as you extracted your
images this is the where it's going to
show up and it's going to be called
something like Visual Studio 2013 image
library and then you're going to go to
all these different things and there's a
whole bunch of them to explore so find
whatever you'd like
I'm going to scroll through here and
just find something random so what I say
this is going to be the font color so
I'm going to come over here and I'm just
going to find this guy right here and it
looks good enough and I'm going to
double click on it you can see there is
the icon for that and click on OK and
then I want to add another one and this
one's going to be font size so let's go
and get the name for this right there
and I'll change this to font size and
tool strip button and there that is and
then we will find the image which is
right here
and I'll select that and I'll import and
then we will go and find font size so
let's see what that guy is well a little
bit too for the depth to the font size
where are you there's font size so let's
just select that and click on OK there's
another one and let's just leave that as
okay right now and then let's show you
how to add another thing up here I'm
going to select this guy and let's say I
want to put a separator inside of there
I can just click like this and throw a
separator and there's that separator and
then I can come in here also and let's
throw in a brand new button that's what
these guys are known as buttons and what
this is going to do is it's going to
open and close this toolbar so I'm going
to make sure that that's selected come
over here and let's change some things
going to want to change the name for
this so let's come right here and let's
change this to open format tool strip
button kind of a long name but that
works and let's come down here where it
has our image and let's select that and
select this and then let's import
another icon and this is going to be
font dialog
there's font dialog so just double click
on that
and click on okay all right and there is
our new toolbars and how they're set up
now if I want to make this work so that
it will open and close the other toolbar
I can just come in here like this
and I can just come in and go TSP format
and visible is equal to true then I want
to say TSP format visible is going to be
equal to false so this is just going to
turn it off or turn it on that's just it
else I'm going to say that if it's not
true that I want it to be true so let's
throw that there and throw that there
and let's change this to true and of
course we want to throw an if statement
right there and of course we want to
throw an ENDIF inside of there now let's
test that to see if that works doctored
up and there that is and if we click on
it it comes and it goes
alright so cool stuff now what I want to
do is jump back over into the form and
I'm going to throw a textbox inside
there because I'm going to show you how
copy and paste and a whole bunch of that
other stuff works as well let's go and
find a toolbox this is freaking out
because I'm running numerous different
applications at one time so textbox I'm
going to grab it and I'm going to drop
it I think I got it here there that is
of course going to change this to
multi-line true and I'm going to change
the scroll bars to vertical so let's say
like this and vertical and I'll just
leave that with the name of textbox one
if you're wondering that's what I'll be
referring to in the code and let's go
get this guy and resize it so that it
fits most of the window and now we're
going to start writing some real code so
to do so I'm going to come into the new
this guy right here and I'm going to
double click on it and write the code to
make it work all right so if I want to
clear my textbox whenever new is clicked
on I can just go text box one dot text
is equal to string empty and that will
clear the text box in essence giving me
a brand new one and if I want to set the
focus on that if it doesn't already have
it I can go text box one and focus and
there that is alright that's it that's
how hard it is to go and clear a text
box and give it focus jump back over
into the form now let's say I want to
get open to work let's double click on
it
and I actually showed you how to open
the open file window so I'm just going
to get that code copy and paste it
covered that in the last part of the
tutorial and here that is and there it
is I just pasted it all in there
like I said if you want to know what
that is and have a full explanation
watch the last part of the tutorial and
it's exactly the same exact code I had
before so now that's going to open up
the dialogue it's going to allow me to
open up files jump back over into the
form now let's show you how to save
double-click again going to use exactly
the same code don't worry I'm not going
to just keep referring to previous
tutorials here but this is the last one
where I'm actually going to use code
that I covered in previous tutorial
there's all that code just copied and
pasted it in there and let's just save
that and run it just to see that it
worked there we are and we can come in
here I can just go blah blah whatever
and click on this you can see that the
new worked we can click on this to see
that it opens up the ability for us to
select files and I'll just hit cancel
and this will be the save dialog okay so
you can see that all of those work now
for something a little bit more
interesting I'm going to come in here
and I'm going to have it set up to undo
what was previously done so let's double
click on that and now to do something a
little bit more interesting I'm going to
have it set up so that we will be able
to undo things so let's just double
click on that and to undo an action what
we're going to do is we're going to say
if type of me dot ActiveX control is
text box we're just saying if we're
dealing with a text box here then C type
me ActiveX control again text box and
then after this undo and that's how we
undo a previous action that was done all
right most I'll show you exactly how
that's going to work here in a second
but it might as well also come in here
and show you how to cut so let's come in
here and double click on cut there that
is and we have cut in the menu bar as
well as the tool bar so I'll show you
how to fix that up here you're going to
do pretty much exactly the same thing so
we're going to come in and just copy
this and we will paste it inside of
there again we are going to be dealing
with a text box and only thing we have
to change to make that work is by typing
cut there it is it works that's it so
now let's make
the toolbar version of cut work so we'll
just come in here and there's the cut
icon double-click it there that is and
to make it work we're just going to call
the previous cut function this guy right
here so we're going to call cut tool
strip menu item click alright so all of
that and then throw this inside of here
and then we just have to put sender Andy
and that's it how that works now we're
going to make the copy work once again
we're going to come up here to this guy
and double click on copy guess what
we're going to do pretty much the same
exact thing whoops as we did previously
up here so let's just copy it and let's
paste it in and then guess what we're
just going to change this to copy that's
it it works that's all and then we can
go and copy this guy right here so that
it works with the toolbar version double
click anywhere and copy double click and
again sender Andy now that works ok so
simple now let's make paste work let's
go and copy this because we're going to
need it jump back over into the form
jump right here to do paste part and
throw that right there and change this
to paste and then guess what we're going
to copy this guy once again jump back
over here whoops I did that backwards
doesn't matter click on this let's
double click on paste probably should
correct it but I'm just going to leave
it that way
and sender and II save it and what else
can we do let's jump back over here all
there's also select all double click it
bounced down inside of there and guess
what we do for select all if you think
we use pretty much exactly the same
thing except to change it to select all
you would be correct and we're gonna do
that and paste it and change this to
select all and guess what it'll work and
I don't think I have a select all in
there let's save that do I have a slick
tall down here no I don't I could of
course come in here and make all these
other different things work but I think
you guys are getting the basic idea of
how we're going to be able to work all
these things let's go in and start ran
run it and see if everything checks out
here is our little form let's just say
is a oops you know what you can't read
that let's go and close that out get the
text box and change the font size of
that and let's change it to 18 so that
you
able to actually see what I'm typing in
here click on 18 doctor da da and run it
again and there it is and scrolling here
a little bit so you can see it this is a
string and let's go and check the copy
and paste works so I'm going to do ctrl
C to see if that works and then I'm
going to do ctrl V so the shortcut works
likewise we're also going to be able to
come up here and go paste there that
works let's see if cut works cut works
and of course we'll be able to do ctrl V
again we could also come in and do
select all you can see everything's
copied right there and we could do a
copy and we could do another paste and
all of that works is there anything else
I did not do though dr. death uh oh yes
let's do undo and you can see I went
back to what it did and can we do
another undo and you can see yes indeed
alright so there is a run down guys of
how to deal with menu bars as well as
toolbars and cutting and copying and
pasting on a whole bunch of other
different things I hope you guys found
that useful
big C sharp tutorial is coming very very
soon as well as games and a whole bunch
of other things you guys requested and
like always please leave your questions
and comments below otherwise till next
