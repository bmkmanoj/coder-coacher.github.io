presentation in which I will provide an
overview on all of the information on
personality tests you took if you didn't
take it there's a link right above to
take that personality test this
presentation I'm gonna go over what all
the codes mean I'll explain the most
common mail personalities I'll also
explain the most common female
personalities and get into which
personalities get along and which ones
do not you can see here all the codes
that you generated and based off of what
your code is you will either see it on
this slide or on the next slide and what
you want to do is write down whatever
the name is next to said code and I
tried to make these really really
understandable and these groups right
here naturally get along with each other
they are called Duty seekers their whole
point in life is to get things done
action seekers are looking for action
just like it says and if your code is
one of these codes then you should write
down the word that is next to said code
again this group is only interested for
the most part in knowledge while this
group is totally associated with their
values and makes decisions as such so
what type are you
well I'm going to go over what exactly
these codes mean you have extroverted or
introverted and basically what that
means is this is how you energize
yourself so an extrovert is energized by
being in a group atmosphere while
introverts or more energized and are
better able to get things done by
themselves then you have how you take in
information you have your sensors and
you have your intuitive see they're kind
of complicated work so I'll explain them
sensors basically look for facts and
think about past experiences while in
tutors more rely on hunches or gut
reactions they just act they don't
necessarily look at all the facts then
you the third code goes over how you
evaluate information and make final
decisions you have your thinkers which
look for facts
who want the lists of information I want
to really pour over it well you have
feelers who more require the ability to
trust the person as providing the
information and they heavily weigh their
decisions based off of who do they trust
or do they have the same values as the
person who's
dividing the information and then
finally you have whether you prefer to
get a job done or take forever to get
the job done right and if based off of
that information you're either what is
called a judging person or a perceiving
person so let's focus more in here on
the first code this refers again to
whether a person is energized by the
outside or inner world introversion does
not mean antisocial extroverts act then
think seek interaction very talkative
like variety and think out loud these
are the people that often will say the
wrong thing in the wrong time introverts
however think first like alone time
often are more quiet than extroverts
obviously prefer to handle one activity
at a time like to think to themselves on
to the second code sensors trust past
experience common sense focus on
problems are considered to be more
realistic prefer specifics and prefer
facts and you have intuitive switch
trust hunches are more innovative focus
on goals live more in the imagination
prefer the big picture rather than a
mile long list of facts and prefer
insight then you have your thinkers
versus feelers thinkers are not easily
insulted decide with their head or
direct objective and analyze while
feelers are easily insulted decide with
their heart may be indirect convinced by
values and prefer feelings and making
decisions based off of whether they like
the person who is trying to lead them or
not and finally in the fourth code you
have judges versus perceiving people
these judges are very structured seek
goals like finishing projects they are
very plan oriented and they value order
while perceivers are more easygoing
solve problems like starting projects
with emphasis on like starting projects
meaning they'll start many projects at
once adapt as things come up and value
taking their time to get things done
right so one of the male personality
styles you can see right here in this
chart almost 20% of males are receipe
followers which works out great for
women that are planners actually large
majority of the public prefers to follow
plans
that's what recipe followers do these
are all my
own terms I tried to make these a lot
more understandable than monitoring's
many of the other personality tests see
on the next frame almost twenty percent
of men are recipe followers followed by
bowls calculators inventors and geniuses
and in the other presentation I'm gonna
go through exactly what all these mean
and the least common male personality
tape our teachers then we move on to
female personality styles most women are
planners followed by givers and recipe
followers again as you can see here on
the percentages that are provided on
this screen least common female
personality type are commanders so who
gets along with who well bulls givers
recipe followers and planners get along
because these Duty seekers predominantly
all trust their past experiences and all
prefer to plan before moving forward and
those are very important codes and the
fact that they are equal in all of these
people makes these people naturally you
like each other as you can see whether a
person's introverted versus extroverted
isn't very important in regards to how
well they can work with others then you
have action seekers they predominantly
trust past experiences like these guys
however they love to adapt and just move
with the moment and you have knowledge
seekers who predominantly trust hunches
and decide with their heads versus value
seekers who also like hunches but prefer
to judge with their hearts I'm doing
another YouTube video that is going to
go over all the different personality
types and that links right here if you
want a detailed four-page report
100% for free check in the underbar for
that guy and it's gonna look kind of
like this give any questions or comments
