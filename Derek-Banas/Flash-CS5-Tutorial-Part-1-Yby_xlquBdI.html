my flash cs5 tutorial where I will
explain everything you need to know
about flash to be able to create cartoon
animations in flash whatever you first
create a file inside flash you want to
click on file new and more than likely
you're going to create an ActionScript 3
file it has the extension Fla Fla tells
you that this is a working file mean
it's a file that we plan on changing
inside flash once you publish that file
it becomes an SWF file meaning it is a
file that we no longer are going to be
changing to make a comparison between
flash and photoshop and fla files kind
of like a PSD file versus an SWF file is
a JPEG which is file that we don't plan
on normally changing inside of Photoshop
in flashes white area here is considered
your stage this greater here is
considered your pasteboard anything in
the pasteboard in the final movie will
not show on screen down here you have
your timeline which is used to create
animations and your motion editor which
is used to tweak animations over here on
the right side of your screen you can
see your panels area as well as your
toolbar area if you do not currently
have anything on your stage by default
the properties panel is going to allow
you to manipulate different information
in regards to your complete movie so
here i can define my stage just by
clicking on edit and change the
dimensions both height and width i can
change the background color as well as
the frame rate but i'm going to choose
to let that just be for this moment and
you have your color panel up here here
you define your stroke and your fill you
can flip clock your stroke and fill
colors just that easily you could change
or stroke color just add easily or your
fill color as well just by clicking on
them and making those changes in
swatches you have custom colors that you
plan on using over and over again inside
of your flash files as well as custom
gradients and you can remove these
panels if you should choose to two other
different areas like I move this watch
panel right here you can move those all
over your screen I'm going to first
teach you about drawing shapes because
I'm going to be manipulating these
shapes with a lot of the other tools
first we're going to go over the
rectangle tool within the rectangle tool
you can define the stroke size you can
define what type of stroke whether you
want it to be a hairline solid dash rag
and so forth you
could also come in here and edit the
stroke type just that simply in regards
to scaling what this is paying reference
to is whether you want whenever the
rectangle for this example is increased
whether you want to the stroke size to
increase with it or just increase on a
horizontal or vertical or to not
increase at all join pays reference to
whether you want a beveled or a straight
pointed corner or a rounded corner on
your rectangle and you can also define
corner radiuses for the rectangle if
this is not set for locked and you
change the corner radius for example to
20 you can see here that nothing else
changed and if I draw a rectangular on
the screen you can see that the radius
is different here than it is in the all
these other different corners that are
here on your screen however if I'd set
that to law now all of the corner
radiuses are going to change here on
your screen also in the toolbar area and
I'm going to zoom in so you can see this
if there is a little triangle down here
at the end of one of these points that
denotes that this is a flyout menu
meaning that there are other tools
hidden underneath of that specific tool
bar tool so that's what that pays
reference to and it's commonly used you
can also zoom in and out on your stage
using the magnification tool or you can
hold down option and zoom out just like
that and if it gets all wacky you come
over here and say fit in window it will
automatically fit your stage in the
center of the window and inside of
flashing you use bitmap and vector art
but for the most part you use a lot of
vector art because that's the way flash
is set up and that's why flash files are
so small I'm going to reference
something here you can see when I'm
drawing this rectangle that I have down
here on the screen I have an option to
draw a rectangle as an object or a
merged image an object drawing doesn't
merge with other shapes whenever you put
them on top of each other so let's
create an object drawing like this and
if I come in here and select this object
drawing you can see that it is these are
not merging whenever they are placed on
top of each other which probably makes
sense to you that they would operate
that way well
if I come in here to the rectangle tool
again and use merged drawing and to make
this really simple i'm actually going to
come in here to the stroke area and i'm
actually going to set the stroke 29 and
this is by the way how you would set the
stroke tonight i'm going to draw my
rectangle and i'm going to draw my other
rectangle i'm going to come in here i'm
going to select this rectangle put it
over the other one unselect it you can
see they're joined now and that is
merged drawing and the way that it works
now let's say that I actually came in
here and drew another rectangle with a
different fill color and that would come
over here and drag this on to that guy
and then pull it off it's actually going
to pull part of the image that was
underneath of it along with it so that's
the difference between object drawing
and merge drawing but if we wanted to
turn this rectangle you have here on the
screen into an object will simply just
click on modify combine objects and then
click union now it's considered an
object and if you wanted to change it
back into a merge drawing you'd leave it
selected come up here hit modify and
then hit break apart now it's back to
being a merge drawing and that for the
most part are all the different things
you can do with that rectangle tool you
can also choose to just draw these
rectangles always as objects these are
primitives which allow you to really
simply come in here and make all kinds
of different changes there I did that
with the sub selection tool if I draw
another rectangle I could also do this
with a regular rectangle tool also drew
this rectangle and then I come in with a
sub selection tool it's going to select
all of the points that are inside of
this vector artwork while the regular
selection tool is not going to do that
we could also come in here and to show
you another thing a selection tool can
do if I just draw this little piggys
aggie a little thing right here come in
here with the selection tool select all
of it I can then smooth out all the
corner radius is just like this this
line or make them more jagged or pointy
just by clicking just like that I'm
going to come in here and draw two more
rectangles on your screen if I select
them now going to go over the alignment
tool if I want it to justify these so
that they were exactly in the same
position to the left I would click on
the alignment panel just click on a line
that did that if I want to Center them I
would do that and right justify them
this
could also come in here draw another
rectangle select all those different
rectangles in the alignment panel also
allows me to distribute so the yoozh
would be an equal distance apart and i
could also do an equal distance if they
were aligned horizontally or i could all
set them to the same exact width or the
same height and now they are essentially
the same could also come in here and i'm
actually you're going to see here that
i'm going to change this stroke on this
rectangle it's actually going to affect
every other tool automatically it's just
going to change that what I want to do
here has change the join to a miter
joint so that it's pointed instead of
being that curved that would also have
to change the radius and since locked
everything else going to be law okay so
there's a rectangular way that I would
like to have it set up now I'm actually
going to select this rectangle and show
you how you use the transform tool to
manipulate it and then just click the
mouse and hold it and I can rotate it
just that simply where click on sku skew
it left or right or up and down and I'm
not going to cover the 3d rotation at
this point in time because the 3d tools
can only be used to manipulate symbols
just draw another rectangle here just so
I can show you this other transform tool
that's available to you I can rotate it
just like I did before I could distort
it like I did there I could also skew it
like I did there and it provides all
kinds of different types of distortions
and most artists either use these tools
they don't use them it's totally up to
you I for the most part do a lots and
lots of drawing before I make this go
away you also have your lasso tool which
allows you to come in here and select
odd different shapes and you also have
your polygon elasa which will allow you
to click if you have ever used Adobe
Illustrator you're well aware of the pen
tool and it works just like it does in
Adobe Illustrator as well as in
Photoshop of course with the sub
selection tool you could then come in
here and edit these different points or
you could come in here and add
additional anchor points to this guy
just like that that's how that pen tool
works i'll cover the text layout frame
we're in another tutorial as well just
for brevity
so draw lines I already went all the
different things you can do in regards
to editing and changing strokes
previously then you have your pencil
tool now again you can create either
with object drawing or with merge
drawing and the difference between the
pencil tool and the brush tool is that
the pencil tool draws strokes while the
brush tool draws fills and if I choose
to make more straight edged or pointy
drawings with pencil tool i would use
that option right there and that's going
to automatically make my pointed
drawings more pointed over I'll might
also choose to have these be more
smoothed out and it provides that option
as well and that's pretty much all there
is to know about the pencil tool then
you have your brush tool and it has a
gazillion different options again you
can either draw with murdering or object
drawing lock feel applies to gradients
across multiple different shapes I'm
going to save that for a future tutorial
say I draw a rectangle and I then come
in with the brush tool and I choose to
paint normal well if i choose to paint
normal remember it uses the fill not the
strokes and then paint over top of that
shape you can see that it shows up and
it paints over everything I'm going to
shut off object drawing here just for a
minute and if I create another rectangle
inside here to demonstrate how paint
fills works inside of flash I'll select
paint fills and you can see that it did
not paint in the stroke and I only paint
it outside of the stroke and where the
fill area is if I undo that and then
come in here I can also paint behind any
of the objects on screen just like this
you can see how they showed up undo that
or I can specifically paint just in a
selected area just like that by selected
the green area and then drew in there
with the blue and it did not affect the
stroke nor outside on the staging area
so that's how that guy works you
actually choose your brush size down
here and that stays the same even if you
scale so let's for example if I draw
with a stroke here website the first
shut off and go back to paint normal but
if I would draw with this stroke at this
point and then scale out using the
magnification tool like so
and then re drew another brush stroke
you can see that the brush strokes
stayed the same even though going to
look larger when i zoom in so the stroke
stays the same size whether you're
zoomed in or zoomed out you could also
define different brush shapes like this
and what's really neat is if you have a
pressure sensitive tablet which I have a
bamboo fun which is by the way the best
tablet in my opinion for the price
you're able to come in here and actually
draw very specific changing with brushes
and that for the most part is all of the
basic things you can do inside a flash I
didn't cover some of the things that are
just common sense like the eyedropper
tool which allows you to copy different
colors well there I actually copied to
the stroke for this and applied it to
that stroke right there and obviously
you have the eraser tool which I have
right here which is used for racing and
the magnification tool which you use to
zoom in and zoom out on your stage and
finally just to impress you there's a
deco tool inside a flash which you can
use to apply all kinds of wild and crazy
different designs automatically so
that's pretty much all the basics of
flash cs5 I will be covering infinitely
more complicated things in the future if
you have any questions or comments leave
them in the comments section below till
