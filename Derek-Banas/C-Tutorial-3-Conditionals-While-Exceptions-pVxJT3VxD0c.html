3 of my CVR video tutorial in this part
of the tutorial we're going to cover
if-else elsif the ternary operator
switch go-to while do wild ception
handling and a whole bunch more like
always all the code is available in the
description underneath of the video as
well as a transcript for the video and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
alright so here we are and I'm sure
you're very well aware I'm using Visual
Studio here but you can use the Maron or
whatever you want to use the very first
thing I'm going to talk about are what
are called conditionals and they just
mean that we are going to form certain
operations under certain conditions now
you are going to have relational
operators and this is how we are going
to compare values which are greater than
let's say greater than or equal to less
than or equal to equal to and not equal
to you're also going to be able to use
logical operators to combine these two
little ways of comparing and they are
going to be and or and not and now what
I'm going to do is show you a whole
bunch of examples of how those different
things are used let's say you have an
age which is equal to 17 and you want to
decide what grade this person should go
into so what we're going to do is we're
going to say if the age of this student
is going to be greater than or equal to
5
and if the age is going to be less than
or equal to 7 in that situation what we
are going to do is we are going to print
out on to our screen a message that's
going to say this student should go to
elementary school
so we'll say go to elementary school yes
I know they should go to kindergarten if
they're 5 but whatever then what we're
going to be able to do is make another
condition here we will say else is and
we're going to be comparing multiple
things again so we're going to say if
the age is greater than 7 and both of
these have to be true or it's going to
come back as false of course age is less
than 13 in that situation let's go and
copy this we are going to say that they
need to go to
to school and there that is and let's
throw another else--if here we'll say
else if and in this situation what we're
going to do is we're going to say if age
is greater than 13 and the age is less
than a 19 in that situation we are going
to say that they need to go to high
schools so let's go throw that in there
then we're going to have a condition in
which none of these are true and this is
like a catch-all for everything and here
we'll say go to college alright so there
we are that is elseis and if and else
and all those other different things and
how you can use them now let's go and
give you another example using or we're
going to use or anytime we want to say
that something is okay as long as either
of these is true so here what we're
going to do is we'll say age is less
than 19 in that situation if either one
of those is true we're going to say that
this person you shouldn't all right so
that's an example of how we can use or
and let's go and see not as well so what
not does is it basically just takes a
true and turns it into a false or it
takes a false and turns it into a true
oh and by the way you can also combine
string operators just by going like this
and throwing a plus inside of there
trying to cover every way of doing
everything and throw in a closing
parenthesis and let's run this just to
see what happens
all right and you can see right here go
to high school you shouldn't work and it
turned true into false and I was using
right instead of right line and that's
reason why we're getting some of those
weird things but either way I now I'd
like to talk about the ternary operator
and what it's going to do is it's going
to assign one value if a condition is
true and otherwise it will assign the
second value so of course that's going
to be it doesn't have to be true or
false but it's very often used for true
or false statements so here what we're
going to say is if the age is greater
than or equal to 16 then we are going to
line a value of true so if that's true
it's going to assign a value of true to
can drive and otherwise it's going to
assign a value of false
all right so that's how that works and
then we have the switch statement which
is going to be used whenever you have a
limited number of options and just so
you know there is no way of checking
ranges and that in my opinion is a
short-sighted thing with c-sharp I
really really wish that they would make
it so that you could use ranges inside
of switch statements like you can with
Python for example if you want to check
multiple different conditions you have
to stack these cases so exactly like
what I'm doing right here so what I'm
saying here is if the value of age is
equal to one or two in that situation I
am going to print a message out on our
screen here and that message is going to
be go to day care all right then what
we're going to do is we're going to
check look make sure you throw a break
statement inside of here get rid of that
throw a break statement inside of here
you must always do that and that's going
to throw us completely out of the switch
statement
that's what break does in that situation
so then what we're going to do is we're
going to say if the age is three or if
the age is four in that situation we're
going to say go to preschool so go to
preschool and there that is and then we
can say we can throw spaces inside of
here if we'd like we could say if the
age is five whoops
make sure you throw a break inside of
here however I'll make sure y'all saw a
break inside of there otherwise it will
get cranky with you and then we'll say
something like go to another school go
to another school just end this
never-ending list of different things
like that and we will say break now
let's say kindergarten go to
kindergarten kindergarten there we are
and close off that break statement and
then what we will do by default if none
of those are true we will say in that
situation go to
their school so go to another school
just throw something in there then
something else we can do is use a go-to
statement what this is going to do is
jump us out of the switch block and to
wherever we define or go to so that's
another way of ending this if you don't
want to use break then what you can do
and go to is a very bad thing to use and
I personally never use it but just want
to cover it because you may see somebody
else use it so what's going to do is
jump out of there jump to where our
other school exists and do whatever is
in here so what we're going to do is we
are going to say elementary middle arms
high school just throw them in there
alright so that is switch and that is go
to and then what will happen will jump
out of here and it will print what is
inside of there and otherwise it will
just skip this code all together another
things important is if you want to
compare strings it is best to use the
equals function so we're going to say
let's define a person's name and let's
go and define another name and let's go
and have them be equal if you want to
check equality between two different
strings you should do something like
this and we'll say name equals and then
we're going to throw inside of here the
name we want to compare it to and then
you're going to put and define what type
of string comparison you are doing so
we're going to say string comparison
throw this down here and then
specifically ordinal and that is way of
checking to see if there are equal
strings or if these strings are equal
and let's go through that and we'll just
say names are equal so that there throw
that there and run it and you're going
to see go to another schools what comes
up here because the age was 17 then it
jumps to the go to printout elementary
middle and high school and then it says
the names are equal alright so that is a
rundown of conditional statements and of
course that this tutorial continues I
will do
or with them and now I want to talk
about the while loop alright so you're
basically going to use the while loop in
comparison to the four and B for each
loop whenever you want to continue
execution as long as a condition is true
so let's create a while loop that's
going to print out odd numbers between 1
and 10 so we'll go in I is equal to 1
and another thing to know about the
while loop is you have to always define
the iterator for the while loop outside
of the while loop before you define the
while loop so here we're going to say
while I is less than or equal to 10 in
that situation we are going to do some
things now remember we want to print out
odd numbers one way to do that is to use
a mathematical operator called modulus
which is a % and what modulus does is it
returns the remainder of a division so
if we want to find out if something is
an odd number what we're going to do one
thing we can do here is we can do
modulus 2 and we know that if this is
equal to 0
well that means this is an even number
so in that situation we are going to
increment the value of I and this is
exactly the same as if we would say I is
equal to I plus 1 and then what we're
going to do is we want to jump back to
the beginning of the while loop and
start execution over again and to do
that we use continue all right so this
is going to say if it is an even number
we want to increment it to the next
number which is going to be odd and then
we want to jump back up here and start
executing again now what we're going to
do is I'm going to show you the break
statement again remember the break
statement jumps us out of loops so let's
say we decide that we want to break out
of here if I is equal to 9 so we can do
something like I is equal to 9 and then
we can just throw the break statement
right here since it is going to be you
know just one thing is going to occur
after this if statement then what we're
going to be able to do is jump in here
and then we will print the value of I
out on the screen let's get rid of that
quote so don't just do that like
us and then what we can do is we have to
remember to increment the value lie all
right so if we do that and we run it
you're going to see that it prints only
the odd numbers and it doesn't print
nine all right so pretty cool stuff with
a V while loop and of course we will be
doing much more with the while loop as
the tutorial continues because I really
like while loops doesn't take much to
get me excited obviously so now we're
going to Dominica and talk about the
do-while loop now you're going to use
the do-while loop whenever you want to
make sure that you execute the code
inside of your block at least once so
what I'm going to do here to show you
how to generate a random number so we're
going to say random and I'm going to
call this R and is equal to new random
create a random object and then what we
can do is we can say something like
secrets number is going to be equal to
and we want to generate random numbers
between 1 and 10 to do that you go 1 and
11 and throw that like that and then
we're going to come in here and we're
going to have like a number guessing
game so we'll say guess is equal to zero
and then we will start our do-while loop
so we're going to say do and then we
will have all the things that we want to
have it to so we'll say console rights
and I'm moving too fast of course hit
the pause button here must say enter a
number between 1 and 10 and we're going
to make this be a right so that we'll
have room to put it in there and then
after that we want to get the number
that they type in so we're going to type
in number guessed is going to be equal
to and also we want to convert the
number that's passed in which is going
to be a string by default into an
integer and another way of doing that is
by using converts I've showed you three
different ways to convert into multiple
different numbers or data types and this
is just another one of those so we will
say console and read line like that and
we will get that and store it into
number guests now what we can do down
here
is after the curly bracket we can say
while and put our condition inside of
here so we're going to continue looping
as long as the secret number is not
equal to the number or guest in there
that is and make sure you put the
semicolon there that is very very very
common error and now you will not make
it and if you're wondering if there are
any other ways of converting yes indeed
here are other conversion options you
can use two boolean instead of two int
32 and 32 is a regular integer two in 64
is a long by the way so you have two
boolean 2 by 2 character to decimal 2
double 2 in 64 which is exactly the same
as long to string of course you've seen
that before and they are all going to
convert from any type into any other
type right so useful way to do
conversions between different data types
and if we run it so we just create a
game enter a number between 1 and 10 can
I get it the first time let's say 7 no
is wrong let's try 1 nope 2 no 3 or 4 I
guess I hit and 4 was the number all
right and it would have been a better
game if it would have told me I guess
the number but I forgot to type that in
and that's not a big deal and now what
we're going to do is talk briefly about
exception handling because I have a
little bit more time to go now basically
we use exception handling to catch
errors that could potentially crash our
program what is an example of an error
like that well let's say we have num1 is
equal to 5 and we have another double
which is going to be num2 which is going
to be equal to 0 what I'm going to do
here is try to divide by 0 actually
c-sharp does not throw an exception in
this situation so what I'm going to do
because I know it can't be done I am
going to throw exception so I'm going to
create my own static function down here
it is going to return a double and I'm
going to call it do division and it is
going to receive a double and we will
call this X and it's going to receive
another double that we will call Y and
it's going to try to perform this
vision right here so what I'm going to
do is I know ahead of time that you
can't divide by zero so I'm going to
come in here and say if the value of y
is equal to zero well then I want to
throw an error and in the next part of
the tutorial I'll do something a little
bit more complicated and the error that
I want to call here is division by error
exception so I want to say hey you can't
do that and you have to put the
parentheses on it right there and then
what I'm going to do is otherwise if
they do not send a value of zero I'm
going to say okay I can do that division
and return the answer okay so now up
inside of here I know that there's the
potential for an error to occur whenever
this function is called so how am I
going to handle it well I'm going to
surround any code that could potentially
cause an error with what's called a try
block and here what I'm going to do is
I'm going to say console and write line
and I will say five divided by zero is
equal to and then I will go do whatever
I'm going to do here jump down to the
next line and then I will call my do
division function and then I will pass
in num1 and num2 knowing that it's going
to cause an error and then afterwards
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
catch that error to keep the program
from crashing and the specific error I'm
going to catch is the divide by zero
exception so I'm going to come in here
so if that error is triggered I am going
to catch it and I'm going to do
something with it what I'd like to do is
go and copy this is print out some
information and so let's just keep it
simple
and we'll say something like you can't
divide by zero there's that error and
that's going to print out and otherwise
if I didn't have that it would crash the
whole entire program so that's why I'm
going to keep it that way then you can
also go and print out additional
information to the screen by referencing
functions available in this e X variable
up here and one of them is let's just go
and print the error message we can say
gets five
and we can go name and this is going to
give us the type of exception that
occurred and let's go and also print out
the message associated with that and to
do that we just type in message like
that and that's going to give us the
error message no other thing if you
would just come in here and just type in
exception like this with e^x that is
going to be a catch-all that is going to
catch every single exception that is
ever triggered and we'll get more into
that later on but I just want to talk
well let's just do it so we could come
in here even though this isn't going to
be triggered we can say exception e^x
and then you can call this anything it
doesn't have to be called e^x and in
this situation we'll just go and print
out exactly the same type of stuff so
we'll just copy this and we will paste
it in there and we'll say something
simple like because we don't know what
error occurred we'll just say an error
occurred and there we are so there is
that guy that's going to be called if
the exception isn't caught by
specifically naming exception like we
have right here and then you can also
use another function or another block
here called the finally block and it is
always going to rub it's always going to
run and it's going to provide for
cleanup after you handle all these
exceptions so in here and we'll do
something like this and we'll just type
in cleaning up whenever we get into
files and other stuff I'll do more with
exception handling and if we run this
guy we are going to see that it says you
can't divide by 0 it prints out the
actual exception and it prints out the
message for the exception which is
attempted divided by 0 and then cleaning
up shows up here from the finally block
all right so there is a rundown of some
conditionals and some additional looping
structures we haven't covered and a
brief introductory situation in which we
covered exception handling and like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
