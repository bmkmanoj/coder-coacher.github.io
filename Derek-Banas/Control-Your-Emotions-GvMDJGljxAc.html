well hello Internet today in this
presentation I'm gonna tell you how to
control your emotions I'm doing this
presentation because Akbar sent me a
question how do I stop thinking about
people who are mean to me well I'm gonna
approach this question by explaining how
to eliminate negative thoughts and
actions altogether I'll explain how our
brains retrieve these negative thoughts
and in doing so also explain how to keep
yourself from having these thoughts how
do we think when we think about anything
we remember past experiences through
three primary ways in pictures sounds
and feelings in psychology is believed
that you can replace a negative thought
by focusing on what triggers it and then
assigning a positive thought to that
same trigger one way you can do this is
through what is called the switch
technique but I'll get into that a
little bit later first I want you to
exercise your brain though think back to
a positive experience
visually now answer these questions is
that picture in black and white or color
do you see yourself in the experience
what I mean by this is do you see your
own body if so your disassociated with
this experience if however you're
experiencing the moment through your own
eyes
you are associated with the experience
we'll get more into that in a bit
can you interact with your surroundings
or are they flat like a picture is the
experience far away or does it surround
you now I want you to think of that same
experience auditorially do you hear
anything or this sounds loud or soft is
the sound in stereo or monotone is the
sound clear or muted can you reach out
and feel textures can you experience the
weight of objects can you feel heat or
cold are these feelings intense or do
you have to force yourself to feel
anything a sub modality is a distinction
and how we really experience a past
event that is the reason why I had you
go through that little exercise
remembering a visual event in black and
white versus color is an example of a
sub modality the sub modalities we have
a firm grasp on dramatically influenced
our emotions and experiences everyone
has their own special developed sub
modalities and they completely control
your overall
emotions when a person is a lack of
emotions that normally means they have
not developed their sub modalities they
can't reinstate ents clearly if someone
however has no control of their emotions
they normally have very well-developed
maybe out-of-control sub modalities the
reason they're having trouble with their
emotions is mainly they experience past
events as if they are occurring right
then and now in that moment and it
overwhelms them so if you want to
control your emotions you need to give
your representations of a past event new
sub modalities if it is a bad experience
you need to enrich it and then replace
it with a positive experience while you
can't change the past you can however
change how you represent a past member
you must not figure out what triggers
your unwanted emotion if something
caused you to become angry what triggers
that anger now ask yourself these
questions is that trigger in black and
white or in color do you see yourself in
the experience or do you see it through
your own eyes is the picture moving or a
static image is the image close or far
away are the sounds loud or soft or the
sounds in stereo or monotone how do you
feel can you feel a tension in a
specific part of your body now to
contrast this anger experience I want
you to think of a moment in which you're
completely relaxed go there now and
answer the above questions again breathe
deeply and relax to get yourself out of
your previous experience again ask
yourself in this relaxed state is it in
black and white or colored you see
yourself there you are you looking at
this experience through your own eyes is
the picture moving or static is the
image closer far away or the sounds
louder soft are the sounds and stereo or
monotone how do you feel can you feel
any tension or lack thereof of tension
in any specific parts of your body you
need to note all of the differences
between your anger state and relaxation
state now you know the different sub
modalities you use when in a state of
anger versus a state of relaxation now
replace those sub modalities of anger
with those you utilize when you are
relaxed if you see everything in color
when relaxed but in black and white when
angered you then need to try and
experience that which made you anger
in color if you continue to do this the
experience that previously caused you
anger will now be much more subdued if
you're unable to eliminate your anger by
substituting your relaxed sub modalities
that means you have developed your
emotion of an anger beyond your ability
to relax this is actually quite common
what this means is you just simply find
it easier to get angry than to relax if
that is true you must find the positive
emotion that is more powerful than your
anger I don't mean to be fruity but this
emotion normally is love what I need you
to think about in this circumstance
would be a girlfriend or a boyfriend a
child a pet God an object and what you
need to do now is analyze the sub
modalities that are well developed when
you are experiencing this love then what
you need to do is just re experience the
moment makes you angry
using these loves sub modalities now
we're gonna eliminate those negative
feelings altogether ranked the issue
from 1 to 10 on how much anger
resentment etc it causes you to feel
reexpansion tin your mind that causes
this feeling determine the trigger that
causes the unwanted feelings what images
sounds feelings etc tell you to have
this unwanted feeling for example see
hear and feel the moment clearly note
the sub modalities that are
well-developed
think of another experience that makes
you feel the opposite emotions note
those sub modalities that are
well-developed here write down the
differences between the visual audio and
feelings of modalities of the problem
versus the resourceful thoughts now
think about both experiences at the same
time think about what you see hear and
feel in each experience at the same time
so at this point you know what triggers
the negative feeling if you don't go
back sit down analyze this is very
important you also know the different
sub modalities that are being used to
experience that negative event and the
positive sub modalities you need to use
to experience that event in a different
light now you need to create a positive
outcome image picture what you will look
like without this negative feeling
weighing you down imagine how you will
feel once you have eliminated this
negative feeling
imagine how by eliminating this negative
feeling your life will be changed again
you want to create an image of yourself
you do not want to be looking on this
scene through your own eyes you want to
be picturing yourself
Richard Bandler a renowned psychologist
created the swish pattern through this
technique you can replace negative
feelings with positive feelings all you
need to do is find out what triggers the
negative feeling what you see here and
or feel create a complete image of
yourself in a positive and resourceful
state create an image of what you see
when you're experiencing the negative
feelings and you need to see this image
through your own eyes close your eyes
and see the image that cues you to start
having the negative feeling make this
image big and bright in the corner of
this picture create an image of your
desired state with your eyes closed
imagine that the resourceful image is
growing big and bright and covering up
the Q image or the image the triggers
your Unruh source phille or the negative
feelings you want to eliminate as you do
this you can make a swishing sound or
sweep the issue away with your arm
imagine your source for image swishing
over the cue or the trigger like a wave
repeat doing this until the trigger or
the cue be it an image sound feeling or
all of the above which previously always
made you think of negative things but
now makes you sing think of a more
resourceful image you can also of course
swish the cue negative image away
towards the distance as if it was a
picture just blowing away this
personally works best for me well Akbar
I hope that answers your question if
anybody else out there has anything
they'd like me to analyze leave it in
the comment section below of course your
comments are always welcome and until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
