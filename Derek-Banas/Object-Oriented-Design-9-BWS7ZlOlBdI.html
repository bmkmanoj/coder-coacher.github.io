9 of my object oriented design tutorial
today I'm going to finish converting our
sequence and class diagrams into working
code now understand I'm really speeding
through this in essence in a little over
three hours I created a use case a
domain model to in essence sequence
diagrams a class diagram and now working
code and the goal here is to get working
code not perfect code working code under
optimum situations I'm going to wait
until the next iteration or during the
testing phase to handle all the errors
but since we're using the unified
process our goal is to work through and
get our code working and then worry
about optimizing it afterwards so
there's a ton of things I got to do so
let's get into it okay so this is where
we left you off with the sequence
diagram and in this part of the tutorial
I am going to create a TM Java Bank
Network Java and Bank computer Java and
just like previous I am using these
class diagrams I created and I went in
there and I transferred all of this
information over here into basic really
easy to understand code there's no point
in me typing all that out in front of
you because I'm sure you understand it I
basically just have to go in here and
fill in the blanks and do a lot of logic
so one thing here is user input scanner
well I know if I see that and I'm in ATM
Java and I'm going to be handling a lot
of user input that means I need the
scanner library so there that is got
that handled and then if I did that well
I need to create a scanner object and
I'm going to set this as static user
input is equal to new scanner and this
is going to be system and because I want
information from my keyboard and I'm
simulating everything out here exactly
like it would be a real world object
because that is our goal all right so
let's get rid of this we know what all
of our methods are that we should have
and we know very early on that we are
going to create a transaction for ATM
because it's right there and we also
know that a method that we are going to
create very early on is is ATM cards
Bank in network and let's look at some
other things here if that verifies we
want to call the following for
transaction set strip number and set did
the card verify
all right so we know all that and also
if we come down here everything
continues as designed in the first
design that we made that means we're
going to scroll down here and look for
atm and there is ATM so we are in
essence going to just come in here and
copy what's on the left side of the
screen over to the right hand side of
the screen except we're going to throw
in some logic so the first thing I need
to do is go is strip readable this is
kind of going to be a security feature
and what I decided in previous parts of
the tutorial is to pass this the strip
number off the card that is entered just
needs to be the proper number of digits
long I know that's not good security but
it is what I'm throwing in here for now
because my goal is to get working code
and then optimize it later okay so how
can I figure out how many digits are in
the strip that is passed over inside of
the card I'm going to convert this into
an int because I'm going to do some math
here and one way to find out how many
digits you have in a number is just go
log 10 and then go the card and then dot
and if I do that what's going to pop up
inside of here is get strip number so
I'm going to double click on that so I
don't have to memorize all these things
there's no point in memorizing you don't
have to and then put in a semicolon and
that is going to give me the number of
digits that is inside of strip number
that's a little math thing okay then
what I need to do is create transaction
why because that is what I was told on
my sequence diagram when we looked at it
up above and I'm just going to go new
transaction and then go card and then I
know this is get strip number so I'm
going to click on it and this is in
1080p so if you want to view it
fullscreen do so and that is going to
create me a transaction that I'm going
to be using a lot here to output
information check things and so forth
and then what am I going to do I'm going
to go if number of digits in strip this
guy right here
throw that inside of there is equal to
and if I forget exactly what it is
let's come over here strip number is
eight digits so that's what we're
verifying so I'm just going to do that
get this back on the screen so I can
follow it so I'm going to say if the
strip number is eight digits well what
am I going to do here I'm going to say
that it is a valid strip number whether
it is or it is like I said I want to get
working code out here
as quickly as humanly possible and if
it's eight digits long I want to return
true yes we think this is a valid strip
number else I want to return false
definitely isn't valid strip number
that's for certain
so that's all we got to do there now
what are we going to work on is ATM
cards Bank in network well I know I'm
going to be getting my card passed over
to me and it's going to have strip
number on it it's going to have a pin
and just like the real world I'm going
to use the bank network and Bank
computer files that I'm going to be
creating and I'm going to create all
these right in a row just so everything
makes sense to me so one of the things
I'm going to do is go if well I know
that I have the network of banks inside
of this because that's what this is
right here and whenever I created ATM
the network of banks that hold the bank
computers is also going to be in there
and then all the accounts of course so
I'm going to go network of banks on ATM
and I'm going to say well what do I want
to know is ATMs card inside of the
network well that's right here so I just
double click on it and there it is and
it automatically has card inside of
there because I use some good names when
I was creating this thing if it is then
I want to go the transaction just
following what's going on here see I'm
Bank associated with the card and I'm
going to check if the ATMs card is
inside of my network so the transaction
and I have to set the transaction I have
to give it the strip number so set and
there is strip number down here so it's
just double-click on that and then it's
going to pop up strip number inside of
there but what I want to do is go that
card paste that down inside of there dot
and then get strip number because that's
the method that I want to call that's
going to get me access to that with the
information that I have and then there
we are then what I need to do is set the
transaction so that it knows that my
card is verified so how did I do that
well just come down here and look for it
did the card verify yes so there we are
got that inside of there and I'm going
to change this to true and this is going
to store in a place that I'm going to be
able to look later to verify that yes
this card has been verified and then
after this let's just go return
so we got that inside of there else if
it didn't verify we're going to return
false of course and then we'll worry
about exactly how we're going to handle
that in the later time so now that we
have that all set up what I need to do
is because I called the network of banks
and called is ATM cards Bank and network
and passed it to card I need to go
inside of Bank Network dot Java and set
everything up inside of there so what
other things may need here well I can
see right here that I get an error that
I'm using an ArrayList and I don't have
that library so let's fix that problem
right now okay so that's gone then we
come down here add Bank to network well
that means I'm going to need to add that
to this ArrayList which is right here
which is banks in database so I'm just
going to copy that
and I'm going to just throw in this
right here to make sure that that gets
called properly and I'm going to go add
and new bank so this is a way that I'm
going to be able to add the new banks to
the bank networks and then the bank
networks hold all the accounts just want
to make sure you get what's going on
then I need to go into is ATMs card in
network and it gets passed a card and
I'm inside a bank network taught Java so
I just got to do a little bit of
searching to see if that's true and I'm
going to go boolean card verification
set this to false whenever it first
starts off before I do all my tests and
then I'm going to go int I'm going to go
card Bank ID and I want to get the first
two digits to verify that I have the
right Bank ID and that's what I have
here in the sequence diagram so how am I
going to do that well previously inside
of the sequence diagram I had a method
defined that was get first two digits
and you can actually see that here and
it's actually in the class diagram as
well so I know I'm going to get the
first two digits by passing it a strip
number well where do I get to strip
number well I can get the strip number
from the card so that's great so I'm
going to go and call this method right
here and I can define the logic of what
that's going to do in a second I'm going
to go the card and I need to pass it the
strip number so I'm going to go get
strip number there we are
got it and that is going to call that
method underneath there then what I need
to do is cycle through all of the
different banks to see if we have
a match so I'm going to go bank computer
and just call it bank and then go banks
in the database which is this guy right
here banks in database and I'm going to
cycle through all of them and see if we
have a match for bank IDs so that I
match my bank IDs to the other banks
that have the same ID and then later on
I'm going to check to see if the account
exists I just go get bank ID is equal to
I'm going to go card Bank ID which is
what I just searched for and if that
comes back positive I can go card
verification and set it to true
instead of false which is what I said it
above card verification and I want to
have that be uppercase v all right so
that's all working good and then it's
going to go through that otherwise card
verification is going to be false and
then I'm going to go return card
verification so that is going to check
if my ATM card is actually inside of the
network well then I have to create get
first two digits and it's going to get
passed a strip number so I'm going to go
through the logic of exactly how that's
going to be created like I said the
strip number is going to the first two
digits of it is going to be the bank ID
so that is how I'm going to find that
out so I'm going to go string string of
strip number let's give it a name then
I'm going to go integer to string and
pass it over the strip number so that I
can do some pretty easy checks here and
this is just what's coming to my head
right now how to do this then I want to
get the first two numbers from the strip
number and save them as an int so int
I'm going to call this Bank ID from and
of course I should have comments on
everything here but I'm just working
quick you can get all this code and
ernie 'the the video if you want to look
at it to help you learn all this stuff
and then i'm going to pass
string of strip number to this guy right
like that and then i want to get a
substring of it substring and i want to
go from zero to two and i put a
semicolon on there and that is going to
give me the first two digits of that
string for that strip number and i'll
have my bank ID and then I'm going to go
return bank ID from strip and that's how
we're going to get our bank IDs so
that's cool and then I want to jump into
Bank computer Java see what we need to
do here well I see again that ArrayList
is underlined
so I want to bring in that library there
it is now we got that everything else is
set up exactly the way that we set it
off previously I have bank ID set is
nine because I want it to be ten so I
know that I want to increment that guy
the first time through so that's why
it's nine instead of ten and then down
inside a bank computer how is this going
to be initialized well it's going to get
the bank name passed to it so I want to
go bank name is equal to new bank name
so now we have our bank with a bank name
whatever we created it and then we want
to increment our number of banks so just
increment it like that and then what
else do we want to do well we want to go
bank ID which is this guy right here and
we just want to set it to 10 for the
first one so I'm going to go to this
Bank ID and plus is equal to number of
banks so just working working working
real quick here and let's go down Add
Account to bank well I know I'm gonna
know how to do that as well that's going
to be this array so I'm gonna go and
grab accounts and this is like
initialization stuff so that's why I'm
doing it ahead time and I'm gonna just
get this accounts add and add the new
account that is being passed over so
that's going to throw that in the
ArrayList for that and let's go through
here get bank ID that's good verify
strip number now might as well get that
out of the way as well that's going to
be boolean or verification remember we
did this previously so in essence we're
just going to be copying that code and
here I'm going to cycle through all of
the accounts account accounts and look
for a strip number that matches based
off of one that's already stored in the
accounts ArrayList and that's pretty
simple to do as well we're just going to
go if account dot and we want to get the
strip number where is strip number get
strip number there it is and we want to
check if the strip number is equal to
the card strip number and it's going to
be get strip number as well I'm not
going to zoom in that time and if it
does match which means there is an
account with the same strip number as
the card that was passed over right here
well then we're going to set card
verification to equal to true so throw
that in there and set this to true and
we don't need to do an else in that
situation and then down here we're just
going
go to return card verification after
that is all set up all right so now it's
bounced over in ATM and see exactly what
we got going on here so we are checking
to see if the card is in the network we
did that and all three of these guys and
next thing we want to do is check to see
if the pin number is going to be right
so we got insert pin inside of this and
we want to find the number of digits
that are inside of the pin well how did
we do that before we want to make sure
that's four where did we do we must
we'll just copy that right that was a
log function that I used and here it is
right here so let's just copy that so we
don't have to worry about it and we're
just checking to see if the pin is four
digits in length and I'm going to go int
number of digits in pin is going to be
the name of that and let's just throw
that there and we'll go equals and then
in this situation we need to get the pin
that's passed not get strip number so
we're just going to change that to pin
and there we are now we know how many
digits there are in the pin and then
we're going to say if number of digits
in the pan so let's just copy that paste
that inside of there is not equal to
four because our pin number needs to be
four digits in length maybe we're going
to throw in something here like I said
I'm worried about getting this to work
I'm not worried about it working
perfectly or having it optimized so
sometimes I'll throw in a little error
message sometimes I won't but main goal
have to get it to work
and then I'm going to go return false
else if they did enter four digits well
we're going to have to verify those four
digits are correct so we're going to go
the transaction and we want to set the
pin for the transaction because remember
we're passing transactions back set pin
right like that and then this is going
to be set to the pen that they sent to
us and we're going to have to verify
that guy later on then we want to decide
to pass the transaction instead of the
card like I did in my sequence diagram
so I'm going to go network of banks on
ATM which is the ArrayList that's inside
of this guy and I want to verify to see
if this pin is right so let's just go in
here and go verify pin pretty easy and
in this situation I'm going to put the
transaction is what's going to be passed
over to that guy and because I have all
the same names
a lot easier and then after that we're
going to return false
so network of banks on ATM verify the
pin what does that mean that means I
need to go into the network or Bank
Network Java and create that guy to
verify that pin number so let's go in
here scroll down we know we're going to
get and there is verify pen so how are
we going to verify the pen just like
before
pull in card verification is what I'm
going to name it is equal to false
whenever I start doing something my
tendency to keep doing it the same way
then I'm going to say if the transaction
and I want to check to see if my card
has been verified or not get did verify
Nass not it boom get did card verify
there we heart didn't think that sounded
right but I forgot what it was called
curly brace and then what I'm gonna do
I'm going to cycle through my bank
computer call this bank banks in
database and I'm going to check each of
those individually to verify my pin
let's say I want to do another check
here I go Bank and get my bank ID since
I know that's a check that's already
there and I just want to throw in
another error check or security feature
or whatever and I'm going to go get bank
ID again that might be thrown out here
later on but for now I like it in there
because I'm Rivera fiying some things
Bank verify the pin and then pass it the
transaction that stores the pin inside
of it so I know a bank ID is equal to
the transaction so I'm going to verify
the pin there and in that situation I
know that card verification is going to
be equal to true so there that is else
and let's just say for the heck of it
because I'm here I want to print out
like an error message I'm going to go
out print line and then come in here and
go the card Bank ID doesn't match
whatever and we would throw them out and
ask them to give a new card or do a
whole bunch of other different things
and for now I'm pretty satisfied this
off of what I got here on my sequence
diagram and everything else everything
looks like it's working out pretty good
now I need to go into Bank computer and
verify that pin again so let's go into
here and verify my pin and as you can
see I'm pretty much doing the same thing
over and over and over again so I'm
going to go bolian card verification is
the
we'll do Falls I'm just doing it in a
different way and then I'm going to go
if the transaction and I want to check
that did the card verify and there that
is so if the card verified see I have
everything stored inside a transaction
so it's useful I'm going to cycle
through all my accounts then and look
for a match for my pin number say and
then I can do something like let's go
account and let's say I want I get my
pen there's the pen and see if it is
equal to the transaction and again this
is going to be a get pin and then I can
do and let's say account and get my
strip number get strip number there it
is and see if it is equal to the
transaction strip number so I'm
verifying the pin and the strip number
and everything all at one time here now
if those two things are true oh I know I
have a match so I'm gonna go card
verification and set that to true right
like that and what else did I do well I
think at this point in time we could
trust that we could save inside of
transaction the customers name because
they've been checked a bunch of
different times
so where we going to get the customers
name well I know it's stored in account
so let's get the customers name and how
do we get it get good customer name
there it is so now we have that stored
inside of transaction as well we know a
whole bunch of things are verifying here
so that's good and then at the very end
of it we want to send back cord
verification whether it is either true
or false so return cord verification and
there it is now we're going to bounce
back over into ATM and see what is the
next thing we got to do pick account to
access well let's just say we're going
to in essence just do a whole bunch of
print line and say something like what
account do you want to withdraw from and
then let's get whatever that account is
from them like we could do something
like we said we wanted them to enter 1
or 0 or whatever so let's just go one
dash for savings and 2 dash for checking
there something we could do put space
inside of there and then we got to get
the user input so we're going to go if
user input has next and this is
something I know we're going to have to
correct later and I would put a comment
in there for the situation
they would enter a string or whatever
I'm just going to go number enter is
equal to user input next int and store
that inside of there then we go the
transaction and I want to set the
account withdraw from so I'm just come
through here there it is and that's
going to be the number entered which is
this guy and that's going to tell me
whether to withdraw from checking your
savings and paste that in there and
there that is and then after this let's
just throw an else inside of there and
let's throw a system out error sort of
message just for now as a placeholder
and we'll just go you entered an invalid
option or whatever we want to do okay so
there we go we got that all in there and
then we come to a mount to withdraw I
want to make sure that Bank network
doesn't need anything more done to it
there's request withdrawal amount so
this right here is just saying pick
account to access it's not saying pick
the amount withdraw so let's go through
here and finish amount withdraw on the
ATM Java and here I'm just going to do
to system outs again pretty much just as
placeholders to test my system and let's
just say with this one how much do you
want to well I already have withdraw
they're not worrying about that and then
maybe we put a message down here that
goes increments of ten dollars or
whatever because we can't do change of
course and whereas in essence going to
do the same thing if user input has next
int we're going to use this guy again
and we're going to use this one again
like that paste that in there leave this
is number entered it doesn't matter
blows that off and then I'm going to go
to the transaction and I want to set my
withdrawal amount which is right there
set withdrawal amount and that's going
to be number entered so pass that over
to transaction so that that's stored
inside of transaction so I can pass that
along and then I need to make a
reference to the network of banks on ATM
and I need to request a withdrawal
amount so there that is
and number entered is not going to be it
transaction the transaction I'm going to
pass everything the whole transaction
over to it so they can access everything
all at once and then else if there's
some sort of error
with them not giving me the right I'm
withdrawal amount again I'm just going
to you entered an invalid option I'm
just going to throw that in there just
so that I have something in there so
there that is so now because we went and
reference Bank Network see network all
banks an ATM which is part of that
ArrayList which is right here that means
I need to go over there and handle a new
method there we are requested wrong
amount da-da-da-da-da and here I forgot
to throw in card verification right
there so I'm going to go return card
verification just caught that I mix that
error gossage go away and then here is
request withdraw amount everything else
here I don't really need a sequence
diagram anymore because everything else
is pretty much common sense and this guy
I'm going to go if the the transaction
is what was passed over to me I want to
check if my card verified so I'm going
to go get card verified don't know why
keep forgetting what that one is get did
card verify there that is and then I'm
going to cycle through all of my bank
computers Bank banks in database cycle
through that and I want to check if my
bank ID and that is right there get bank
ID is equal to the transactions bank ID
so get bank ID so there we know that the
bank IDs are the same which is all we're
checking here this is the bank network
remember and if it did we're going to go
Bank request withdrawal amount and pass
it over the transaction the bat network
can handle anything in regards to
transactions so you know that's not
going to work if we have a situation
where my card didn't verify or the bank
ID didn't verify we're gonna need an
else statement in there and let's just
jump over here and grab this one you
entered an invalid option just to throw
something in there again so there that
is so now that I called bank computer
that means I'm gonna have to go into
Bank computer and handle request
withdraw amount inside of it so what are
we going to do we're going to cycle
through all our accounts account
accounts and we're going to check if the
withdrawal amount that they're trying to
pull out there is going to be valid or
not that's accounts so I'm going to go
if account and then I want to check my
account number and make sure that it
matches the transaction account number
that's used
so get account number there that is and
one
make sure that it's equal to the
transaction sum paying attention to this
that's what the what's being passed over
because that's all I have to work from
and then inside of this I should have
account number used and yes it is there
it is so if the account number is equal
to the transaction account number then I
know I got a match then I'm going to go
if account and I want to get the balance
get account balance there that is and I
want to say if it's greater than or
equal to the transaction the requested
amount which is get withdrawal amount so
I believe yes get withdrawal amount so
they just asked for an amount that is
actually in the bank so we're going to
let them get some money so we're going
to go double new account balance and get
the new account balance by taking
account dot get account balance which is
that guy right there and subtracting
from it the transactions amount
requested and that's going to be get
withdrawal amount which is right there
so I'm saying okay well I want to
subtract that from the amount there and
now I have that all stored inside of
there well now that I get that set I
need to set the new balance for the
account so set account balance and I'm
going to just send it new account
balance rather than type all that out
copy paste that inside of there and
there we are so now the account is
up-to-date with the change that was made
and now all I need to do is set
transaction to the new account balance
and there that is and there's new
account balance and that's perfect well
actually it's this guy right here almost
perfect
namu else in the situation in which
those things didn't verify I did not
have enough funds why need to send out a
message to tell them hey you asked for
too much money or something else went
wrong so just to have something here I'm
just going to say you can't have that
much money say I want to think out all
the perfect things to say and that's
that so there's bank computer that's
done Bank Network we know that's done
and that leaves ATM get transaction info
and then that's the last method so I
know we're done with that so what can we
do here well what is going to be a
system out and we're just going to print
out a simple message to the user and
we're going to say something like thank
you and then
and we have transaction we have access
to transaction that's what we've been
passing around here so if I want to get
the customers name just come in here and
go customers name there we are so I can
address the customer directly and I
could say something like for using XYZ
bank maybe I want to throw a new line in
there there we go and I'm going to have
a whole bunch of these system outs
remember I wanted to put the date / time
of transaction and I'll put that there
on the screen well again I know I have
access to transaction and if I want to
get my current date and time there it is
see that's what's so great about paying
attention you're naming and all that it
just makes it so easy just clicking
around I mean it's so simple it's great
and then say we wanted to put some
information out in regards to the
transaction itself maybe we want to
throw a new line and type in some
transaction and uppercase letters I know
this is going to change later system out
and then print out some more information
like removed how much money did they
take out I don't know let's find out the
transaction and I want to get my
withdrawal amount get withdraw amount
that's how much money they took out of
the account and I'll say from your well
what account that they take that money
out of and then we could check to see
here whether they took it out of savings
or they took it out of checking or where
that money came from
so we'll just go if the transaction and
get a count to withdraw from get account
withdraw from there's that and then see
if the numbers stored inside of there is
equal to one because I remember had that
and then one is savings so we'll just go
savings account and then let's say we
wanted to do something like type out the
current balance and then I'm going to go
the transaction because I know I have my
current balance stored inside of there
get account balance so easy it says I'm
just clicking on stuff it's just working
it's awesome now if they took it out of
their checking account guess what it's
pretty much going to use exactly the
same sort of thing just go through an
else statement inside of there throw a
system out and then just change this to
checking and everything else stays the
same see get account balance as far as I
know everything should work so let's run
it and let's see what happens okay
after executing everything the only
change I needed to make was I already
had a class called account so I had to
change this to account one and then I
had to change everything else to account
one throughout the program other than
that which shouldn't even affect you
everything else seems to work so let's
execute it and you can see what account
do you wish to withdraw from and let's
say we just type in checking because
that's what we have and how much do you
want to withdraw let's say we type in
$40 thank you da da da da and there is
the date and there is information on the
very specific transaction so I know that
pretty much everything works the way
that I wanted to and now it's basically
my job just to go in and handle all the
error checking which I leave to you for
homework because it is quite simple and
doesn't really have anything to do with
object-oriented design leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
