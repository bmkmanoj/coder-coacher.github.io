video tutorial this is going to be a big
tutorial because I'm going to show you
how to install git on Windows and Mac
and Linux pretty much and I'm also going
to show you all of the common commands
you will need to use git I'm going to do
my best to cover everything part of its
going to be presentation and part of its
going to be in a terminal and I'm going
to go as fast as possible so let's get
into it so you may be asking yourself
probably not though what is get well git
is a version control tool that saves
changes to groups of files so you can
revert back if needed and no this whole
entire presentation isn't going to be in
this format most of its going to be in
the terminal but I just wanted to start
off this way now there are different
types of version control tools there's
local version control which saves files
to a database on one computer there's
centralized version control which saves
changes to a shared server and then
there's distributed version control
which allows for easier sharing of files
then you're going to find with local
version control because you're going to
be able to share them and also it
eliminates problems that could occur if
access to the server is lost under a
centralized version control system now
DVC clients that are using git are going
to have complete backups of all the
files on their personal computer so if
the server is lost the client just waits
to regain contact and then uploads
changes whenever it's available what
this means is when you commit changes to
files get basically stores of reference
of what the files look like at that
moment and if a file isn't changed it
isn't stored again and like I said
before each client is going to have a
complete history of all changes stored
locally and the client also is going to
be able to access all changes made to
those files historically with just a
couple simple commands another benefit
is those files cannot be changed without
get knowing and changes are very
difficult to lose now basically in get
files transition between three different
states they're going to be either be
modified files which are files that have
been recently changed staged files which
have been marked to be saved and
committed files which are those that
have been saved okay so it's modified
staged
mitad get saves all these file changes
to a directory as a compressed database
and then you're going to be able to
modify those files in what is called a
working directory
you then can notify that you want saved
changes in the staging area and then of
course after you commit the file changes
they are saved to the git directory now
if you want to install git here you go
I'm going to show it to you step-by-step
but basically these are going to be the
addresses you're going to have to go to
and of course I provide a link
underneath the video and of course in
Linux you can just type in a couple
simple commands either one of these
should work for you depending upon what
type of Linux you are using so enough of
that presentation format let's install
git on Windows okay so basically inside
of Windows we're going to go to this
address and this is going to be the
website that you're going to see of
course hit download and then you're
going to see get show up down here
you're going to have the security
warning pop-up of course hit run another
security pop-up comes up of course hit
yes then you're going to need to be able
to set up get of course come down here
and hit next you're going to get to see
the license again hit next
then you need to define exactly where
you want to save everything I just hit
next and then here I check that I want
both the git bash this guy right here as
well as the get GUI and then of course
hit next then this pops up hit next
again I prefer to select the first
option right here because I'm just going
to use git bash because I would like to
use the commands that are provided there
again I leave the first option checked
again and hit next and then everything's
going to install for you and then the
wizard pops up and everything is
installed and I check on that I don't
care about the release notes and hit
finish now to open up kit you're going
to click on your Start button and then
look for a folder named git and
specifically click on get bash and here
you can see an example of what I have
set the very first thing you're going to
want to type in is get config - - global
username and then put your name inside
of here and that's going to allow you to
track who has changed files inside of
your database you're also going to want
to come in here and define a user
email as you can see there's mine so
just type that in of course hit enter
again and then the final thing that I
wanted to bring up because I'm going to
do all this stuff live in front of you
but I'm going to do it over on the Mac
all the commands are exactly the same
the only thing that I wanted to point
out here is if you want to change your
directory this is something comes up all
the time and there is a space and a
directory name just surround them with
quotes ok so now I'm going to show you
how to install get on a OS X or Mac
computer ok so we're going to go to
sourceforge.net projects blah blah blah
again this links going to be in the
description then you're just going to
want to come down here and click on
download then you're going to want to
open up the file that was downloaded and
double click on this box right here then
your installer is going to open up of
course click on continue again click on
install and the installation was
successful and now of course just like
you did inside of windows you're going
to want to come in here and type git
config - - global username and then your
name inside of quotes and then also I
came in here and also defined the email
address again get config - - global user
email and then whatever your email
address is now one thing that you might
want to do is to edit what are called
commit messages which is basically just
a message about why you changed the file
or how you changed it or whatever well
one of the things that a lot of people
on Macs like to do even though I never
do it is to use a chosen text editor in
this situation I'm using text Wrangler
because I use it and if you want to use
text Wrangler instead of using the
inline editing tools that are common or
default inside of get what you're going
to need to do in text Wranglers click on
text Wrangler and then click on install
command line tools and whenever you do
this little pop-up is going to pop up on
your screen click on OK and then to use
text Wrangler in this situation all
you're going to need to do is type in
git config - - of course this is inside
of the terminal on your Macintosh or OSX
machine you're going to type in git
config - - global Quarter
then inside of quotes edit space - w and
of course I have a link also to the
entire transcription of this video
underneath the video okay so enough of
the presentation format let's jump in
and start using it okay so here I am
inside of the terminal like I said
before all the commands you see here are
exactly the same on every operating
system I'm just using this mainly
because I'm recording everything here
and it's easier on my computer now I
just showed you how to change over to
use text Wrangler for your chosen editor
and you're going to see in a second what
I mean by editor and here we're going to
come in and I'm going to change it over
to vim which is very commonly used so
I'm going to go global core dot editor
and then I'm going to type in vim
instead and whenever I do nothing's
really going to happen it's just going
to use that editor from now on now if
you want to show your settings because
we just changed a whole bunch of
settings here all you need to do is go
get config and then - - and list and
there you can see all the information
that I changed inside of here if you
ever need to get help just type in get
help
pretty easy and of course you're going
to see all the different things you can
get help on and then let's say for
example you want to specifically get
help on add all you would do then I'm
going to clear the scroll back is just
go get help
add and it's going to show you all that
information you can read through it all
that you would like and you just type
quit or queue to get out of that and if
you're on a Windows computer and you
want to clear the scroll back just type
in clear and hit enter that works as
well now if you want to start tracking a
directory what that basically means is
you want to start saving certain files
inside of a folder or a directory on
your computer
the very first thing you're going to
want to do is actually go to that
directory okay and I'm going to use a an
Android directory here just to change
the files it doesn't really matter what
you use however and you're just going to
type in whatever that directory is and
let's just do this and then if you want
to show everything inside the directory
you either type in LS and you're going
to show everything like that or you can
type in LS - a and that's going to show
everything and show a lot of things that
are hidden like this stuff right here
Betty filet let's clear the scroll
and in this situation what I want to do
is I want to use a directory called
first app so change directory first app
and I'm inside of it and I hit LS you
can see all this stuff right here and
then if I want to tell get hey I want
you to start saving certain files inside
of this directory all I do is type git
init and there you can see initialized
empty git repository there's nothing
inside of it right now
if you want to start tracking specific
files you can do that in a couple
different ways let's say that you wanted
to track changes in every single Java
file you could just go get add well if
you want to do everything you just type
in star if you want to type in just
specifically Java files even though
there aren't any on here right now you
would just type git add star dot Java
drag like that and it's going to
automatically add all those I'm going to
use a specific file in this situation
which is going to be Android manifest
that's when we'll be working with so if
I want to start tracking it and saving
changes I just type in git add
androidmanifest.xml there you can see
doesn't show you any message if I want
to specifically ignore certain files
what you want to do I'm going to do this
right now
is you want to create a file called dot
get GI t ignore light like that if you
can see that right there and then you're
going to want to basically what I do is
I just take all the different file types
that I think I'm going to be working
with and I go to a website and
automatically download all these
different things so common things you
would want to ignore if you're
developing Android is all this stuff and
you can see it's going to ignore all apk
files it's going to ignore all Dex files
all class files it's going to ignore the
bin and Gen folder or directory and all
of these different things so you can see
right here an example of all that I'm
going to show you the website let me
just jump over you can see it right here
it's github.com forward slash github for
it slash gets ignore if you go here
you're going to see all of the common
things that should be ignored normally
are ignored inside of get but of course
you can also ignore
very specific filenames just like I
added the manifest that you just saw so
let's jump back over in the terminal
keep playing around with this alright so
what you're going to want to do is save
this file so I'm going to go to save as
and where am I gonna save it well I
saved it as first app there we go I'm
gonna save it inside of here
and again it's get ignore right like
that and that's gonna save you a lot of
time in regards to worry about things if
you're on a Mac it might give you a
warning just say use dot okay and there
we go now we have all of the files that
we should ignore ignored okay so back in
the terminal and you can also go LS and
you're going to see that the ignore left
the ignore file didn't show up was clear
scroll back
let's go LS dash a and now you're going
to see get ignores right there okay now
if I want to commit the
androidmanifest.xml file that I just
typed in there that I wanted to stage is
what they call it I'm going to show you
a brief way to do it now I'm going to
show you a more complicated way to do it
you just type in get commit and then if
you want to write directly to it without
opening up an editor you're going to
type in dash m and then I'm going to
give this a note like initial project
version okay right like that and there
you're going to see that everything went
through and an editor didn't pop up
that's going to change here in a second
and I just want to point out if you ever
want to do an abbreviated what it's
called is a commit message or commit
comment you just type in commit - M
after that more than likely you're not
going to want to do that all the time
because it's going to make your changes
a lot harder to figure out for other
developers as well as yourself now if
you want to get the status on all of
your files you just type in get status I
like that and you're going to see all of
the different untracked files that you
have here and there's going to of course
be some missing because you're ignoring
some of them and now I'm going to go
through the process of staging a file
basically I'm going to open up eclipse
right like this and I'm going to open up
a very specific file open file and I'm
gonna find first app which is going to
be right here and let's just come in
here and first app is right there and
you're going to see Android manifest
which is one of the files I'm going to
be try
okay so I'm just going to double click
on that and I'm going to come in here
and make a completely inconsequential
little change to this file I'm going to
put a comment inside of it so I'm just
going to type in this and you can save
images with git you could save any file
that you would want okay
so I'm just going to type in random
comments inside a random comments
whatever and I'm going to save this so
file save now I'm going to jump back
over inside of the terminal inside of
get clear the scroll back again and then
this is what's called staging so
basically I'm going to stage this file
and then it's going to be committed and
there's going to be two different
versions on the git system so if I want
to show what has changed one thing that
I can do is do in here and go get DIF
and I provide a cheat sheet as well
under in the description you can see
right here where we have the plus sign
right here and random comments it shows
me exactly right here exactly what has
been changed inside of there so that's
very good and very useful if however I
want to actually stage this file which
means that I plan on committing it very
soon thereafter I'm just going to go get
just like I showed you before and we
type in Android manifest XML and this
file has now been staged and you can see
that if I come in here and go get diff -
- catched like this that it's going to
show exactly what has been staged and
what has not been committed on our
screen now the logical thing to do is to
just commit the changes so you type git
commit and there you can see what
actually happened is a file opened up on
your system and I'm using them phim is
very easy to use very first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to type escape
from a hit or I'm going to hit my Escape
key already was escaped and I'm gonna
hit I you're going to see down here in
the lower left hand corner that insert
popped up then inside of here I'm going
to note exactly what I changed now
everybody's kind of a stickler for what
exactly how these are formatted
basically what I'm going to do is I'm
going to cover the most common way of
commenting on a commit change or a
change to this file basically you want
to type in a heading that briefly
explains the changes in 50 characters or
less so let's just say clients
asked me to change a comment okay that's
terrible but that's pretty much what I
did so what I'm going to do here is I'm
just going to type in that's sort of
like a heading then what I'm going to do
of course in real world you would type
in exactly the problem you very
specifically changed or the exact change
that you made but I'm sure you
understand that then what you're going
to want to do in sort of a paragraph
format is describe the original problem
that was addressed then you're going to
want to describe the specific change
that is being made right here then
you're going to describe the result of
the change or the result that you know
you're going to have and then you're
going to potentially describe any future
improvements and then you could type in
like a bug note notation or something
like that as well so let's just say the
client asked for the comment to be added
da da da da da and then I normally I
never go past this line right here it
causes some problems with the terminal
sometimes so I made that and I'm going
to hit enter change for them and then
all the things that I told you you
should also do another thing you is very
common is to also come in here and type
in a star and then type something like
client asked for comment change and then
you could say you know boarded list of
what you did I don't see this affecting
anything okay and then you could do
something like come in here and add a
bug notation which basically means that
you've closed a bug and bugs normally
have numbers and then you can type
something like number sign and one two
nine one six to one or something you
know whatever the bug number is and then
hit enter make sure that you do that
again then what you need to do is hit
escape again the Escape key and down
here at the very bottom you're going to
type in a colon and wq-- and that is
going to save the changes that you just
made and then of course hit enter and
there you go and you can see right here
the notation you can see right there
that your file has been changed another
thing that you could do if you want to
totally skip the staging as well as the
commit message
that we just typed in that was a commit
message it's just I get commit and then
type a that's going to skip the whole
staging area you're not going to have to
do the adding and all that and then of
course you can type in - M and you can
type in exactly what you want to change
here so let's jump over and let's
actually change the file slightly go
into the comment section and I'm just
going to type - inside of there and then
I'm going to type in save again there we
go I changed it then here I'm going to
say changed comment added to whatever
and there we could say that the comment
was changed and everything's there on
the screen so that's a shorthand way of
both skipping the staging as well as
skipping the commit message but like I
said it's something you're not really
going to want to do all the time because
the whole idea here is to be able to
track all your changes and be able to
very logically figure out any errors
that might have been added along the way
and now what I'm going to do is actually
create a file so that you can see
exactly how to remove a file inside of
get so I'm just going to file new duck
text document and I'm going to say
please delete me and then I'm gonna go
file save as you can see I'm right here
in the same place and I'm just going to
call this delete me text hit save back
over and get again and there you can see
delete me text is right inside of there
now I'm going to type in get add and
delete me text right like this and then
if I want to remove it I can type in get
RM delete me dot text and you're going
to see the message pop up that it is in
the staging area and cannot delete be
deleted unless you do a force removal so
no problem just come in here rim and
then I'm going to type in - F and there
you can see that it was deleted and if I
type in LS you're gonna see it's deleted
as well another thing you could do is
let's go and save that again file save
as pop back over here LS you're going to
see delete me is back there again see
there's delete me and this time you
let's say that you just want to remove
it from the staging area you can just go
get add and I'm going to put it in the
staging area right like this and then if
I want to remove it from a staging area
I just go get RM - -
hatched deleteme dot text and this is
going to keep the file on your system
but it's going to remove it from the
staging area and there you can say if i
type LS delete me still there but it's
not going to be in the staging area get
status and there you can see that it's
not in the staging area now what I want
to do is come in here and go get add and
delete me text then I'm going to go get
commit - M initial project version and
now if I want to rename my file I can go
get em V delete me text and rename it to
delete text or something like that and
get status and you can see right there
that it was renamed now let's take a
look at logs and how they work inside of
get now if you want to show all the
previous commit messages in reverse
chronological order just type in git log
and there you can see all of the
different changes that were made as well
as all the different notifications just
type in Q and then you'll jump out of
that and then I'm going to clear my
scroll back if you want to show all of
these on one line this is very common
you just go get log - - pretty equals
one line and there you can see
everything is pretty easy to see the
only problem is this is kind of a mess
we want to shorten that maybe so let's
go get log pretty again but this time
we're going to format exactly how this
information shows on the screen so let's
just come in here if I want to just show
like an abbreviation of this hash code
right here I just type in % and H and
then let's say I want to put a colon
between there I can do another % and if
I want to show the person that made this
change I can just type in % a N and
another colon you don't need these
colons you can put anything inside of
there I just chose to use colons a R is
going to be the date that was changed
and then if I want to show the first
line of the comment I just put % s right
like that hit enter you can see got
exactly right there on the screen
exactly what I wanted
so pretty neat there's a couple other
codes that I'll get into later in this
tutorial but for now I think that's
enough another thing is if you want to
say show just the last two commits you
can come in here and let's say I've been
and if I just want to see the last two
there you can say all those are on the
screen right there for me hit Q to jump
out of that again if I want to print
just some what are called abbreviated
stats I can just come in here and go
stat there you can see that on the
screen just a bunch of different things
you can do if you want to see all the
changes in the last week
well this in this situations could be
everything but get log you can type in -
- since equals and then you can type in
1 dot weeks and I'll show you a couple
other things there's everything Q to
jump out of that again you can also get
all the changes since a specific date so
let's go get log a can this is going to
be everything since I just did all this
right here in front of you since is
equal to and that's how I want to do
2014 - oh 4 - 12 that's gonna give me
everything there you can see R is
everything again you can also format all
this information I can also just show
the changes that have been made by a
specific author there you go
and I'm just gonna say it or bonus will
make sure I spell that right Stannis and
there's all the changes I have made q
jump out again if I want to see all the
changes that were made before a certain
date get log B 4 is equal to and then
2014 - oh for - 13 and there you can see
there again and then in this situation
let's say that I want to make another
file change so let's go to let you can
see that it's listed as delete text
right there delete me um I'm just gonna
type in again if I'll save that let's
say that I come in here and I go get add
delete text and then I go commit whoops
make sure you type in get every time get
commit and then type in M and just I
don't know random change you would never
want to type this in in the real world
but I'm going to type it in here and
there you go let's say that you wanted
to undo a commit all you do is type in
git commit dash - amend and this is
going to allow you to change your
previous commit that you just made right
there and you can see right here if I
typed in something ridiculous like that
well I could come in here and change it
I'm going to change into insert mode by
hitting I and then I'm going to delete
this select all thing here and type in
something much better type in random
message hey
go that's much better escape again hit
the coal 1wq can see right down here
there's WQ okay and then hit enter and
then the final thing that I'm going to
cover in this tutorial later on well
maybe in the net probably in the next
tutorial going to cover remote and using
remote files because I just couldn't fit
all this in one tutorial it's just an
insane amount let's say if you came in
here and you said that you wanted to
stage a file by going get add again and
delete text right like that let's say
that you went and staged the file but
then you decided you did not want to
stage it now you just type in reset head
and in this situation you're going to
type in what you want to on stage and
there you go then any type in get status
and there you can see that it is not
ready to be committed so there are is a
ton of things about get hopefully
answered a lot of your questions again
I'm going to cover I'm trying to cover
everything as quickly as humanly
possible so and of course there's cheat
sheets and all that stuff underneath the
video to help you along it's pretty easy
to use you just have to dive in and
start using it and of course it is
extremely useful I just wanted to make a
special note right here if it is before
April the 25th of 2014 I'm giving away
another samsung galaxy note 3 with a
Samsung Galaxy gear SmartWatch in this
part of the contest all you need to do
is to submit on my website a link to a
funny video that shows why you should
win emphasis on funny and whoever makes
the funniest video is going to win so
please leave your questions in comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
