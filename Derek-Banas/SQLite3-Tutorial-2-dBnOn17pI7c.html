2 of my SQL Lite video tutorial today
I'm going to go over how we able to
create SQL Lite databases as well as
tables and I'm going to show you a whole
bunch of shortcut ways to generate a
whole bunch of insert statements so you
don't have to type raw data into your
database so I have a lot to do so let's
get into it
okay so this is the data that we're
going to have what we're going to have
here is a database with a whole bunch of
superheroes in it and superhero powers
now as you can see here is a whole mess
of different types of general
superpowers that a superhero or super
villain can have like mind control
possession psionic blasts and so forth
and so on
what we're going to need to do is put
this in alphabetical order so it's a
little bit easier to read and then what
we're going to need to do is match up
all of these general type superpowers
with the super heroes or villains
themselves so here we have Tony Stark
and he is Iron Man so we're going to
have all of that information in another
table and then we're going to have
specific power information the very
first ID right here is actually going to
reference these general powers up here
as well as those general power
descriptions and then also in that table
we're going to have more specific
information in regards to our very
specific superhero and then what we're
going to do is take the identities which
is going to be represented with one two
three four this column right here is
going to represent the IDs for the
superheroes themselves and then these
are going to be very specific powers so
for example if this is Iron Man then in
this situation one is going to represent
the first item in this column which is
going to be specific to Iron Man's power
to shoot pulse bolts and then two is
going to be specific to thirty four
which is going to be a reference to the
general superpower of super speed and
then this is going to be Iron Man's top
speed and 95 is going to be a reference
to the general superpower of super
strength and then 90 tons is going to be
the specific amount of weight he can
pick up so that is what this table is
going to do and if you haven't quite
gathered all that don't worry all the
code is veiled
link under the description and I'm going
to be covering this stuff numerous times
so you'll get it by the end so what I'm
going to do first is I'm going to create
the table which is going to have all the
general superpowers and I have a little
tool here called unlit as you can see
right here I've used it previously it's
a free plugin for Eclipse and it allows
us to create things like these
descriptions for the tables in our
database now like I said before we're
going to have a general power if you
can't see this view at full screen but
I'm going to make most of this in a text
editor
so that's going to be general power and
then I'm going to add all the other
columns underneath of it and I'm going
to do that over here so we are going to
have an ID which is going to be an
integer which is going to be a primary
key which just means that it's going to
auto increment and make sure that we
have unique values inside of there then
we're going to have power type which is
going to be the name of the general
superpower and then we're going to have
general power description which is going
to be a description for the general type
superpower so now that we have all of
those set up you can bounce over here
and we can select this and we can paste
that in over here and now you can see
that we have all that information for
our table for our database so now what
we're going to do is go and grab another
one of these and create another one so
this is the one we created just now
that's great big guy going do the thing
and now we're going to create the table
this is going to represent the secret
identity as well as the superheroes name
or whatever you want to say and this guy
is going to be called identity right
like that just as you can see right
there now I'm going to create all the
columns for it as well so we are also
going to have an ID which is going to be
a primary key which is going to be a
unique number that is going to represent
our superheroes and they're going to
have a secret identity and it's going to
be of type text and we're also going to
have character which is going to be the
superhero or villains name I'm just
going to copy that out of there and this
is just going to provide us with
everything in a nice organized manner
because here in a second we're going to
show how these different tables are
going to relate to each other and then
let's just come in here
we're going to create another one and
the next one we're going to create is
going to be the specific or more
elaborate information on this specific
power for each hero and this guy is just
going to be called power and then inside
of the power table again I'm going to
have an ID that's going to be a primary
key I am also going to reference the
general power type ID and this is going
to be known as a foreign key and all
that means is it's a reference to a
primary key in another table we'll get
more into that as time goes by then
we're going to have power description
which is going to be a more specific
explanation of the power for the
superhero and of course we can just come
in here and paste that in there and then
I'm going to take identity move it down
here grab power move it over here and
then I'm going to point to the fact that
the primary key here is referenced by
power type ID inside of the power table
say so that is how they are going to be
linked together so pounce out of that
now we got three of them set up and now
we just need a fourth one now the fourth
one is going to pull everything together
it's going to have the identity for the
superhero and it's going to have all the
specific types of powers that that
superhero is going to have so let's
bounce back over in the side of this guy
and this one I'm just going to call
super human right like that and then
inside of super human we're not going to
have a primary key this time I'm
actually going to put identity ID and it
is going to be an integer and like I
said before it's going to be a reference
to the ID inside of the identity table
and then I'm going to have power ID
underscore one which is going to be an
integer and I'm going to have a couple
of these guys I'm going to have three of
them and I'm just going to name this two
and three just like that and then we can
grab this copy it paste it inside of
this grab this and for now I'm not going
to link all the individual power IDs I'm
just going to keep this nice and simple
right now so here we are going to show
the link between the identity table as
well as the identity ID which is over
here like I said this is known as a
primer
okay this is known as a foreign key
alright now what we need to do is
actually create all of these tables
inside of our database and we're going
to go sqlite3
and I'm going to call this superhumans
dot TB and there we are and tables is
going to show that there are no tables
currently created inside of it then what
I need to do is create the table so I'm
going to go create table
I'm going to go general power and I need
an ID which is going to be an integer
primary key and basically just copy and
everything from the left side of the
screen over to the right and then I'm
going to need power type which is going
to be text which is going to be the
powers name and then I'm going to have
general power description which is also
going to be of type text and then close
that off and it has been created as you
can see right there there's general
power next thing I need to do is come in
and create the identity table and it is
also going to have an ID which is going
to be an integer which is going to be a
primary key and it's going to have the
secret identity which is going to be of
type text and then it's going to have
character which is going to be the
superheroes name and it's also going to
be of type text and there we go and if
we type in tables you can see that
general power and identity are both
created alright so let's just keep on
creating tables so let's create another
table course create table this is going
to be the specific power which we called
power
there's integer primary key and we're
going to have power type ID which is
going to be a foreign key reference
which you're going to see in a second
how to set up a foreign cake and then
we're going to have power description
which is going to be the specific
description for that said guy and then
we're going to jump down here to the
next line you don't have to jump down
the next line just decided to and I'm
going to say foreign key it doesn't
matter this whole thing with uppercase
or lowercase just something I chose to
do then whenever you're creating a
foreign key you're going to define what
is the foreign key inside of this well
power type ID is the foreign key and I
can see I made a little slip-up here in
regards to this actually let's just exit
out that's in the throw syntax error and
I accidentally jumped out of the thing
no big deal and there we are we're back
inside of it tables and there we go
general
identity and it did not create the
power1 yet so I'm just going to come in
here grab this guy paste that inside of
it and I'm going to jump down in the
next line just to show you you can do
that I'm gonna say power type underscore
ID spell integer right this time
and then I'm going to say power
description which is type text and then
I'm going to jump down in the next line
again and here I'll type in foreign key
using lowercase doesn't matter and then
here we reference what is a foreign key
we're going to type in power type ID and
then we're going to say references and
we're going to say what specific table
it's going to be general underscore
power is the table we're going to
reference an ID is going to be the
specific thing we're referencing boom no
errors and tables and there we go we
have those all set up as well and Shaima
is going to put all the information out
there on the screen regards to how it
was created like that okay pretty cool
so now what we have to do is create our
last table and that's going to pull in
the identity with all the individual
superpowers great table superhuman and
here we're gonna have identity ID which
is gonna be another foreign key like I
said before then we're gonna have power
underscore ID underscore one which is
going to be an integer and then we're
gonna have power underscore ID
underscore two which is going to be an
integer as well jump down the next line
just to keep everything neat power ID
underscore three which is also going to
be an integer I went to Joe right there
we go and then after I have that set up
remember I have another foreign key that
I need to create inside of this so let's
go for and key and I'm going to say
identity ID is the name of it and then
I'm going to say references identity
which is the name of the table that I'm
going to be referencing ID is the very
specific part of the table and there we
go
and now we have all our of our tables
created for us and there are all of them
all in one place so now that we have our
tables all generated the next thing we
need to do is to populate them with
insert statements so let's look at that
and figure out exactly how that needs to
be done
remember you don't want to type in all
this stuff it's just a mess but the very
first thing I want to be able to do here
is actually come in and put all this
information in alphabetical order and
since I was recently asked how to do
that how to turn a multi-dimensional
right into alphabetical order I'm gonna
get to show you that what we're going to
use is the arrays.sort tool and what
this is going to do is sort the array
based on the order that is going to be
specified based off of the thing called
a comparator which you're going to see
here in a second and of course we're
going to be sorting the array in this
situation based off of the powers name
and not the description because that
wouldn't make much sense so the very
first thing we're going to be sorting
here is going to be this Jai gundo thing
and it's gonna be called superpower
array so let's just copy that I'm down
inside of here and paste it and then we
want to sort it in a very interesting
way so we're gonna say comparator and we
are going to be sorting a string array
and then after this these braces here
put a curly brace one two three come
down here put a semicolon now this guy
is gonna throw an error because it's
going to say we need to implement a none
implemented method as you see click on
it there we are and then inside of this
we're going to define exactly how the
East different items are going to be
compared to each other so I'm going to
be comparing power 1 to power 2 and all
that means is scroll up here
the very first thing we're going to
compare is power augmentation to power
Postell or stole or whatever so those
two are going to be compared to each
other so we have to define exactly what
that means down inside of this guy and
then it's going to handle everything
magically for us it's absolutely kind of
cool actually so what we're going to do
we're just going to come in here and
just go return and then we're going to
go power 1 and then we're going to go 0
and then we're going to say compare to
put inside of this power to 0 like that
I'll save it and it is going to work and
the way this is going to work is power 1
which is just going to be the first
power in the list and power 2 is going
to be the second one that we're going to
be comparing to each other what it's
going to do is it's going to compare
power 1 to power 2 and in this situation
which power 1 is greater than or equal
to power 2 then power 1 is going to be
compared to the next power that follows
after power 2 or power 3 and the list if
forever power 1 is less than power 2
then power 2 is going to be compared to
the next power that follows it and so
forth and so on and if you would want
this to go into reverse alphabetical
order
you just change this to power two and
change this to power one but that's just
silly because I don't want to do that
and there we go and now we're gonna have
all this set up now what we're gonna be
able to do just this this little tiny
bit of code just went and sorted that
whole entire array and I'm going to show
you here proof of that just going to go
for string like that item and then the
array is name itself and then inside of
this we're going to go
well actually just amount and then I'm
going to say item plus and then inside
of this I'm going to go 0 and then
inside of this we're going to go item 1
item 1 like that and if we execute it
and come down here in the console and
you can see that everything is in
alphabetical order as you can see right
there so pretty cool so that's how you
go in and sort multi-dimensional arrays
but we don't need this our goal here is
to generate all the insert statements
that we're going to use so what I'm
going to do is I'm actually going to go
superpowers which is the name of this
class and they call this super power
tools new super powers and this is just
a quick and dirty way to solve this
problem of generating all these insert
statements so we don't have type min so
I'm just going to call this generate
insert statements and what's gonna get
passed inside of this is going to be
this array super power array right here
come down here paste that in there then
after that we're gonna put general power
which is the name for the table general
power power type is going to be the name
for the very specific column as you saw
previously and then general power
description is going to be the last part
of that so there we are now I just need
to create generate insert statements I'm
gonna do that down here public void
boink
generate insert statements and then the
very first thing we're gonna have inside
of this is gonna be a string
multi-dimensional array it's going to
get passed inside of it and I'm just
gonna call that the array like that then
here we're gonna have another string and
this is going to be the table name
itself here we're going to have another
string and this is going to represent
I'm just gonna call this cell name 1 and
then we're gonna have another string and
it's going to represent
what I'm gonna call SIL name too here we
come oink oink now this guy's gonna spit
out all those statements guess what I'm
going to do kind of the same thing that
I did before to print out that
information string item the array was
passed in system.out and then here I'm
just going to create the insert
statement so it's going to be insert
into and then we're going to put in our
table name which is what we're going to
be inserting into Plus and then we're
going to need to put bracket here Plus
come down in the next line keep this
nice and neat then I'm going to say sell
name one plus blink and you're going to
see here in a second exactly what this
is going to generate plus sell name two
plus close off that bracket immediately
after this we're going to type in values
and then the values that we're going to
put in here specifically since these are
both going to be strings it's going to
be pretty easy now I'm going to say item
0 plus single quote space put another
single quote then right after this I'm
going to say item bracket 1 plus a
little bracket there a single quote Dada
to close off that command and guess what
everything is all set up I don't see any
error so let's execute it and there you
can see the whole entire thing all the
insert statements we're ever going to
need it's right click in here select all
copy paste this insert statements in
there as long as I typed in everything
right it should work and if we type in
select bah dah dah dah dah from general
power you can see there is everything
and it is an alphabetical order and it's
wonderful and we didn't have to think
too much to create all that stuff so
that's really cool ok so now I need to
do exactly the same thing inside of code
to create all my other insert statements
so let's bounce over inside of here
clear the scroll back and I'm going to
go schema and let's look at identity and
how it works now identity is going to be
entering a secret identity which is text
and the character's name which is also
text so if we look at generate insert
statements we can see table names string
of course that's fine this is a string
and this is a string so that means it's
going to work if I am entering the
identity information as well I just have
to change couple different things here
so instead of superpower array
do is I'm just gonna get rid of this
altogether so it doesn't print that out
twice
so let's come back up here and let's
look at exactly what fields we have
inside of identity now this is gonna be
super human array which is what we're
gonna be pulling from come back down
inside of here this isn't being super
human array and the guy or the table
name for that is identity so pretty easy
to remember and then this is going to be
secret identity and then this is going
to be character character file save and
let's execute that see if it worked
run ass looks like it worked me yes it
did Tony Stark Iron Man that it either
died so I don't have to think about that
either
good copy I'm silver enjoy school life
paste that in select from identity like
that and there you can see all that
informations inside of there and it is
perfect so now we need to do the same
thing again for the other two
multi-dimensional arrays we have inside
of here move this out of the way now
this one's a little bit different
because this is going to get a number
and then it's going to also get a
description so we can no longer use this
generate insert statements the way that
we're using it here let's get rid of
this again and get rid of this alright
so I'm gonna have to create a new
generate insert statements no big deal
let's just copy this is a baseline and
I'm not thinking too much about this
reusing of code I'm just trying to solve
the problem okay so we got this right
here now for this guy what we're gonna
be doing is using this right here which
is specific power array come back down
here and then enter specific power
arrays what we're going to be passing
over inside of it and actually let's go
and cut this out of here and put it
where it needs to go which is right here
there we are and then also super power
tools is gonna be used again I'm just
overloading this method it's all I'm
doing now what I need to do here is make
it so that this is going to work with
both integers as well as with strings so
how can I do that well we're going to be
putting in power which is a reference to
the power ID which is an integer
well one simple way to solve that issue
would be to pass a long an integer and
I'm doing this like just out of my head
this is just way I'm thinking because I
think this stuff sort of helps well
actually this would be here
matru all right so it's going to be true
if this guy that we're passing in here
is going to be an integer and this is
going to be power type ID which we know
that this is going to be an integer this
is just the columns name but the actual
data type for power type ID if we come
back up here again you can see even
though it's set as a string it's really
going to be an integer whenever we
create this information so let's just
let that be there that way and just for
the heck of it I'm also going to copy
this and do the same thing for the last
part because I may need this in the
future and power description is going to
in this situation be false because it is
a string and not an integer so now I
just need to create this actual method
down below no big deal top yet come down
inside of here public void generate this
very specific information this is going
to be a string again multi-dimensional
string right there we go I'm gonna call
it the array just like I did before this
is going to be a string that's going to
represent table name just like before
this is going to be a string as well
which is going to represent the first
cell name so we call that cell name one
just like before then this we're going
to need a boolean and I'm going to call
this is int it's just going to refer to
whether the data that is in this very
specific cell inside of the table is
going to be an integer or not and then
I'm just going to copy this in here
paste that in change this to cell name
to change this to is int to that and
there we go
and we have that all set up and pretty
much a lot of the code is here so now
I'm actually going to use a lot of the
code out of this guy right here the
previous generated insert statement so I
know this is a little sloppy but this is
me trying to get something accomplished
it's not me trying to be slick so we're
going to commit here and we got to think
about okay well what's really going to
be different well pretty much the only
thing that's going to be different are
the values we're going to have to decide
if we're using integers or strings for
using integers then we're going to want
to get rid of this single quote if we're
using strings we're going to want to use
it that's that that's the only
difference so I'm going to change this a
little bit and I'm going to call this
I'm gonna define a string and I'm going
to call it insert statement and it's
going to be equal to this the whole way
up to the point where
we get to the quote which we may or may
not need that's all we need here so just
copy that paste it inside of there close
that on and there we go that's all ready
to be used now we have to change
everything based off of whether the data
being passed in is going to be an
integer or not an integer so that's what
we need there so in this situation I'm
just going to say if is int which means
it's an integer well in that situation
I'm going to say insert statement like
that plus is equal to item zero plus
there we are else it's not an integer
then it means we need to have our quotes
inside of this guy so the big deal just
come in here and before the item we're
going to put the quote in that's all
pretty simple stuff and then at the end
of it well know everything's going to
stay exactly the same and then I'm just
going to copy this because I'm largely
going to do the same thing again
the only difference is this is going to
be changed to is int 2 and this is going
to be changed to item 1 and this is
going to be changed item 1 everything is
going to remain the same except this
right here is going to be the closing
bracket for our guy here and guess what
this is going to be the same
down here that's it it's all we need to
change save that and then what we need
to do is inside of the print line we're
instead going to print insert statement
like that if I'll save and let's execute
it so we just need to go in here and fix
this part where it's putting a quote in
there but it's not putting the last
quote in nice to make an error everyone
Salam proves you're human so just come
in here here we're not going to put a
quote here we are going to put a quote
I'll say if execute now let's look at
our data a little bit better yes in this
situation we have our quotes where we
need them and now it won't throw an
error at least I hope not and just
double check here with a select
statement to make sure the power is
empty paste in all my new insert
statements and now let's go and check to
see if everything went in there properly
and there we can see that everything
indeed did go in there properly so
perfect perfect perfect perfect so now
we're just left with one more of these
guys in our database and all the data is
going to be set up and wonderful so this
last one is going to have three integers
inside of it so we're not going to be
able to use the generate insert
statement thing that we created before
but we're going to be able to use
something that is extremely similar to
it so let's come
a cup into this guy again generate
insert statements I'm actually just
going to change this rather than going
and deleting it and so forth and so on
like I said before the code is available
to link underneath the video and here
I'm going to change it from specific
power array to identity power array and
then just change the name for the table
to superhuman and then here we're going
to have identity ID and it's going to be
true because it is going to be an
integer here I'm going to call this
power ID because that's the name of the
column and it's also going to be true
copy that change this to power ID too
and change this to power ID 3 okay so we
have those all set up and now we just
have to create the new version of
generate insert statements not that big
of a deal because for the most part I'm
just going to cheat and I'm going to
copy the previous generate insert
statements and just reuse it because
it's going to work for me I think that's
the end of it yes it is good copy paste
that in there and then we just got to
change this up a little bit still going
to be the array still going to be the
table name still going to be string so
name 1 still going to be boolean is int
again again again only difference here
is I'm going to need a couple more of
these guys which is gonna be to paste
that in there paste that in there and
then I'm going to come in and change
this to 3 change this the 3 change this
to 4 change this to fork over passing in
for integers everything else is
perfectly fine we're going to be
creating an insert statement with values
just like we have in the past so that's
all fun the only thing that's going to
really be different here is I'm going to
need a couple more of these guys before
I get to the final one down here so I'm
just going to copy that and I'm going to
need two of these guys here to be
specific and then I'm just going to
change this to is int to change the item
to 1 change this item to 1 change this
to is int 3 change this to 2 change this
to 2 and then this is going to be is in
for change this to 3 change this to 3
and I think that'll work and the one
problem is that we have two less power
IDs and what we're going to need and
actually that's going to need to be
changed to the cell name 1 2 3 4 5 so I
forgot to put those
a big deal so I'm just gonna come in
here so name one grab this guy copy plus
sign paste it in there sell name three
and after that plus and then change this
cell named for it's gonna copy that base
that inner grab all those copy and then
also cut off this last part right here
if I'll save it execute and everything
is looking perfect just grab all those
copy jump over in SQLite paste it in
select everything from super human and
everything looks perfect so that is a
whole bunch of things in regards to how
to create tables out insert information
into tables as quickly as possible
