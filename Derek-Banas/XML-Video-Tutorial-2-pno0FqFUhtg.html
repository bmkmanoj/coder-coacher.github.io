my XML video tutorial this is where I
left you off where we created our main
XML file we're going to be adding more
to that but this part of the tutorial
and a cover extensible style language
which I'm sure you guessed is used for
styling XML so the very first thing
we're going to need to do here is go
into our directory and this is eclipse
and if you haven't seen part 1 of this
tutorial definitely check it out I'm
just gonna click on source just like I
did before go to new I'm gonna go other
and then this little wizard that pops up
is gonna help me get my XSL found if you
can't see this view at full screen HD
video and I'm gonna call this guy TV
shows dot XSL click finish and there you
go we have a whole bunch of things just
thrown right in here again it's just
going to have the version number the
type of encoding the version of XSL that
I'm going to be using a whole bunch of
other different things here I'm going to
get this part out of there then I'm
going to add something in here right
before template match which I'm going to
tell you that is here in a second I'm
going to go XSL now you technically
don't have to do this but I always do it
I'm going to go method is equal to HTML
and all that does is sets the output
type for HTML just like you may have
guessed
then we get to XSL template match I'm
gonna get a lot more into templates
later on in this tutorial today I'm just
going to briefly touch on it but
basically what this is saying is that
all of the rules that we define in this
XSL document are going to match the
entire document where the root node
which in our situation is going to be e
TV shows now what I'm going to start to
do here is just start going in here and
defining everything that I want to show
up inside of here I'll throw an HTML tag
a head tag inside the head area I'm
going to create a title and I'm just
going to call this TV shows and then I'm
going to go body and all the code that
you see here on the screen is available
in a link underneath of this video so
you should go get it because it's a very
heavily commented now I'm going to start
using some XSL little rules that we have
here now the first couple are not going
to be all that exciting as you can see
I'm doing this right inside the body
section which I'm creating here first
I'm going to say okay I want to output
the version for this guy so I'm just
going to type in XSL and then this is
important value of we're going to using
this constantly in this tutorial and I'm
going to say what exact
value I want to pull in and this is
going to return just like I said before
the XSLT a version that I'm using here
and as you can see up here we know
exactly what it's going to print out
what property XSL version and then close
that off and and end it with a break
statement then I'm actually going to
copy this because the next thing that I
print out isn't going to be that much
different and don't worry we're going to
get into a lot of more cool useable
things let's say that I want to print
out the vendor which in this situation
is going to be lib XML - which is a
toolkit that was developed from the
gnome project again don't you have no
reason to remember that again we're just
going to use system property except in
this situation we're going to change
this to vendor instead of Eila version
and then vendor URL again this is going
to be very simple we're just going to go
in here and type in vendor - URL so
that's how to pull some specific
information in regards to what XSL file
you're using now we're going to get into
some more interesting things that you're
going to use on an ongoing basis let's
say I want to cycle through all of the
nodes that are currently on the screen
and then print out certain information
or all the information that is contained
inside of those XML nodes or elements
whatever you want to call them well just
going to type in XSL for each and then
you're going to go select and be like I
said you're going to want to remember
this tool here and then I'm going to
specifically pull information from TV
show which is the root element and then
show itself and if we bounce over to XML
file you can see just that TV show
there's the root element and then this
is the information I want to pull in so
I want to pull in all the information
that is contained between each of these
show opening tags and closing tags and
it's going to act just like a for loop
if you are used to using for loops and
other computer programming languages
then I'm going to close that guy off and
I'm gonna start pulling in some
information now one thing that would be
kind of useful is if I would have a
series of links across the top of the
page and whenever the user clicked on
one of those links it would zoom down
into the document to that specific
information so I'm going to show you how
to do that I'm going to use a function
called generate ID I'm going to need an
anchor tag of course each reference is
going to be equal to I'm going to put
number sign inside of here and then if I
want to generate a unique ID for each
one of these elements on this page I'm
just going to say generate ID based off
of the name which is going to be the TV
show name
put that in there and then close that
off and that's going to create the
beginnings of this link for me so now
what I want to do is get the value for
name or I want to get the tv-show name
how do I do that again XSL : and then I
say value - oh and I'm going to type in
again select what do I want the value of
I want the value of name and then I'm
going to close that guy off and there
you go I just created a series of links
for all the different types of
information that is contained in our XML
file and printing them out to screen
this guy right here that's what this
code is going to do gonna cycle through
all those different elements and then
output a link to each one of them that's
going to be unique for every single
thing on the screen so now what I need
to do is create a series of links
underneath that instead of using H
reference use name which is how you'd be
able to link inside of documents so now
that I have that series of links I'm
going to actually get the data and throw
it on the screen I'm going to use
another for each block just like I did
before there's that now inside of this I
want to define a couple different rules
I'm going to say that I want us to be
able to sort everything so to sort the
results of this for each search just
type in XSL short select I'm going to
sort everything based off of the name
you sort it based off of an e I'll limit
that you have inside of there I'm going
to say that my order I'm going to type
out ascending but ascending is the
default of course descending is the only
other option and then I have to decide
how do I want to sort this information
well I'm going to tell it that since
it's a name I want to sort it based off
of it being text and there you go I
could also of course put in number and
that is the only other option so that is
going to start printing out all this
information and it's going to sort it
based off of the name in ascending order
so let's go get ourselves some
information let's say I want to go and
print the name of the television show
and also we're going to generate a link
back to this list that's going to start
our XML file this guy up here so how I'm
going to do that is I'm going to create
this h3 tag just like I started typing
here and then instead of each reference
I'm going to say name and it's going to
grab and get the exact same generated ID
that was created in the list above I'm
going to base it again on name close
that off
close that off well then inside of this
link I'm going to want to put the name
field so I'm going to save themselves
some time just grab this guy right here
it's going to automatically print out
the screen the name for said television
show another thing would be kind of neat
is to be able to go in here like I have
here with the images or the poster or
whatever you want to call it for each
one of these TV shows would be nice to
go in there and automatically print out
those posters so that's exactly what I'm
going to do how you do that is you go
image which is exactly what you're going
to be creating in this situation and
then I'm going to say that I want to
change one of the attributes for this
image and I'm going to do that by going
XSL attribute and I'm going to say name
being source this is the attribute that
I want to be able to go in here and
change and then right after that I'm
going to define exactly what I want the
value of source to be so what am I going
to do XSL value of select and then I
need to get the H reference for poster
which is this guy this is the attribute
for poster which is this element so how
do I get this value right here of course
I want to bounce in here and spell value
right and then I'm going to type in
poster forward slash at symbol I'm going
to say H reference that's how you get
ahold of the attribute for that and then
I'm going to close that off and there
you go you can see in just a couple
lines of code I'm able to create a brand
new image and give the attribute of
source whatever the attribute value is
for the poster element in my XML file so
pretty cool and after that's done I'm
going to throw a blurry statement in
there again I told you we're going to be
covering a lot of stuff in this tutorial
and let's say I just want to print out
all of the node information every single
thing that is assigned to that node I'm
going to say XSL value of select is
equal to current and this is a method
that's going to return every single
value that is stored in that element and
print it out to screen throw another
break statement in there now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take all of
these different elements that you see
here like the name of the show the
release date the end date the network
number of viewers and all that and I'm
going to write a sentence I'm going to
create a paragraph tag here and I'm just
going to start typing and I'm gonna say
the show and just save myself some time
it bounced up here and grab this guy and
I can throw this in here and it's going
to automatically take the show's name
mm shoot it right into our document
continue with was released and throw
pastes in there again and in this
situation my type in release which is
going to be its release date by row in
another call and in this situation my
type network there your arm just pulling
those values right out of the XML
document real easy Pro period at the end
of their just keep on typing it add an
average viewership of throw that in
there again and his situation getting
throw in viewers throw in a space
million people and we'll say it was
canceled in or that guy in there and
type in end date and then let the
paragraph tag end itself and then I'm
gonna throw it on the break statements
out of there there you go that's how to
grab information and create sentences
out of it and then I'm gonna let this
for each block and just like that let's
file save it and see how this works I'm
gonna go over to TV shows which is right
here click on that I'm gonna go open
with other and lift the little wizard
that opens up and we'll scroll way to
the bottom and click on web browser and
there you can see there is all the shows
showing up here is the links to all the
different parts if I click on them it
jumps to those specific names as you can
see right there and there is the version
number the vendor number and all that
other different information and there's
the posters that are automatically
pulled online and a whole bunch of other
stuff let's make some more stuff again
I'm strolling the XSL file and I'm going
to close off the end of that for each
block and let's say that we want to
output all of our information into a
table which is again another thing
that's commonly done I'm going to go
table and just to be simple I'm just
going to create a border for it close
that off and then I'm going to go TR
from a table row and then I'm just going
to type in th my header and I'm going to
say name th and then the other thing is
Network th and then I'm gonna say
viewers and that's all I'm going to do
for now so now that I have that part of
the table set up I'm going to create
another for each block inside of here
and go in and start cycling through all
that information just going to copy this
guy just like I had before paste that
guy in there and I'm also going to show
you how to apply different information
using an if statement so let's say that
I want to go and test and only show
thing
was in our table based off of whether
their release date was prior to 2006 how
do I do that
XSL if and then I'm going to type in
test which you're going to type in every
time and I'm going to say release and
remember previously I talked about
character entities and different things
that you're not able to type in well
less than is one of them so I'm going to
type in and lt and semicolon that is
going to represent the less than call
and then I'm going to type in 2006 which
is what I want to test for and I want to
close that part off now for anything
that meets those restraints I'm going to
come in here and type in TR create a new
table row then I'm going to go to TD and
then what am I going to throw inside R
here whole bunch of these value of
statements you're going to use this a
lot with XSL just bounce that guy in
there and name is the very first thing
that I actually want to show up inside
of here so I'm going to copy that paste
that in there
and I'm going to say that I want network
to also go into my table and then the
very last thing that I want showing up
inside of there is viewers and that is
going to populate my table for me
another thing you can use if you don't
want to use if and that is called choose
and choose as often used whenever you
want to cover multiple different
conditions so with this I'm going to do
in here XSL choose and then I'm going to
define all the different conditions in
which I want to have certain things
occur so I'm going to type in XSL when
this is the condition test is equal to
release is greater than greater than
unlike with less than in this situation
you do not need to put its special
little character code but with less than
you absolutely have to so let's say in
this situation I want to print out
anything that has release date greater
than 2006 that's exactly how I do that
and then I'm basically going to do
exactly what I do here create another
table row and all a bunch of columns so
just paste that inside of there except
in this situation just to show that I
got something different down here I'm
going to say a background color is equal
to yellow so that's all in this
situation we're going to have the
background color be yellow for this one
thing and then let's say that I want to
create another condition so I'm just
going to copy this in this situation
paste that in there let's
if we want to have something else
happened whenever release is equal to
2006 in this situation I'm going to type
in orange so the background color is
going to be orange in that situation
that's all that I need to do there and
then the last thing you can do with a
choose additional is to define a default
now this isn't going to apply I'm going
to type in otherwise that is the guy
right there this is the only other thing
you can do with this this is the default
action that is going to occur for
anything that was not affected by this
test right here or this test right here
it's not going to affect what was done
up here with this if because that is
outside of the choose area so in this
situation we're actually going to have
whichever television show was less than
2006 or how to release less than 2006 is
actually going to show up twice that's
no big deal
I just want to show you all the other
different things and also just so you
know if you wanted to test for a release
date that is not equal you just put the
exclamation point in there just like
that so let's get into otherwise here in
this situation I'm just going to copy
this bounce in here paste that in there
to happen and tap these in and this
situation I'm going to have the
background color be pink there's a whole
bunch of different things you can do
with choose let's save this guy and
let's bounce in here and actually check
this out
and if I bounce in here now you're going
to see way at the bottom of the screen
right here this is the table that we
just created and remember I said there's
going to be a duplicate which in this
situation this Freaks and Geeks
television show was the duplication and
you can see how all the different colors
changed and the table shows up and just
so you remember this is how you're able
to bounce through all the different
elements inside of our XML page and yes
indeed we are using an XML page here not
the XSL the excel file just acts as a
style sheet in the next part of the
tutorial I'm going to cover a ton of
other things about XML leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
