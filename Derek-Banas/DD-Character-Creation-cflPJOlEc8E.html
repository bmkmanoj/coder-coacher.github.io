Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons character creation
tutorial you guys asked me to teach you
how to play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons and so
here it is I'm gonna teach you how to
play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons one of the
easiest ways I think of learning how the
game works is to create a completely
original character using the supplied
character sheet and you can see it's
right here on the right side of the
screen and what we're gonna be using to
fill it out is the basic rules which are
free and there's a link in the
description there's a link sted pretty
much everything in the description and
I'm also going to be using the players
handbook this guy right here as well as
the Dungeon Master's guide to make sure
that everything makes sense and this
tutorial is gonna be kind of verbose I
am going to completely a.m. to make you
understand the character sheet so that
it makes total sense to you what all of
these jargon terms mean and the only
thing I want to cover before I jump into
creating your character is the different
type of dice that are available so you
know what they look like now this is
what we call a d4 and whenever you roll
it whatever the number on the top is is
going to represent whatever the die roll
is then you're gonna get a d6 which are
pretty much well aware of this is a
standard dice that's d6 then you're
gonna have a d8 and this is going to be
a basically a diamond shaped dice so
that's a d8 then you're gonna have a
d-10 doesn't actually have a ten on it
but it does have a zero so this is what
a d-10 looks like then gonna have a d12
once again biggest number on the die
normally represents what the die is so
that's a d12 and then the die that
you're gonna be using a lot is the d20
that's this guy right here so now that I
covered what the different types of die
look like you don't need the die you can
actually get apps that roll dies for you
or whatever but they're cheap and they
add a lot of fun to the game so why not
pick them up but either way now I'm
gonna jump over and show you how to
create your own custom Dungeons &amp;amp;
Dragons character okay so as I said I'm
gonna be using the basic rules that are
provided by Wizards of the coast and
this is the link to the basic rules and
they're free and I'll also provide a
link to that in the description
underneath the video
pretty much everything you'd ever want
is in the description under the video
link wise anyway so this is the
character sheet over here and basically
what I have to do is translate what's in
the basic rules to this sounds really
hard it's really not so what type of
thing do i what type of character why do
I want to create this is the very first
thing you want to ask yourself well I
decided a beginner probably wants to
start with a character that is tough and
probably isn't gonna take a lot of
damage well after reading through the
races and classes that are available I
decided that a hill dwarf fighter is
probably about one of the toughest
characters we can have and how I decided
that is let's just scroll through here
hopefully the scrolling doesn't bother
you I came down inside of here where we
see dwarfs see I am currently in the
race part of it so we're scrolling
through here and I see Hill dwarf
specifically have a hit point maximum
that increases by one starting at level
one and increases by one every time you
gain a level hit points are going to be
a measure of how much damage you can
take before you are either incapacitated
or killed so to be able to get an extra
hit point is always going to be
beneficial if I want to survive also if
I scroll through here down to the
fighter section which comes after the
classes way down here and this is gonna
be on page 25 for my fighters I can also
see down here under fighting style that
my defense specialty right here is going
to allow me to gain one point in AC and
AC stands for armor class and to make it
really simple and this is where you put
your armor class right here if somebody
is attacking you that attacker must roll
a number with the d20 that is going to
be equal to or greater than your armor
class so if my armor class is really
high the chances of them hitting me and
damaging me goes down dramatically can
also see here if we look at the fighter
that was second win this is going to
allow me to regain hit points no need to
read all this I'm just gonna give you
the brief overview of it and like I said
before hit points are going to measure
physical durability and just so you know
if they go too
zero you are going to be incapacitated
not killed to be killed for example
let's say that my hit points were a
total of 14 and this is where you put
your hit points right here to be killed
my hit points would have to drop to
negative 28 so otherwise you are going
to be incapacitated not killed and later
on we'll get into what happens if you
are killed and another thing that might
come up like armor class comes up all
the time when you're rolling there's
also another thing called difficulty
class or DC and that's gonna define how
hard it is to succeed at an action but
we'll get more into actions here in a
moment so now the very first thing that
I want to do on my character sheet is
because we saw over here that my defense
is going to my defense fighting style is
gonna give me a plus one bonus Stacy I'm
just gonna go over here and put a little
note on the screen that's gonna say plus
one DFS and we're gonna remember that
for later now what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna zoom up to page 13 inside of my
basic rule book and I'm gonna put in all
types of information in regards to my
dwarf first thing we're gonna notice as
we go through here under dwarf traits is
your ability score increase your
Constitution score isn't only to
increase by two so what I'm gonna do is
over here in the Constitution part I'm
gonna put plus two dwarf trait and
you're gonna write this in pencil so you
can go in and erase it later on whenever
you're calculating your Constitution
then as I go down inside of here I'm
gonna skip all these different things
until I get down to speed and you're
gonna see right here that your walking
speed is gonna be 25 feet so I'm gonna
take that 25 feet and put it over here
inside of speed as we scroll through it
we're good then going to see that my
dwarf is going to have the power of dark
vision so what I'm gonna do over here on
the right side of the screen where it
says features and traits I'm just gonna
write dark vision and then I'm gonna
make quick note that says in dim light
can see 60 feet in darkness can see as
if in dim light okay so you're just
gonna take what's here and move it over
here likewise I have dwarven resilience
over here so once again inside of
features and traits I'm going to put
advantage on poison saving throws and
what advantage means is whenever I would
go
to get a saving throw I'm actually going
to be able to roll my dice two times and
pick whatever the highest number is and
what the resistance means here where it
says resistance is on a hit I would
still only take one half damage of
whatever that poison hit would be once
again we'll come down into dwarven
combat trading it's going to say here
that you have precision see with the
battle ax hand ax light hammer and
Warhammer well I actually know that
since I am using a fighter in the
weapons section here under other
proficiencies and languages I'm actually
going to be able to put everything
because a fighter has proficiency with
every weapon as well as bows trap
shields and every armor so instead of
just writing the hammers and all that
stuff I'm going to come in here and
write all that down and of course you're
gonna find that information in the
fighter section down below which we'll
be getting to in a second and basically
proficiency is just going to demonstrate
how much better a player is at using say
a great sword for attacking and if
you're proficient with a weapon you're
going to be able to add bonuses to it
and your proficiency bonuses are going
to be up here where it says proficiency
bonus and basically you're going to use
these proficiencies any time when you
attack and use a weapon you're
proficient with or anytime you roll for
a spell or any ability checks using
proficient skills or any ability checks
using proficient tools or with saving
throws and your saving throws are going
to be right here now as we come down
you're gonna see tool proficiency and
it's gonna say you're allowed to choose
from either Smith's tools brewers
supplies or mason tools and I'm gonna
come over here in the features and
traits area and write Smith's tool
proficiency and it's important to know
that if you want to use any of these
artesian tools that's what they referred
to as whatever we're talking about tool
proficiency you can only use them if you
are proficient with them so I'm only
going to be able to use the Smith tool
proficiencies because that's all that I
know about then we come down here to
stone cunning not stone cutting stone
cunning and with this guy I'm going to
write stone cunning +2 perception checks
involving stone in other proficiencies
and what that simply means is
going to get a +2 for perception checks
involving sliding walls or stone traps
or unsafe stone surfaces or ceilings or
whatever okay like I said before getting
into a lot of detail don't need to
memorize this basically what we're doing
is just taking what's on the left and
moving it over to the right into the
right place and then we come down to
languages and you should write in here
common and dwarvish in your other
proficiency section because that's what
it says right there then we come up to
the fact that we're using a hill dwarf
and we want to be able to go and add all
the benefits here so one of the things
is ability score increase your wisdom
score is going to be increased by one so
I'm gonna make a note of plus one for
Hill dwarf inside of the wisdom and then
we have dwarven toughness which is one
of the reasons I decide to pick Hill
Dwarfs as my race and for that guy I'm
gonna come over here in the hitpoint
area and I'm gonna put Hill dwarf plus
one and then I'm gonna put a colon plus
one per level just so I can make a note
of that later on whenever I'm using my
character sheet and that's it I got all
of the different things about my hill
dwarf and transpose that over into the
character sheet and now what we need to
do is go down to the fighter skills and
add all of those and that starts on page
25 okay so I'm down in the fighter
section and I'm gonna come down I'm
gonna skip all this stuff for now and
come down to class features and every
class and race are gonna be handled
exactly the same the only difference
really are spellcasters like wizards if
you want me to do another tutorial like
this for wizards leave a comment below
and i'll do that because it's the only
thing that's slightly different than the
basic fighter and all the other
different races and classes so now what
I wanted to do is I want to cover my hid
dice so what I'm going to need to do
here is come over where it says hit dice
and put one d-10 and like I said before
hit dice represent your character's
ability to survive an attack and each
level increase is going to increase your
number of hit dice by two and once you
use one of your hit dice you're going to
lose it for that round until you have
none left and the only way to regain it
is if you have a long rest you're going
to regain
100% of your hit points remember hit
points determine if you are going to be
knocked unconscious or gonna be killed
so with a long rest you're gonna get a
hundred percent of those back however
you're only going to get one half of
your hit dice back and with hit dice
what you're going to need to be able to
do is roll your hit dice which in this
situation is going to be your detent
you're then going to add your
Constitution modifier which is gonna be
right here to that and that's going to
define the amount of hit points gained
from a short rest versus a long rest and
we're going to need to get to your
Constitution modifier and how to
calculate there that in a second you're
also gonna see right here where it says
hit points at first level you're gonna
see ten plus your Constitution modifier
what you don't want to do for that guy
is to come over and put ten plus one
plus Constitution modifier and whenever
you calculate your constitution modifier
you'll be able to go in there and put in
that specific number to make sure that
that's correct
then we come down here you can see all
armor and shields for proficiencies
we've already added those in down here
where we wrote that we're also gonna see
simple weapons and marshal weapons we've
already said that we can use any weapons
down here and it doesn't come with any
additional tools then for saving throws
you can see that we have strength and
Constitution are going to be added in as
specialties for our fighter and show
that inside of saving throws we're gonna
put a little dot here and a little dot
there later on I'll show you exactly
what that's gonna do for you and then
you're gonna be able to choose two
additional skills from this list right
here acrobatics animal handling
athletics history insight intimidation
perception and survival and just so you
know a saving throw is going to be used
to either avoid or reduce the effect of
an attack on your character by a
creature or whatever and basically you
are going to roll a d20 and then add in
any bonus ability modifiers here to see
if you are able to avoid some type of an
attack or not and there are basically
three types of saving throws you're
going to have fortitude reflex and we'll
basically with fortitude you're going to
apply your Constitution modifier to
stand up to it
such as poison disease paralysis
petrification energy drain disintegrate
and so forth and so on so for example if
somebody attacked you with poison spray
and let's just skip this here and let's
go into poison spray and exactly what it
does and we just scroll down inside of
the spell casting area right here you
see poison spray okay so it says you
extend your hand towards a creature you
can see within range and project a puff
of noxious gas from your poem the
creature must succeed on a constitution
saving throw or take one d12 worth of
poison damage so what you would do with
a saving throw and this specifically
poison spray is going to be a fortitude
saving throw is you would roll apply
your Constitution modifier to that role
and then that's going to determine if
you take damage or not reflex on the
other hand let's go to page 85 and let's
look specifically for burning hands
here's burning hands this is an example
of a reflects saving throw in this
situation let's assume a wizard attacks
with burning hands with a roll +
intelligence modifier for a total of 14
if hit the spell is going to do 3 d6
worth of damage and if we come down here
we could see 3 d6 fire damage or if you
were able to dodge that attack it's only
going to do half as much damage as if in
comparison to a successful hit and how
you would decide if you were able to
dodge or use that reflect saving throw
is to roll a d20 ad your dexterity
modifier to it and let's say you came up
with a 15 in that situation you would
best that attack and you would only take
half damage and then the final saving
throw like I said before is a will
saving throw and in that situation you
would apply your wisdom modifier to
resist mental or magical effects and an
example of an effect you would want to
save in that would be charm person which
is right here and you can see right here
in the notes on the spell it must make a
wisdom saving throw and does so with
advantage if you or your companions or
fighting it so basically it's telling
you right there that this is a will
saving throw
you need to use your wisdom modifier
which is gonna be right here to protect
from being enchanted by someone who
would try to cast a charm person charm
on you so anyway let's get back to the
fighter section and that's going to be
on page 25 and here we are and you can
see right here that I'm going to be able
to use two additional skills from this
list and put checkmarks down here inside
of the skills area for those and I
decided to put one in here for
perception and another one inside of
here for survival and basically
perception means that I'm going to have
an increased awareness of my
surroundings and it's going to increase
my ability to eavesdrop and sense
stealth once again I'm leaning towards
creating a character that's gonna need
to be devera defensive and hard to hit
or hard to attack and then I'm also
gonna put a check here for survival
because that's going to allow me to
avoid hazards as well as find food again
I'm sort of weighing in on trying to
survive and we come down into fighting
style and I already said previously I
want to use the defensive fighting style
which while I'm wearing armor which when
would I not be wearing armor I'm gonna
get a +1 bonus to my AC and now I'm
gonna cover the default equipment a
fighter receives just for being a
fighter now whenever it comes to
equipment you're either going to be able
to use the default equipment or you're
going to roll to determine a random
amount of gold and then buy the
equipment based off of the amount of
gold you are able to generate from
rolling I'm instead going to just use
the straight old regular old equipment
here and I'm gonna show you how it works
because for the most part for a beginner
it makes a lot more sense to just use
the standard equipment because if you
have a bad gold roll that's gonna mess
up the entire game so the very first
thing I'm going to do you're either
gonna be able to choose a or B a or b
you're gonna be able to pick one from
both of these choices but only pick a or
B in that situation so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna add chainmail and if I want
to find out what chainmail exactly does
I'm gonna go to page 44 and that's gonna
show me all the different types of armor
I'm gonna be able to wear and you can
see right here I have chainmail it's
worth 75 gold it's also going to say
that it's going to have an armor class
ac of 16 so now knowing
I can take the 16 over here add one
because I had the plus one from Armour
class and write 17 inside of there and
I'm also going to come down here inside
of my equipment area and I'm gonna write
chainmail 16 AC and then I'm gonna say
disadvantage for stealth and
disadvantage basically says that if I
have disadvantage and I try to go and
use my stealth ability I need to roll
the dice two times and pick the least
number rolled instead of the highest
number rolled whenever I had advantage
in comparison and that's all we need to
know about chainmail jump back up here
to class features then we can see my
next item is gonna be a marshal weapon
and a shield or two marshal weapons I am
going to choose one marshal weapon let's
go down inside of here and let's look at
our marshal weapons so right after armor
we are going to have down here your
weapon options and looking at all these
guys because I want to have a good
weapon but I also want to use my shield
once again to protect myself I'm
thinking that the longsword is going to
be one of my best options so basically
the longsword is going to be able to do
one d8 worth of damage and it is going
to be a slashing type attack however
it's also going to be versatile so I
could put my shield down during combat
if I wanted to increase my potential
damage and in that situation I'd be able
to change it into a two-handed weapon
and roll with a d-10 instead of a d8 to
potentially do more damage so there's a
lot of benefit I can use my shield with
one-handed with a long sword or I can go
to two-handed and do more damage I like
the way that works so that's what I'm
going to stick with now in regards to
slashing different monsters are going to
react differently to slashing
bludgeoning or piercing damage and
whenever you look at the monster
whenever you look the monster up inside
of your basic rules where it talks about
monsters or inside of books that you buy
it's gonna tell you if they had take
some type of advantage or disadvantage
to slashing budging or piercing damage
okay so that's just some information in
regards to how that works so then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to come
over here and put my longsword in with
one-handed as well as two-handed and how
you calculate your attack bonus it's
you're going to use whatever your
strength modifier is plus your
proficiency bonus
so you're gonna use strength plus
proficiency bonus and I'll get more into
calculating those later on and then also
in damage type if we come over here and
look at longsword you're gonna see
that's 1d8 slashing so I'm gonna put 1 d
8 plus strength your strength modifier
which is gonna be right here and a
little bit and then I'm gonna write
slash and I'm also gonna put in what how
it attacks in regards to two-handed
again 1 d-10 plus your strength modifier
and again slash alright and we'll
calculate those in a moment
now I also was going to come in here and
I wanted to use a shield now we need to
go back up here and right here you can
see shield and you can see that shield
is going to give me plus 2 for my armor
class so I can now come over here to my
armor class and increase that from 17 to
19 and I'm also gonna come down here in
my equipment section and write shield +
2 AC and let's come back up into my
fighter section see what's going on I'm
also gonna see right here I have a light
crossbow with 20 bolt option or two hand
axes I'm gonna pick a light crossbow
just so that I have a range attack again
we're gonna come down and check out
exactly what's going on with a light
crossbow so there's the armor and here's
this guy so like crossbow that's this
guy right here
it's gonna do 1d8 piercing damage and
it's going to have a range of 80 which
is going to be your normal attack and
then 320 which is going to be a
disadvantaged attack again disadvantage
roll two times pick the lowest one and
this is also going to have to be loaded
before you can shoot it which is gonna
take an additional action and it's going
to take up both hands so we're not going
to be able to use our shield if we are
using our light crossbow just something
to know so based off of that information
I'm gonna write like crossbow and for
ranged attacks you're gonna use your
dexterity modifier which is gonna be
this guy right here which we haven't
calculated yet plus your proficiency
bonus remember I'm proficient with bows
and all that stuff so I can write that
I'm proficient with it and then to
calculate your damage it's going to be
one d8 how did I find that out well I
went over here to the lake crossbow and
it says 1d8 piercing so I'm going to
write 1 D 8 plus dexterity and piercing
ok so we have all of that information
all right
inside of there and for the crossbow I'm
gonna come over here and write in 20
bolts and I'm gonna write in the
different range information regards to
how far it can go
also that it needs to be loaded and also
that it needs to be a two-handed weapon
whenever I plan on using that and now
I'm gonna get the option to either use a
dungeon ears pack or an explorer's pack
and I'm gonna go to page 49 to check
those out and you can see the different
equipment packs that are going to be
available to me I am personally going to
use the dungeon ears pack and basically
I'm just gonna copy everything that's
right here and put it right over here so
there you go now I know that I have a
crowbar hammer and all these other
different things available to me go back
up into 25 for my fighter and look at
what else is going on here and basically
what I see here is I have a bunch of
other different things that I need to
write down so we have second wind which
is going to basically allow me to roll
one d-10 and add in my fighter level to
regain certain amount of hit points and
I'm only going to be able to do that
once per round until I take a long rest
so I want to make a note of both second
wind axe and surge marshal archetype
ability score improvement extra attack
indomitable and all these other
different things and these are going to
be abilities that I get at higher levels
so action surge is gonna come in the
second level third level fourth level
fifth level and ninth level and make a
note of that over in my features and
traits and you can see right there that
I did that so I also put my defensive
fighting style in there with plus AC
plus one AC which is what this guy is
right here I wrote in second win once
before rest roll one d-10 plus level to
regain hit points that's also gonna help
me survive action surge once before rest
get one extra attack or one extra action
martial archetype and I just put all
these in here and I can later on lock
them up as the level of my character
increases and now it comes to
personality and background now I want to
pick a name for my dwarf so I'm going to
go to dwarf names and this is on page 13
all the other ones are going to be
different
depending upon the race you chose and I
decided that my dwarfs name is going to
be da rock iron fist
so we've went and put that information
inside of there then what you need to do
is come in and calculate your height as
well as your weight I already wrote
those in there and in this situation
with the dwarf that's gonna be on page
33 you can see down here personality and
background you can see all of the
different races are down here and how to
calculate both the height and the weight
in this situation you're gonna roll to
determine what that is so basically to
pick the height of my Hill dwarf I'm
gonna start out at 3 foot 8 inches and
I'm gonna roll to D fours and whenever I
did that I rolled a 3 so I'm going to
increase my overall height to 3 foot 11
inches as I did right there then what
you do to pick the weight is you take
the starting amount which is gonna be
115 then you're gonna roll to D sixes
and in my situation I rolled for a total
of 4 with both of those d sixes you're
then gonna multiply that times 3 which
was what we rolled previously whenever
we were calculating the height which is
going to give me 115 plus 12 or a total
of 127 pounds and that's all I went and
calculated that now I need to come in
here and pick an alignment and alignment
starts right here and then it comes down
here and you can either roll for the
alignment or not and basically this is
just information that you can use to
roleplay with whenever you're playing
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons and I decided that
lawful good which was the direction that
I wanted to go so I went in wrote lawful
good right here and you start off with
zero experience points and I wrote my
real name inside of there and fighter
and hill dwarf right there and then it's
gonna be time for you to pick your
background and that's gonna start off at
page 36 and you can see here are the
backgrounds that are going to be
available and there's a whole bunch of
different backgrounds and you can either
pick them or roll for them just like we
did previously with all the other
different things I decided in this
situation to roll for it and the
background that I got was for soldier
which
going to be on page 42 very important
gonna put a lot of information here with
this and one of the things if you are a
soldier any of these other different
backgrounds you're going to get skilled
proficiencies so I'm gonna have be able
to come in here over in the skill
section right here I'm gonna be able to
put a tick mark inside of athletics as
well as intimidation which is gonna be
very useful now if you were wondering
what personality traits ideals bonds and
flaws and all that stuff means basically
what you can do is you could roll ad 8 d
6 or d 6 for these guys to figure out
what all those are I went ahead and did
it ahead of time and as you can see I
rolled a 1 here and I just wrote I'm
always polite and respectful I'm always
polite and respectful and did the same
thing for ideals bonds and flaws and
this is just gonna
once again wow you to roleplay better
with your character and act a certain
way from you know whenever you're
playing your story okay so that's how we
figure out all of those different things
down here I can then roll for specialty
to determine what type of soldier I was
and in this situation I got really lucky
and rolled a 1 which means that I had
the higher of the different options for
a soldier which made me an officer so
I'm gonna come over here in features and
traits and right officer and it's gonna
say all soldiers will recognize your
authority and you can see down here
where it says feature military rank and
says exactly that down inside of here if
you read the details and all these gonna
be a little slightly different but
basically the same type of idea
depending upon the different background
options that you pick I'm then gonna
come in here and I could see that I have
told proficiencies one type of gaming
set vehicles land and I'm gonna note
that down here and other proficiencies
as you can see right there land vehicle
proficiency then over inside of
equipment I'm gonna take all the
additional equipment that I receive as a
soldier and I'm gonna write all of that
in here under equipment as you can see I
did right there okay and the insignia
rank is going to match up with the fact
that I was an officer and all that and
we'll get into what deck of cards and
all those things mean later on I'm also
going to get 10 gold as you can see 10
gold pieces right there so I'm going to
write 10 gold pieces but I'm also gonna
write 10 gold pieces right here and this
is where we determine and you're gonna
be using a pencil here of course to
determine and keep track of how much
gold and silver and
and all the different coinage you have
as a player and now it comes time for us
to go in and measure our ability scores
which is what you have been waiting for
now to determine your ability scores
what you can do is either roll four D
sixes and then add up the three highest
to determine your ability scores or you
can use a standard which you can find on
page seven so let's go to page seven and
right here you can see these standard
scores we used i personally decided to
use the standard scores because they
work out good for me now as a fighter
that wants to be protected what do i
want to do well i want to stay a lot to
stay alive that means i need to have a
high Constitution i want to be a good
attacker so i'm going to be using
strength more than more than i'm gonna
be using dexterity for range so i'm then
going to want to put some points into
strengths then we have dexterity then i
would like to focus in on wisdom to
increase my perception as well as my
insight once again keep me alive i'm
going to then pick charisma as the
next-to-last most important because i
want to increase my persuasive abilities
and then finally i'll put the last eight
into intelligence because reasoning and
memory doesn't really matter much for my
fighter
so as you can see everything is about
protecting myself performing strong
attacks and then ranged attacks and then
you know perceptive abilities and so
forth and so on so i'm going to put all
of those guys in there and that is how
you figure out what these different
ability scores are basically you use
that or you can roll for it it's
completely up to you and remember
whenever you're calculating these that
you're going to add plus two for
constitution and plus one for wisdom if
you're making exactly the same thing as
I have or depending upon whatever other
things you found in your you know
looking up your specific character make
sure you increase that and that's how I
was able to come to my final numbers in
regards to all those guys now what
you're going to want to do to be able to
calculate your ability scores and
modifiers which go in these boxes right
here is you're going to use a table and
that table is going to be on page a7
well
don't have to go anywhere for that there
it is right there now to figure out what
your a strength modifier is going to be
what you're going to do is take your 15
gonna look over here 14 to 15 and get +2
and you're gonna do that for all of the
different abilities as you can see I did
right there so +2 dexterity says 13 I
look in 13 and I see this is a plus 1
plus 1 there Constitution 16 16 17 plus
3 put a plus 3 right there and there you
go now you have all of that information
all laid out there and you're gonna be
able to then take all that information
move it over into saving throws as well
as skills so you're gonna take the plus
2 here and since you have a check mark
in there that means you get to add an
additional two to it to get a final
saving throw for strength of 4 dexterity
once again you have one it isn't checked
so you just put one inside of there
Constitution you have three right here
yeah two to it you get five and so forth
and so on and that's how you figure out
what you're saving throw modifiers are
going to be for all of your different
abilities likewise you're gonna do
exactly the same thing for all these
guys if you see here I don't know if you
could say it says Dex dexterity wisdom
intelligence strength charisma all those
so if it's dexterity you're gonna take
plus one put that in there
it's not checked so you don't do
anything else with it athletics however
you can see this is strength so I'm
gonna take my plus two from a strength
put that inside of there because it's
checked I'm gonna increase that by two
to keep the floor okay so you can see
how exactly we add up all the ability
modifiers and all of those different
things now if you were wondering what
all of these different skills mean I'll
go through them I already talked about
saving throws so whenever we're talking
about acrobatics that is going to
measure your ability to stay on your
feet on slippery surfaces tight ropes or
during some type of a stunt animal
handling is going to measure your
ability to understand and use animals
Arcana is going to basically calculate
your ability to recall spells items
symbols planes of existence athletics is
going to measure your climbing jumping
and swimming ability deception is gonna
measure your ability to deceive history
is going to measure your ability to
recall or insight is going to measure
your ability to guess someone's next
move intimidation
going to measure your ability to
intimidate investigation your ability to
use clues find hidden items or deduce
weaknesses medicine your ability to heal
someone
nature knowledge of animals plants and
terrain perception awareness of
surroundings eavesdropping and your
ability to sense stealth performance is
going to measure your entertainment
ability persuasion once again your
persuasive abilities religion knowledge
of religious people and items sleight of
hand your ability to conceal or steal
stealth that's going to be ability to
hide or sneak away and then finally
survival which is going to measure your
ability to avoid hazards as well as fine
food so we got a lot of things done here
we're gonna come down here to passive
wisdom and to calculate that you just
take 10 plus whatever your wisdom
modifier is which is plus 1 right there
and we're gonna slap that in proficiency
bonus is gonna be plus 2 for everybody
and that's going to measure proficiency
with weapons and all these other
different things so that's plus 2 for a
first level initiative is gonna be
whatever your dexterity modifier is and
that's just going to be used to
calculate how quickly you can act
whenever you and your party are getting
prepared to attack and inspiration can
be used to increase any role so if you
needed one additional point to be able
to succeed at a role you could use your
inspiration and these get used up and
basically inspiration points are going
to be given by the DM as a reward for
being true to the personality traits
that you have defined right here and
then to finish everything off what
you're going to want to do here is come
down here where it says strength +
proficiency bro - and you're going to
take your strength modifier - plus your
proficiency bonus add that in there and
do the same exact thing for damage type
for all these different guys and now you
can see now we have all of that
information all together all in one
place and everything is all set up so
hopefully that helps you guys with both
understanding a lot of the basics of
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons as well as how to
create a custom character inside of
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons so just like always
