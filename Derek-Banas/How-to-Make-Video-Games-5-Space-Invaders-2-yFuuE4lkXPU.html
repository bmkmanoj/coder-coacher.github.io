5 of my how to make videogames tutorial
in this part of the tutorial I'm going
to finish up canvas I'm going to create
the UI so we can see our scores I'm
going to finish up the spaceship and I'm
going to cover spaceship bullets prefabs
and a whole bunch more like always all
of these sounds all of the images and
all of the code is available in a link
in the description underneath the video
and I have a lot to do so let's get into
it
ok so here we are back inside a unity
and whenever we were I was off-screen I
noticed here I have is trigger checked
I'm going to uncheck it well actually
I'm going to check it and I'm going to
show you the difference here so if I go
and play our game you're going to see
that I am able to move my spaceship whoa
what happened see whenever you have is
triggered on checks what it's going to
do is it's not going to work like a
normal collision sometimes you need is
triggered sometimes you don't I'm not
going to get into all the details but
I'm going to uncheck it for now and then
later on if we need to add that feature
in we will so I'm going to replay it and
now you're going to see the collisions
work the way that we hoped that they
would all right so we got all that set
up what I want to do now is go in here
and create the canvas so that I can put
my UI elements inside of it and to do
that you're going to go into your
hierarchy and you're going to say create
and you're going to come down to UI and
then over here to text and that's going
to create it inside of here
I'm going to select my canvas and then
I'm going to well first off I'm going to
do is I'm going to select text right
here and I'm going to change its name to
score go outside of there that's all set
then I'm going to select score and I'm
going to think about some things I want
to do here well one thing is this is
going to be the score in the game so I'm
going to change the default text to just
zeros because everybody's going to start
with a zero score I'm then going to make
this Arial bold I am going to take this
up two loops let's take it up to like 23
and size and I'm also going to center
align it and everything else there I
think looks perfectly fun now after I
set up score I'm going to be able to go
in and select canvas just select canvas
inside of there and come over
here to the inspector I'm going to
change my render mode to world space and
that just means that the canvas and all
of the UI elements are going to be on
the same level as my game I'm then going
to adjust my scale so I'm going to try
point one three and point one three to
see how that works out I'm going to get
my main camera out of the hierarchy and
drag it and drop it over here into the
event camera area and then the important
point here is I'm going to make sure
that my dynamic pixels per units are one
and zero or ten and reference pixels per
unit 100 everything looks perfectly fine
there save that I'm then going to go in
here and get my canvas and drag it down
and lay it in directly over top of where
the camera is we can zoom in here to
make sure that all that's fine it's
awful slight little bit so let's get it
in there and get it as close as possible
and there you go I think that looks
pretty good
I can then select my score and it's
actually down here at the bottom of the
screen grab that guy and I'm going to
throw it right up here above right in
the middle of the screen basically and
so that I'll be able to see it I'm going
to also change its color to white and
grab that and click right there and
there we go now we have our score all
set up as well as the canvas in general
now what I want to do is set up my
bullets and write all the code for that
and to do so we're going to go and click
on sprites inside of our assets folder
you can see right here is the bullet and
I'm going to set the bullets up as
prefabs and how you do that is you just
drag them down here drop them onto the
scene don't worry about it though make
sure that they are the proper size which
they should be let's click on bullet
here
yeah pixels per unit is 1 and also point
so that it's not going to be able re
probably going to want to scale this
though so that it's not quite so big and
yeah I think I'm going to want to shrink
it down a little bit something to come
in here and I'm just going to shrink it
down by half and then we're going to see
what that looks like on the screen there
it is a little bit smaller and I like it
a little bit better based off of my
spaceship size this is what I'm looking
at so there it is there it is ba ba ba
ba ba we're going to be adding rigid
bodies to this so that we'll be able to
move this so we're going to come over
here like this in physics 2d and
rigidbody I'm going to set my gravity
once again to zero because I don't want
that to be affected I'm going to set the
mass very very small so that doesn't
throw off any other objects it may hit
inside of my game
going to turn on my collision detection
and interpolate so that movement is
smooth and freeze rotation Z also going
to come up here dynamic and change it to
kinematic okay so everything else there
it looks great now I don't want to
bullet floating around here on the
screen they're going to appear they're
not going to be something that is going
to you know always be on the screen so
what you do in that situation is you go
and actually make this into a prefab and
how you turn it into a prefabs you just
drag it over drop it in the prefabs
folder there it is and then you delete
it from the scene and then we can make
them appear whenever we want because we
have them all saved here okay so
basically what we need to do now is go
and create a script for our bullets
so our bullets can fly so I'm just going
to select my scripts and double click on
bullet and it will open up in visual
studio and there it is right there and
you have to think about the type of
things you're going to need with your
bullet well if you're going to be moving
something you always need a speed so I'm
going to come in here and just go and
define my speed and I'm going to make
that 30 I like to have everything move
at the same rate of speed and 30 looks
pretty good on the screen I'm also going
to need access to the rigidbody so that
I will be able to move my bullets so I'm
going to get that as well and let's just
call that rigidbody with a capital B as
far as I know that's all I'm going to
need right now now in regards to
initializing the bullets whenever they
first come on the screen I need to get a
reference to the rigidbody so we can use
that so I'm going over it body is equal
to and we do that with get components
and of course you type in exactly what
you're looking for which is the
rigidbody right there and there you are
and then what I need to do then is
define exactly what the bullets are
going to do whenever they come on the
screen and how you do that as you design
you define your velocity for the bullet
when it comes on the screen so I'm just
going to go rigidbody and velocity is
equal to and what do I want my bullets
to do when they come on the screen I
want them to shoot straight up in the
air
so I can just go vector2 and up and then
multiply that times my speed and that
will define how quickly they move
upwards on our screen now what I need to
do
do I need update I can't think of any
reason I needed something to get rid of
it now what I want to do is I want to
set it up so that whenever my bullets
hit the wall they are automatically
destroyed and how I can do that is I can
go avoid on trigger enter 2d and
Collider 2d and I'm just going to call
this Co l4 Collider and then I'm going
to say if the thing that my bullet
collided with has the tag name of wall
and in the last part of the tutorial I
showed you how to set up those tag names
and do it in C in the inspector which
says tag and you created a tag called
wall and you do it so then what I'm
going to do is if it does I want to
destroy my bullet and game object is
always a reference to whatever the
object is for this class another thing I
want to do just as a safety precaution
anytime my bullets leave the screen I
want to also or the viewing area I want
them also to be destroyed and it's just
saves from a potential you know issue in
which we have bullets that are somewhere
off screen we don't see them and you
know the whole entire computer falls
apart because it runs out of memory so
let's go and always anytime a bullet is
not visible it's also destroyed in that
situation so here we'll go game object
once again and that will destroy the
bullet once again alright so I got all
that saved up now I'm going to open up
spaceship and set up spaceships so that
it'll be able to fire bullets
so let's come down here inside of my
update area and remember I set jump up
so that it would fire bullets and the
last part of the tutorial so what I want
to do here is actually create a bullet
at the position for our spaceship so how
I can do that is just go instantiate
that's going to create a bullet and what
do I want to create is all bullets
transform.position
and then after that I'm going to go in
and put in whatever the heck this thing
is called quick terry Nanyan whatever
basically what this does is it just adds
my bullets with no rotation to them so
that's what that is used for and
identity and there we are
and that is how we go and create a
bullet right where our spaceship is
and do I have all there it is so I have
to uncomment that had that in the last
part of the tutorial now I'm going to
save that jump back into unity and I'm
going to go into the prefabs section
click on bullet and I'm also going to
have to add a box Collider clearly and
that's physics 2d and box Collider 2d
and I'm going to put is trigger on there
because I am going to need it in this
situation for our bullet then I'm going
to go and create all of the different
tags that I can think of right now that
I need I have player already created
inside here so I don't need that wall is
also created and I'm also going to need
bullet someone come in here for this guy
create bullet and there is bullets so
click on save and that's good and then
I'm gonna have to create my layers
couple more layers here so click right
here
I have spaceship and wall I'm also going
to create bullet and once again these
are going to be used to handle collision
issues and to make sure that things
don't get fouled up if you have a bullet
automatically appear inside of your
spaceship it's going to cause all kinds
of issues so we want to avoid that and
to set that I'm going to come over here
to edit and project settings and physics
2d and I'm going to come down here and
anywhere that I have my bullet come in
contact with my spaceship I want to get
rid of that problem I don't I don't want
them to have collisions so there that's
all I do is uncheck that have that all
set up and let's make sure that I
actually have this set up for these guys
to click on spaceship and I have player
right here my layer also needs to be or
else it needs to be spaceship and let's
double check since I'm already here my
top wall yes I have both those set as
walls my bottom wall yes both of those
are walls my left wall it's always good
whenever you think of something don't
put it off just go and do it right
immediately okay so all those are walls
and then I have my bullet and up see
forgot to do that so let's get bullet
and let's come down here and go bullet
alright so all my layers and tags and
all that is set up and you're going to
be doing more in regards to telling
unity to avoid or ignore collisions as
the tutorial continues now I want to go
in and set my aliens well let's go and
run this here and see what happens you
can see here got a spaceship I have my
collisions working Oh
I can't fire bullets you know why
because I didn't assign them so let's go
in here to spaceship right there and if
we come down here you're going to see
where the script is it's saying that it
wants a bullet and you didn't give it
one so that's reason why bullets aren't
appearing so let's go grab a bullet and
let's drop it right in there and you can
see it's right there in the script area
and now let's run it once again see if
it fires we are up it's coming up there
but it's not shooting up in the air why
is that let's go look go and look at
bullets and we'll see what we got here
well I didn't go and get my bullets
script and drag it into the bullet area
so let's grab the bullet script drop it
inside of there save it and let's run it
again and now we can start and now you
can see the bullets are firing and on
top of that whenever they hit the top
wall they are automatically being
deleted or destroyed
alright so great a lot of progress here
now what I want to do is set up my
aliens so we're going to come in here
and I'm going to go to my sprite section
and there these guys are and these are
going to be all of our aliens so let's
just figure out which ones are going to
be which and I have alternative aliens
set up I wish is a little bit bigger let
make that bigger I can't hmm not sure
why alright so I have the I don't know
if you can see it or not but I have
alternative aliens
so puts them in here really close so I
have this alien say and then I have that
it's alternative so it's going to
basically as they go across the screen
it's going to go backwards and forwards
and I'm going to set all these up as
prefabs
just like I did previously so what I
want to do is I want to take all of
these guys and drag them over and wrap
them inside of the scene let's go and
line them up all right next to each
other so there's this guy and let's set
this is yep that's another one and four
is another one actually messed that up a
little bit what doesn't matter I'll put
down there and five there's a good
another greenie and six and that's going
to be an explosion actually let's also
set that prefab up and a seven this is
going to be when my ship explodes and an
eight and though that's the spaceship I
don't want that one so let's go just Lee
and nine there is the alternative
version of that alien and ten
there's the alternative for that alien
and 11 there's the alternative for my
green so let's zoom in here and you can
see all those different sprites that I
went and created inside of GIMP okay so
good stuff not what I want to do is I'm
going to one by one turn these into
prefabs so I'm going to select this and
I'm going to change their name as well
so let's come in there and select this
and I'm going to call this guy alien 2
and then I'm going to call this guy
whoops go and make sure I have that
selected alien 2 alternative so I'm
going to give these all different names
so this guy is going to be alien 3 and
this is going to be alien 3 alternative
and this is going to be alien 4 whoops
let's make sure I got this right okay so
that's alien - that's fine that's alien
3 okay that's alien 4 and some sitting
here typing and not looking what I'm
doing so that's alien 4 and then this is
going to be alien 5 so just change that
to 5 you can't see what I'm doing there
alright and then this is going to be an
explosion so I'm going to have this be
my alien explosion so alien explosion
and then what's this guy going to be I'm
going to change that spaceship explosion
so space ship explosion and then these
are going to be my alts so this is going
to be this alien 3 yes so I'm going to
change this to alien 3 alt and change
this to a lien for alt and then change
this to alien five vaults and that's all
those guys then I want to size all of
these guys because I made everything
half its size so I'm just going to
select every single one of these and
then over here inside of the inspector
I'm going to be able to scale them all
so I'm going to make them all point five
half of what they were but just like I
did with bullets you could say they look
much better on the screen now everything
looks like it lines up much better I'm
going to drag all these guys over in to
the prefabs area so I got that one
and I got that one and you can see they
turn blue whenever you do that there's
that that's how you can tell it's a
prefab another one and just do this with
every single one of these guys right and
drag it in there and drag that in there
and then after you have prefab versions
of all of those you can delete all of it
so let's just select all of it and
delete it and there they go they're all
gone
now what I want to do is have all my
aliens I'll be in the same area so I'm
going to go create and create empty and
I'm going to rename this guy aliens then
I'm going to come over here and I'm
going to create some new layers let's
just select this right here I'm going to
create some new tags and so forth so
this one's not going to be called aliens
I'm just creating in here so let's go
and call this alien and save that and
then let's also have a layer that is
called alien okay and all of those are
going to be set then I'm going to grab
all of my individual aliens here and
throw them into my box so I'm going to
grab this guy and then and alien 3 and
alien 4 and I'll change to their
alternative versions inside of code
whenever they move okay so I got all of
those guys inside of there and then I
want to line them up so let's just go
and select this and let's have it book
make sure we got this selection box up
here we're going to line them up on our
screen so that they can all be in like a
row that makes our column that makes
sense let's drag it over there and let's
grab this guy
drag him right there and then alien five
and let's drag him put him right there
okay all those are set up nice then
going to select all of these different
little guys we have here and I'm going
to come up and give them the same tags
Simon come in and go alien and then go
alien for that as well so we don't
forget I'm going to say any time an
alien comes in contact with an another
alien to ignore the collision sub
project settings and physics 2d like
this come over
er and go and uncheck where it says
alien touching alien don't want any
alien on alien
action going on here let's go zoom in
here and see how this looks
mmm I don't really like the way they're
lining up here let's just go and zoom in
and try to put them in there by hand so
that they look a little bit better okay
so that looks good that looks good that
looks good I think it all look pretty
good okay so I'm going to leave it like
that
and then I'm going to come in here and
select all of them once again and go and
add a rigidbody so I'm going to go add
components physics 2d and rigidbody
actually sometimes there are issues
whenever we go I'm going to go and
remove that component whenever we do
duplications so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to do my duplications
immediately right now so I have all the
aliens selected right now so I'm going
to select all of them I'm going to come
in here and right click and say
duplicate and then you got to go in here
and move these guys around a little bit
so let's put that right there
put that right there and put this right
here so that we got all of our different
aliens all stacked up inside there I'm
going to select all of them and then I'm
going to move them all over and then
have them all line up pretty well here
so that is if we go to zoom in yeah they
look like they're lined up good and we
can just let that be selected I'm going
to make all the different changes here
in a second so let's go and duplicate
that once again 2 3 4 5 everything looks
good let's go select this move them over
and I'm gonna have like 5 of these guys
I think once again what I'm just doing
is just selecting all of them clicking
duplicate grab that throw that right
there look I don't want them to be
overlapping them so let's just move this
out here
make sure there's no overlap and let's
just go in there and verify once again
that there's no overlap here this looks
pretty good just good part apart and
select this a lot of tedious sort of
moving things around but that's art I
mean it's just what or it is alright so
that's cool and select these guys whoops
I just don't like the way whenever these
are set up this way so that's why I'm
moving them around so it's going to put
three four and five like that and let's
do one more row so let's go and select
all of them and duplicate then 2 3 4 5
and then let's grab this and let's drag
them so that they are apart once again
okay so there we go we've got five rows
of aliens everything looks pretty good
alright so now what we're going to do is
select every single one of these aliens
and go and add the same components to
them so just add component physics 2d
and the very first thing I'm going to do
is add rigidbody of course so that I can
change it and move them around I'm going
to leave this as dynamic once again I'm
going to change my mass to a very small
number so that if the aliens bump into
things they don't affect whatever they
bump into gravity I'm going to set that
to zero because I don't want this
affected by gravity freeze rotation at
zero continuously you do the same thing
over and over again and interpolate I'm
also going to add a box Collider to this
so once again physics 2d box collider 2d
is trigger is not going to apply here
I'm going to leave these triggers in the
bullets for the aliens as well as for my
spaceships bullets and then I'm going to
have an alien script of course which I
already created but I didn't actually
fill in so let's go and get this drag
this down here and throw it inside of
there and now that I have all that set
up what I want to do is just click on
these aliens real quick just to see that
everything is lined up exactly the same
way sometimes you do duplications it
causes all kinds of weird things to
happen but looks like everything is good
basically I'm just verifying that all of
the components are set up exactly the
same all right great
so everything looks like it's working
good so we can close that let's go and
open up my prefab section once again
grab my alien bullet where is the alien
bullet at not there so let's go and
create it so sprites here I'm just going
to use a simple square drag it over here
drop it inside of there click on it and
I'm going to name this alien bullets
select off of there drag it over into
the prefab section and then delete it
off of my hierarchy so delete it and
alien bullets select that guy right
there leave everything exactly the same
for now click on scripts and there's the
alien bullet script drag it drop it
right there come up here click on
prefabs again alien bullets and let's
add some components to this I'm going to
click on this I'm going to add a
rigidbody of course so that I'll be able
to fire this so rigidbody 2d kinematic
on that
I'm going to freeze rotation of course
get the collisions and of course
interpolate for smoothing then going to
also add a box Collider to this so there
it is box Collider I'm going to use is
trigger on this because I want to be
able to use that method with this and I
don't need to do anything else there
then going to also get alien explosion
don't need to do anything there either
except I want to verify that I actually
have the right size for that so let's
just double check on these guys and I'm
also going to create my shield here
since I have this open so sprites I'm
just going to use the basic square again
drop that inside of there change this
the shield that is looks good let's
click on square just so make sure yes
pixels per unit one point no filter
don't want anything to be blurry going
to change the color on this though to
like a neon green so let's click on that
come over here click on neon green that
looks good everything looks good there
with the square so what I want to do is
select my shield here and just change
the color on it so I'm just going to
click on that go over here to neon green
select that and there it goes and we can
close that and the shield looks good
then we'll grab the shield throw it in
the prefabs once again drop it right
there and then delete this out of here
we'll put the shield's in later on we're
just going to let the bullets handle
what happens to shields don't need to do
anything else aside from that and then
basically I have everything set up so
that in the next part of the tutorial
I'm going to be able to write a lot of
code and finish up a good part of the
game so I think this is a pretty good
place to stop so like always please
leave your questions and comments below
