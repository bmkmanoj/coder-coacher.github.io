my job algorithms tutorial today we're
going to cover again linked lists inside
of Java if you didn't watch part one you
should definitely watch it otherwise you
may be confused and of course I have a
link to a playlist of all the tutorials
in the upper right hand corner in
today's tutorial we're going to cover
double-ended linked lists doubly linked
lists iterators and a whole bunch more
and because you guys have requested it
this tutorial is going to be almost
nothing but 100% code so let's get into
it okay so I'm basically going to create
a linked list that's going to be filled
with a bunch of neighbors inside of a
neighborhood so the very first thing I'm
going to do here is start creating the
neighbor class and I'm going to make
everything public here just so I don't
have to worry about getters and setters
so we're going to have homeowner name
and house number and then of course
because this is going to be a linked
list I'm going to have a link inside of
here to the next neighbor inside the
linked list and what the heck because I
am going to get into doubly linked lists
I'm also going to put a link to the
previous neighbor in the linked list
create myself a constructor here and
this is just simply going to get the
home owner's name passed to it and the
house number and we're going to save
those inside of there then just to keep
this very simple I'm also going to
create a display and it's just going to
output information in regards to that
information that's passed in there and
whenever it's called
it's going to print out the home owner's
name and all this code is available to
link in the description under the video
I want to play around with it and then
on top of that I'm going to define to
string inside of this and if it's called
it's just going to return the home
owner's name and that is all we're going
to need for our neighbor objects so now
let's go up to double and add linked
lists that's what we're going to be
creating first and a double-ended linked
list just has a reference to both the
first as well as the last link in the
list that is what makes it different
than the linked list we talked about
previously but of course with any
changes that we are going to be making
we are going to have to change our
methods so we're going to have the first
link and the last link stored inside of
it and then we get to insert in first
position and I'm going to jump over to a
presentation or explain exactly how that
works
okay so if I want to insert a new lame
for a new neighbor into our neighborhood
and I want to put it in the very first
position in the linked list it's really
quite simple
each one of the neighbors has a object
next and what I'm simply going to do is
take the double-ended linked list and
take the object for the new neighbor
that's going to be inserted into the
first position save that now because
we're dealing with a double-ended linked
list to first link previous and first
link of course is going to be a
reference to just another neighbor in
the neighborhood so that's the first
thing we're going to do and then the
only other thing we need to do is go and
set the value for next for our new
member inside of the neighborhood to
whatever the object is that is assigned
to first link in our double-ended linked
lists let's go write the code so we're
going to have ourselves a new neighbor
and I'm just going to call him new the
new link and so we just have to get a
new neighbor and pass homeowner name
into it
of course as well as our house number
then we need to check if there are any
items in our list so we're going to go
if is empty which I'm going to create
here in a second so if our list is
currently empty it's going to be very
easy to set this up I'm just going to go
last link for our double ended length
list is going to be equal to the new
link that was passed in here that was
just created and then after I'm done
with that I just need to assign the
reference to the previous first link
just like I previously showed you and
assign the new link to first link inside
the linked list so I'm going to go the
new link next is now going to have the
value for whatever first link is inside
of our linked list set that is new link
and then we just need to go first link
is going to be equal to the new link
that we just added to the first position
so easy enough and we are done
until we have to come back and make
couple little changes whenever we create
a doubly linked list which I'm going to
get into in a second and that brings us
to what exactly do we need to do if we
want to insert in the last position now
if we want to insert into the last
position this is going to be the guy
that we want to insert first we're going
to need to take this new link and save
it into the value of next for the
previous last object inside of our
neighbor
double-ended link list then we need to
take whatever the value for last link is
and save that inside of previous for our
new length this is the new link and then
I need to take the new link and save it
in for last link because this guy is no
longer the last link because we just
added a new element so let's write all
the code for that so we're basically
going to do the same thing here again
need to create our neighbor paste that
in there then if the linked list is
empty we're going to put our new
neighbor in the first position so we
need to check this again might as well
just copy all of this actually because
not many things are going to change so
if the link list is empty we just go
instead of last link this time we're
going to go first link and assign new
link to that else if it's not we need to
assign the last neighbor next to the new
neighbor so here we're going to go last
link next is going to be equal to the
new link that we're going to be adding
and then new link just like I said
previously previous is going to be equal
to whatever the previous last link was
so pretty simple there then we're going
to close that else statement and assign
last link equal to the new link that we
just created that's all we needed to do
there now since I'm using is empty a
whole bunch of times here I'm going to
create it and of course it's going to be
simple is empty and whatever this is
called it's just going to return
whatever the result of checking if first
link is equal to null there that is
that's all set let's actually go in here
and block off the things we haven't done
yet and let's test this guy out now if I
go into main I'm going to need to create
a new double ended linked list so I'm
just going to copy this I don't have to
type it I'm just going to call this the
length list is equal to new a blended
linked list and I don't have to do
anything with it then I can just go the
linked list and if I want to insert in
first position no problem homeowner name
here I'm going to put Mark Evans and
then just to keep it simple this house
number is going to be equal to 7 and
let's say I want to go in here and throw
a couple other random people in peers
focus and let's set that at 9 and what
the heck let's try last position as well
here I'm going to put in Doreen fig F
her set at 6 and petunia Dursley and set
her house number is 4 and then of course
it would make a lot of sense to be able
to display
all this jump down here and create a
display method real quickly and I'm just
going to go the neighbor is going to be
equal to first whatever the value of
first link is and then just take the
link and cycle through it until it's
equal to null which means I don't have
any more to go and because I already
created display for each of the
individual neighbors I can just do that
and I could go next link the link and
just call for next to print out on a
screen and then I'm just going to go the
link is going to be equal to the link
and then get the next neighbor in the
list and then let's throw another new
line in there and now because I got that
defined paste that in there and call
display on it let's execute and there
you can see the results insert in first
position that is going to be marked Evan
so there he is and then you can see
Doreen fig actually comes in last why is
that well because we inserted her in the
last position Pierce pocus pops up right
there and then insert in the first
position petunia Dursley shows up and
there she is right there so that's just
a quick run-through of exactly how all
that stuff works so now let's go make a
couple little changes to make a doubly
linked list
there's not many changes we need to make
I'm going to come up here into insert in
first position and what this is going to
allow me do or what is a doubly linked
list is unlike the linked list that
we've been using which only allow us to
go forward because they have a value
inside of next now we're also going to
be able to go backwards because we're
going to have a previous inside of it
and I already defined down inside of
neighbor previous see there's previous
so you can see there's not much to it in
regards to getting that door and now if
I want to insert in the first possession
and have everything line up it's
actually pretty easy to do right here
after we check if it is empty when we go
else and here we're going to go first
link previous is going to be equal to
the new link that we just inserted and
then of course nothing needs to change
down here so you see all I'm doing is
assigning a value to previous once again
down here inside of insert in last
position the only thing I'm going to
need to change is because the else is
there already we can just leave that the
way that it is and I can just go into
the new link right
and assigned to the value of previous
whatever the value for last link is and
that will be able to get ahold of it and
I will be able to bounce backwards and
forwards through our linked list and
that brings us down to insert after a
key so let's say we want to be able to
insert new neighbors into our
neighborhood using a specific key that
is passed over and that key is going to
be a house number well what we're going
to need to do is go in a neighbor just
like before new link is going to be
equal to new neighbor and once again
it's going to be homeowner name
nothing's going to change there and
house number two create that neighbor
object then what we're going to need to
do go current neighbor and have it
assigned to the value for first link and
all this is doing is going to make sure
that we're starting the search at the
first link inside of our linked list
then the next thing we're going to say
is while the current house number isn't
the key that we are looking for keep
looking
so we're going to go current neighbor
which is the beginning of the list right
now and we are first starting and we're
going to say while the house number is
not equal to the value of the key we are
going to keep on looking for it so here
we know it wasn't a match so we're going
to go the current neighbor is now equal
to whatever the next item in the linked
list was we're going to just simply
switch to the next neighbor and then
because of the fact that this while loop
just continues on and on and on until it
finds a match if we get to the last
neighbor without matching we want to
make sure that we can kick ourselves out
of the method altogether so we're going
to go current neighbor current neighbor
ever equals null we're going to return
false and that's going to throw us out
of the method so there's the while loop
all set up now if we make it out of the
while loop without getting thrown out of
the method we know we have a match for
the key so then we want to go if current
neighbor is equal to last link what
we're going to need to do is go the new
link next just like I was showing you
with those pictures of the little
characters that's going to now be equal
to null and last link is going to be
equal to the new link because the new
link is now the end of the list else if
it didn't match for the last link what
we're going to need to do is take next
from the neighbor that was here
previously and assign the new link to
that previous neighbor because I
the whole point of what we're doing here
we are going to insert after the key
that was entered there's the key so to
do that we're just going to go the new
link next is going to be equal to the
current neighbor next pass that in there
because it's in essence replacing it and
then we need to take current neighbor
next and get the previous value or the
previous object from that next and now
new link is going to be stored inside of
there then we're going to go the new
link previous see now that we have
previous and we can do all kinds of cool
things there in regards to organizing
we're going to assign that to current
neighbor then we're going to go current
neighbor next is of course going to be
the new link that we just created and
then of course we get down here that
means that we've found a match and we
want to return true so that's how we're
going to be able to insert based off of
a key also it shows you some neat ways
of moving around inside of a linked list
now to continue on here and show you a
couple other different things let's say
that we want to insert all of our house
numbers in order I can go a public void
insert in order and of course it's going
to get passed in a homeowners name and a
house number so I'll just copy that
paste that in there and of course just
like before create a new neighbor call
it the new blank well of course you
don't have to call it the new length
neighbor and then of course homeowner
name is going to be passed inside of
there as well as house number then what
we need to do is hold the last neighbor
searched so that we'll be able to change
its value for next if we input a new
neighbor
so means we're going to go create a
neighbor object that's going to hold our
temporary information we're going to
need here set that the null create a
current focused neighbor and it's just
going to get the value of whatever is
first link inside of our linked list and
we're going to say wow there are still
neighbors and the new house number is
greater than the current focused house
number we want to continue cycling
through these guys so go current
neighbor well it's not equal to null
which means that that would be the end
of the list and house number continues
to be greater than the current neighbors
house number because current neighbors
the only thing is going to be changing
here we want to continue searching and
we are searching we're going to be
assigned the current neighbor to the
previous neighbor where in essence just
going to be switching these guys and
then to current neighbor after we make
that change well that's going to be
equal to whatever the next object inside
of our linked list is now after we cycle
through all those guys if previous
neighbor is equal to null we're going to
need to save the new neighbor in the
first position else if we're not at the
beginning of the list gets a little bit
more complicated
not much we're just going to go previous
neighbor see what it's all we're doing
is moving nexts and lasts and all these
things around we're just switching we're
moving things into place gonna take the
value of next for that and assign new
link to it then outside of our else
statement we're going to go the new link
next is going to be equal to current
neighbor like that and then we can check
this guy out
let's go down inside of main we do a
couple things here
let's try insert in order just change
this up a little bit like that file save
and execute and there you can see even
though they were entered in a different
order 4 6 7 &amp;amp; 9 there are now in order
so that's very useful then let's say
that I want to insert myself into this
fancy neighborhood after a specific key
so I can just put self in here and then
house number 10 and then just change
this key to 4 I don't know I'm just
picking something random and execute it
and you can see right after petunia
Dursley I am now inserted into that list
so that's pretty cool
now the final thing I want to do is go
through exactly how an iterator could
work with this linked list that we
created here now as you are probably
aware an iterator is just going to
provide an easy way for us to cycle
through all the objects inside of our
linked lists and this guy is going to
have inside of it a neighbor that's
going to represent the current neighbor
and another one that's going to
represent our previous neighbor in our
linked list and then of course we're
also going to have to have double ended
linked lists and I'm just going to call
it the neighbors inside of here stored
inside of our iterator that's going to
get passed into our iterator whenever we
call our constructor for this guy and
most iterators have a has next next and
a remove method so I'm going to go
through exactly how all of those were
then we're just going to go this and
then it's going to be the neighbors is
going to be whatever was equal to the
neighbors that was passed into this guy
and then this and then we're just going
to go current neighbor is going to be
equal to going to get the information
from the linked list that was passed
inside of this and get the value of
first link and assign it to that and in
essence we're going to be doing the same
thing except we're going to be doing it
with previous neighbor and here we're
going to change this of course to last
link then if we want to define how
hasnext works which is just simply a
boolean question we're just going to go
is the current neighbor next not equal
to and all and if that comes back we're
going to go return true right like that
otherwise we return false
simple enough then if we want to get the
next value we can come in here now and
go if as next even though most of the
time you would use has next in your code
to check this but either way I'm doing
it this way just to be safe and I'm
going to go previous neighbor is going
to be equal to current neighbor and then
current neighbor I'm sure you know is
going to be whatever the objects stored
in next is equal to and then after we're
done with that we're going to go return
current neighbor pretty simple and
otherwise I'm just going to say return
null and then finally if we want to
remove objects from our linked list
using this iterator we're going to going
to go if previous neighbor is equal to
null we're just checking if we're at the
beginning of our list or not if so the
neighbors first link is going to be
equal to current neighbors next else we
can go previous neighbor next is going
to be equal to current neighbor next and
then in the situation in which we are
actually at the end of the list we want
to go current neighbor next if it's
equal to null we want to assign the
first link as the current link and to do
that you just go the neighbors first
link and previous neighbor I'm just
going to sign that tune all to show that
we are at the end of our list else we
just go current neighbor and assign it
to current neighbor next and real
quickly it's jump up here and look at
exactly what that's going to do here we
are inside of main and let's say we want
to throw a new line in there just
make sure we can separate everything out
here on a screen we're going to create a
new neighbor iterator named neighbors
new neighbor iterator and then inside of
this we're going to have to pass the
link list into it if we want to get the
first neighbor and display it just go
neighbors and then we can just go
current neighbor which is going to be
the very first guy that pops up here and
then after that display and execute and
you can see petunia Dursley is what
should come up and that is exactly what
does come up we can do a system out and
if we want to check if there's another
one in there and we're just going to
print it out on screen this time has
next and that's exactly what's going to
do is print true or false and then we
could also go neighbors and call next
which is going to switch to the next
item inside of our linked list using the
iterator we can call this guy again to
display that information on the screen
and then we could also come in here and
remove items from our linked list and
execute and there you can see a whole
bunch of things went on true yes we had
another item and there I am and so forth
and so on and what the heck let's just
come in here base that execute it again
and you can see now it skipped over
petunia Dursley skipped in here printed
my name then I hit remove which removed
me and then finally printed the next
neighbor which is Doreen fig so there is
a ton of things about link list inside
of Java
up next I'm going to be handling more
advanced sorting techniques leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
