tutorial on how to make fish pie it
sounds really really disgusting but it's
extremely good what you gonna do is
yourself five potatoes roughly of potato
size and you want to chop those up in
essence what we're doing here is we're
making mashed potatoes so this isn't
rocket science it's real simple so of
course you can have some boiling water
on your stove when you're on a boil
these for roughly about ten minutes so
you can stick a fork into them you know
it's nice potatoes no big deal okay and
while they're boiling what we're gonna
do is gonna get about 3/4 of an onion I
like to cut into sideways like this and
then downwards like this so that it'll
easily chop itself then I'm just gonna
dice all of these onions and this is
three four seven onions or broccoli
whatever you think it looks right on
your screen looks like about two cups a
cup and a half's oh my god
and you're just gonna get yourself and
carrots chop them up real nice and meaty
and then I got a nice big handful of
fresh parsley which is the last
remaining now that it's wintertime where
I live it comes out to about a half cup
that I have about six ounces of spinach
so I'm gonna just throw this in the
microwave for about a minute half and
drain off any liquid that comes out of
it and we're gonna get ourselves some
cheddar cheese it's about five ounces of
cheddar cheese and we're gonna grate
this down this is what the spinach is
gonna look like after you microwave it
you know go and throw this into a
colander squeeze out any extra water I
like to use a potato masher or something
like this so you don't burn your hands
no I got a cast on your pan here I'm
just gonna throw in a little bit of
olive oil does everything cut up I just
throw those in the pan and I'm basically
gonna stir up this onion and care it for
about four to five minutes now that the
onion is starting to look translucent
we're gonna add
one cup of heavy cream stir that up and
now but it is boiling here on the side
we're gonna add in our parsley
everything's on high stir that in then
to that we're gonna add one teaspoon of
Dijon mustard and two tablespoons of
lemon juice stir that together you turn
off the heat all together now we're
gonna be putting in our cheddar cheese
remember again five ounces and then mix
that in when the cheese is all melted
pull it completely off of there then we
get to the fish part of the fish pie
this is blue hake it's cheap really
really meaty fish you want to cut it up
into chunks right like that with a nice
sharp knife cod would also work but blue
hate if you can get it because it's so
inexpensive works best and you're gonna
take your fish and throw it into the
bottom of a earthenware pot already call
these sons and then throw the spinach on
top of that and mix them together then
you want to thank the cheese sauce that
you just made and pour it over top and
mix it up okay now to go and make the
mashed potatoes it's gonna go over clock
now here's the mashed potatoes that have
been boiling and whenever you get to the
point where you can stick your fork
through and they fall apart you know
that everything is good
well like I said make your own mashed
potatoes now this Parliament I put
myself and a couple more jugs of olive
oil and I like garlic if you don't don't
put anywhere near as much garlic in
obviously just taking big that's about
Table five and a half garlic take match
heads throw them in over top of that I
just throw it on high put in about 1/2
cup of milk and obviously Masha
nicely mash and then I just keep adding
seasoning and so I'm happy with it
hens on how you like master taste and
then add some pepper if you like pepper
and mashed potatoes and who doesn't and
I like dried oregano throw some of that
in here if you'd like it was about a
tablespoon I only use garlic powder for
mashed potatoes and love it there's a
good tablespoon of garlic powder just
stir it up again now you don't want
these mashed potatoes to be really mushy
unless you do I mean this is supposed to
be like comfort food to me I pick
partner and you get your earthenware pot
and you scoop your mashed potatoes over
top of your other little concoction see
no pie crumbs want to be even though
seal in the bottom completely then you
want to throw them in the oven at 450
for 30 minutes and after a half an hour
in the oven it's finished it looks
really good you just scoop it out and of
course try to get some fish from the
bottom it's real nice and soupy and very
very good the next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
