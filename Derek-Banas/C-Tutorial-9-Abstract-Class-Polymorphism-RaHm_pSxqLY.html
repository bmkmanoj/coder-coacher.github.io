9 of my c-sharp video tutorial in this
part of the tutorial we're going to
cover abstract classes abstract methods
based classes is as casting and a whole
bunch more about polymorphism like
always all the code is available in the
description along with the transcript of
this video and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay so I created four
classes here I have the program dot CS
of course I'm going to have shaped CS
circle dot CS and rectangle dot CS and
you know how to create those usko
project and add class now very often
you're going to want to define a class
that you do not want to instantiate and
in that case an abstract class may be
the way for you to go actually most of
the time it would be and to make a class
abstract it's very easy to say hey this
is an abstract class and that is all you
do and by instantiating I mean to create
an object of a specific class type
that's what I mean instantiating okay so
let's come in here and this is my shape
file of course and I'm going to go and
define a name property inside of here
and have it automatically generate my
getters and my setters now inside of
this I'm then going to create a whole
bunch of different types of shapes see
in this situation shape is like this
abstract thing it doesn't make sense
to instantiate it there is no such thing
as an object that is a shape it's a
vague thing which is sort of hints based
off the name and that it should be
abstract now you're also going to be
able to define non abstract methods
inside of your abstract class and what
that means is the more abstract method
is just the same as anything else so we
can come in here and we'll say virtual
and void and get info and what this
guy's going to do let's go make this
capital get info and this is just going
to print out some information on the
name that you assigned to it so we'll
just go in console and write line and
then we're going to come in
and we're just saying something like
this is a and throw in the name inside
of there just to do something really
simple and I'll do more complicated
things with it later but you're also
going to be able to come in here and
define abstract methods now in this
situation what we want to do is we want
to be able to calculate the area of any
type of shape and what that means is we
want subclasses to override this method
and to do so we are going to come in and
Mark it also as abstract and it's going
to return a double which is going to be
the area and that is all you do and you
put a semicolon at the end you don't put
it any curly brackets or nothing and
that is an abstract method that is
basically created just to be overridden
and that's all we're going to do we're
going to keep this very very simple now
I'm going to jump over to the circle
file and let's create that class all
right so if we want to come in here and
inherit from shape and get all of its
different fields and methods we just go
in and do that just like we did
previously and this is going to give me
a little error message it's going to say
circle does not implement inherited
abstract method shape area C by marking
a method as abstract that means you must
use it so we're going to go like this
and we're going to do like this and it
automatically created it for me I'm also
going to come in here however and I'm
going to create the radius which we're
going to need for our circle and let's
just come in here and generate the
getters and setters for that as well and
let's also come in and generate a
constructor so we'll go circle of course
and this is going to receive a double
which is going to be the radius and
we're going to be able to reference name
over in shape and we can just go name
like this and we know that this is going
to be a circle so we'll just put circle
inside of there and then likewise we can
also of course assign radius to whatever
they passed inside of there so there we
have that all stored now we need to come
down here into area and you see it's
going to throw this exception in the
next part of the tutorial meant to cover
exceptions in a lot more detail we're
going to do here is calculate the area
by referencing PI inside of the map
library and then we'll go math and
radius ^ - right like that and there we
were able to calculate the area you're
also going to be able to come in here
and replace a method using override of
course so we'll come in here and what I
mean by that is I'm going to come in
here - as you get info method and I'm
going to show you how to override it and
also have called base class so we're
just going to come in Bango public and
override just like you saw on previous
tutorials void and then get info we're
then going to be able to call the get
info method for our base class just like
that and then we can also come in here
and let's say that we want to add some
additional information as well so we can
do that and that can just be something
like it has a radius all and let's go
and get whatever the radius is for it
and without put all of that information
okay so that's what we're going to do a
circle we're just going to test all this
stuff to see how it works after we get
it all set up so now let's jump over
into rectangle rectangle of course is
not going to have a radius but instead
it is going to have a length and width
so we'll go and double and this is going
to be lengths and slips setter and
getter and we're going to do exactly the
same thing for width so it must copy
that and change this to width and don't
forget that we are going to be
inheriting from shape so let's go in
there and throw that inside of there and
let's spell shape correct there that is
and it's going to give me an error
message I'm going to say show potential
fixes and I'm just going to say
implement that and there's our area of
course we're going to have to create a
special constructor for our rectangle
and that's just going to be rectangle
and this of course is going to receive a
link as well as a height or a width I
mean throw that inside of there and then
let's go and assign these as well so
we'll go length is equal to the link
that was passed inside of there and then
the width is of course going to be
whatever the width was that was passed
inside of that and also we want to come
in and assign name a value and the name
is going to be rectangle like that all
right so we have the constructor all set
up and we have this guy right here the
area Salou might as well just come in
here and handle this already we'll just
go return and this is going to be length
times the width all set up and then
let's go in there and let's also replace
get info with something specific to our
rectangles and to do that we're going to
go public and override void and get info
and let's call the base for this guy's
well to have that information get
printed out and then let's print out
something that is specific to rectangles
so we'll say that the it has a length of
and we'll get the length and width of
and we'll get the width and print that
out all right so we have those all set
up now what we're going to be able to do
is jump over into program and here's
program and play around with all this
stuff and see how the abstract classes
enhances our ability to take advantage
of polymorphism now what we're going to
be able to do here is store our shapes
in a shape array as long as it contains
subclasses of shape so to do so we can
go shoot and there's our shape array and
let's just call it shapes is equal to
and it will go and create a circle and a
rectangle to do so circle and then we
will throw a 5 inside of there and then
we will go new rectangle and inside of
there we can do something like 4 and 5
so there we went and created a shape
array with a circle and a rectangle
inside of it now what we'll be able to
do is come in and cycle through these
shapes and then print on information on
them so we can say for each and shape s
in shapes and we can call the overridden
method that we have so we can say
something like get info
there that is likewise we're going to be
able to get the area so we can go
console and write line and this time I'm
not going to use stringent or interpol
iation i'm going to come in and just do
this and area that's going to put the
name there and then i'm going to put in
the actual area and i want this just to
be two decimal places in length just to
keep it nice and simple and then from
that I can go s and get the name and
then likewise I can go s and get our
area and remember it's methods we have
to put that there the parentheses okay
so we got some good information going on
here and I spelled shape wrong again
what is wrong with me there we are now
that's fixed the things kind of neat is
you're going to be able to use the
keyword as to check if an object is of a
specific type so let's come in here and
we'll go circle test circ is equal to s
as circle and it's either going to get a
value or it is not going to get a value
based off of that what we can do is then
after this is say if test circ is equal
to null in this situation then we know
that this isn't a circle so we'll
console.writeline and then we'll just do
a simple message like this isn't a
circle likewise there is another keyword
and that keyword is is and we can do
something like if s is a circle and in
this situation we can come in and I'll
put some information on our screen and
in that situation we're going to put
this isms a rectangle just to do
something different and just to add a
little bit of flavor here let's go and
copy this as well so that this looks a
little bit nicer throw a new line in
there after that output and it's also
important to know that you're going to
be able to store any class as a base
type and on top of that you're going to
be able to call the subclass
methods even if they don't exist in the
base but what you're going to have to do
is cast what I mean lines let's go and
use the most base type which is object
which is what everything comes from and
we'll be able to come in here and let's
just go to Cirque one and let's create a
circle now this normally would not work
because we can only normally ever call
functions or methods or whatever that
exists inside of the base type in this
situation however if you know that this
is a circle you can cast and make it
work how you can do that is just go
circle and search two is equal to and
then cast it into being a circle and it
will go sir one like that and here
you're going to be able to see that
indeed that is going to work for us and
here we can just say the area is and
let's make this only two decimal places
just like we did before
and then after that we can go circ to
name and then circ two and we will call
the area function and then after we do
that we can run this and we can test
that everything is working and start and
you're going to see that went in there
said this is a circle and you're going
to be able to see if we move this out of
the way right here where we are calling
get info and the get info woods actually
let's go in here look at this
here's get info it called the base which
is actually the shape area the shape
version of get info and it printed out
the name and then likewise it has a
radius of five where did that come from
I came from this guy it has a radius of
five we then called the area and it
properly calculated that now putted it
and we then used is and as to figure out
if they were rectangles or if they were
circles and then finally we also came in
here and calculated the circle area even
though it was originally saved as a
object type and that guy is right here
say we say this is an object and then
through the use of casting we were still
able to call the proper method alright
so there's a rough overview of abstract
classes abstract
methods and how we can cast and another
deeper look at polymorphism as well as
casting and a whole bunch of other
different things and like always please
leave your questions and comments below
