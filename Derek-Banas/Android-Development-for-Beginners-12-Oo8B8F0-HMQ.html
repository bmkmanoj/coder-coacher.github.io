12 my android development for beginners
tutorial today what we're going to do is
take the weather app that we previously
built in Inkscape and move it over into
App Inventor so I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay so here what I
did was I actually took the weather app
that we've been working on and by the
way if you haven't seen part 11 you
should pretty much have to watch
otherwise this is just not going to make
any sense to you now basically what I
did here was I pulled out rulers and I
opened this up in Illustrator mainly
because it's easier for me to present
this to an illustrator it doesn't have
anything against Inkscape and you can
see right here I just pulled out rulers
and I set them up to be on the edges of
all of our components so you can see
right there that's going to be where
we're going to be able to search for
cities this is going to be our
magnifying glass right here 10:00 is
going to represent a margin and just
understand that these numbers are not
going to be exact
but they're going to be off by a couple
pixels at most and then what we're going
to do we're just going to measure out so
this is going to be 22 pixels right
there and this is going to be 17 pixels
and this space in here is going to fill
parent but it's going to be 12 pixels
high this is going to be 14 pixels high
and also fill parent and then I have to
go through all the individual pieces
inside of here now to start off with
this interface I'm just going to use
dummy numbers I'm not going to use exact
numbers so 37 is just going to be 37 and
I'll worry about doing the updating with
the temperature information and all that
later remember I just want to
incremental e do this so what I'm going
to do here is I'm going to get this
little tool here which Inkscape doesn't
have I showed you a workaround with it
but either way and for this cloud here
I'm going to go from here and just
measure it down to here at the very
bottom of it then I can come over here
and see that that is ninety five point
eight nine so I'm basically just going
to say that that's going to be 96 again
this is a judgement call as well don't
know if you can see that or not and then
whenever we measure from this part right
here you can see I actually wrote in 107
that is going to work out to 107 so
let's just use this as an example right
here for what we're going to do next
so 107 across and let's say 97 pixels
down is going to enclose
that whole entire cloud basically what
I'm going to do now is just come in here
and select all that and then jump over
into a program like GIMP or like
Photoshop and zoom in on this and there
is our cloud and we are just going to
paste that on a transparent background
and save it as a ping in this situation
I called it rain dot ping all right and
then we can jump over into App Inventor
because I think you get the gist of this
I don't need to go through all these
different parts I'll include the vector
art as well as the finished art in a
link in the description underneath this
video but that's basically all I do I
just pull these rulers out and I measure
how much space they take up and then I
go and put a graphical representation
over and save it as a transparent ping
file that's it now let's jump into App
Inventor and take a look at how we
assemble all of this inside of App
Inventor alright so here we are inside
of App Inventor and I already have the
transparent paying that I have right
there I'm just going to go in here and
save some time I'm going to upload file
and I'm going to go and get all my
images and you can see here inside this
folder I have all the individual images
all saved so what I'm going to do is
just go in here and start getting them
and uploading them inside of App
Inventor I just find it easier just to
do this in the beginning and now you can
see cloudy days down there click on
upload file you cannot upload more than
one of these at a time sadly enough so
hopefully someday they fix that cloudy
night upload another file dewpoint which
you're going to be able to see better
here in a second and then just keep
uploading these files until we have all
of our graphical files inside of App
Inventor ok and I got all that set up
and here is every single transparent
thing I created now before I go on I
want to jump back over into Photoshop
and make sure this is completely
understandable so here is the cloud and
the rain whenever I create this guy and
when I go file new like that I'm going
to want to make sure that I set the
pixels and the height for the right
sizes because like I said I come into
this guy and go into image size you're
going to see that it's 107 by 96 exactly
the same as I showed you an illustrator
and that's going to be very important to
make sure
that we can keep our file sizes to a
minimum and also keep our images clear
so I just want to make sure that you
knew that valued was doing that so now
to start off basically what I want to do
is I want to put in a little text box in
here where they can enter that
information as well as our magnifying
lens so I'm just going to do this step
by step so that means inside of App
Inventor I am going to come over here
and go to layout and I'm going to get
myself a horizontal arrangement drag it
over here drop it right there and then
inside of it I want to first put some
padding and in this tutorial I want to
show you a whole bunch of different ways
to use padding I'm going to show you how
to use a ping to use padding I'm going
to show you how to use just an empty
image do you do padding but for this
first part I'm going to use a
transparent padding which is actually
going to be an image but first I want to
do with the horizontal arrangement I
have right here is come over here to
width and change this to fill parent and
say okay I'm not going to worry about
messing with the height or any of those
other different things and then inside
of it I'm going to put some padding in
and like I said this is something you
have to play with the work that we did
in the vector or tool is going to give
us rough numbers like I said they're
going to be off by a pixel here or pixel
there for the most part they're going to
be very accurate but just understand
they won't be perfect and you will have
to play around this stuff alright so
after I thought about it for a little
bit I decided that my padding for this
guy should be 15 pixels in width and for
height 22 pixels again I had these
pretty much exactly in the vector art I
did have 22 pixels but I had 17 and I
later changed out to 15 just because of
the way it looks I'm just going to go
into picture right like this and I'm
gonna go transparent Ping right like
that like I said I'm going to put a
compressed folder that's going to have
all those images for you in the
description but there you go so I put
the padding inside of there well then
what do I need well I need a text box so
that they can enter their city name so
I'm just going to grab a text box out of
here
drag it up here drop it inside of there
and then this I had to fiddle with quite
a bit to get the width and the height
right on it but if you're making this
it's going to work perfectly fine first
for the text inside of it I'm going to
put enter City also you're probably
going to have to play around with font
size I
eventually decided on eleven for my font
size it fit nice and snug inside of
there I'm going to rename this while I'm
here - there we go City textbox very
important to have your names actually
mean something go okay and inside the
vector art tool I had this set for 256
pixels for my width and that ended up
working perfectly so I'm going to say
okay on that and for my height I'm going
to set that to 30 pixels so I think you
can see how important it is to do that
in a vector art because it's very easy
to do it here now after I have all that
work done now I'm going to get myself a
button over here and I'm going to put my
magnifying lens on that just drop it
inside of there come over here and
rename it now just so I don't forget and
I'm going to call this search button
because that makes a lot of sense there
we go
come over here I'm just going to let all
these things be the way that they are
except when I get down here to image I'm
going to want to use my search button
for the image and there it is search
button paying click OK don't want any
text on it got rid of that and then come
down here for my width and set that 37
exactly like I had for the vector art
tool and change this to 30 okay and very
often it's going to run off inside of
this emulated sort of version of your
device but in the real world it won't
and of course you can check it just by
going connect an AI companion and
looking at your device or opening up the
emulator and if I open up illustrator
again you're going to see right here 37
for the width and over here it's 22 I
think the 22 change but 37 didn't and
sure enough it's that's exactly right
there are 37 pixels ended up working out
well but as I moved from the vector art
over into App Inventor I realized this
couldn't be 22 pixels I had to be 30 so
that's perfectly fine so there we got
our first row done now what's next well
Pittsburgh I want to have it on its own
line because we never know how long the
city names going to be so that's just
going to be fill parent and that's going
to be very easy to do
over into App Inventor again but the
very first thing I want to do here is to
put like a margin or padding between so
I'm going to go into a layout again I'm
going to go horizontal arrangement drag
that over here drop it inside of there
I'm over here I'm going to say fill
parent for my width fill parent and then
for the heights I'm going to change this
to 4 pixels see I didn't have to use a
transparent pink file or anything and
that's going to work perfectly for my
little margin that I want inside of
there then I'm going to have to make
room for my city name as well as the
margin don't forget that and we're just
going to go in here grab another
horizontal arrangement drag it drop it
right there
here I'll use an image again transparent
ping file drop that right there come
over inside of this make the horizontal
arrangement fill parent fill parent
there we go and if we look at this it's
saying that should be 14 and height
inside of appinventor i decided that the
height made more sense of 22 again
you're going to have to fiddle with
these things but after you do it for a
while to get pretty easy then for my
image which is just going to be a margin
I'm going to come over here and I'm
going to change my width to 15 just like
I did above I want the margins to be
consistent leave the height be automatic
and for the picture I'm going to make it
transparent paying again ok there we go
now I'm going to have to put the city
name inside of this so come over here
just get a label drag it over here drop
it in there can I have to change the
phone of course because it looks
different I'm down here I'm going to
rename this to city name label city name
label ok and again after playing around
with it for a little bit I thought the
font size look good at 20 so let's
increase that let's give it some default
text this Pittsburgh there we go the
width is going to be fill parent because
I wanted to be able to fill out the
whole entire area and the height is
going to be 22 just like the other
component okay and we take a look at it
there we go we'll worry about changing
the colors later on might actually want
this to be bold as well so let's change
that to bold and there we go it's
looking pretty good
once again forget about the color so
I'll fix that later then I'm going to
need another margin so go into layout
again get another horizontal arrangement
drop it inside of there
over here width is going to be fill
parent okay I'm gonna leave the height
is automatic and inside of this I'm
going to just go over inside of
illustrator and look at this this is the
part I'm going to be working
right now this guy right here it's going
to be these numbers and so forth as well
as this cloud these are going to be in a
table format so go and user interface
grab an image drop it inside of there
like I said before you don't need a
transparent ping inside of there so I'm
just going to leave this as none right
there is what I'm referring to
I'm going to make my width 15 and then
click on OK let height be automatic and
there's our margin now I want to stack
these guys look at this just so we
remember I want to put 37 here and then
I want to put chance of rain underneath
of it so I'm going to use a table
arrangement this time grab this drop it
inside of there and then for this table
arrangement I'm going to have one column
and two rows that works out great and
I'm going to make the width 167 and I'm
going to make that 167 because the
vector art tool I have here told me to
let's go in here just measure it to make
sure and I'm going to have this go the
whole way over and butt up against this
image right here take up as much space
as possible and then the vector our tool
came out to 170 so I just shaved off a
little bit no big deal then I'm just
going to have to get myself two labels
that are going to represent first the
temperature and secondly the current
weather conditions you can see that
these are broken into two rows drop that
right there and this is going to be my
temperature so I'm just going to rename
it right now let's call it current temp
label okay change the font size on this
too big because it is big 248 and then
the text inside of this is going to be
37 and on Macs you hold down option and
K to draw a degree I'm sorry but I don't
know how to do that and other things but
you can look that up it's no big deal
and then I have to get my weather
description well I'm also yeah if I
click out of there there are you going
to see the temperature looks good get
another label that's going to be the
current weather conditions drop that
inside of there over here rename it and
this is going to be current weather
label I mean here change my font size to
16 and my text to chance of rain now
let's go and look and see what that
looks like looks pretty good and now I
can get my large weather image and place
it inside of there I'm going to go and
get another layout this is going to be a
horizontal arrangement yes you can put
these layouts inside of layouts there
that is change it to 107 pixels for my
width because that's what my vector art
told told me it should be and then I'm
going to get myself an image and drop it
in their user interface image drop it
right there and then I'm going to get my
rain
so where's rain there's rain look okay
and there you can see it's placed inside
of there also going to click on this
table arrangement and change this width
right here 167 and there you can see
everything is looking perfect now okay
now I'm going to put some padding inside
of this so just grab a layout coming
over here grab a horizontal arrangement
drop it right underneath there come over
here and I'm going to change my width to
fill parent okay and my height is going
to be 6 pixels and there we go
go to margin again alright so the next
thing I need to do is put in this big
text area here so I'll be able to grab
information on current weather and
display these four lines of text so I'm
going to get another horizontal
arrangement drag it over here drop it
right there I'm gonna get myself a
margin user interface grab an image drop
it inside of there like I said before we
don't need to do anything or put a
transparent pin inside of there if we
don't want to set my width on this guy
to 15 pixels just like I have every
other time leave everything else be the
same and then I'm going to make this be
a label just like before drop it inside
of there I'm going to rename this guy
current weather report label very
descriptive over here I'm going to let
the font size be 14 and then I'm gonna
come down here and have my width V fill
parent and I'm just going to put
something like current weather or
actually you know what what's even
better than that I'll jump over inside
of here and I'll just copy and paste
exactly what this is so we'll have a
good understanding of what we're working
with paste that in there I paste that
into the text area and boom there you
can see it's all right there and like I
said don't worry about what it looks
like inside of App Inventor things
change whenever you actually emulate
them or show them differently and then
I'm going to get myself another layout
this is going to be another margin grab
this drop it right there
come over here change its width fill
parent height again is going to be 6
pixels just like I've used a whole bunch
other times then you can see inside of
here I have a bar that goes across this
blue bar so let's go and create that
inside of here so I'm going to go and
get myself another or
arrangement drug that there get myself
another image drag that down there I'm
going to have a margin just like before
make sure you trap it in the right one
come inside of here and for the
horizontal arrangement I'm going to make
sure that because this is a bar that I
know I want to have it be 10 pixels high
I'm going to define inside of here for
the height so this is going to be 10
pixels and that's with the horizontal
arrangement once again and I'll have my
width be fill parent just like before
select my image inside of here and have
the width on this be 15 pixels and
everything else can stay the same and
then I'm actually going to use a label
and in the next part of the tutorial I'm
going to make it blue so I'm just going
to grab label I'm going to change its
black around color to blue when
everything's initialized and then I
measured this out in my vector art tool
I'm going to let the font size be 14
doesn't matter I'm going to get rid of
this text because then end up being blue
and so I can have text it's just a
dividing line and I'm going to have my
width in this guy be 290 pixels and have
my height be 4 pixels like I said it's
weird to use a label as a line but in
the next part of the tutorial I'll show
you how to set that up then we're gonna
get ourselves another margin just go
into layout again horizontal arrangement
drop it right there with fill parent
height 6 pixels and now comes the big
guy which is going to be this right here
now if we count this out this is going
to be for the margin so that's going to
be this is going to be a table out this
is going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 I'm going to
measure from the drop right up to this
number the number is going to be 7 and
whenever it's all said and done I'm
going to have 13 columns with one row to
create this guy right here let's jump
over an app inventor and start playing
around with that so I'm going to use a
table arrangement for this because I'm
gonna have a whole bunch of columns and
it's going to have 13 columns and one
row and its width is going to be fill
parent ok then what am I going to need
well I'm going to need an image in the
very first part that's going to act as a
margin image drag it down here drop it
right there and the width is all that's
going to matter so I'm going to give it
a width of 22 pixels there we go then
I'm going to need another this is going
to represent the low temperature it's
going to be an image drag it over here
drop it inside and come up here picture
and look for low temp there it is got it
come over and look here you can see
there's low temp right there and I'm
just going to make sure that the width
is 12 pixels exactly like my vector art
tool told me and then I'm going to have
to have a dividing line between the
image and the actual low temperature so
if we look at this see right here have
the margin there's the image and then I
want to have a margin inside of this and
then the actual number right after that
so just come over here grab this label
drop it right there and it's going to
act as a margin so I don't want any text
inside of it and I know that I want its
width to be 19 pixels so 19 okay now I
can put the actual low-temp see it's
just acting like a margin just like this
is now I can get a real label drop it
inside of there and this guy is going to
represent the current low temperature so
let's just make this 19 degrees with a
degree there for size 14 is going to be
perfectly fine and the width is going to
be 43 just like it showed inside of the
vector art tool 43 okay let's go back in
the vector art ol just to make sure say
right here
43 so that's how I figured out those
numbers jump back and now I'm going to
have dew point inside of here so I need
another image drag the image over drop
it right there I'm up here to the
picture area look for dew point there's
dew point click on OK I know that I want
the width for this to be 12 pixels click
OK and there we go now the dew points
inside of there now what I'm going to
need to do I'm going to have to put
another mortgage in between the dew
point and the actual number so grab
another label drag it over here I know
it might seem weird to use a label as a
margin but that's what I'm doing and
then have this be a width of 19 pixels
because that's what I worked out in my
vector tool also probably a good idea
because I'm gonna have to be changing
this temperature right here I'm gonna
give it a good name I don't really worry
about giving the labels a good name
because you know with what are you going
to name them this is going to be current
low label that's fine alright so I have
that divider inside of there I'm going
to get another label and this is going
to actually have the dew point inside of
it this get rid of that I'm just going
to change this to 22 just as a generic
junkie number font size 14 that's
perfectly fine and the width in this
situation is going to be 36 click OK and
there you can see have the low and the
dew point let's see if this is still 22
over here up there you can see right
there 36 is what I meant yes so that is
still 36 so as you can see I'm working
directly off the vector tool and also
it's very important to understand that I
am using the label that's going to
contain the dew point or the temperature
in this situation I'm increasing the
width on those larger than what is
needed to space out everything and
that's just something I do I don't know
if that's something that everybody does
just works for me for doing interfaces
drag another image down here this is
going to be windchill picture windchill
where is that windchill
there's windchill right there okay give
this a good name also rename just have
it be current dew point label and then
from a windchill when I give that a
width of 17 because that's what we
worked out before put another label in
here for spacing reasons and no other
reason aside from that and that's going
to be 20 pixels for the width there we
go
grab another label over here rag it over
here and this is going to represent
windchill as well give it a good name
now so I don't forget current windchill
label here font size 14 is fine for this
get rid of that change this to 27 come
down here and like I said dynamically
will change all those things later on I
mean here from a width change that to 37
everything else is fine then we need to
put in our final image which is going to
be visibility grab another image drag it
over here drop it next to this over
there go get myself a picture it's going
to be visibility it's going to be the
name where's visibility there's
visibility click OK change the width to
20 pixels put in another label to act as
margin between the visibility here get
rid of that change its width to 10
pixels okay and then the final label
which is going to represent whatever the
visibility actually is make sure you fit
it in there right there goes let's
rename it the current visibility label
there we go okay give it a text of 7.00
and a width of 42 and there you go
you're all done your homework what you
need to do is go in and do the second
row exactly like I did right there and
then you
able to do it what I mean by second row
is this you'll put that in there and
then also put in a another dividing line
and it will worry about this stuff down
here later like I said I have all this
work already done for you changed from
vector art into regular pinging files if
you want that it's available in a link
in the description please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
