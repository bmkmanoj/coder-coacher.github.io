3 of my MongoDB tutorial in this part of
the tutorial we're gonna cover indexing
as well as aggregations if you haven't
watched the previous parts of this
tutorial you absolutely have to
otherwise you'll be quite confused
because in part one I covered setup as
well as introduction a MongoDB and in
part two I covered inserting removing
updating and querying in MongoDB and I
provide links to those in the
description underneath the video so I
have a lot to do so let's get into it ok
so the very first thing I'm gonna do is
I'm going to start up my server over in
one tab and everything's the same on Mac
or on Windows so feel free to do
whatever and there is my Mongo shell
first I'm gonna do is I'm gonna switch
over to my test database and just in the
situations in which I have any
collections inside of here I want to
drop all those I didn't so there we are
now we can jump in now basically
indexing a database is like creating an
index for a book this is just gonna make
it quite quicker to look up data and
what I'm gonna do here is I'm going to
create a large set of documents and then
I'm going to analyze the execution
differences between documents that are
indexed versus documents that are not
indexed so we can go and write some
JavaScript directly inside of here so
what I'm gonna have this do is I'm gonna
generate 500,000 documents and I'm gonna
make each one of those unique so for and
we can come in here and run insert just
like anything else we were doing here
inside of the shell and I'm going to
create an account and like I said all
the accounts are going to be unique so
I'm gonna give each one account followed
by increment whatever the value of I
would be in this situation and I'm also
going to give them a randomized age for
each person in the accounts gonna call
math.floor and then random and let's say
that the maximum age is going to be 90
for all of these fictitious accounts and
I just have to close the for loop and
execute and this can take up to a minute
depending upon how fast your computer is
so you just have to sit here and wait
for it to finish loading okay so we have
our 500,000 documents loaded inside of
our test DB collection
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
issue a query on this SD B and find and
specifically what I want to find is
every person who has an account here who
is of the age of 50 and I'll be able to
analyze the performance of this query by
calling explain and then execution stats
there we go when we loaded that up we
can see here that the execution time in
milliseconds was 130 doesn't sound like
much but believe me it's a lot whenever
you're running a database that's getting
a lot of hits and also we can see right
here total number of documents examined
came out as 500,000 so it had to search
through all 500,000 different accounts
to find the matches in which we equalled
the age of 50 for the accounts not very
good so what we are gonna do now is
we're gonna create a compound index
that's going to be based on first the
age and then the account and to do so we
come in here and then we go test DB for
our collection and we're gonna call
ensure index and like I said we're going
to focus in on the age for our index
here and then secondly we are going to
focus in on the account now we're gonna
start with the age because we plan on
querying for age so that's what is very
important here and it's very important
to remember that indexing should be
based on improving the performances of
whatever queries you plan on issuing and
we just hit enter and that just takes a
couple seconds and it's all loaded now
let's jump in here and let's run the
exact same query we used before so we're
searching for everybody who is the age
of 50 inside of here see that loaded
very quickly if we come up inside here
execution time in milliseconds came back
as zero can also come up inside of here
and we can see total documents examined
comes back as 5432
so considerably better instead of
searching through 500,000 documents we
just searched for 5432
and it took 0 milliseconds to get our
results and the reason why this query is
quicker is mainly because we were able
to search directly for the age of 50 and
then ignore everything else another
thing that's important there's tons of
information here you can look up what
all this stuff does but if you want to
see the actual
name that we have set for it it set as
age one and a count one with little
underscores underneath of it another
thing that's important to know is
cardinality is a jargon term which
basically just defines the number of
distinct values a field may have now as
we saw a second ago we are going to have
well let's just bring up the query right
here now if we are inserting we can see
here our accounts are all going to be
unique for every single account and age
however is not going to be unique
likewise we could think of gender for an
example which would be either male or
female but there's only one or another
and that basically means that would if
we were going to issue an index on
gender that it's going to have a low
cardinality on the other hand if we were
going to issue an index on say an email
which would be different for every
single user in that situation we would
have a high cardinality so in our
example that we have here the accounts
have a high cardinality because
everything is different however age is
going to have a low cardinality because
it is very possible for multiple
different accounts as we saw right here
to have exactly the same age it's also
important to understand that the higher
the cardinality the more valuable and
index on that field would be however are
basing indexes purely on grouping to
improve queries is most important of
course like we said before another
command that we can use here that can be
very useful if we have multiple
different indexes set up is get indexes
if we at that we could see it again age
one and a count one and another thing
that's important is that indexes are
more useful whenever you're going to be
returning a small subset of the data and
less so whenever you're receiving a
larger percentage so it's very important
to understand that so why don't we come
in here and drop this index and look at
some other different indexes that we can
use so we can go to DB and to drop the
index we just call drop index and then
we paste inside of there the indexes
name and that index has been draw now
I've been talking poorly about how
indexing unique values isn't necessarily
a good way to go however indexing
something that is unique to each
document can be helpful if you use
limits like we talked about in the last
part of the tutorial and the reason why
is it's going to avoid searching further
after a certain limit
been reached so I don't we go and take a
look at exactly how that would work
issue another find on this and in this
situation search for account however
what we're going to be looking for is a
count one hundred you may be surprised
by the result here and I'm gonna call
explain and execution stats once again
and we'll issue that you can see here
number of times or milliseconds it took
was one hundred however it searched
through five hundred thousand of our
documents to find those results that's
bad so what we can simply do other than
using a limit to limit the number of
results we search for is we can come
through and tell our querying engine
that our accounts are all going to be
unique so it should be able to take
advantage of that and to do that we're
going to use in short index once again
create a new type of index and we're
going to be indexing just account and
then we're going to say that all of the
accounts are going to be true or all the
uniqueness of all the accounts is indeed
true so it would be able to rely on that
create those indexes and now let's go
and issue that quarry we had before to
find account 100 you could see execution
time in milliseconds once again went
down to zero can also see total
documents examined went down to one and
everything is hunky-dory and wonderful
another thing we do when we come in here
and let's drop the index which was just
set as account one there it is got rid
of it now let's say that we wanted to
come in here and once again index all of
our accounts however in this situation
we are not 100% sure that there won't be
any account names that are duplicated
however we are more than willing to drop
any duplications can we do that yes we
can't so we're going to use and short
index just like we did previously and
we're also going to say that everything
is unique even though we're not our sent
positive that everything is unique and
in situations in which they are not
unique we're going to say that we want
to drop our duplicates that's what that
stands for there we go and now we can go
in and index everything and drop any
duplications that might come up if you
don't have dropped duplicates in there
it's not going to let you perform that
ducks and let's go in there and drop
that once again count one is what we're
using and let's cover another situation
in other situations you may want to
index a field name however you're not
harm percent positive that some of those
might not have a null value which is
actually something that could occur very
often so what we're going to do is we
are going to ignore those and index
anyway just come in here once again and
go account one and then we're gonna go
unique just like we did previously and
then we're going to use the sparse
command and that's going to eliminate
situations in which we have null values
in the account field and you could say
it's going to index that as well
so that's the basics of indexing so what
we're going to do now is jump over and
take a look at aggregations now the very
first thing I want to do is come in here
and drop all of the different
collections or documents that we have in
our test DB collection so drop all those
and let's go and throw in a whole bunch
of new documents okay so what I have
here are just a whole bunch of recipes
so we have our recipe name we're gonna
have an author Sally Smith in this
situation we're gonna have the number of
likes and dislikes that recipe is
received the type that we're going to
categorize the recipe under and the date
that it was posted so it's going through
all those inside of there now we'll be
able to query them and basically what's
great about aggregations is they're
going to allow us to perform operations
on multiple different documents as
you're gonna say so let's say that I
wanted to go through all of the recipes
that were uploaded and I wanted to group
everything based off of first the
author's name and then afterwards the
total number of recipes that they have
contributed to do so I'm gonna call the
test DB collection and I'm gonna call
agregate and I want to group this
information so I am going to call group
and then I have to designate how I want
this information to be grouped so I want
the authors then I'm going to create a
new field and I'm just gonna call this
num recipes and what this is going to do
is sum up the total number of recipes
contributed by each of the authors close
that off
and there we are and here you can say
there's a list of all the different
authors and the total number of recipes
that they went and contributed to our
database it's a pretty useful we're
gonna do a whole bunch more that get
even more useful we could also come in
here and sort our results from lowest to
highest let's just call that again
aggregate and right after the some part
I'm going to come in and I'm gonna say
that I wanted this to be sorted and how
I want them to be sorted is based off of
and the number of recipes that were
kurtter bearded and we're putting
negative one inside of there close both
those off and boom you can see that it
went from highest to lowest if you
wanted it to go from lowest to highest
you would just change that to one
instead of negative one another thing we
can do you do all sorts of different
sorts let's just come in here let's say
that we wanted to sort everything based
off of the total number of likes now we
could just change this to number of
likes and then come over to the some
part and change that from one two likes
and as you do more and more of these
it's gonna make more and more sense in
regards to what's going on here so
number of likes and you can see here
sorted from lowest to highest number of
likes Sally Smith is the most popular
and there's many different operations we
could perform we're not just stuck with
some let's come in here and get rid of
some let's say that we wanted to do the
average number of likes average leave
likes exactly the same as it is right
there then sort based off of the number
of likes and you can see right there
performed all those operations to get
the average so while Sally Smith did get
the most number of likes you can see her
her average is actually below Sam Smith
so just provide some random data I don't
know likewise we could also come in here
and get the minimum number of likes
versus all the different recipes and we
just go testdb aggragate again this is
going to be another group and get our
authors and then the next guy is gonna
be num of likes and we're gonna say that
we want the minimum number of likes
close that off and then let's also come
in and sort this based off of num of
likes and then close off all our
brackets and execute and you can see
right there is a listing based off of
the minimum number of likes another
thing will be useful is to get the
maximum number of likes versus all the
recipes once
again another grouping designate how we
want this to be grouped again based off
of the author num of likes and in this
situation we want the max for the likes
and let's come in and sort them based
off the number of likes close that off
and then why don't we just show you
another thing you could also come in and
limit the results let's say that we just
wanted the top three and execute you can
see back
Sam Smith Sally Smith Paul Smith and the
number of likes that came back with
those guys now there are other commands
other than just group we can also use
match and match is gonna be used to
filter out documents that don't match
the condition so let's say that we want
to match only Latin recipes that are
entered inside of here we'll use match
instead of group and specifically what
we want to match for is a type that
matches with Latin we can also come in
and use group once again and match for
author and let's say we want the total
number of recipes and we want to output
the total number of Latin recipes for
each author use sum and one and you can
see right there the total number of
Latin recipes for each of the authors
inside of our little database another
command we can use is project and
projects gonna provide fields from sub
documents and it also is gonna allow us
to rename fields if we'd like so here
let's say we want to get a list of
recipes using the name recipe instead of
meaning uppercase recipe versus
lowercase recipe we can do that and
let's say we don't care about the ID
being returned to us you can see right
there we got a total list of all of our
different recipes we have inside of our
database we could also come in and add
likes as well as dislikes to chart
something like strong impressions also
going to use project here so let's
change this to strong impressions and
here we're just going to simply add our
likes as well as our dislikes and we can
put in as many values you need one here
you don't have to stick to just two and
here let's say that we don't want our ID
returned and there you can see the total
number of strong impressions that each
of those got each
the recipes likewise we could also come
in and subtract our likes from our
dislikes and instead of add we're just
gonna type in subtract here and run that
and you can see the results there and
just for the heck of it I'll come in
you could also multiply even though this
isn't gonna make any sense but let's
just do it
you can also multiply values right like
that you can see they got quite big and
also we would have the option to come in
and divide them which would make even
less sense but it's nice to know that
you can perform these different
mathematical operations here so there's
divide now let's do something a little
bit more useful you're also going to be
able to extract date information such as
month year week day of month day of week
day of year as well as hour minute and
second just type out the whole entire
word here I'll show you an example so at
stp again aggregate and you're going to
use project here as well say we want to
say a month posted to get the month just
put a dollar sign and month inside of
there and we're gonna take this from
date posted which is a value inside of
our documents and then let's say that we
wanted to list our recipes however we do
not care about our IDs close that off
and there you can say both a listing of
all the recipes as well as the month
that they were posted you're also going
to be able to use a whole bunch of
string operations so let's go and create
a couple of those so aggragate once
again we're going to be using project
and let's put type and let's say we want
to list each recipe type using a
substring of the type so let's just say
we want the first three characters just
as an abbreviation we call substring on
that and if we want the first three
characters they're all going to be 0
index we have to come in here and we
will say 0 as well as 3 and here we'll
just say that we do not want the ID to
come back and you can say there's all
the recipes and the types of each of
those recipe types another string
function it's available is concat so
let's go test DB aggregate let's make
this a little bit neater here let's go
project and title and I'm going to
combine the recipe with the author's
name
make a little title and I just go concat
like this and then follow that up with
all the different things that I want to
concatenate or combined and why don't I
also come in here and show you to upper
exactly how that would work so it's
going to make everything in between the
brackets after to upper in
capitalization so basically whatever you
want capitalized you're gonna put it in
between this bracket right here well I
want to put recipe inside of there for
example and there you go the recipe is
going to be an upper case letters and
then I just put everything I also wanted
to concatenate inside here I could throw
random strings inside of there it
doesn't matter and then finally I want
the author to show up inside of there
and I just need to close down the title
part and then after that I can say that
I don't want the ID to show so it's
going to give me a list of all the
different reference P's and uppercase
letters followed by the word by and the
author's name there you can say is
exactly what it did we can also receive
different output based off of conditions
so project and I'm going to put all this
underscore and then if I want to issue a
condition I can go condition and I can
throw a condition directly inside of
here so I can say greater than and then
after that if my likes are greater than
200 then I'm gonna say the value of
score is going to be equal to great else
I'm going to say that the score is going
to be okay
just to do something and then let's say
that I wanted to include the recipe in
our results and then get rid of the ID
close that off and you can see right
there pops back the recipes name as well
as the score based off of whatever the
value of likes is or whether the value
of likes is greater than or equal to 200
we're also gonna be able to come in and
compare values and there's project and
I'm gonna give this the name of compared
to 200 and how I want to compare them
compare likes I'm going to compare it to
200 and then we'll say I want the recipe
name to pop back and know I did just
like always and there you can say in
situations which the total number of
likes was greater than 200 it's going to
pop back a value
one in situations in which it is less
than 200 it's going to pop back a
negative one and in situations in which
it's equal to it's going to pop back a
zero so there you go guys there are a
ton of examples in regards to how we use
indexes as well as aggregations using
MongoDB and please leave your questions
and comments below of the last till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
