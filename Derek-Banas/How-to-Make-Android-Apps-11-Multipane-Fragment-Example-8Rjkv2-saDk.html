11 of my tutorial on how to make Android
apps today I'm going to focus in on
creating multi-pane fragments this is a
topic that confuses a lot of people and
I get a lot of questions on so I'm going
to ultra ultra simplify understanding
exactly how we build these guys and now
I'm going to jump over and show you
exactly what we're going to have by the
end of the video okay so here's the
finished application when it's in
portrait mode it's going to show one
fragment and whenever it is in
horizontal or a landscape mode is going
to show two fragments of course you'll
be able to put anything inside of there
and it's automatically going to work
super simplified and the goal here is to
create a template you can use in
numerous different apps so enough talk
let's start writing some code okay so
I'm going to call this guy multi-pane
fragment right like that and it's going
to give it the name all type in fragment
click next I'm going to leave this set
at 15 click next I'm going to use blank
activity click next I'm going to leave
this called my activity and activity my
for the layout and I'll just call this
multi-pane fragment and click finish
alright so while I'm letting that build
I'm going to go in here and I'm going to
get some support libraries so I'll be
able to use these fragments multiple
different applications so first we want
to go into our SDK folder and this is
for Android studio then you want to go
into extras Android support version 4
and then this guy right here this jar
file and there is its full name and this
is the same on Windows or Macintosh or
whatever okay and I'm going to copy this
and then I'm inside of the project the
Gradle built for me I'm going to go into
app I'm going to go into libs and then
I'm going to paste it inside of there so
there is our support library and then if
we go inside of our application you're
going to see there it is right there
alright so that's how we do that I'm
going to start off by first creating the
different fragments we're going to need
so I'm going to go into the layout
folder right here and I'm going to
create some new files and the very first
one I am going to call fragment main
panel and I showed you the application I
haven't seen it yet but what I showed
you at the very beginning of the video
is what this is going to be it's going
to be the largest part of the panel you
saw so just click on OK for that and I'm
going to
over here and create another layout I'm
going to call this guy fragment side
panel dot XML and of course this is
going to be the smaller one click OK and
then I'll go into activity my right here
see do I want to do a relative layout
now I'm gonna just jump in here and
build this from scratch so of course
come down here to the text area and I'm
going to create a linear layout for this
guy first I'm going to define my
encoding okay I got that set and then
I'm going to create a linear layout and
I'm just going to copy this guy right
here paste it over inside of this one
and then I'm gonna define my layout
width make that match parent and I'm
also going to define the layout height
of course and let that be matched parent
and these are the fragments these are
the parts this right here is the main
panel it's the largest panel so it's
going to show up whenever it's
horizontal or it's going to show up
whenever it's in portrait mode and
background I'm going to say Android and
color and why don't we go Hollow red
dark is this red dark red light red dark
there it is that's the problem with
creating as you can see over here what
color it is just like you saw at the
beginning of the video and then I'm
going to say that I want the layout
gravity and let's look like this to be
top center and this is just going to
position the text view I'm going to
create here in a second and the
orientation I'm going to have that be
vertical doesn't really matter and there
we go now inside of this I'm going to
put a text view and I'm going to have
this be wrap content and have this be
wrap content the text inside of this is
going to be main panel and of course all
this codes available to link under the
video text color I'm going to make this
white and then I'm also going to have
the text style I'm just using a whole
bunch of these different things just so
you get used to seeing them all the time
I like to repeat things over and over
again I'm going to make them bold and
then the text size I'm going to make
this 20s P that's it and I'm actually
going to copy this for the other
fragment which is the side panel down
here click on the text tab face that
inside of there any other thing I'm
going to change here is I'm going to
call this side panel and that's it not
change anything else so that's done as
well now I'm going to actually create
the code right the
Java code that is going to allow me to
create or inflate these layouts onto the
screen so to do that I'm going to go
into Java and I'm going right here and
right click and go new Java class and
the very first one I'm going to create
side panel fragment there we go now we
of course need to extend fragment to
create this guy and right click generate
override methods get on create view
right here and there that is and this
time I'll do this a little bit different
let's create our view is equal to and
the inflator that's going to inflate
this on our screen and if you didn't
watch that last part of the tutorial you
should probably watch that and of course
I have to spell inflate or wrong because
I do that all the time don't know why
it's like a silly thing alright so then
I need to tell it what layout that I
want to inflate on our screen and that
is the one we just created fragment side
panel there it is and then if there is
going to be a parent or not which would
be passed in a container and I'm gonna
put false here because there's not going
to be a parent and then after I do that
I can just go return view or it could it
did that all at once and that's it
that's all we had to do I'm trying to
keep this as simple as humanly possible
because most of the time the list is
presented it's presented in a very
complex manner so I'm doing my best to
avoid that I also come up here and do
our support library that we're going to
use here
v4 dot app fragment and to be able to
use that we're going to have to go into
our build Gradle file over here
double click on that and make a couple
little changes here down here in
dependencies I'm going to click down
here and I'm going to say compile calm
Android support : support
- v4 this isn't something you memorize
is something you do and my target is 20
version of Android there it is and then
to make sure that we don't try to add
support libraries more than once we're
going to go configurations and then
inside of this I'll go all star dot
exclude group com Android support module
support - v4 and then sync now if we
jump back over into side panel fragment
you're gonna see that those errors went
away and everything's cool alright great
so now to create the next fragment I'm
just going to copy this I'm gonna go
over here right-click on that go new
Java class and I call this main panel
fragment click OK
and just come in here select everything
paste that in there change this to main
panel over here fragment main panel and
that's it we're done I'm going to jump
back into activity my dot XML and what
do I need to change is there anything I
get rid of this padding right here my
activity that's the application it's
going to be tied to I could do something
like base line and then I'll set this to
false just so that we'll be able to get
some performance enhancements because we
won't have to force Android to go in
there and try to align all of our
children elements that are inside of
here if we want to add a nice little
animation change for when our layout
changes just come in here and set this
to true and play around with that see
what that does and then instead of text
views inside of this what we're going to
do is put our fragments in here and I'll
just have both of these be match parent
I'm going to give this an ID of main
panel make sure you put plus ID inside
of that to make sure that updates are
our file and let's do a little bit of
layout here let's say align parent left
and let's have that be true and then
let's also go lay out a line parent top
and have that be true and we want to
associate it with the right class file
and that's going to be column dot new
think-tank in my situation you're
probably not going to have a new
think-tank inside of here and then
multi-pane fragment and main panel
fragment and then close that off and
then we're pretty much going to do
exactly the same thing for the other
fragment which is going to be our side
panel let's just paste that in there and
then we're going to call this side panel
instead of main panel and then the class
is going to change as well we'll change
this to side panel and that's it we got
activity my done as well now what we
want to do is define the layout we're
going to use whenever the device is in
landscape mode so I'm just going to copy
all this come over here to the resources
folder new directory and then the name
of this is going to be layout - land
this is how we can define landscape
layouts and then right-click on that and
go new file and the name of this file is
going to be activity underscore my dot
XML just like the other one click OK
click on the text tab at the bottom
paste this in there this is from
activity my the other one we had and for
the
guy what we're going to do is come into
the side panel fragment down here and
for our width let's go and select this
and let's do something like 150 DP and
see how that turns out that sounds about
right for a little bit of text that we
have there file save that and now all I
have to do is go into my activity Java
and make everything work which is
basically going to show two panels when
it's in horizontal and only one panel
whenever it is in portrait in the next
tutorial we can get a little bit more
advanced by going in and actually
putting different content in there but
if you want homework why not go in there
and try doing that right now for
yourself great way to practice basically
what I want to do here is hide the side
panel when I'm in portrait mode so I'm
just going to go int and I'm going to go
screen orientation is equal to and then
I can go get resources which is going to
get us access to the resource is going
to allow us to get with the orientation
I'm going to call get configuration
which gives us configuration information
just like it did in the last tutorial
orientation that's what I want now I'm
going to say if screen orientation is
equal to go to the configuration file
just like we did before and here I'm
going to say orientation and portrait
now if we are in portrait mode let's go
and do this in a separate one I'm going
to say hide side panel just show you how
easy this is if everything separated of
course I get an error there because I
haven't created hide side panel yet come
down here and let's just go private void
because then I can return anything hide
side panel and do that we're going to go
view side pane is equal to find view by
ID and I'll just pass it what I want it
to hide which is going to be or side
panel there it is and then I can say if
side pane get visibility is equal to
view visible I can go side pane these
are fragments are often referred to as
panes if that's if you're wondering why
to decide to do that and then set
visibility to view going I'll save it
and it is done except to come up here
and let's close that off bring us up
there close that off okay guys so if you
run this you're gonna see exactly
whatever I showed you at the very
beginning of this video tutorial please
