my visual basic tutorial in this part of
the tutorial and a cover math function
strings date subroutines functions
arrays for loops and a whole bunch more
and like always all the code is
available in the description underneath
the video and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it
alright so to start off here I'm going
to create a new project and it's going
to be a windows form app again and I'm
going to call it VB Tut - but the name
doesn't matter and I'm going to click on
OK it's going to create my project for
me and you can see the little form that
I have here and I am going to come in
here and first off create a text box and
if you open up visual studio and you do
not see the tool box just scroll down
here to the bottom of the screen or zoom
in or whatever and click on that and you
will see your tool box that's going to
have all of your little components
you'll be able to use and what we want
to do here first off is come down here
where it says text box and I'm going to
drag a text box up here inside of my
form and drop that inside of there I'm
going to grab this window here and
expand it a little bit and we're going
to mainly be printing out to this text
box in this tutorial and if you want to
be able to have a text box to have
multiple lines what we're going to do is
make sure we have that selected of
course and I'm just going to leave this
be called text box one and you're going
to want to come in here and find
multi-line wherever that is that's ma
right here and you're going to want to
set this to true instead of false we're
then probably going to want to use
scroll bars so select scroll bars and
come in here and set those to vertical
and then you're also going to want to
come down here where wordwrap is and
make sure that that is also set to true
now that we have that set up we can
resize our little text box and I'm also
going to throw in a button so just find
a button right here drag it up here and
I'm going to throw it right here in the
bottom of the screen I'm going to zoom
in here and select this and call this
button update and then come down into
the text area inside of here and we'll
call this update and that is basically
all we're going to do inside of the
mariya now I'm going to jump in here
click on or double click on update and
this is going to give us our code window
now this is a little bit hard to read so
I'm going to come in here to the tool
section and come down to options and
this will allow me to enlarge my font
and I'm going to come in here select
this guy and it doesn't give me an
option that's big enough so I'm going to
change this to 38 and hit enter and then
I'm going to click on OK and that's
going to make my text real nice and big
so you guys can see everything I'm doing
now previously I didn't describe
everything that was going on here in
this subroutine so now I'll do that
basically private means that this
subroutine is only going to be able to
be called from code that lies within our
class and this is our class right here
as you can see so that's basically what
private means sub means that this is a
method that does not return a value
button update click is the name for our
subroutine and then right here inside of
these parentheses I'll get into the
specifics of the object and event
arguments and all that later on in the
tutorial series but basically anything
within parentheses are going to be
parameters that are going to be sent to
our subroutine to execute and then right
here handles is going to define that
this is called when the event is
triggered and that event that is being
watched is whenever we click on button
update so that's just an overview of
everything that's going on right there
now something that was brought up in a
previous part of the tutorial was what
happens if we go and create a variable
inside a Visual Basic and we do not give
it a defined datatype well I'm going to
show you so I'm going to go textbox and
this is textbox 1 and I'm going to set
the text for it inside of here and I'm
going to get the data type of random
number and we will place that inside of
there so not only will you see what
happens whenever you do not assign a
datatype to a variable but you'll also
see the way that you would be able to
get the datatype so let's just save that
and let's run this and you can see it
opens up right here and we can command
and say updates and you can see that it
shows up
is a double so basically if you do not
define the data type it is going to
decide it for you that's just that
simple now let's also come in here to
our form and let's change the the size
of this and you do that inside of font
right here and we could just open all of
this up and let's change it to something
that's a little bit easier see let's say
18 and let's see if that works out
better for us and it'll jump back over
inside of here alright so that is how
that stuff works now I'd like to go over
some math functions and also talk about
strings and new lines and all a bunch of
other different things so what I'm going
to do here is I'm going to define a
string call this the text output and
then I'll say as string to define that
it is indeed a string and let's say that
we want to get the absolute value for a
function so I'm going to say absolute
and negative 19 is going to be equal to
and no I am NOT going to individually
type all the possible different math
functions inside of here I'm going to
speed through it but I'm going to cover
some things here first so if you want to
get the absolute value what you would do
is type in math dot abs and then throw
in whatever you want your value to be
and of course we're able to join or
concatenate our different values and
strings using the and inside of there as
you can see and if you would like to
then go in and throw in a new line
inside of your textbox you're going to
type in environments and new line and
what this is going to do is add a
platform-specific new line inside of
that text box and then what we'll be
able to do here is then assign the value
of text output over inside of our
textbox and how we're going to do that
is just go to the text box 1 is equal to
dot txt is equal to text output and
while we're doing this won't we go and
also output another piece of information
and I'll just show you another math
function a shortcut if you want to take
what is already inside of text output
and then amend to the end of it some
more additional information
come in here and go and is equal to
right like that and let's say that we
want to also use the ceiling function to
see how that would work for us we just
go in here like this and and it will say
math dots ceiling and throw in 4.5 and
then at the end of that we're also going
to throw in an additional newline so
like this and like that and if we save
it and run it you're going to see
whenever we click on update that it puts
out the absolute value as well as the
ceiling or it rounds it up and I spelled
ceiling wrong but that's perfectly okay
alright so that is how that would work
and now we'll go and take a look at some
additional math functions we can work
with and I'm using exactly the same
format here as I use before you can see
right here we can also have floor which
is going to round down a value and print
that out on the screen we can also find
here earase to the specified power and
he of course is going to be 2.718 you're
also going to be able to return the
natural logarithm right here as well as
being able to return the base 10
logarithm you're also going to be able
to use the max function right here and
it's just going to return whichever of
those values is larger and here also the
min function is going to return the
value that's smaller we're going to be
able to return the number to the power
of another number so this is going to be
5 squared in this situation likewise we
would be able to get the square root of
a number and there is also an additional
round function that is going to either
round up if the value is 0.5 or higher
or round down if it is less than 0.5 and
if we save that and we run that you're
going to see all of these different
functions here work on our screen and
there you can see absolute value the
ceiling the floor and all of the
additional functions that we have here
available to us inside a visual basic
and of course you're also going to have
the option to use cosine there I'll just
show you the cosine function
everything is going to be uppercase so
you're going to have cosine and sine and
tangents and arc cosine arc sine arc
tangent cosine
okay so those are all of the additional
math functions that are available to you
another thing it's kind of interesting
here is you are going to be able to add
Sata's subtract multiply and divide
numbers and then save those values back
to themselves much as we were able to do
here with our strings being able to mend
to the end of those or append to the end
of them so I'm going to say let's go and
create a random integer and give it the
value of 10 then we can come in and say
random int and we can do plus equal to
10 right like that and like I said you
can do that for subtract multiply divide
and so forth and so on and then we would
be able to go and let's just copy this
and paste that inside of there and do
something like 10 plus 10 promised the
tutorials going to get a little bit more
excited here in a moment you're also
going to be able to come in there and
just throw in random int just like that
and I'll put that information on the
screen and one other thing that is
important to know in regards to the
different data types is if you have
random int like this and it is defined
as an integer so we'll say as integer
that is going to mean that if you come
in here and let's say we take random
integer and then multiply it times 0.1 3
and then save it back into its own
version if you would go and output that
you may be surprised by your results so
we'll just say 20 times 0.1 3 and I'm
going to let you see what that is so
let's go and run it and indeed if we run
that you're going to see that you are
going to get a value of 3 and that is
completely wrong and the reason why is
you said that random integer is an
integer right here and that means that
even if you try later on to assign it as
a decimal or a double or float value it
is still going to round down and remain
an integer so that's just some important
information
to be aware of if you're going to be
using math functions inside a Visual
Basic and now I'd like to talk about
some string functions that are available
so we're going to come in here and we're
going to create a random string and
we'll come in here and you're going to
surround all of your strings with double
quotes like this and I'm going to say
here this is a string just to keep it
simple we can come in here now and we
can output like this and equal to let's
say we wanted to get the random strings
length we could do that we're going to
be able to get that with just typing in
random string followed by the word
length and then of course if we want to
put a newline inside of here we would go
environments and new line like that now
let's do a whole bunch of string
functions just so you can see what they
look like you're also going to be able
to start at a specific index and return
a certain number of letters after it so
let's just go and let's copy this and
let's go and create a whole bunch of
these different guys so in this
situation let's say that we want to get
the first three letters inside of a
string we would just come in here and go
random string and then instead of length
we would type in substring and if we
want to get to the first three we're
going to start off at the zero index and
then we're going to get the next three
values after that let's go and get some
more things you're also going to be able
to replace a string so if we'd say that
we wanted to do let's change this to it
changed string and let's go and change
the string on a different line so we'll
go random string is going to be equal to
random string and replace and let's say
that we want to replace the word string
with the word up make sure this is
string lowercase with the word sentence
do that and this is going to output that
change in value will just change get rid
of that right there we're also going to
be able to format values in multiple
different ways so let's say
that we create a decimal let's all this
decimal random num and then as decimal
and give it the value of 3 1 2 3 . 1 4 1
5 9 and we will edit this in multiple
different ways so let's do text output
here I'll just put value now what we're
going to do is we're going to be able to
format this guy in multiple different
ways by going string dot format and then
inside of here let's say that we would
like to use a thousand separator if
needed as well as cut down the decimals
to just three decimal places what we do
inside of here is we put a curly bracket
and 0 colon and 3 another curly bracket
and then close that off and then we
would put our random number inside of
there like that
and then close this off and why don't we
run this to see all the different things
we just did and update and there you can
see it threw in the thousand separator
and cut down the decimal places to 1 for
2 you're also going to see here that it
printed out the string length as well as
the first 3 characters and then it went
and changed the string for us we're
going to be able to format values in
other different ways as well so let's
say that we would want to have this be
converted into currency automatically
which means a thousand separator plus
the dollar sign plus it's going to be
rounded to two decimal places we can do
all that once again we're going to be
using string format so let's just go and
copy up and let's paste this inside of
here now however since you're working
with currency what you're going to do is
put a C inside of there instead of the n
everything else will be exactly the same
so you don't need to change any of that
stuff and we could also come in here and
define specific ways that we would like
to format our numbers inside of here so
for this guy I'm just going to put
random just for whatever and here what
I'm going to do is I'm going to define
that I want to show at least five
numbers before the decimal place so I
can just go one two three four
five and then I want to cut this down to
just one decimal and I can do that right
there let's just go and run it see how
that changed everything and click on
update and here you can see it went
through a leading zero inside of there
cut that down to one decimal place you
can also see here with the currency I
put in the dollar sign thousand
separator as well as the decimal place
and then cut it down to two digits okay
it's a whole bunch of different ways you
can format inside a visual basic and now
if you replace the C or the N in this
situation there's a whole bunch of other
different guys there's also the G and
what that's going to do for us is
display without a thousands separator F
is going to display with at least one
number on the left and right of the
decimal at all times P is going to
multiply the number times 100 and then
show the percent sign next to it and E
is going to display whatever value you
have inside of there as exponential
notation let's go in here and do a
couple more different things with
strings we're also going to be able to
come in and get the first location of a
string that is defined inside of here so
let's throw that right there and for
this guy I'm going to say eyes in string
and let's go and get the first matching
eye inside of our string here and to do
so you're going to type in in string
like that you're going to say that you
want to start at the very first
character searching inside of it and the
string you're specifically going to be
searching is going to be random string
and then the string you are going to be
looking for is actually going to be an
individual character which is going to
be an eye and then we want to use the
compare method that is text because we
are working with text let's go and
create a couple other different things
I'm going to get more into arrays in
detail in a later tutorial but now I'd
like to just show you arrays so that I
can show you how strings and arrays work
together now if you would like to create
a fixed size array which means in this
situation I'm going to career
eight an array that is going to hold
three values and arrays are just used to
store multiple values that's the only
point in their existence well what you
do is just go dim array like that and
let's say that I want to have an
employees array it's going to start at
the zero index and it is going to
continue to the second index so that's
going to be 0 1 2 so that means that
this is going to be a fixed size and it
is going to hold three different pieces
of data now they don't have to always be
fixed size like I said in the next
tutorial I'll cover arrays in more
detail now if you want to then after you
created your array you want to come in
here and throw in a value inside of your
right you could come in and say that the
first employee is going to be Bob and
the second employee is going to be Sally
and the last one is going to be Paul
there you go you just created an array
now you're going to be able to join
array values into a string which is the
reason why I brought up arrays all
together so we can go string employees
as string is equal to and then call the
function join on the array and you're
just going to come in and go employees
and then you can then define how these
different pieces of data are going to be
separated from each other inside of the
new string that's created and I'm going
to say that I want to put a comma in a
space between each of them inside them
of the string and then let's go and
output this information on the screen
and I'm just going to change this to
employees and then get rid of all this
stuff and then go string employees like
that and let's run it and see all the
different changes that we've made so far
and bring that up and update it and here
you can see that it not only printed out
all of those different values that were
stored inside of the array but it also
separated them with commas and you can
see also here with the eyes in string
that it found the very first eye within
our string at the third index place ok
so there's a whole bunch of other
different things and we'll continue
making some more now you may say well if
you're able to turn
earn an array into a string how do you
turn a string into an array well you can
come in here and just go array employees
and call the split function and string
employees right there again and here
you're going to define how these
different pieces of data are separated
and we know that they're separated with
a comment of space so there you go and
then of course we're going to be able to
output this information and then we want
to cycle through all of these individual
different pieces of data inside of our
array and print them out one by one but
how would you do that well you would do
that with a for loop once again this is
the basics of a for loop but I'm going
to get more in detail in them in the
next part of the tutorial now basically
this is just going to do the same thing
a defined number of times and this guy
right here I is going to increment each
time we cycle through our for loop and
we have to define the data type for that
and I'm going to give it a starting
value of 0 which is going to be the 0
index or the first place inside of our
array and then I have to define how long
this is going to cycle so I'm going to
say that it's going to cycle for each
value inside of our array however since
we have a the array starts off with
index number 0 we want to subtract 1
from that so we're going to continue
increasing the value of I each time we
cycle through here up until the point in
which we get to the end of the the very
last index in our array and I just want
to output this information on the screen
here I'm just going to say employee and
then if I want to get each individual
guy inside of the array or each
individual employee inside of the array
I would just go array employees and then
throw I inside of it and it's basically
increment each time and show you each
individual person inside of there and we
just run it and see that that's true and
there you can see it printed out Bob
Sally and Paul now there are a bunch of
different string functions inside of
here I'm going to show you most of the
main ones that you're more than likely
to ever want let's say that we wanted to
get to the left or the first three
values inside of a string you're
going to use a function and it's going
to be strings left and you're going to
pass into it the string you want to
search for and never you want to search
in and you saying right here you want
the first three characters inside of it
we can also come in here and get the
right three if you'd like to do that so
we'll say right three instead and we
just change that to right there's a
bunch of other different functions let's
say that we would want to take our
string and put it in uppercase go
uppercase change this to you case and
then get rid of three of course likewise
we're going to be able to put all of our
characters in lowercase and then just
change this to LC we're also going to be
able to take a string and completely
reverse it so just change this to
reverse and that's just going to make
the very first letter the last one and
then the very last one the first one and
so forth and so on and for this guy
you're going to put string reverse and
we're also going to be able to compare
strings throw this in there and so let's
say that we want to compare the string
dog compared to cat we just come in and
type in string compare and the very
first thing we're comparing which is
going to be the string dog followed by
this second thing that we're going to be
comparing which is going to be cat we
are then going to be comparing text here
so we're going to say compare method
text and then close that off and the
final thing we can do here with strings
is we can trim whitespace off of them so
throw this inside of there and I'll just
say trim and then call the trim function
and one two three and we'll put string
and then one two three and you're going
to see that that whitespace was deleted
and we run it bring it over here update
it and you're going to see if we scroll
down inside of here that we were able to
come in and grab the first three
characters the last three characters
change the entire string uppercase
change the entire string to lowercase
reverse the string and compared the
string dog - cat and what that one means
there is that it is going the compare
function is going to return 1 if the
very first string sorts after the second
one it's going to
turn a zero if these two strings are
equal and it's going to return a
negative one if the first string sorts
ahead of the second one and you can also
see here with trim that it deleted all
the white space at the beginning as well
as the end of the string and also there
is another function called L trim L trim
like that that's just going to get rid
of white space on the left side and
there is our trim which is going to get
rid of the white space on the right side
so that's all we're going to cover four
strings right at the moments and now I'm
going to jump over and talk about dates
now what date is another data type
that's available inside a Visual Basic
and to define one what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to say that I want to
get a date which is going to be the
current date as of the moment it's
created and to do so I just go now and
there it is
so whenever the program is started that
is going to be when that value is
assigned now once we go and create it
we're going to be able to come in here
and get individual pieces of the data as
well as get all of the data the data
information all at one time so what I'm
going to do is let's say that I just
want the month I can get that and how I
get the month is just by going and and
then DTE current and month pretty easy
to remember and then likewise I'm going
to be able to get a whole other plethora
of different data information so here is
pretty much everything you'd want so
there's month
there's day all you do is print day
inside of there instead a month pretty
easy remember year just put Year inside
of there hour minute second and like I
said it's all of that information based
off of whenever the program first
started running also you would be able
to get the day name by typing in the
whatever the date is and then followed
with point two string and then
ddddd inside of quotes inside of there
like that and yes they have to be in
lowercase could also get the month name
and once again to do so you would put
mm-mm all uppercase let's go and run
that see how that looks
bring it over here and update and there
you could say so at the moment that I
created this that was in December the
second day of December 2016
1357 ii 49 and here you can see that i
got the day name as well as the month
name now you're not tied to creating
dates that are just based off of
whatever the current system time is you
can also come in and create your own
date so what I'm going to do is go and
say very important dates like this and
to create your own date you're going to
put a hash symbol followed by 12 21 on
1974 and 11 32 no seconds and this is
going to be a.m. and then another hash
symbol so that's how you create a custom
date and let's go a hand called as dim
as date and then of course you're going
to be able to print out the month and
date and the day and mont year and all
that other stuff of course but let's go
and also show you an additional thing
let's say that you wanted to print out
the full information so let's just
change this to date like that and to get
that we're going to copy this guy right
here paste that in right there so
there's that wonderful date and if you
wanted to get the long time all in one
place you can do so by just going in to
long time string and let's go and throw
a space inside of there like that throw
another and inside of there like this
and then here I'm going to get the same
exact date that we have before actually
I'm going to copy this entire thing
paste that inside of there through
another and symbol inside of there and
change this to long date string like
that and if we run it just to see that
it worked and click on update you could
say that it did so there's a whole bunch
of different things you can do with
dates now I'd like to talk about methods
now we use methods to promote code reuse
as well as to break code into parts so
that it is easier to understand and
you're not only tied to creating
subroutines that are tied to event
handlers but you can just create
subroutines that do anything now you're
going to use a subroutine
instead of a function whenever you don't
need to return a value now remember
I'm going to create a subroutine here
remember to the private means that this
subroutine can only be called from
inside of our class and it's subroutine
that's what that means
I'm going to give it a name of show
message it doesn't receive any
parameters so there that is and what
this is going to do quite simply is just
open up a message box and it's going to
say hello again and then the title to
top is going to say love saying although
and if we want to call this subroutine
just inside of here anywhere we can come
in and just go show message like that
and that's all we need to do
so whenever the option button is clicked
this time it is going to open up a
message box and there you can see right
there so let's close that and let's look
at how we can pass a value into a method
and to do so we're going to use a
function instead of a subroutine so once
again I'm going to say private and I'm
going to say function and I'm going to
call this get some it is going to
receive a value that I'm going to call
num1 and it is going to be an integer
it's also going to receive another value
called num2 and it's also going to be an
integer and this guy is going to return
a value so we're going to say return
num1 plus num2 now up inside of here we
are going to get rid of this guy right
there and instead we're going to call
our new get some function so we'll say
text output and is equal to and we'll
say six plus five is going to be equal
to and then we'll call our function and
that is get sum of course and make sure
it's spelled exactly the right way and
then pass six and five inside of there
and if we run it and click on update
you're going to see that it went and
called that function and then that value
is returned and then it went inside of
our little text box now whenever you're
working with subroutines as well as
functions it's very important to
understand how values change inside of
functions and how they affect values
outside of functions so what we're going
to do is we're going to create an
integer value
I'm going to give it the value of 10 I'm
then going to create a subroutine down
inside of here actually I'm not using
this stuff so I can delete all this all
together and this is going to be private
subroutine I'm going to try to change
the value inside of my regular code so
it's going to get past integer value and
of course as we said this is going to be
an integer just as you saw previously
and inside of here it is going to change
the value of integer value to 20 and
then it is going to open up a message
box and display the new value for the
integer value so here I'm going to say
integer value in in function 1 is going
to be equal to and then I will get that
value and print it out so integer value
and and we'll say environments dot
newline so that's going to print out the
value of integer or value inside of the
function and then what I'm going to do
up here is print out the value outside
of the function so I'm going to call
change value and pass it the integer
value you might be surprised by what
goes on here and then I'm going to
output the value outside of the function
so here I will say integer value out of
function one and here we can just of
course come in and go integer value now
let's run it and see what happens
once again we assign the value of 10 to
it and then inside of this function we
change that value to 20 so what happens
when we click update well you can see
right here it inside the function we are
going to print out the new value for the
integer value variable is going to be
equal to 20 and click on OK however it
is still 10 inside of the regular code
outside of the function so how is that
well basically inside a Visual Basic if
you pass a variable to a function what
you're actually doing is passing that
variables value you're not passing the
variable itself and that is the reason
why the value doesn't change in the
regular code even though the value
changed in
of our function visual basic however
does allow you to actually pass the
variable itself and you just have to
make a couple little simple changes to
have that work basically inside of here
where we have change value we're going
to change this to by reference and we'll
change this to 30 just to show that
something changed and now if we go and
run this you're going to see that this
time the value is going to change inside
of the function and it's also going to
change outside so we'll click on update
see right there the value is 30 and when
we click on OK
you're going to see also in the regular
code that it's 30 so you can either pass
by value or pass by reference it is
completely up to you and now to finish
off this tutorial series what I'd like
to do is come in here and show you how
to create functions that allow you to
receive a variable number of parameters
and then work with those so we'll go
private and have this be a function it's
going to return a value I'm going to
call this get some more and I want to
receive by value that's the default by
reference is not the default just want
to show you how to do that and here what
we're going to do is with we don't have
any idea how many different parameters
we're going to be sent we're going to
toilet parameter array inside of there
like that and I'm going to call this
numbers as and this is an array just
like you saw previously and the values
in the array are going to be integers
and that's what I'm defining right there
now what I'm going to do is create a
some variable as integer and give this
value of 0 I'm then going to create a
for loop inside of here that's going to
cycle through all those array values so
that's for I as integer going to start
off with value of 0 two numbers length
and then I'm going to go sum plus equal
to whatever the value of I is each time
and then after that is all finished off
I'm going to return the sum to whoever
calls this function I'm going to call
this function up here and here I'll just
replace this all together and I'll put
one plus two plus three plus four and
then I'll call my function get some more
and then I'll throw
in 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 see it has no idea how many
parameters are coming and it's just
going to work do that we'll do this
we'll click update and that comes up and
you can see that it adds those values so
there you go guys that is a whole bunch
of other different things you can do
with Visual Basic and the next part of
the tutorial I'm going to cover arrays
and for loops and conditionals and a
whole bunch of other different things
and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
