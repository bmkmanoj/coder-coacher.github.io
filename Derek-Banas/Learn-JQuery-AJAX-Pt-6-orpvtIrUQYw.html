my jQuery and Ajax tutorial in this
tutorial I am going to walk you through
the code for the web page that you saw
at the very end of part 4 of my jQuery
and Ajax tutorial so if you haven't
watched that tutorial go and watch it
right now and it's probably better that
you'll watch one the whole way through
to 6 so that you are totally clued in on
use jQuery and Ajax here is the starting
off code for that web page here I'm just
simply opening up the HTML page and
calling for the jQuery library of course
make sure if you want to write this down
you can pause your screen or you can
just go to new thing tango comm and copy
all of the code that is in this tutorial
there totally for free this code will
attach all of my event handlers as soon
as the page loads I describe window dot
onload in my previous jQuery AJAX
tutorial if you want to see more on that
there I am using the function bind to
attach an on click event handler if
someone clicks on the element named one
button in this example that I have right
here the function alert button click
will be called and here is the HTML code
in the bulleted item in the lower left
hand side of the screen that will
trigger this event when that button is
clicked here I show you how to attach
more than one event handler at one time
just follow one call to the bind
function after another as you see here
on the right side of your screen I'm
attaching a blur focus on Mouse down on
Mouse up and a change of that handler to
the HTML text box named text box 1 and
you can see the code that goes along
with that text box in the third bolded
item on the left side of your screen
here I show you how to call a function
in this case resized window when the
browser window is resized
again I attach a double click event
handler to a button and a mouse over and
Mouse out handler to an image this is
how you call a function when the submit
button is pressed also a show here how
you can embed a function to directly
handle an event handler and it's up to
you which way you'd like to call your
functions here I end the functions
associated with the window dot onload
event handler call make sure you end
this code block with not only a closing
curly brace but also a semicolon because
this is a call
an error people make I also bind a click
event to another button and a keyboard
key press to the body of the webpage
special note here make sure you assign
an identification number to the body
tank to be able to do this and this is
what the body tag would look like with
the identification code attached to it
trying to find two functions that will
handle alerting you that an event
handler has been triggered the function
alert button click will open an alert
pop-up when the button is clicked the
function onblur event will write new
text into the paragraph element named
second when the user leaves a text box I
reuse this last function over and over
again for many of the event handlers to
come because of that I'll list the code
but it won't describe it until something
new comes up you can see here I'm
running pretty much identically in the
same code where I am posting text to
either of the paragraph name third or
the paragraph names second just as you
can bind an event to an HTML element you
can also unbind an event handler in the
function unbind logo I do just that
now the events assigned to that element
will no longer be triggered in the
function check key pressed I pass it the
event object that I use to get the key
code associated with the last key
pressed and I'm talking about the
keyboard here I then convert it into a
character I can display on the webpage
with the function string dot from
character code and here you can see the
rest of the HTML that goes into the page
basically just a bunch of spans breaks
and declarations inside of form elements
for buttons as well as textbox elements
and now because I forgot about it in the
previous tutorial I'm gonna show you
exactly panel to add Mouse event
handlers if you add the following code
to my previous event handler code you
will have a complete review on how to
use vent handlers change the code where
I sign event handlers to the body to
this as you can see here I just added an
additional event handler being mouse
move to the body element and whatever a
mouse movement is detected I will call
the function the mouse move in the upper
right hand corner your screen this text
will bind the mousemove event handler to
the whole webpage now anytime the mouse
move the the mouse moved function will
be called that function also needs to be
added and looks like what you see here
in the lower left hand side of your
screen this code will change the text in
the paragraphs name seventh and ninth
every time the mouse moves make sure you
pass it in the event attribute like I
did here the variable event dots green X
and event off-screen Y containing the
current value of the x and y coordinates
of the cursor then add these new spans
and you are pretty much all done the
rest of the HTML as you see on the right
side of your screen should be completely
understandable to you in the next
tutorial I'm gonna go through all the
animations that are possible using
jQuery and Ajax in the next tutorial I'm
gonna teach everything I know about
animations I'm going to show you how to
hide the logo gonna show you how to
bring that logo back I'm gonna show you
how to fade logos just a little util I'm
gonna bring it back to full opacity I'm
gonna fade it just a little bit so you
still see it there toggle some text
slide away text slide that text back and
mess around with the images catch you
