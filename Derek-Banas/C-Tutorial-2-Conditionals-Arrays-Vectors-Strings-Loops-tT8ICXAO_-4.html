2 of my C++ tutorial in this part of the
tutorial we're gonna cover if-else
conditional operators logical operators
arrays vector string stream Wow for and
I will also provide you with a ton of
different problems you can solve if you
didn't watch part 1 definitely watch
that before you watch this because
otherwise you might be confused and I
provide a link to that in the
description underneath the video is a
link to a transcript of this entire
video along with a cheat sheet and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so here we are and I'm using
NetBeans but you can use any IDE or text
editor or anything you want now the very
first thing I want to talk about our
conditional operators conditional
operators are things like equals not
equals less than greater than less than
equal to or greater than or equal to and
they provide us with the option to
perform different actions depending upon
different conditions so I'm going to
show you a whole bunch of examples also
we have logical operators which allow
you to combine conditions and we have
and which is going to return true if
both things are true we have or which is
going to return true if one or the other
is true and then we have not and not is
just going to turn trues and falses and
falses into truth now I'm going to
provide you with examples to show you
exactly how it works in a real world all
right very first thing I want to do is I
want to create a program that is going
to determine if a birthday is important
or not and my conditions for an
important birthday is that the person
has to be between the age of 1 and 18
they have to be 21 they D have to be 50
or they have to have an age that is
greater than 65 alright totally
arbitrary and everyone other every other
birthday is unimportant in my crazy
world that we have here okay so putting
this together we have to think about
what we're going to do well we're going
to want to ask for the users age we are
going to receive a string we are going
to convert that string into an integer
and then we're going to use if-else and
else--if and conditional operators and
logical operators to then decide if the
birthday is important or not so very
first thing
I'm going to create a string which is
going to contain an age and I'm just
gonna give it the default value of zero
and yes I should be going and verifying
that values are entered before four you
know executing code and so forth but for
now just to keep everything streamlined
I am going to not do that yes I know
that's good code practices and so forth
and so on but I'm trying to keep these
tutorials as short as possible while
also covering as much as possible okay
so we're going to output a message on
screen that asks for the user's name we
are then going to use getline
to receive information from the user
from the standard input and we are going
to store that in as a string inside of s
age and the S just tells us that this is
a string Hungarian notation you can use
it if you like it if you don't like it
don't use it the N stands for integer
and you can also use I or like I said
you could use nothing so I don't know I
just decided to use Hungarian notation
for this tutorial and it's up to you if
you want to use it okay so then what
we're gonna do is we're gonna combine
our conditional operators with our
logical operators now to like I said
before perform different or execute
different code depending upon different
conditions how we can do that is with if
and I can say something like if the age
is greater than or equal to one and
there is a logical operator both of
these have to be true for this code to
execute and the age is less than or
equal to 18 well like I said previously
in this situation I consider that to be
an important birthday so I'm gonna say
I'm gonna output information on the
screen that says importance birthday and
there we go
and in for newline now I didn't need to
put these curly brackets in here and
I'll show you an example later on where
I don't use the curly brackets but for
some reason I like to look at them I
think they make the code easier to read
but if you don't like them don't use
them alright then I'm gonna say if the
age is equal to 21 or there's the or
logical operator
the age is equal to 50 well I said
previously that I determined that that
well those were important birthdays so
in that situation I'm going to come in
here and once again print out on the
screen important birthday and the other
condition was that our age was greater
than 6 or greater than or equal to 65 so
I'm going to say else if the age is
greater than or equal to 65 well in that
situation I also said that's an
important birthday and then to finish
off our if-else if-else statement we're
gonna use an else and here we're going
to print out a condition or our final
condition if nothing else is true and in
that situation I must say not an
important birthday so there we go and
that is everything that I said I wanted
this to do so I'm gonna hit f6 come over
here well before I go on let's go and
change this into a string and we'll save
it man and we'll execute it and you can
see over here it says enter your age and
if I come in and say something like 16
it's gonna say that's an important
birthday that probably is easier to see
and then let's run again and it will say
something like 23 and you can see that
that comes back as not an important
birthday okay so just a simple example
of how we can use conditional logical
operators if and else and now we are
coming to the very first problem of the
tutorial okay so the problem that I want
you to solve is going to be to determine
the grade a student would go to based
off of their age so I'm gonna give you a
little bit of information then you can
pause the video try to create yourself
using all the information you've already
learned and then see what happens
so what conditions we need to worry
about here is if the age is five you're
going to output on the screen go to
kindergarten and if the age is that's
kindergarten okay I think I spelled that
right and if ages are 6 through 17
they're going to go to grades
through 12 and if the age is greater
than 17 just to keep it simple you're
going to print out go to college
something like that and the conditions
gonna be or the code execution is gonna
look something like this
enter age and then they're gonna put
something like two and you're going to
print out too young for school so
there's something else you need to worry
about and if they would do something
like enter age and they would do
something like put eight inside of here
you're going to print out on the screen
go to Grade three and your goal here is
to try to solve this problem with using
15 lines or less of code so you can
pause the video right here and try to
solve that otherwise you can see how I'm
gonna solve it okay so what are some
things I'm going to need to do here or
what what types of information am I
going to need to store that's what we
want to start off with first so of
course I'm gonna need the age so I'm
gonna come in here and create that no
the thing I'm going to need is I'm going
to need the grade I'm just gonna give
this a default value of zero I'm also
going to then need to put inside or
print out on the screen enter age so
enter age and a colon just so that I can
meet the standards that I set off at the
top of the line then I'm going to need
to get that age so I'm going to call get
line and see in and then assign that to
this string that is going to be age I'm
then going to need to convert to an
integer so that I can work with this I'm
gonna have to standard TOI and s age so
convert from the string version of age
into the integer version and then this
is where we're gonna start working with
if statements and conditionals and all
that other different stuff so I'm gonna
say something like if and age is less
than five and here I'll just show you I
don't need to use curly brackets it's up
to you whether you like to use them or
not
I like to use them but I'm just gonna do
this just to do something different so
I'm gonna say exactly what we had to
young for school and I'll throw a new
line in there and if you don't get this
right don't worry about it you know it's
it's not a big deal the whole goal here
is just to understand what is what how
the final answer works so that's the
goal and the goal is also to get you to
think in new ways so here I'm going to
say else if the age is equal to five
since this is a weird thing where I'm
going to only print out kindergarten for
this one thing I'm going to have it be a
separate thing go go to kindergarten and
with a new line and then I'll say else
if and I'm going to use two brackets
here the age is greater than five and
there's a logical operator whoops made a
little bit an air make sure everything
is the same then I'm gonna say age is
whoops I did it again with the heck of
crazy fingers today age is less than or
equal to 17 well in that situation here
me have to use curly brackets
I'm gonna have the grade be equal to the
age minus five and then we will print
out our new information which is going
to be go to grade and then whatever the
grade would be and that and there we are
and we'll throw another new line and
then we'll finally say else for our
default situation and in the default
situation I can say go to college and
there we go and we met all of our
conditions and if we execute that
there's a little bit of a bug I forgot
to put in two colons in that situation
right here and then put in another one
right there and execute it and you can
see we got our age I'll put five in
there go to kindergarten we can execute
it again and we can put eight inside of
there we expect three yep go to grade 3
and we can execute it again and we can
say 19 and we expect go to college to
show up and that's exactly what shows up
ok so hopefully you got something
lots of what you see here on the screen
if you didn't like I said the goal is
just to get your brain working in new
ways and to understand how this code
works that I typed out here and
otherwise what I'm gonna do is jump over
now and show you a whole bunch of
examples of how we can use a raise now
an array is just a collection of data of
the same data type and you declare like
let's declare an array events so I'm
gonna say that's an array and once you
declare the size of your array the
amount of size you want to set aside
meaning we want 10 spaces they're gonna
be big enough to fill in we can also say
that we want the default value to be 1
for example there's a bunch of different
ways to create arrays we could also
leave out the array length and then
provide data to put in the array and
have it automatically set that
information aside or set that space
aside so let's come in here and let's
call this array gnomes to see and I did
not put anything in there however it's
gonna know to set three spaces aside
because that's how much data I told it
to pull to hold and you can also create
an array and assign some of the values
so we'll come in again and gnomes and
three and we'll say that we want five
and then in but we're only gonna provide
some of that space and they'll go in the
zero and then one index
okay so there's a couple different ways
and to access information from an array
so let's say we want the first value
like I had mentioned previous in the
previous tutorial basically an array is
going to store information and each
piece of information in the array is
going to be assigned to an index so make
sure we have here array and let's come
up here and put these ends inside here
and ends right there so if you want to
get the very first item in the array
well you're just going to have to go in
there and put the zero index inside of
it and
I'll give it to you so let's feel like
this and there we go and that's gonna
output that and if we run it you can see
first value is eight and that is for
this guy right here
and let's go and do a couple other
different things he can also change
values very easy so gnomes three and
just go and point at the index you want
to change and then just say equal to
whatever you want the new value to be
and we can also let's just go and I'll
put that again just so you see that that
changed of course it did and you'll see
now it's seven you're going to also be
able to get the array size but you do it
in a sort of a little bit of a weird way
so let's say I want to get array size
what you're gonna have to do is figure
out how big the array data is that's
being set aside so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna say size of and the array
that you want to look at so I'm going to
use the third array that we created
inside of here and then I'm what I'm
going to do is divide that by the size
of so we're gonna get the size of the
entire array and then what that's gonna
do is show us how many bytes were
working with and then what we're gonna
do after that is we're gonna divide it
by whatever the first datatype size is
and to do that we're going to need what
is called the dereference or indirection
operator and what it's going to do is
provide data at a memory address and
this is starting to get into the world
of pointers which i don't want to get
into quite yet pointers just allow you
to point at locations in memory that's
all they are but some people find a
little bit confusing so just know that
if you want to get access to the data
that is here the data that is in the
first location in the array
you just put a star right there and
that's what it'll provide for you and
I'll get into more detail in regards to
pointers very soon I promise you maybe
even in the next tutorial and if we run
that you're gonna see that the array
size is five just like we thought it
would be say we said it was gonna be
five and so we got that answer there's
also things called multi-dimensional
arrays and you can think of them like
spreadsheets
so if you think well what I'm gonna do
is I'm just gonna create one for you so
we go integer create them just like
anything else but basically what we had
here with just these types of arrays
with just a single dimensional array
that's basically just a row okay so what
we want to do here now is we're gonna
create a brand new array and I'm gonna
create a large one so I'm gonna go two
and two and two now basically this first
part right here is going to be how many
you can think of them as pages you want
to set aside for your array and then the
next one after that is going to
represent the number of columns and then
the next one after that is gonna be the
number of rows so let's go in here and
let's assign these so first off I'm
going to go and put in three curly
brackets I'm gonna go one and two curly
bracket and then divide this up and then
this is going to be three and four okay
and then we'll put another curly bracket
here this first part right here is going
to represent this right here so if you
want to access this first page if you
want to think of it as a spreadsheet and
spreadsheets on pages well this is gonna
access if this has the value of zero
it's gonna access to that however we can
go down here to the next line we could
also come in and make a couple more of
these go five and six and then divide
that up and it will go seven and eight
and then close that off and as you can
see as I'm putting in these curly
brackets they are lighting up showing
that I'm closing them say there and you
can see I close the final one so there
is a multi-dimensional array so what I
want to do here now is I want to access
eight how do I do that well eight is in
the second page tape Pages a technical
term it's it's something that I just
like to use because it seems to make
sense for people so basically what I'm
accessing if I have a value of one right
here with this is this second page if
you'd like and then if I have one here
what that's going to do is say that I
want to access the second grouping right
here and then if I have a one right here
that's going to give me the last item
right there and you'll see if I try to
output this information that is
precisely what I'm going to get so just
to show you an example of how you can go
and have these big multi-dimensional
arrays and quite easily access
information and all of them so pretty
easy stuff alright and move on and there
we are and there we go and there you can
see eight comes back and that aid comes
from this okay and that's a good rundown
of arrays I'm gonna get more I'm gonna
cover more in regards to arrays as a
tutorial continues but now I want to
talk about vectors now with arrays once
you decide how big you want them to be
you cannot change that vectors on the
other hand are resizable so you can
create a vector and at a certain size
and then decide that you want to change
the size of the vector so let's come in
here and let's create and integer vector
and you can create vectors of any type
that you would like so let's go and
Nam's
and let's start off by saying we want to
set two spaces aside now if we want to
go and add values to our vector we can
do that easy enough so Rams
num nums I mean and you're gonna
reference them again and like with an
index just like we did previously so
there you go you got those now let's go
and add another one this and in the
second space that's available we're
gonna put 20 now if you want to add an
additional one an additional item into
the vector even though no space is
available for it no problem
just go and reference your vector and
then you go push back and this is going
to add this value that you add here
which is gonna be 30 and in this
situation it's going to add that to the
end of the vector so no problem and
you're going to be able to easily get
the last value for an hour a vector for
example so let's go last index just to
prove that the 30 is there so we'll go
the last index and then let's reference
our vector and then we can get the
overall vector size just by just going
like this and then we can get the last
item inside of there by going and
subtracting one from it and go into a
new line after that and there you can
say last index is six so
you can see it's easy to go and add
additional data to the end of the vector
no problem doesn't cause any problems
another thing that's very useful is to
be able to convert a string into an
array so let's go and let's do that or
let's cry mean basically create a or
convert a string into a vector so I'm
gonna go and I'm gonna create a string
right here and pay good attention cuz
this is gonna be in the next problem
that you receive so I'm going to create
a string just called sentence and let's
just call this this is a random string
okay so we went and we created that and
we get rid of all this other stuff here
so let's just get it out of the way so
that we don't have to look at it and be
distracted next up go and do a little
bit more what I want to do now is create
a vector that this string is going to be
divided up all the words inside of it
are gonna be divided up and stuck in
there and as you can see I can go and
make a string vector no problem at all
and let's just call this words because
that's good enough and you can see I
don't need to set the size for it or
anything everything is perfectly okay in
regards to that then what we're gonna do
is we're going to create ourselves a
string stream and this is an object that
receives strings and then it will be
able to manipulate them in one way or
another and how we're gonna manipulate
them is we are going to receive the
string which is what we just did right
there and then we're gonna use it to
spit out each individual word separated
with a space and then we will separate
them out so we're and we'll separate
them out into a vector and then we'll
output all the information from the
vector and to do this we're also going
to need to have an individual holding
cell for each of the strings as they get
spit out before we attach them to the
vector and we're going to have to also
define what is going to separate our our
different words and that's gonna be a
white space so we're just going to
create a character type and put a
whitespace character inside of there so
now what we want to do is we want to use
a while loop and basically a while loop
is
to continue executing things that are
inside of its curly braket so it's
opening and close it closed curly
brackets as long as whatever is inside
of here is true so what we were going to
specifically say is as long as the
string stream still has words to spit
out and throw into the temporary holding
cell inside of individual string while
paying attention to the fact is that
spaces are going to separate each of
those words we're gonna continue
executing code so what we're gonna do is
we're going to then use push back with
our vector that we have push back and
it's going to pull the individual words
out of our string that we have there and
that's what get lines gonna do for us
it's going to pull it out of the stream
each individual word and then stack them
inside of our vector that we have here
and VEX words and that's all perfectly
fine individual string okay good stuff
all this is gonna be div though so there
we go all right got that set and I just
noticed I forgot to put two colons
inside here so I'll fix that real quick
and there we go I went and put in double
colons inside of there okay we can save
that and also we put a double colon
inside there sometimes I just get
distracted and forget that okay so now
that I have all of those inside of the
vector what I'd like to do now is use a
for loop to go in here and pop them or
each of the individual words out so once
again going to create an integer I
assign it a value of zero for the zero
or the first index then I'm going to go
vector words specifically and size and
then we will increment the value hi each
time we cycle through our for loop and
then we are going to print out on the
screen each of the individual words
separated with a newline so words and I
like that and throw in a newline and
there we go and if we run this dump it
uh this is a random string prints out
okay so that is how we can take a string
converted into a vector
and then out put the information on the
screen and that is going to be important
because your final problem is going to
require you to create a calculator and
this is what the sample output is gonna
look like so you're gonna print out
enter calculation and then you can put
like an example of what type you want to
look for you want to look for five plus
six for example is what the user is
gonna type in and then they're gonna
type in something like ten minus six and
you are going to output something that
looks like this ten point O minus six
point O is equal to four point O and
you're going to be able to perform
calculations on plus minus
multiplication and division you could
also do modulus if you should like to
and you should also provide for the fact
that let's say you don't provide for
modulus and they type in five modulus
six you're going to be able to put an
error message on the screen that says
something like please enter only plus
minus multiplication and division
alright so there you go that is your
problem and you can pause the screen and
go and create that based off of the
knowledge you have learned today and in
the previous tutorial or you could watch
me do it which I'm gonna do it right now
okay so what are we gonna need to do
here
well first off we're always gonna need
to think about the type of variables
we're gonna need so I'm gonna need a
first number to represent this value
that they put inside of here and I'm
gonna give it a value of zero to start
off and then I'm gonna have number two
I'm also gonna give it a value of zero
and of course I should come in here and
verify that they entered information at
all and things like that but I'm just
trying at this point in time to keep
everything streamlined and not
complicated I'm also going to have the
string which is gonna be this this part
they enter that's gonna start off life
as a string and then I'm also going to
need a vectored enough you caught on to
this and if you didn't get this at all
or you if you confused don't
the goal is just to get you to use your
brain in new ways and also to get you to
understand how I solve the problem so
it's not to you know give up because you
couldn't come up with the answer that I
had in a couple minutes okay so we're
gonna go and get that string that we
wanted so calculation and in example 5
plus 6 okay exactly like I showed you
right here we're gonna have that and
we're not gonna put a new line in there
because we we want to have that be on
the same line then I'm gonna go get line
and standard C in and where I'm gonna
store the calculation they want me to
perform so that string that we have
right there and I'm gonna use the string
stream like we did previously and it's
gonna spit out individual information
one at a time so the calculation and I'm
going to specifically look for it to
spit out information or strings to be
more specific
after each blank space a standard string
s we're going to store that in a string
as an individual holding cell just like
we did previously and we have to define
that we want to use a blank space once
again and what did I do here there we
are
got that fixed so make sure you put a
blank space inside of there and there we
go
so we're doing you know pretty much the
same type of thing that we did
previously and I can come sumup here you
can see the entire program that we have
then just like I did before I'm gonna
say get line and I'm going to go and get
the individual variable where it's gonna
store each word that is going to follow
a space in our string and if anything
doesn't make sense I am one of the
youtubers that actually answers comments
so just tell me leave me a comment as
long as you leave me a new comment I
should get it if you leave a comment
that is a comment reply I might not get
it because YouTube only sends me new
comments okay so we're gonna push those
individual words after the spaces into
our vector just like we did before and
then I need to go and get the first
number from our our vector and convert
it into an integer so we're gonna go of
X and calc and zero and if you did get
this right you know and you feel that it
would be helpful to me go ahead and
leave a comment and say hey I got it
right not necessarily in the way that I
did it which I find it hard to believe
you'd get it exactly the same as what I
did it but as long as it works it works
and that's all that matters so then I'm
gonna have the operation that's being
performed a pawn or different values
that are entered and that's gonna be in
the center part okay but I'm gonna keep
that as a string because that's
perfectly fine and then I'm gonna use if
I'm going to say operation is equal to
and they entered a plus I can check
using other different options as well to
see how this works and I'm going to use
a printf in this situation so % point 1f
based off of the input that it said that
it wanted which is up here say whoops
say this is all floats or doubles or
whatever okay so I got that there I'm
gonna say plus and another % point one F
is equal to and another % point 1f and a
new line and I'm gonna follow that up
with DB num1 and TB num2 and then i can
go on to the next line n2 TV num1 plus
DB gnome 2 and there we go and we have
that all set up now what I'm gonna be
able to do is just do this for all of
the potential operators that we can we
might have to deal with somebody else
is equal to and we'll do subtraction and
then I'll change this into subtraction
and then I'll change this into
subtraction and everything else there's
fine
and then I'll say else and I'll do
multiplication in this situation and
multiplication and multiplication and
then we can say else and then we can do
division and then we can do another
division and then a final division and
then finally we can say else and we'll
do standard C out and I said that I
wanted it to say what I wanted to say
please enter only these guys and I will
say I will put that inside of there and
then I'll put a new one inside of there
and close that off and I think that's
all I need to do as long as I need to
make an error let's run it and of course
I made an error and up see how he's for
Kali's it the only one of these colons
okay and this is on what line 18 so what
it's saying that the yep right here okay
right there yeah here I made looks like
it might be my notes do 5 plus 6 you can
see I got the right results as run again
and let's do something like 2 times 5
got the right results and let's run it
again and let's do something like 30
divided by 6 and I got it again so there
you go guys hopefully you got that last
problem all right
but if you didn't don't worry about it
and all of the code that I have here and
a transcript of the entire video is
available in the description underneath
the video and like always please leave
