4 of my cascading stylesheets tutorial
today I'm going to completely cover the
layout and positioning with cascading
style sheets in XHTML if you haven't
seen the previous HTML XHTML and
cascading style sheets tutorial
definitely watch those first first
whenever it comes to positioning in HTML
with cascading style sheets it's very
important to enclose all of your code
into a series of block elements if you
don't remember from the previous
tutorial here are all of the block
elements that are available to you
inside of HTML you have block quotes is
definition lifts forms header tags
ordinal rules
order lists paragraph tables unordered
lists and list items
those are your block elements in HTML
and you want to always enclose
everything in block elements and what
are block elements they force a line
break after you define them quite simple
if you'd like to actually read this
tutorial instead of watching it there's
a link in the underbar to all of the
code that I use here so you can see it
here on the right side of the screen
just in case you'd like to read it or
you want access to the code alright
right into this guy a lot of people said
this is a hefty amount of information to
cover in one to Touro I'm going to do my
best to keep this under 15 minutes and
keep it a hundred percent understandable
we have here on the left side of the
screen just the basics HTML there's
nothing too fancy here you've got your
style tags body tags and that is pretty
much it I'm going to show you how to
make sidebars headers footers all that
stuff all here in one tutorial ok let's
get to it
stop talking so what we're going to do
here is I'm gonna define a class and I'm
going to call it vine to mainly because
I'm gonna stick a brain inside of a div
and I'm gonna give it a border width of
two pixels and a border style of dotted
trying to mix this up and give you some
new things you may not have seen before
or may not remember order color and this
is just hexadecimal code you want
hexadecimal code for pretty much any
color you could ever imagine just type
in wiki space web colors or anything
like that in Google and you should be
able to get it background color and I'm
going to give it a width of 200 pixels
text-align:center make all
the text inside of what's going to be a
day of centered follow all those roles
right there I'll show you what this
looks like without the styling and then
I'm going to show you what it looks like
with the styling paragraph tag and I'm
going to stick same graphic I've been
using and the other tutorials here and
I'm gonna skip over things like
alternative text just to save time
otherwise I'd be here forever and then
close the div right like that reload it
and you can see right there there's the
div and there's what a brain and there's
a little graphic and so forth and so on
well you can remember I did not style
this guy's but I'm going to style them
right now how do I do that jump in here
this time because I didn't use the
period I have to use ID previously
whenever I put it a period in here you
have to call class but since I put a
hash symbol in here just to show you
different ways of accessing this
information I have to call ID instead
and if I save that you can see now I
applied styling I applied all the
styling to this div i centered it change
the background change the border change
countless numbers of different things
just that easily another great thing
about div elements is that you can edit
the tags inside of it also with these
like for example let's say you want to
change the color of just the h3 tag
inside of the brain to do well you would
just come in here type the following
brain to change the styling on the h3
tag and want to change the color to
purple right like that and you can see
the color change to purple instead of
the black that I had in there before and
also you can do the same sort of thing
with spans which are kind of like divs
except they're inline elements like your
two so let's say I want to choose an
irritating color for a span then I would
just come down here after this div and
type in span class now remember because
I put the period in there it's at a hash
symbol your tape and if I roll over here
you can see that it showed up right here
in the ugly fuchsia color so you can do
the same sort of things with spans that
you do with divs
okay so now I'm going to show you how to
get this div to align right and it is
amazingly easy come in here delete this
out and inside of style create some
styling for some basic lip some code and
here I'm just going to say border color
and just make that white real nice and
simple and then if I want this guy to
flow
to the right side of the screen that's
what I'm talking about when I say flute
right I just type in float and guess
what the word right not too hard and on
top of that I'm going to give it a
margin to the left of where it's going
to be so if it's over on the right
margin to the left is what I'm creating
right here of 50 pixels so this will
keep it separate from the Lipson code
that I'm going to be putting in here and
this div right here can stay the way
that it is and I pre created this lip
some div right here just so I didn't
have to type all this nonsense out it's
just a lot of information you're going
to see in a minute see how long it is
and that's all you do and if I file save
that come over here you can see that the
lips um information is right here and
the little box div that we created is a
line right and you can bet you that
there's fifty pixels between these two
guys all right so that's how you would
form that now let's say I want to make a
div with a header footer as well as
content and a sidebar boy that sounds
like a lot of work actually it's not I'm
just gonna jump up here again and in the
style area I'm going to define that I
want my body background color and here
shorthand code for white and then I'm
gonna define my header hopefully you
know what I mean by header if you don't
you're gonna know in a second chrome
color just change it up a little bit
color meaning color of text and we're
going to make that white padding 20
pixels now I'm going to come in here and
create the footer again hope you know
what that means otherwise you'll see
background color and I could have copied
what was up above but it didn't but this
time I'm gonna be smarter I'm going to
copy this
I'm the footer and the header be the
same color no this isn't going to be the
most beautiful thing imaginable but
that's not the point of it the point is
to make it work
now I'm going to come in here and make a
couple changes to this lip some code
meaning that I'm going to take this out
of here background color and I'm also
going to define margin right creating a
margin to the right of this that's all
this is 240 pixels and this right here
is the main reason that the content is
going to be separated from the sidebar
that I create I don't have to make him
any changes here so I have float right
so I want this to be on the right side
margin left I'm going to change this to
20 pixels and I'm also going to make a
margin top which is going to separate or
create a margin between this and the
header and just keep everything
consistent I'm going to make that 20
pixels as well and then down here I
don't really need to change that many
things I do need to put a div in it's
going to represent the header header
everything else can be exactly the same
except I'm going to have to put in
another section and guess what that's
going to represent the footer and footer
once you get good at cascading
stylesheets you literally can do almost
anything just without even thinking
about it
and if I file save that you can see a
grid at a title bar I created a Content
area I created a sidebar and I created a
footer that fast now I'm going to create
for you a two column sidebar layout
you're going to see just how simple this
is I mean it's like almost nothing I'm
going to need to change okay so I got
everything set up here this is why I
crack up when people are so amazed
whenever a website will change signboard
locations and so forth on the fly well
there's certainly nothing to it I'm just
going to have to come in here to the lip
Sumeria and I'm going to have to create
a margin to the right of 450 pixels
remember I'm making a two column sidebar
so I want to allow for two of these
sidebar items here that's what I'm doing
with this guy all right so I changed
that now I'm going to create the other
side bar item and just to keep this
simple I'm gonna call this brain 3 I'm
going to keep this at 2 pixels keep this
dotted keep this color exactly the same
keep background color the same keep the
width to 200 pixels float it right
margin to the left this is actually
going to change to 420 this is still
gonna say 20 pixels right there and
there's still going to be a 20 pixel
margin top well and since I only changed
styling up there there's not really much
I need to change down here what do I
need to do I need to create another div
that's it sample div boom ID is equal to
guess what it's gonna be brain sorry I
like that and what are we gonna have in
here I'm gonna cheat a little bit I'm
actually using to steal this information
but you can put anything you want here
and that's all I need to change right
there if I jump over here boom I got
three of them in there and if I want to
come in here and adjust this margin here
on the side so that this doesn't have
quite as much control over it I can of
course come in here this is in brain
three again and let's just change that
to 20 and reload it and you can see that
everything lines
up and then I got the lip some
information here and then I have the two
sidebar items let's you say how hard
would it be to move this sidebar item
over here and have this be centered
actually would take almost no time at
all just need to change a couple things
I need to come in here to the lip
Samaria and I'm going to have to
actually create a margin on the right
and I'm going to make this 250 pixels
and I also need to make white a margin
on the left and I'm going to leave that
at 250 pixels then if I want one of
these sidebar and items to be on the
left one to be on the right well I have
to come in here in brain two and I'm
going to make this margin left change
that to 10 pixels leave everything else
precisely the same come down to brain 3
and I'm going to change my float from
right to left and then i'ma change this
to 10 pixels I'm going to leave that the
same actually I'm gonna leave everything
the same I'll save it reload boom I just
moved everything over and just to keep
this simple so you're not like what
what's he doing C float right
that's this guy float left that's this
guy that is it that is all that is to
defining and moving these divs around
now you also have something called
setting up a locked layout and to create
a locked layout all you basically have
to do is surround all of your divs with
an enclosing div with a fixed width it's
really simple we're going to do is we're
going to come up here and we're going to
create something that I'm going to call
master this is gonna surround everything
and I'm going to give it a fixed width
of 1000 pixels padding top of 10 pixels
just to keep that nice and neat padding
bottom 10 pixels again background color
white normally this is always this going
to be the same color as the background
for your body you can also set your
margins to auto this will Center the
whole entire web page and create left
and right margins so that they are equal
and I'm going to do the same thing for
margin right then what we got to do is
just calm down into the main HTML in the
body section and we're going to create a
div and we're going to give it the ID
equal to master and then what we got to
do we going to close off that div that's
it and if we file save that you can see
that I created a fixed width this guy is
going to
they the same no matter what and that's
how you create a fixed layout inside of
HTML using cascading style sheets and
you can also tell the browser exactly
where you want to place your divs down
to the pixel using what is called
absolute positioning I just have to warn
you and this is why I'm not going to get
into this a whole lot against using this
because it's very easy to break the
structure of the web page if you don't
precisely calculate the exact placement
of your divs and most of the problems
that I have come across in regards to
cascading style sheets have to do with
absolute position and basically to
understand how absolute positioning
works you need to think of your divs as
playing cards and technically you can
stack all of your divs on top fits or
other with absolute positioning and
actually there is a property that
specifies which div is above all of the
others and this is called the z-index
and I'm not going to get a lot into
absolute positioning because I think
most things are liquid like this with a
surrounding div that keeps everything in
order but just so you know like if I
wanted to create a sidebar using
absolute positioning what I would do is
define position absolute and then I
would say and this would work I mean you
can totally type this in and that will
work I need to tell it absolutely where
to base so I want it to be a hundred
pixels from the top and I want it to be
zero pixels from the right side of the
current browser I want it to have a
total width of 200 pixels and a z-index
remember here's the property I just told
you about that's new and the higher the
number is the more on top of the stack
this guy is going to be so if the
z-index 99 is the highest the index this
div that you create is going to be the
highest div meaning it's going to be on
top of all the other ones so that's how
you do absolute positioning it's real
simple top hundred pixels of course put
position absolute and it's going to be
pretty much stuck to the right side of
the browser and you can also use what's
called relative positioning and what
this does is it positions divs based off
of a position that is relative to
another div for example you could for
example create like an image that was
going to be inside of this sidebar and
instead come
here and create a relative position
meaning that it's going to be a hundred
pixels from the top of whatever div it's
inside of and if we come in here
normally with relative positioning you
work with top and left so let's say a
hundred pixels okay so that's a relative
positioning work so it's pretty much
like absolute positioning in which
you're defining relative to the entire
browser window with relative positioning
you're divining relative to a div with
this image for example would lie inside
up simply let's understand well if it's
not the reason why I'm not covering it
is it's a disaster especially for
beginner people to try and figure out
how to do relative and absolute
positioning and the other positioning is
you can do almost anything so why go
into it extremely deep but I am going to
show you how to do a fixed position like
a pop-up like an irritating thing inside
of cascading stylesheets here so it's
going to be on top of all these other
things so what I need to do is to jump
up into my styling area and I'm going to
call it pop-up and I'm going to copy all
this stuff from here because this is all
going to be the same okay so we got all
that in there and then this is the part
that's different position is going to be
fixed meaning that it's going to go
exactly where I tell it to go 100 pixels
from the top of the screen and 300
pixels from the left side of the screen
you know if you ever wondered how they
get those pop-up windows to irritate you
by popping up there on the screen this
is how they do it and I'm gonna scroll
down here and what do i do i could just
got a create a div div i like that ID is
equal to pop-up right like that close
that on and again just save a little bit
of time i'm actually gonna grab this
code right here grab all this code copy
it jump this right there water brain and
now let's make the pop-up appear and you
can see that it is it appeared 100
pixels down from the top and 300 pixels
from the left right there and i can
position it anywhere I want on the
screen and do pretty much anything I
want with it so there is pretty much
every single way of styling and laying
out web pages with cascading style
sheets between this and the other three
tutorials you know pretty much
everything there is to know about
cascading style sheets if you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
