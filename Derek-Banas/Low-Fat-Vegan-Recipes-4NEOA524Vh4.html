have asked me to do some more recipes so
I'm going to do another tutorial that's
going to focus in on low fat vegan
recipes that are going to be low in fat
extremely healthy and loaded with
vegetables so I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay so the first
thing I'm going to do here is I'm going
to create something called Buddha's
Delight and later I'm going to create
vegetable lo mein and I'm going to start
off with the sauce where my boot is
delight and it's going to be 1/2 cup of
water and then it's going to have 2
tablespoons of apple juice and 4
tablespoons of either liquid aminos
or soy sauce that'll be adding 3
tablespoons of cornstarch to keep
everything real nice and thick and then
I'm also going to be adding 1/4 of a
teaspoon of white pepper to the mix and
basically then all you need to do is mix
it up and be careful with that white
pepper don't add more than 1/4 of a
teaspoon and also make sure everything
is mixed very thoroughly and then to
this I'll be adding 1/2 a cup of green
onions 3 cups of mushrooms a 1 and a
half cups of julienned carrots I'm also
going to take an entire napa cabbage and
slice it up exactly as you see right
here I'll also be using 4 cups of frozen
broccoli as well as 2 cups of frozen
peas and I'll be adding 11 to 15 ounces
of baby corn as well as 8 ounces of
water chestnuts and 8 ounces of bamboo
shoots and then I'm going to use 1/4 cup
of water not oil water in either a wok
or a very large pan and I'm going to
cook all of my vegetables and stages so
basically whenever my pot or pan or wok
is about half full I'm going to stop
with that and I'm going to add right
around an eighth of a teaspoon of salt
and then I'm going to cook it with the
lid on then after approximately three
minutes I'll take the lid off stir it
around then decide if I want to put the
lid on and steam it some more then when
they're ready I'll remove them and add
my napa cabbage and bamboo shoots and
put the lid on ingredients like cabbage
normally take a little bit longer these
might steam for 8 minutes it's basically
up to you and whatever your personal
tastes are and of course put the lid on
so the first set of vegetables went for
about 5 minutes this cabbage went for
about 8 minutes if you don't really like
the end texture of the cabbage you can
cut that off and it would also cut down
on your cooking time and
and I'm going to add in the last
ingredients and lastly I'm going to
first start off with my broccoli and my
frozen peas and the throw those in there
I also added a little bit of water and
then I'm gonna put the lid on let those
steam for right around four minutes and
after those four minutes are up I'm
going to go in and add my water
chestnuts as well as my little baby corn
and this is going to cook for right
around two minutes so I'm just going to
stir that up to get everything
consistent and then of course put that
little and let it steam alright so all
the vegetables are all done so I'm going
to mix them all together and then I'm
going to go and get the sauce that I
made in the beginning of the tutorial I
want to make sure that that is really
consistent and all stirred together and
then of course I'm going to pour that
over top of my vegetables and then I'm
going to mix those vegetables until
everything is real nice and stirred
together okay so my vegetables are done
so I'm going to get myself either some
regular old white rice or some jasmine
rice throw that in a bowl put my
vegetables over top of that and then
voila we have Buddha's delight which is
quite a delicious and an extremely
healthy low-fat vegan meal
and now I'm going to make vegetable lo
mein I'm going to use P b2 because it is
very low in fat and it is a great peanut
butter alternative and I'm going to
start off with 2 tablespoons of PB 2 and
2 then add 1 tablespoon of water and
then 5 tablespoons of either Liquid
aminos or soy sauce then I'll be adding
2 tablespoons of white vinegar as well
as 1/4 of a teaspoon of garlic powder
you can use any brand by the way and to
finish off the sauce I'm going to use
1/8 of a teaspoon of white pepper as
well as 20 drops of your favorite hot
sauce and then finally 1 tablespoon of
regular old honey and make sure you stir
this until all the clumps are gone and
now we'll get into the vegetables for
our vegetable lo mein I'm going to use
one and a half cups of red onions I'm
going to use 3 green onions chopped up
I'm going to use 3 tablespoons of minced
garlic I'm going to go to the napa
cabbage again and use about half of a
napa cabbage I'm going to also throw in
a 210 ounces of mushrooms 1 cup of
julienned carrots that's what julienne
sort of looks like and then finally 1
yellow pepper chopped up for the noodles
I'll be using Ronzoni smart taste which
is high in fiber and low in fat as you
can see right there and then like before
I'm going to add 1/4 of a cup of water
to either a wok or a large pan and I'm
going to add all of my vegetables until
the pot or wok is about half full make
sure everything is consistent here then
I'm going to add in one eighth of a
teaspoon of salt to help the cooking
process and then of course I'm going to
stir everything and then the cooking
process is going to be pretty much
identical to the last recipe we're going
to put the lid on let it cook for about
three minutes and then we're going to
stir and we're going to cook in small
batches and basically you're just going
to continue to cook the vegetables until
they taste the way you want them then
you're going to dump those on top of
your prepared noodles riester your sauce
dump that over top and mix the sauce in
with the noodles and vegetables and
there you go
vegetable lo mein I hope you guys
