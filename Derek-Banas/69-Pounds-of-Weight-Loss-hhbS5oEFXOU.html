my diet nutritional plan information
that I posted many months ago and have
received a great amount of success with
today I'm going to actually explain how
I may have created a diet that keeps you
from putting weight back on I've never
heard of a diet done this way and it was
done purely by accident and in this
presentation I'm going to explain to you
exactly what happened I'm now down to
179 pounds and I've made a major
discovery not only does my diet seem to
hinder future weight gain meaning the
dreaded weight rebound I think it may
make it very hard to go back to eating
unhealthy this may be a positive or
negative but I currently cannot eat most
fast food any more every time I do I get
stomach cramps I've been doing a lot of
research on this and I believe it's
because of a chemical called monosodium
glutamate or MSG MSG is also known as
hydrolyzed vegetable protein on products
that want to state they don't contain
MSG well in creating this diet I never
tried to make sure I continued ingesting
certain preservatives I never thought
that there was any great need to do that
I instead just aim to decrease my fat
cholesterol and salt intake MSG is a
sodium salt that is added to food as a
flavoring agent from all the research
I've read it has addictive properties
that fast-food restaurants love in
particular it seems that while children
can easily digest it however adults lose
their ability to digest it if it is
removed from their diet for a prolonged
period of time I've gotten sick eating
at buffets for the most part even though
all I ate was salad some msg is in
almost everything on a buffet however I
have had no problem eating at
traditional mom-and-pop restaurants as
they're called that would be non chain
related restaurants I've eaten a bunch
of them no problems so far so I started
to think to myself is my diet maybe bad
so I also looked into some other side
effects of the diet I was checked by a
doctor and received fabulous
and even qualified for the highest-rated
life insurance which is preferred plus I
used to sell insurance years ago and you
have to understand it is very hard to
get people preferred plus rates so I
don't think there's anything wrong based
on a phone medical testing and I had a
lot of it so the medical test state I'm
a-okay
I then looked into negatives of
consuming small amounts of cholesterol
which I do I found there is only one
negative which is a slower sex drive I
personally feel fine in that regard as
well being a man however I don't know
how this lower cholesterol level would
affect women though I also want to
repeat that I'm not a doctor I had just
sat down and read 14 diet nutrition
books Addis where all this information
came from don't want anybody to think
I'm a doctor so what about the fat do
you really need to consume the daily
requirements the FDA states what you
have to understand is that those stats
are guidelines not requirements in fact
consuming a 2,000 calorie diet is way
above the amount 95 percent of the
world's people should consume I'm
personally six three with a large frame
and I'm only supposed to consume 1400
calories a day for example so do you
need fat well the FDA also recommends no
more than 65 grams of fat per day and
this is for the 2,000 calorie diet while
for me they recommend 40 grams of fat
based off of my 1400 calorie diet well
based off of my own results and what
I've read there is no negative to
consuming only 10 grams of fat which is
my average per day consumption low fat
diets may make you tired if you don't
consume enough easy to burn fruit and
vegetable sugars and carbohydrates
however but in my case I consume immense
numbers of vegetables and and to a
certain extent some fruit so I guess
there's no problem there you also need
fat to digest certain vitamins and
minerals but from what I've read I'm
well within the guidelines of the
required fat intake only my intake of
salt is almost exactly what the FDA
recommends so I definitely don't need to
worry that I'm not consuming enough salt
so I'm very happy to announce that my
diet helps you stay away from fast-food
restaurants
altogether which should really help you
keep the weight off also I want you to
be aware that if you do feel you are
getting sick
from msg there is a pretty quick
antidote either to ibuprofen pills or
better yet a can of redbull almost
immediately will get rid of the stomach
cramps so if you you do by chance get
sick from MSG that is a cure that I have
personally found works for me I hope
you're benefiting from a totally free
diet plan and if you have any questions
leave them below it was created by
following FDA research and nutrition
textbooks basically what I did was I
looked at all the textbooks that people
who are going to Stanford to become
nutritionists read and I read them I
lost 69 pounds of six months without
supplements vitamins or any expensive
food many people suffer from obesity and
I'm offering to help for free yes every
video is free on YouTube and I don't
sell any of them so I hope this helps
you a whole bunch and I'll see you next
