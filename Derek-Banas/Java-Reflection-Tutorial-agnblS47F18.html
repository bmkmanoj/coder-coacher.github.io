10 of my design patterns video tutorial
today we're going to talk about
something that isn't a design pattern
however it has been brought up many
times and that is the Java reflection
API in this tutorial I will unveil
exactly what reflection is and make
everything a hundred percent
understandable so let's get into exactly
what is the Java reflection API I think
most of the confusion that revolves
around this topic is based off of the
name whenever people hear reflection
they immediately think it's a technique
to use inside of Java no it is and it's
a library just like everything else and
also the names kind of vague and sounds
mysterious
I think better-class manipulator would
be a better name for reflection so every
time you hear the word reflection think
of class manipulator because that is
exactly what it is the Java reflection
API is used to manipulate classes and
everything in a class including fields
methods constructors private data
private methods etc however you have to
understand that because using the
reflection API is most often dynamic it
can slow down a program because the java
virtual machine can't optimize the code
if it is in fact dynamic the reflection
api can't also be used with applets
because the added security at applets
require and also remember that because
this api allows you to do things like
access private fields and methods it
should be used sparingly or else
potentially destroy the complete logic
of your program now on to what i think
is the greatest and coolest thing about
the Java reflection api have you ever
dreamed that somebody could pass you say
a string such as method to execute this
is a method that you'd want to execute
on your own dynamically and then you'd
be able to dynamically take this string
and execute it just as if it was a
method that was pre-built directly
inside of your code well with the Java
reflection API you're going to be able
to do that now on with a code I'm going
to explain everything that goes into
this guy now the very first thing I'm
going to do here is I'm going to use
some code that I originally created
whenever I created my abstract factory
design pattern and again reflection has
nothing really to do with design
patterns however it is often used with
design patterns and inside of this guy
I'm going to create some
it's stuff that I'm then going to go in
and access so this is just dummy code
I'm gonna split 100 inside of here as a
string I'm going to show you in a second
how to grab private information however
that's just a small part of what we're
going to be doing here I'm going to
create myself a private method that is
just going to return a string how did
you get this it's a pretty simple stuff
I'm going to create another private
method inside of this it's going to
return a string get other private and
it's going to receive an integer and I'm
just going to call it this int it's also
going to receive a string and I'm going
to call it that string and in doing so
I'm going to show you how to pass any
type of value into things like this and
then it's going to go return how did you
get here
and then pass back that information back
onto the screen so just putting this
stuff together so that I will be able to
come in here and play around with all
these private methods and pass
information around using this API then
I'm going to go public and I'm also
going to create a constructor and I'm
going to show you how to run a
constructor using the reflection API as
well and then it's just going to print a
message out the screen telling you that
the object has been created and then
also that you pass certain information
into this constructor so by the end
we're pretty much going to do just about
everything you can do with reflection
random string and then in the next part
of the tutorial I'll actually use it in
a real-world scenario you can kind of
use this as a cheat sheet from now on
whenever you want to dabble with the
reflection API and now we're going to go
into testing reflection Java I'm just
going to start typing some stuff in here
so let's say that you wanted to get the
class object for UFO enemy ship how
would you do that well I'm just gonna
call this reflect and all this code is
available in a link underneath the video
and it's extremely heavily commented
like I said I wanted this to act kind of
like as a cheat sheet for reflection and
there you go and that is going to get
you your class object for the UFO enemy
ship pretty simple stuff and let's say
you wanted to get the class name for
this object also pretty simple
I'm just going to go create myself a
string and then call reflect class get
name and that's exactly what it's going
to do for me I could then print this
name out on-screen he's
you know just by going classname and
then I'm gonna throw in a carriage
return if we execute that you can see
UFO enemy ship the name of the class
pops our aid up there on our screen for
us to use so kind of simple stuff we're
going to get into much more complicated
things don't worry about it you could
also check modifiers for a class so
let's say you wanted to see if a class
was public or not we're going to create
an integer here and I'm going to call it
class modifier and I'm covering a whole
bunch of things that you might not often
use but just want to get into a whole
bunch of things here so you're just
going to go like that it's going to give
you the class modifiers for this guy and
then I'm going to a system.out.print and
then I can just simply come in here and
type in mod a fire and check if it's
public is public and then inside of here
I'm just gonna type in class modifier so
pretty simple and then we get true comes
back and other class modifiers that you
could check for would be is abstract is
final is interface is private is
protected is static is strict is
synchronized is volatile and there's a
couple other ones but those are the main
ones that you could be able to check for
all right so let's move on here and if
we bounce over to UFO enemy ship you can
see right there see public and that's
why that came back true now if you'd
like to get a list of different
interfaces used by a class well this
class doesn't have those but in the
situations in which you would have them
they would all be saved inside of a
class array and I'm just going to call
this interfaces of course you don't want
that equal sign in there select class
get interfaces right like that and that
would return a array full of class
interfaces that are attached to the
class but like I said I don't have any
so there's no point in doing that you
could also get the superclass for UFO
enemy ship just by going class and I'm
going to call this class super because
that's what it is
and then you're just going to type in
reflect class again reflect class
remember is the name for this guy right
here that holds the reference to the UFO
enemy ship class okay so you don't have
to use that you can use any name you
want and just type in class super class
and that's going to return super class
for that guy and then of course make
that lowercase
then if I would want to print that
information out on a screen now that I
got the superclass I just come in here
and go class change that to class super
followed by get name right like that
file save it execute and you can see
enemy ship pops up so that's how you get
that so you're just manipulating the
class that's all you're doing it's
nothing tricky here you could also get
the object methods and return types and
parameter types and all a bunch of the
different things how you do that as you
go and create yourself a method array
and I'm going to call this class methods
and then just go reflect class get
methods right like that it's gonna get
you a whole array of different methods
and then if we zoom in here on this guy
it's going to pop up a message for us
there you go import method and then we
look down here until we see java.lang
reflect see that's reflection so just
click on that and then I'll get you the
libraries that you need and then if you
want to cycle through all these
different libraries no problem just use
the enhanced for-loop and just go method
because that's the class name you're
using I'm gonna go method and in class
methods is the array name that I want to
cycle through pretty simple and then if
I want to get the system name say that I
type inside of here method name then I
want to get the method name I'm gonna
type in method get name again see typing
in same thing over and over again before
I go and execute that guy let's say that
you'd also like to know if this method
is a getter or setter method that's
pretty simple you're just gonna go
method again get name and then bounce
out here and go starts with and see if
it starts with get to see if it's a
getter method system.out.print in this
situation I could go getter method else
if I'm just going to copy this I could
also of course come in here and say set
that's going to tell me if it's a setter
method then just change that to s there
you go
so pretty simple way of doing that as
well now before we leave this enhanced
for say we also wanted to get the return
type for all the different methods oh
pretty simple for third type then just
go method get return types that's pretty
cool there you go
now you get your return types as well
you could also get all the different
parameter types for all of these methods
but think about it
what is that going to main as
potentially a bunch of them so that
means you need an array we're just going
to go parameter type is going to be the
name I'm going to give that and to get
all those you go method get parameter
types so I told this this kind of be
like a cheat sheet sort of thing then
let's say one come in here parameters
print that on on the screen and then we
want to go in there and list all of them
out so I'm going to do another enhanced
for inside of the other enhanced for
except this is going to be changed to
class because its parameters and not
methods change that to parameter and
then we're going to be cycling through
this array so we're going to grab that
from the array paste that there and then
if we want to I'll put those onto the
screen also pretty easy to do
they sit there and go parameter get name
for the parameter and there you go
that's gonna output all the parameters
for that method and then let's say after
we get out of here we just want to do
another new line so I'm just going to do
that septum I type in written line and
I'm also see on type in print line there
cuz that makes sense
got a little bit crazy and just type
system.out.print so that's all I'm doing
here so if I'll save that no I did was
change all the basics prints into print
lines and we can execute it and see a
whole bunch of things come on the screen
and there you go so what are we doing
here well we printed out UFO enemy ship
true like you saw before enemy ship is
the super class name and then we started
printing out the method name there's
method name return type for that method
name is void and then the parameters for
the method called follow heroship
there are none see there's nothing
listed here then we go on to our next
method turn to void parameters there are
none let's get down here until there are
parameters you can see right here here's
the setter method returns nothing
parameters it does have a parameter and
that parameter is string and you can see
all of that information that is being
accessed directly from that class that's
pretty cool now let's say you'd like to
access class constructors and we're
nowhere near being done here I'm
actually getting into the simple stuff
right now well we just go constructor
create a constructor right there and
it's giving me an error that means I
need a library and I'm just going to
call it constructor give it a
initialized value of null zoom in on
it's going to give me an error it's
going to say import constructor job or
reflect air got that all soda and I'm
also going to show you how to create an
object by accessing a constructor I'm
just going to call it constructive to
initialize it with a null and then we'll
start playing around with this stuff so
we're going to go constructor and
remember reflect class is a reference to
our class UFO enemy ship dot Java up
there and if we want to get this
constructor we're just gonna go get
constructor say this stuff isn't hard to
memorize it just takes a little bit of
practice after you play with it for a
little bit you'll get it okay so what
does our constructor do inside of UFO
enemy ship that's the stuff I just
created let's grill down here and look
at what else we got well here's our
constructor and it receives an enemy
ship factory called ship factory but
that doesn't matter
so what are we gonna have to do we're
going to need to pass it a class called
enemy ship factory or an object so
bounce back over here and to pass it an
object
we're gonna go new class brackets right
there and this is used to receiving
multiple different parameters but in
this situation it's only going to
receive one so I'm going to go enemy
ship factory dot class because that's
what it is and there you go and it's
going to give me an error
so just drift over top of it there it is
add throws declarations surround with
try multi catch click on that you don't
have to remember any of these exceptions
which is always a good things no point
in memorizing all that stuff now let's
say you wanted to call a constructor by
passing parameters to create an object
how would that be done pretty simply
actually and we're going to be working
with this guy right here constructor two
so I'm going to go constructor two and
basically going to do the same thing
it's going to be reflect class get
constructor and if we want to pass it an
integer we're going to go into class
remember what we're doing here
bouncing to this guy this is the guy
that we're going to be playing with in
this situation saying here's that
constructor that I specially created to
receive two parameters first an integer
then a string that's going to define our
integer we're going to pass and then
this is going to define the string that
we're going to pass and if we want to
get an instance or an object for it we
go new instance and if we want to pass
values to it saying initial arguments
I'm going to say 12 for my integer this
is just
totally random and inform my string I'm
just gonna say random strength in their
yarn and now it's going to kick back an
object for me and it's also going to
kick back an error message and what's it
going to say it's going to say add catch
Clause to surrounding try yes yes yes
yes that's what I want to do so just
click that and there you go your error
message just went away and it just added
an additional bunch of different catch
clauses inside here if you'd like to
return the parameters for a constructor
well again what's that mean there's
probably going to be more than one so
anytime there's going to be more than
one chances are you're going to want to
create yourself an array class so I'm
just going to call this construct
parameters is equal to constructor get
parameter types and if you expect there
to be more than one its parameter type
so you expect there only to be one its
parameter or tight so this is what you
want to use now if you want to cycle
through all those what do you do it's
all simple we're just going to go class
parameter and then we're going to do
construct parameters so construct
parameters there you go
and then cycle through them also gonna
be simple what do you think we're going
to type we're gonna type in parameter
which is this guy right here okay after
a while you can kind of almost guess
what this stuff is that'll get you all
your parameters now I'm gonna go and
create myself UFO enemy ship new enemy
ship and initialize it with null and
what I'm gonna do here is create a UFO
enemy ship object by calling new
instance also gonna go enemy ship
factoring because I'm going to need to
pass enemy ship factory to it to
initialize it but it doesn't matter what
it actually does reflexions actually
used very often whenever your tube
debugging a program so that's what a lot
of this stuff here is and then we can
just go what we're gonna do I'm not
going to throw it a try block even
though I know it goes in it because I'm
gonna let Eclipse handle that for me I'm
gonna go new enemy ship and if I want to
use my constructor to get me a new UFO
enemy ship well it doesn't know what it
is
so I'm going to have to tell it to cast
it to UFO enemy ship and then call my
constructor on it new instance and that
new instance is requiring that I pass
over a ship factory now if you don't
know what I'm doing
bounce over here again scroll through
and you can see right here here's the
constructor and what's it being passed
an enemy ship factory see so that's why
I'm passing it even though the enemy
ship factory really doesn't need to do
anything that's how it works
and what's it gonna do it's gonna give
me some errors telling me that I need to
surround it with a try and multi catch
block so let it do that
and now that I've created this guy I'm
gonna be able to call methods inside a
UFO enemy ship just like any other
object so I'm gonna go new enemy ship
and let's say I wanted to call set name
which is something that UFO enemy ship
has somewhere where is it
ah it's actually an enemy ship yep there
it is see set name so this is the method
I want to call here on this guy so no
problem I'll just do that and I'm just
gonna throw something junkie in here I'm
gonna type in X 2 1000 you know it's
just nothing doesn't have any real
meaning and then I'll say I want to
print some stuff out I can come in here
and go enemy ship name like that then go
new enemy ship I know what I'm gonna
type if I want a name for something get
name because that's gonna be my default
that pretty much is used everywhere
right I can file save it and we can
execute this and see all these different
things start popping up and you can see
you sent 12 and random string where did
this come from so let's go back and look
at what we were doing here see this guy
right here whenever I created this
object see there is the object
constructor - and then here is where I
called my personalised constructor see
integer string + 12 + random string is
what I passed and 12 + random string is
what it spit back at me and if we jump
over here you can see this guy right
here
UFO enemy ship receives an integer in a
string and what does it do it spits out
you sent number and random string so
that actually created that object
whenever it called this personalised
constructor right here and then spit it
back on screen so let's go back here see
what else it did down here you can see
enemy ship factory you can see with this
guy right here this is where we got our
enemy ship factoring see I wanted to get
the parameter for the constructor so
what is the constructor this is the
basic constructor and it's saying that
one of the parameters are the only
parameter that it kicks back his enemy
ship factor and then the final thing I
did was I set the name to X t1000 and
then I told this newly created object to
call the method
name and what did it do print an enemy
ship and there it is so you can see that
I'm manipulating that object directly
inside of this guy so I don't even need
them in the beginning of what's cool
about reflection I can also access
private fields using the reflection API
and how you do that is since you want a
field you're going to type in field and
then I'm going to call this private
string name and give it a initialized
value of null and then it's giving me an
error message right here and that just
means import and I want to look for
field Lang reflect just click on that
and there that message goes away because
I now have the needle library and you
can see all the libraries way up here
say there's the field library that I
just added to it there's a whole bunch
other libraries so now that I have this
guy I want to create a UFO enemy ship
object so I'm going to go UFO enemy ship
this has nothing to do with reflection
I'm gonna call it enemy ship private is
equal to a new UFO enemy ship and then
I'm gonna pass it ship factory which I
created earlier so that it likes me
there it goes then I'm going to define
the private field that I want to access
here and what's cool about this is I'll
be able to access any field with just
this name even if it's sent dynamically
over so let's say private string name is
the field that I want to be sent back to
me I'm gonna go UFO enemy ship class and
then get declare field and the field
that I want to get is actually going to
be represented with a string and it's ID
code right like that so you can see
synthesis is a string I would be able to
dynamically be able to grab all this
information out of here and it's giving
me another error because I need to wrap
this in a try-catch blocks around with
try multi catch so I'm gonna give myself
a little bit of room but just to prove
to you that this could all be handled
dynamically meaning remember I said back
in the very beginning let's look at it
would it be cool if somebody could pass
over just a method name as a string and
I could execute it dynamically well
that's what I'm doing right now so let's
get back to that so here I am and I
could say string ID code sample string
and then inside of that write in ID code
like that and then type in ID code
string which is a string like I said it
can be passed over dynamically this is
what's cool about it I paste
that in there but of course make sure
you get the variable name right or field
name and this is the guy that I want to
get this guy right here it's actually
lower case in this situation so I want
to make sure that I have that as lower
case okay boom so we are got that safe
so that's how you can dynamically access
any field with just access to its name
see it's all dynamic so it's really cool
wrap your head around that some of you
guys are going to get it some of you're
not but think about it because it's
really cool once you're able to figure
out how to do that and then what you're
going to need to do is come in here
because we're going to be trying to
access a private field well we need to
shut down the security so that we're
allowed to access private fields and how
you do that is go private string name
which is this guy right here saying it's
the field and you want to shut it down
just say set accessible and then that's
going to be marked as true so that's
going to allow you to go in there and
get yourself some private field data now
once you have that set up if you want to
go in there and save that private field
data as a string for example I'm just
gonna go value of name doesn't matter
what it is we're gonna cast it into
being a string and then you just go
private string name which is name of the
field git and then I'm going to type in
enemy ship private put that there and
you can see here enemy ship private is
the name for my UFO enemy ship object so
enemy ship private you want to list
inside of here whatever the name for
your object is and of course it's giving
me another error saying put some more
dry catch blocks and I always do it this
way I always let it do the work and find
my proper catch blocks so you can see
right there that is how you're going to
be able to get the value for this and
then if you want to be able to print
that out on the screen Oh problem wrist
mount print line what are we gonna do
we're gonna print out the value of name
which is going to be that private field
we just got access to private field name
paste that there I'll save and then
execute it and there you are private
field name 100 and we were able to get
this right here
say so you're able to use the reflection
API to grab pretty much anything but
definitely information whether it's
private or not and like I said before
you can do the same thing with private
methods and also what's cool again is
that all these method names can be
passed as strings so just to prove that
I'm going to go string and method
aim is equal to and I'm going to type in
get private like that and what am I
going to do here here it is get private
this is the method that I'm going to be
accessing dynamically here so that's
cool
and if I want to access it while I'm
accessing a method so I need to create a
method and I'm just going to call it
private method because that's what it is
I'm gonna go equal UFO and on my ship
because that is the object that I want
to get hold of and I'm typing in class
get declared method and then what I'm
going to pass it well the name of the
method that I want to execute or method
name which is this guy right here
see dynamically created with that string
and it's really cool to be able to be
able to do that and then I'm gonna pass
it all over inside of here and there you
are
and what's it gonna do again it's gonna
say hey guess what you need to catch
yourself some more exceptions so I'm
gonna come down through here and add
catch Clause to surrounding try and
there we are so I've got that set up
again and now that I've defined that
what am I have to do I'm gonna have to
go private method and shut down the
security on it so set accessible to true
on that method and let's say that I also
want to get the return value from a
method I can just come in here and go
string private return value cast that to
a strength and then go private method
invoke which is going to execute the
method enemy ship private and then pass
it all again I'll save it and then if I
want it execute print out the return
value from that private method
system.out.print line and I'm gonna go
enemy ship private method private return
now and that gives me another error that
says I need to add even more exceptions
add catch clauses surrounding try say
got that handle then we can file save it
edie execute it and there you go enemy
ship private method how did you get this
there's the string if we jump over in
UFO enemy ship dot Java you're gonna see
this is the method that I called right
there how did you get this so I accessed
a private method called get private like
I said I'm pretty much going to cover
everything now what would you do if you
want to execute a method that has
parameters this gets a little bit more
complicated but basically you're going
to define the parameters
expected by a private method now there's
going to be more than one I'm just
making this complicated just for the
heck of it so it's going to be class or
a that's going to have a whole bunch of
different parameters so the first thing
you need to do is go new and define the
values of the parameters that are going
to be sent so I'm going to send an
integer and then you're going to have to
follow that with type and then I'm gonna
send a string which is a class so it's
not a primitive it's an object and if we
bounce over here again - UFO enemy ship
you're going to see exactly what I'm
doing here this is the private method
that I'm going to be working with so
it's private and I'm also going to show
you how to pass parameters to it so
again making is complicated just to
cover everything there is enough then I
want to provide the parameters above for
those values so I'm going to create an
object in this situation and I'm just
going to call it params is equal to new
object like this and then I type in new
integer and I'm going to pass the value
of 10 doesn't matter it can be anything
of course and then new string and I have
to pass a value and it's going to be
random in this situation close that guy
off and there you got that all set up so
now that we've defined what parameter
types we're going to send which is an
integer string and we also define the
values we're going to send which is a 10
and the string random now we got to get
the method by providing its name and a
class array with those parameters so I'm
just going to use private method again
because it doesn't matter I'm just going
to do UFO enemy ship class get declared
method and in here I'm going to define
the name of the method remember you can
do to have this by the dynamic can have
it be a string that is provided but just
to simplify things I'm not going to do
it that way this time but there it is
that's that name and then parameter
types it's going to say well what type
of parameters are you going to be
sending to me well method parameters
defines the type of parameters you're
going to be sending so we're gonna copy
then paste that down inside of there I
like that and then what are we gonna do
well we're gonna still enemy right get
rid of that error okay now that's fixed
and then we're going to shut down
security for private method again true
like that and then we're going to
execute the method and pass parameter
values for it so we're going to go
it returned values with this cousin
recalled this is going to be the return
value sent from the method after
everything has been executed so this is
going to be a string private method
invoke that means we're going to be
executing a method which anim method or
which method are we going to be
executing well enemy ship private is the
name and you can see that right here see
here is enemy ship private it's just an
object of type UFO enemy ship there's
that guy enemy ship private and then the
arguments that are going to be passed to
it are going to be the actual parameter
values which are stored in this object
array called params so just going to
paste that inside of there paste link
and then if we want to output all of
this information I know I hit you with a
ton of things but you guys have been
asking for an all-encompassing tutorial
it covers everything so here you are you
can watch it more than once if you
didn't get it the first time but if you
download the code you should be able to
get most of this because it is very
heavily commented and can be used like a
cheat sheet sort of thing then we're
just going to go private return Val
which is what was passed after the
method was executed file save and
execute and it gave me an error that's
just because I spelled parameters wrong
so okay she told me about that
so I have parameters spelled right both
the hair as well as their file save it
execute it and this time you can see
everything was printed out so here is
enemy ship other private method how did
you get here and then prints out 10 and
random and if we go to UFO enemy ship
Java you're gonna see get other private
method how did you get here and it's
going to print out the integer and the
string that you pass to it so there you
go that's a ton of things you can do
with Java reflection and the driver
reflection API is a more app name
feel free to leave any questions or
comments below and in the next part of
the tutorial I'm actually going to use
the reflection API in a real world
application way the next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
