of my Java video tutorial series in this
part of the tutorial I will pretty much
finish up the video game
so whenever lasers or tippy-toes hit
rocks or asteroids they will blow up and
play a sound effect whenever those
torpedoes are fired they will play a
sound effect whenever the ship is hit by
an asteroid it will blow up everything
pretty much all comes together in this
part of the tutorial and underneath the
video I provided a link to a zipped
archive for the whole entire thing sound
effects and everything so let's get into
code the first thing we're going to do
is go into photon torpedo and make a
couple little changes here ends up I
made a little slip-up inside of this
code whenever I set up the collision
detection see right here with get bounds
get width is not going to work what I
want to use instead here is get X Center
and that's going to give me my center
point in the end that's a method that's
built into this guy and this is going to
have to be converted into an integer and
then we're basically going to do exactly
the same thing here let's just copy this
except this is going to be get Y Center
so to have this properly work for
collision detection we're gonna have to
work with the center points and then get
width and get height are all perfect and
that is the only change I need to make
with photon torpedo so let's go into the
spaceship and make pretty much exactly
the same change okay so here we are in
spaceship Java and I'm pretty much going
to make the same exact change here we
got to look for get bounced so I'm just
going to look forward and there it is
and with this guy again we're going to
go get X Center paste that in there and
this is going to be an integer again
except spaceships a little bit bigger so
we're going to make that minus 14 and
then we're going to do exactly the same
thing here except this is going to be 14
and then this is going to be get Y there
you are collision detection all fixed
for both the photon torpedo and the
spaceship and now we're done with
spaceship and now we have to go into the
game board and make a bunch of changes
alright so here we are in game board
Java let's just start up at the top
because we're going to change a whole
bunch of different things one of the
first things going to have to change
here scroll
here to the bottom is we're going to
have to import some libraries so that
sound works properly and/or sound
libraries that works and we're going to
need is import Java X dot sound dot
sampled star there we are got that and
then we're going to have to import some
exceptions Java IO because we're going
to be working with a file a sound file
so I've got to get that guy as well put
that on a separate line then we're also
going to have to go import Java dot net
because we're going to point at a URL or
a Uniform Resource locator which is
going to end up being our sound file and
then import Java X swing because we need
a couple extra things for our jframe to
work as this is a jframe much easier to
load and play sounds inside of an applet
but I'm using the jframe so that's what
we're going to and we're going to scroll
down through here make a couple other
different changes we're going to create
a string and this is going to link to
one of the sound files and you need to
start it off with file colon and then in
my situation I have this in a source
folder so forward slash source that's
how you get into an upper level
directory from where you currently are
and this is an au file so got that saved
and then we're pretty much going to do
exactly the same thing here except this
is going to be laser file and then this
is going to be laser dot a iff so er
that's just a point towards all of the
audio files we're going to use actually
we're going to use another one called
explode but that's going to be in rock
Java and then we scroll down in here a
little bit more now if I want to be able
to play a sound like here I'm hitting
the forward or the W key well inside of
game board as you're going to see here
in a second I'm going to create a method
called play sound effect and I'm just
going to throw over to it the location
of the thrust file audio file that's
going to play and then I'm basically
going to do exactly the same thing
inside of this area where wherever we
are checking to see if the Enter key has
been clicked on and if it has we're
going to send over to that method that
we're going to create here in a second
the laser sound effect so I'm pretty
easy and actually since we're inside of
game
or I don't even need those nor do I need
that guy right there so let's just get
rid of that and we're gonna scroll down
and we're actually going to create the
method play sound effect and way at the
bottom of the game board class is where
I'm going to create it I'm going to make
it public static avoid lay sound effect
and it gets passed a string of course
which is going to be the name for our
file so I'm going to call it sound to
play then we need to create a uniform
resource locator I'm going to call it
sound location and it's just going to be
a pointer to the resource that we're
going to want to play here then we're
going to go and put everything inside of
a try block because any time you work
with files and things like that need to
do that I'm going to create a clip and a
clip is going to store a predefined
audio clip for me I'm just going to name
a clip and go null then I'm going to go
clip is equal to audio system get clip
and this is going to convert the audio
to a playable format inside of this J
frame then I'm going to call audio input
stream and this is going to hold a
stream that's going to be of a definite
length which is going to be the length
of my file it knows everything right up
front and I'm just going to call that
input stream for now rule up here and
give myself some room then we're going
to go input stream is equal to audio
system and we're going to have to say
get audio input stream and then we pass
over to it the location for our file
that we want to print out on the screen
and of course spell audio right then
after we have all that set up we call
clip dot open and pass it input stream
this is going to make the audio clip
available to be able to use and then we
can define how many times we would want
this to loop I'm going to say that I
want it to loop at all then we need to
say clip start right like that and there
you are that'll play the clip for me
then there's a whole bunch of exceptions
that we need to catch here so I'm going
to scroll up and just print them all out
we need to catch malformed URL exception
call it e 1 and just go a one print
stack trace just to keep this simple
because this isn't an error catching
tutorial this is a opie principles as
well
as video game tutorial and then your
house are going to have to go
unsupported audio file exception and you
can send it a you AI F files and WAV
files and I actually use all of those
different types of files in this
tutorial can't send in anything else
otherwise you will signal that exception
to fire then the last one is line
unavailable exception and that handles
all of the exceptions that I could
possibly have so then we need to start
getting into some collision detection
and making sure that asteroids or rocks
disappear when they're hit and ships go
in the right direction and end up in the
center of the screen if they're hit and
so forth and so on
we need to scroll way down inside of
here I'm looking for cycle through all
rock objects let's see if we can find
that and there it is okay so we don't
want to be able to show rocks if they're
not visible so we're going to go rock on
screen like this and we are not going to
draw the rock if it is not visible which
totally makes sense and that if block
then also inside of this guy we're going
to handle moving the rock so we're going
to say Rock move and we're going to pass
it the ship to check if there's a
collision with the ship as well as game
board or PTO's so that we can check if
there is a collision with any of the
torpedoes and of course this is Rock
move and we're going to create Rock move
here in a second and that is all we need
to do for the game board so let's file
save it and go fix up rock okay so now
we're going to have to come in here and
the first thing that I'm going to do is
to create a string and it's just going
to hold a location for the explode sound
effect remember you have to put file
inside of here if you want to jump up
into a previous directory you do it like
that and then like I said you can also
use WAV files so now we're going to be
able to play that sound effect whenever
the rock explodes then we're going to
bounce down into the move because
remember it's going to receive a
spaceship which we're going to refer to
as the ship and it's also going to
receive an ArrayList which is going to
be full of our photon torpedoes which is
just photon torpedo in this situation
and we're going to call those torpedoes
that all works good then again we're
going to say if Rock is currently on the
screen
we're going to perform some actions here
and right here after we check if the
rocks are hitting each other we're
actually going to move this up we are
then going to perform a bunch of checks
to see if the ship is hit by a rock and
to do that I'm going to go rectangle
ship box is equal to the show and then
call get bounds and that is going to
create an artificial rectangle around my
ship and then I'm going to be able to
just go if other rock which is going to
be the name for the rock that we're
cycling through if we scroll up here see
other rock is going to be equal to rock
get bounds which is right here so this
is the guy we're we're going to be
working with and that rock comes from
this which is what we are cycling
through for so we're cycling through all
of the asteroids and we're asking it if
at any point any of the other asteroids
come in touch with our ship on the
screen then we're going to bounce out
here and if they do we're going to go
game board play sound effect and we're
going to play the explode file sound so
there that goes pretty simple actually
and then we're going to go the ship if
the ship explodes we are going to just
throw it back to the center of the
screen because that seems to make sense
we're just going to go the ship and then
we're going to put it in the center of
the screen we need to go game board with
and divide whatever the game board is by
two and then of course if we're going to
put it Center X we're also going to have
to put it Center Y and this is just
going to change the height so we are we
are able to throw our ship into the
center of the screen and another thing
we want to do is go ship set X velocity
to zero so that's going to make the ship
come to a complete stop because we don't
want it to go into this end of the
screen and then start flying around
again we want to give the player of the
game a chance to just get their bearings
straight and then basically we need to
do the same exact thing for all the
torpedoes so we're just going to go for
photon torpedo torpedo and this is the
ArrayList that we passed over called
torpedoes now we're going to cycle
through all the torpedoes and see if any
of the rocks are hit by a torpedo first
thing we want to do however is make sure
the torpedo is still on the screen so
we're just going to go on-screen because
it's not on the screen well it's
going to hit the rock and then we need
to check if the torpedo hits the rock so
we're going to go if we're going to go
other rock and then in this situation
I'm going to use contains or just see if
the rock contains the center point for
or torpedo so I'll just go torpedo get X
Center call that nice method we had
before and then after that we're pretty
much going to do the same exact thing
we're going to say get Y and that's
going to say is the center point two
vectors for our torpedo anywhere inside
of our rock and if they are that means
that we just add a torpedo hit a rock so
we're going to say rock on screen
obviously if it's been hit by a torpedo
it's going to be deleted so there we are
we just deleted that and also the
torpedo is no longer going to be on the
screen because it's we're guessing has
been blown off when it hit the rock or
the asteroid and then we're going to
play a game board sound effect again so
play sound effect explode file and there
we are
so let's file save it and let's run this
guy see how it turns out
and you can see here I don't know if you
can hear this or not but as I hit the
spaceship it just exploded but I can fly
around and you can see it exploded again
and then I can also shoot lasers and
whole kinds of crazy sounds good flying
out of this guy you can see the
asteroids explode and of course I could
do animations with these asteroids but
that's going to use different image
files and so forth to make that work out
for me
but either way it is a working asteroids
game with sound and 100 percent
collision detection like I said the
location for the zipped archive is
available underneath all of the video
you can kit it right now leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
