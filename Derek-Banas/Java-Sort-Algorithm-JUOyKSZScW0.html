2 of my java algorithms tutorial today
we're going to talk about all of the
elementary sorting algorithms going to
take a look at two different search
algorithms and we're going to talk about
a whole ton of different things and in
this tutorial I'm going to try to make
everything much more interactive because
I wrote a method that's going to make it
very easy for us not to just see what
the algorithms are but completely
understand how they work all of the
arrays we're going to be working with
are going to be displayed in a
horizontal format like this and then on
top of that you're going to be able to
see the indexes and how they move as
they process information using the
algorithm so we have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay so there's a link
underneath the video to all of this
stuff and if you really really want to
learn it you should get it and then run
it as I am running it like this and flip
back and forth between the video or at
least that's my idea so you can
completely understand this stuff and
there's a link in the upper right hand
corner to a playlist for all of my
algorithm tutorials well where I left
you off last time we are using the
linear search and I'm going to show you
exactly how it works now we have our
indexes and there's going to be 10 of
them 0 through 9 and the way the linear
search is going to work for us is I'm
going to pass in a value and here's all
the different algorithms we're going to
be creating as you can see and I'm going
to pass into the linear search function
a11 and say I want to find it here we
are back up in the linear search method
and we are going to watch it execute
this is a very simple one all we're
going to do is start out at the zero
index and we're going to continue to
increase in value until we get to the
end of the array and we are just simply
going to go to the zero index and say is
17 equal to 11 if it is we are going to
add it to indexes with value obviously
it isn't but index two has 11 in it
that's going to be added to indexes with
value and 11 is nowhere else to be found
and as you can see it's going to go to
the zero index the one this guy is
representative of the value for I over
here I'm going to jump into to jump into
3 and you can see it is just simply
searching for all those values and
storing all of them in a minute you're
going to see the binary searching to see
how it differs
from linear search and then you can see
at the end it prints out the final place
or the location for the number 11 in our
sample array that we have here so now
let's take a look at our bubble sort
now the bubble sort will sort everything
from smallest to largest or very easily
by changing one little tiny piece of
code it's going to sort largest and
smallest and basically what's going to
happen is we're going to create a for
loop and you're going to see lots of
these guys and we're going to say array
size minus one and the reason why we're
doing that is because array size is
equal to ten and we only have nine
indexes and this eye is going to start
at the end of our array and as it is
decremented all the index is greater
than it are going to be sorted and we're
going to continue to do this as long as
I is greater than one and we are going
to decrement it so I is going to start
over here in the nine index and then
move towards zero and we're going to use
another variable to start from the
beginning and what it's going to do is
compare each value next to each other
and if the value is greater it's just
simply going to swap them so then we're
going to go int J is equal to zero and
whenever I execute it over on the right
side of the screen you're going to see
exactly what's going on it's very simple
and then we're just going to say if the
array for the value of J before we put a
semicolon there is greater than the
array for J plus 1 then we are going to
swap those values so we got a fasten J
and J plus 1 and we're going to create
this method here in a second and then
I'm going to use my new little teaching
tool print horizontal right and we're
going to pass into it both the values
for I and J so you can watch both those
indexes moving around that means we have
to actually create this guy right here
swap values very easy and all it's going
to do is swap the values so we're going
to throw that in there and I'm just
going to say public void swap values and
then inside of this we're going to go
int index 1 and int index 2 right like
that and then if we want to swap them
we're just going to create a temporary
variable and have it store the index 1
array value inside of it now that we
have that store
bird we can go in the sign whatever the
value stored in index two for that same
array in there and then we can go and
take index two and store it inside of
there the value for temp and there we
are we're done that's how hard the
bubble sort is now let's execute it and
watch it go so I got to come down here
and right here I am just going to go dot
bubble sort and it's going to print
everything out on the screen execute and
you can see precisely what is going on
so let's come back up to bubble sort so
we can compare the two and actually I'm
going to throw another print horizontal
array inside of this area and whatever
we execute you're going to see right
here that the value for I is going to be
equal to nine just like it should be the
value for J is going to be equal to zero
then what it's going to do is it's going
to pick an pair twelve to nineteen and
it's going to see that yes indeed twelve
is less than 19 so we don't need to
change anything then it's going to
compare 11 to 19 and see that yes indeed
we're going to need to change them and
you can see that yes indeed it did and
it's going to slowly work its way up to
compare nineteen to seventeen and then
switch that and continue again compare
19 to 12 and then switch that compare 19
- 19 know that it doesn't need to do
anything not worry about it then compare
19 to 14 and as you can see it changed
that and then as it proceeds it
eventually is going to come back and
switch this 14 to 19 but it's not going
to do it right now it's going instead
compare the 19 to the 10 and move the 10
over after it gets the whole way up to
the point where J is equal to 8 and I is
equal to 9 it is going to move 9
downwards because it knows that this
value right here is as great of a value
as anything in the entire index which as
you can see 19 is the biggest and then
it's going to repeat from the bottom
it's going to compare 11 to 12
da-da-da-dah and then once it gets to
this point 17 12 it's going to switch to
17 and it's just going to continue to do
that until it gets back up to the 8
right there and then it's going to make
the maximum index 7 and it just
continues to repeat that process over
and over and over again until the very
very last area where we have all of our
digits in ascending order
so how hard is it to change it so that
we have these in descending order very
simple just come in here where this is
greater than change it to less than
file/save execute and if we scroll down
you're going to see everything is in
descending order so there you go that is
the bubble sort and I think that makes
it very understandable whenever you see
everything on the right-hand side of the
screen and if you haven't quite got it
all just run to program yourself of
course it's free all the code is
available underneath the video so now
that we have everything sorted or
actually we're going to have to change
this to greater than because you need
this for ascending now I'm going to show
you how the binary search works so let's
double check yep there I get everything
in order
now the binary search is actually
quicker than the linear search because
all the values are sorted and because
everything is sorted once you get to a
number that is larger than what you're
searching for you know you can stop the
search so that's why it is much faster
however the binary search does not work
so well when there are duplicate numbers
because it's only going to find the
first match and of course everything
needs to be put in ascending order using
a sorting algorithm now to find this
basically we're going to go for the old
trick of guessing for a number between
say 1 and 100 a smart person if they
could then ask for if their guess was
higher or lower so for example if
somebody said guess I'm a number between
1 and 100 you said 50 and then they say
lower then you can automatically cut out
from your search 50 1 up to 100 now your
next guess is going to be something like
25 and then you can see that it cuts
down dramatically on the number of
numbers you need to search but to do
this we're going to have to have a low
index value which is going to be the
minimum search area or search number
that we're going to be looking for and
we're also going to have to have a
maximum or a high index and it is just
going to be whatever the maximum number
is and here we're going to have array
size minus 1 now what we're going to do
is we're going to go while low index is
less than high index because we could
never have our low index be larger or
even equal to RI index if the number
we're searching for is inside here and
then we're going to make our big
educated guess which is going to be the
middle index and we're going to find the
middle index by taking the high index
plus the
low index and then dividing those by two
which like I said before if it's one and
100 then that would be 50 then what
we're going to do is just go if the
array and then we're going to put middle
index inside of here is less than the
value that we're going to be searching
for well that means that our low index
is going to be equal to our middle index
plus one and four else if the array and
again this is going to be middle index
is greater than the value then we know
we have to change our high index and
make it equal to middle index minus one
and it's going to dramatically decrease
the search area that we're going to be
working with and if neither of those are
true that means we matched our index we
found our number you can see we're going
to find our number very quickly and in
that situation I'm going to go
system.out.print line and let's say I
want to do a new line and then go found
a match for value at index and then it
will be middle index right like that and
that will print out on the screen and it
will have no reason to continue
processing that information so to skip
out of the while loop we just need to
make the low index less than or equal to
the high index and I'm just going to go
low index is equal to high index plus
one and then I'll throw us out of there
and then to print out all this
information on the screen so we can see
what's going on I'm going to go print or
is on alright and then I'm going to pass
middle index into it and then negative
one is going to be whenever I want to
ignore that index that's just the way
that this program works and then I need
to actually come down here and call this
guy but we need the bubble sort remember
so I'm going to have to go new array dot
binary search for value and then let's
just search for 11 again just for the
heck of it and let's execute it and as
you can see it's going to find
everything very very quickly this part
up here is the bubble sort sorting
everything and as you can see everything
is in order and the very first guess if
we take 0 + 9 and divide it by 2 is
going to give us 4 remember we're
looking for 11 and that comes with the 4
index and it says is 13 equal to 11 the
answer to that is no ok fine that means
we can totally eliminate the rest of
this array and
we have to find a new midpoint so that
means our new high index is going to be
equal to three and if we take three plus
zero that's going to come out with three
divided by two is going to be equal to
one so now we're going to search in the
one index to see if we find eleven and
the answer to that is no so we raise our
low index to one and we add one plus
three like that divided by two which is
two and we can see here that we have a
value or a match for the second index
whenever we are searching for the number
11 and that is how a binary search works
so let's take another look at sorting so
we're going to look at the selection
sort
now the selection sort is actually going
to save a number in a minimum spot as it
finds it and then repeat searching
through the entire array each time to
slowly put the whole entire array in
order so again we're going to have to do
another for loop I'm going to say X is
equal to zero and then we're going to
continue cycling through this as long as
X is less than array size same sort of
thing over and over again and then we
are going to increment X we are going to
create a minimum value and have that set
to whatever X is and then we're going to
have another for loop and it's going to
be in and we're going to have Y be equal
to X and we're going to continue cycling
as long as Y is less than or a size and
then we are going to increment Y same
sort of thing just a little bit
different now what we can do is say if
the array minimum is greater than the
array value that is stored in the index
represented by Y well we now know that
we have a new minimum index and it's
going to be a whatever the Y index value
is pretty simple then what we need to do
is just swap our values and that's going
to be X and minimum are going to get
passed in there and if I want to print
everything out again we're only going to
be using really X here so I'm just going
to put negative one inside of there and
we'll be able to track that index again
all we need to do is come down here into
main and go selection sort and we can
actually X out bubble sort don't need
that and instead put selection sort
inside of here and execute and as you
can see when
look down here everything is sorted
perfectly if we come up here we're going
to see that our minimum value is going
to be set for 10 after searching through
the entire array so now we know we can
move our marker over to this point
and whenever we search the entire array
looking for the next smallest number
after 10 we see that we have a match for
11 okay great we know that's in the
right place now let's find the next
number that's going to go in index 2 if
we look at all these well we know it's
going to be 13 and as you can see 13 was
moved into place then the next is going
to be 13 again and you can see 13s there
then after that 14 and you can see 14s
there and that goes on and on and on and
on and on searching and moving up that
marker place until we have everything
sorted in the right order and once again
to change this to make everything go in
descending just change that right there
if I'll save execute and now everything
is in descending order
so that is how simple the selection sort
is now let's go into the final
elementary sort which is called the
insertion sort and it's a little bit
more complicated first what I want to do
just come down here get rid of that guy
and come up here now the insertion sort
is normally the best of all the
elementary sorts however unlike the
other sorts like you've seen here so far
and then he went one point in time there
is going to be a group or a part of the
array that is sorted with the insertion
sort that's not going to be true or no
least not definitely going to be true as
you're going to see here in a second so
what it's going to do is basically
search through the array find a minimum
and then put it precisely into place
skipping multiple different indexes for
the most part what we've been doing here
is just swapping indexes that are next
to each other the insertion sort doesn't
work that way so we're just going to do
another for loop and this is going to be
array size again and we're going to
increment it of course then we're going
to set the value for J equal to I and
then this is going to be the value that
we plan to insert somewhere else in the
array and its value is going to be the
array to start with right there then
we're going to create ourselves a while
loop this first part is just to make
sure that J never has a value that is
less than zero so we don't really need
to focus on that whenever we're
analyzing exactly what's going on
and then we're going to have J minus one
which is actually going to be the zero
index whenever we first start off J has
a value of 1 remember right here J 1 so
this is what we're going to use whenever
we want these zero index and we're going
to say is it greater than 2 insert which
is going to be a value that we plan to
insert there if it isn't the minimum
number already and then we're going to
go the array J is going to be equal to
the array J minus 1 and we can do that
because we have the value for J already
saved in to insert and if you're getting
it all confused you won't be once I
start running through this on the right
side of the screen and then what I'm
going to do is just print horizontal
right passings with the values for I and
J and then down here we're going to put
inside of the array the value that is
stored inside of to insert and I want to
print that on on the screen as well and
then this time because this is a little
bit more confusing I'm going to print a
ton of information out on the screen so
that we can watch everything go down
here we're going to go print line and
I'm going to throw a new line in here
and I'm going to say array I is equal to
and I'm going to actually print that out
let's move this over and that value is
going to be the array I so we'll be able
to see that on the screen help us keep
everything straight let's move this down
here and then I'm going to say array J
is equal to put that in there and go the
array J print that on the screen and
then I'm also going to print out to the
screen whatever the value is for to
insert we'll be able to see exactly
what's going on here got that all set up
so now I just need to go down in main
and do insertion sort da-da-da-dah new
array and insertion sort is the only
option for that put that there and if I
typed everything let's execute it looks
like everything worked out let's come
down inside of here and we can see
everything is in ascending order which
is exactly what we wanted it to do now
let's come up the insertion sort and it
let's actually watch what it does so
basically these two values are 1 and 1
which we know are true because that's
exactly what's going on there now what
we're going to do is we're going to
check ok is 12 less than 19 no that's
not true
now is 19 greater than 11 yes it is
so what we're going to do is store this
value 11 in to sort and then we're going
to take 19 and paste that value right
there so that 19 is now in the right
place and then we're going to take the
12
because remember 11 is what we need to
move in here we're going to copy 12 to
this place right here and then finally
we're going to take the 11 and put it in
the position where it needs to be now we
have three numbers right in order here
pretty quickly then we need to go
through and check whether 19 deserves to
be there or whether 11 should move down
we're going to store the value of 11
inside of there put the value of 19
right there go do the same thing with 12
by copying it right there
and then putting our other 11 right
there and you can see we're more quickly
getting everything in order however we
don't have large groups for example 10
still here where with the other sorts
that would have been up here much
quicker you can see that we're slowly
putting everything in order and that
process is just going to continue
onwards and onwards and onwards until we
get down here and we have everything in
proper order so there are a whole bunch
or all of the elementary ways of sorting
in regards to Java algorithms as well as
to different ways to search and a brand
new tool for us to analyze all of our
data structures if you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below otherwise till
