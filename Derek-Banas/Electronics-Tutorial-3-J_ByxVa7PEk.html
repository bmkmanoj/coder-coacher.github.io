3 of my electronics video tutorial in
this part of the tutorial I'm gonna take
a look at capacitors diodes variable
resistors schematic diagrams electronic
circuit diagramming software and a whole
lot more if you haven't watched the
previous parts of this tutorial you
probably should otherwise you might be
confused and there's links to those in
the description as well as links to all
the schematic drawings that I make in
this tutorial and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it and in the previous
parts of the tutorial of course we took
a look at Ohm's law which is extremely
important and how I like to remember how
to calculate voltage with current and
resistance is that the player that
played with voltage went to the IR so
just remember to multiply I times R to
get voltage and then to get current as
well as resistance you're gonna be
dividing into voltage with the remaining
character be it either resistance or
current okay so now I'm going to measure
voltage drop in a circuit by analyzing
resistors in series and I'm gonna have a
470 ohm resistor and a 1000 ohm resistor
and the first thing I'm going to do is
measure current by pulling up one of
those terminals it comes out to just
about four point three and then I'm
going to unplug or turn off my battery
and I'm gonna measure resistance across
the first resistor come out to 0.46 five
and then if I measure a voltage drop
that comes right out to be about two and
now I'm gonna use a nifty formula to
verify what I go out there with my
multimeter you can see that I plugged in
for current four point two six and
that's milliamps and we're gonna
multiply that times 0.4 six five kilo
ohms and we come out the result of one
point nine eight volts which is pretty
much exactly on spot and as you can see
here we have another formula that would
allow us to measure voltage drop in
either one of those two resistors and
that brings us to capacitors now a
capacitor is going to store electrons
even after the power supply is
disconnected and a capacitor is going to
contain two metal plates that are going
to be separated by an insulator or a
dielectric and while a battery produces
charged particles through an
electrochemical reaction a capacitor
instead is going to allow charged
particles to build a
on the middle place it contains now as
you're gonna see electrons are going to
flow into a capacitor and eventually
reach a point in which they have no
place to go and then at that point
they're going to block the conductive
path and then what's gonna happen is the
other plate in the capacitor is gonna
have what we call in that positive
charge transfer then is going to stop
whenever the voltage of the capacitor is
equal to the battery voltage now there
are five main capacitor symbols the
curved line is going to represent the
more negative side and sometimes you'll
also see a plus sign and in that
situation it is going to be facing
towards the most positive part of the
charge and also if you see an arrow
going through the capacitor symbol that
means it's a variable capacitor now
capacitance is going to describe how
much charge a capacitor can store and
the higher the capacitance the more
charge that can be stored so a
capacitance is normally measured in
farad's where one fair @ is going to
equal the capacitance need it to get one
amp to flow and because a farad is
considered too large for most situations
and so here what I did was just list
some of the more common capacitance
measurement in units you're more than
likely to see the highest voltage
recommended for capacitors designed for
DC Circuit's like we're gonna be using
is somewhere between 16 to 35 volts but
of course you should check with the
manufacturer and on this screen I list
most of the small capacitors you're
going to be seeing and the three-digit
system that they use and the unit of
measure that they match up with many
capacitors also have a letter code
that's going to indicate how far off the
capacitance may be or the tolerance
whatever you want to call it and you can
see all of those letter codes right here
now I'll demonstrate in a real circuit
exactly how capacitor works with some
LEDs I'm gonna start with a 9-volt
battery and connect that to my
breadboard and then I'm gonna get a
jumper wire and throw that in there and
then I'm gonna get an SPD T switch or a
single-pole double-throw switch and
throw that inside of there and connect a
two point two kilo ohm resistor now I
can add in another jumper wire over on
the other side of my switch and I'm
gonna get myself a 470 micro farad
capacitor and the
and of the negative lead is gonna go
towards the negative part of our battery
and the or you could think of it the
other way the longer end goes towards a
more positive end throw another jumper
wire inside of there and then I'm gonna
get an LED and I'm gonna connect to the
long end pointing towards the positive
part of our breadboard and then I'm
gonna get another LED and this one I'm
gonna plug it in in exactly the same
port and I'm gonna have this time put it
in the opposite direction so what
exactly is happening well basically
whenever the switch is down that's going
to charge our capacitor and as it
charges Kearney's gonna flow to the LED
until the voltage of the capacitor
equals the voltage of the battery then
the LED is gonna reach a point in which
it doesn't receive a charge which it's
going to dim and then the second LED is
not going to light up because it's lead
is backwards then whenever the switches
up the electrons flow into the opposite
direction out of the capacitor into the
resistor and lights up the led until the
charge is used up and now I'm going to
show you exactly how this works in a
different way using electronic circuit
diagramming software now if I'd use a
piece of software called AI circuit to
explain exactly what's going on here cuz
I think it might work a little bit
better you can see right here we have
our battery here we have our switch here
we have a resistor here we have our
capacitor and here we have our two LEDs
and currently if we want to set it up
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
switch down to charge our capacitor some
of the colder here and say closed and
now you can see real briefly there that
the capacitor was charged and that's
being represented here by having this B
green and you could also see that real
briefly let me just switch it back off
and then back on again
you're gonna see the LED lights up down
here and then it stops lighting up and
the reason why is it stops lighting up
just simply because it stopped receiving
a charge and then it dims and of course
the second LED doesn't light up because
it's lead is backwards so there's no way
to light it up you can also see here the
capacitor is now charged and now if I
want to power the other LED all I need
to do is switch this from closed and you
can see there that LED went and charged
we could switch that back and forth and
quite simply when the switch is off the
electrons are going to flow in the
opposite direction
out of the capacitor into the resistor
and then light up the LED until the
charge is all used up said thought that
would be a nice representation here to
see the circuit in multiple different
ways now something that's interesting is
that the resistor you use is actually an
affine how long it takes to charge and
discharge your capacitor now it's going
to take approximately five times the
resistance in ohms times the capacitance
in farad's so we're going to convert our
normal 470 micro ohms to 0.004 seven
farads and that's going to come out to
1.0 three seconds and if we multiply
that times five that's five seconds
roughly and you can see if we switch
this one whoops let's go and switch it
one two three four five and you can see
it pretty much predicts exactly how long
it's gonna take for that capacitor to
discharge as well as to charge now we're
gonna take a look at the sum of
capacitors in parallel and you can see
right there we have a 104 on there which
is equivalent to 0.1 micro farad's and
we're going to measure this using our
multimeter and we'll just insert them
and that's how we would insert them if
we want them in parallel and you can see
that they measure out to be around right
around ninety six point three nano
ferret's whenever we measure those and
then you'll see that they actually sum
versus the opposite with resistors and
it's gonna come out to right around nine
one hundred ninety two point six or one
ninety three on the multimeter now if we
measure the capacitors in series you're
gonna see that the capacitance is
actually reduced once again the
capacitance is going to be ninety six
point three nanofarads
and we measure them in series it's going
to come out to approximately forty seven
point six nano farad's and you can see
the formula there on your screen to
calculate this out if you want to verify
what you see on your multimeter now as
we saw in a previous part of this
tutorial a diode is a simple
semiconductor device and what sets it
apart is it only conducts a charge in
one direction now diodes can convert
alternating current to a pulsing direct
current it can also be used to convert a
radio signal into a charge you can hear
through a speaker and
is called rectification which we'll get
into later and a diode is gonna contain
an anode and a cathode and the schematic
symbol for a diode should look familiar
because an LED which we have already
covered is also a diode and the
schematic symbol for a diode has an
arrow which represents the anode and a
straight vertical line which represents
the cathode and current is going to flow
from the anode to the cathode and on a
real diode a white or black band is
gonna identify the cathode terminal on
that diode and that band is gonna
identify the terminal in which a
positive charge again we're going to be
using conventional current here when
we're describing this and it's going to
show where the positive charge is gonna
flow out whenever the diode is
conducting a charge and like we covered
in the first tutorial an LED is going to
contain two semiconductors the n-type
has more electrons while the p-type has
holes where electrons used to be and
whenever a charge is applied the
electrons are going to move from the
n-type to the p-type and of course
electrons won't flow in the opposite
direction and whenever you have a
conventional current we say that current
flows from the anode to the cathode and
that will prove that is exactly how a
diode works we're gonna throw in a
jumper wire and then I'm gonna throw in
a switch and SPDT again once again and
then I'm gonna get myself a silicon
diode and you can see where the line is
on the diode how it connects to our
breadboard and then I'll add in a 100
ohm resistor and then I'll add in
another diode which is our red LED and
this is a three volt battery pack and
you can see there it works however if we
come in and get our diode and pull it
out and insert it in the opposite
direction if we hit our switch it will
not light and once again just want to
show you a circuit diagram in here using
a circuit where this isn't a sponsored
piece of software it's just a real cheap
piece of software that works very well
cost about 5 bucks you can use it
anywhere you can see here is the diode
representation there's no arrows so you
know that it's not an LED then we have
our resistor we have our LED and then we
have
battery once again thank you see here
real easily that whenever I open or
close that circuit that it is going to
flow and I could come in here and delete
this diode all together and then come in
and throw in another diode and flip it
around and of course you're going to see
what's going to grab it like this and if
I switch the diode in the opposite
direction you're gonna see that it is
not going to be able to flow through
there let's just jump back over here and
and you can see that it's not loading
okay so just a representation
schematically so that you get more
comfortable with schematic diagrams and
can better understand them and in the
next example I'm going to show you some
other things about diodes as well as
variable resistors and the purpose of
that is is to explain that each diode
has a minimum turn-on voltage known as
its forward voltage and the silicon
diode is gonna require a voltage of
around 0.6 volts well an LED is gonna
require anywhere from one point five to
four point seven volts and if a diode
doesn't receive enough voltage is said
to be unbiased and the peak reverse
voltage is the voltage at which the
diode would actually break down if the
current flows in the wrong direction and
now I'm going to show you a project in
which we're going to demonstrate both
forward voltage as well as a variable
resistor okay so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna throw in a 470 ohm resistor
and this is a potentiometer it's a
variable resistor and then we're going
to connect our jumper wires and there's
going to be three pins on the
potentiometer and we're going to put
those jumper wires in there and
specifically it's a 10 kiloohm variable
resistor and what makes it different
from a regular resistor is it can change
its resistance and it can be used as
either a two or three terminal component
where the center terminal is going to be
connected to a wiper that is going to
increase or decrease our resistance and
if only two terminals are going to be
used it's going to act as a variable
resistor or array estat and if all three
are going to be used it is a
potentiometer that's going to form a
voltage divider now a voltage divider is
going to act just like two resistors
connected in a series like we saw in the
previous tutorial and
we increase the resistance between two
terminals we are going to decrease the
resistance between the other two and by
setting up the potentiometer so that we
have a terminal on either side of the
LED we can set the resistance of the LED
and since the LED requires a voltage of
1 point 5 volts to turn on whenever we
set the resistance of the variable
resistor below that we can also turn it
off as you can see right here and here I
thought it would be good to take a look
at our circuit once again so that we can
better understand our variable resistor
or potentiometer and basically what I'm
gonna do here is here I previously I
showed you just one LED I wanted to show
you two LEDs so you can see exactly how
the potentiometer actually works what
I'm gonna do over here is just change
the position of our variable resistor
and you're going to see how that is
going to affect our LEDs if we place
another LED between the other terminal
rather than just using one LED we're
gonna be able to switch back and forth
between which LED is going to light up
and we're going to be able to do this
just by increasing one resistance as we
decrease the other resistance and there
you go guys that is part three of my
electronics tutorial don't worry if you
didn't catch everything I will be
reviewing it and creating big projects
to explain everything further and before
I leave just when to thank all my
supporters over on patreon I'm able to
make videos like this because of you
guys so thank you very much and just
