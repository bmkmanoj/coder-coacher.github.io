presentation in which I will show you
everything that a famil to learn in
regards to how to get more views and
subscriptions on youtube so where does
all this information come from it
doesn't actually come from what I do it
comes from looking at what i consider to
be the best video bloggers on the
internet both in the past and in present
days and exactly what they do more
specifically I'm going to go through
everything a guy named J Frank did to
generate a huge commotion on the
internet and get tons and tons of views
so I'm going to really focus in on say
Frank if you want to see I'm mashup I'll
be frank it's in the underbar just click
on that link so what am I going to
specifically cover well I'm going to
talk about topics that are the most
popular to cover in video blogging how
you should video yourself and how you
should best edit your videos to increase
views and likes and how to increase your
overall comments likes and video
responses here's a tip for you don't do
what I'm doing for example presentation
style videos or consider to be quite
boring however this is just the way that
I do think so there's a tip for you you
definitely want to show your face again
like I said I don't do these things but
there is not a successful video bloggers
out there who doesn't consistently show
their face you want to edit your videos
very heavily you want to edit out every
single pause and say Frank even edited
out every single blank he made you want
to keep your videos extremely short
being about three to three-and-a-half
minutes in length seems to be the sweet
spot never go over four minutes you want
to constantly have reestablish your
overall brand for your show you want to
do everything you could possibly do to
get viewers to interact with you both in
comment sections video responses and you
want to post as many videos as possible
shoot for hosting a video every single
day if that is at all possible for you
now in regards to say Frank he was a
neurosurgeon by trade and I think that
he used pretty much everything he knew
about how the brain works in his videos
the best thing you can really do if you
want to get good really really fast is
just study all of the big shot people
all the people that are already getting
views and just blatantly copy them I
have this thing inside of me that won't
allow me to do that but that doesn't
mean that this thing inside of me is
right fact is almost everybody
you successful on the internet to a
certain extent copy to offer somebody
that preceded that and that's pretty
much true in life if you have a problem
with this just make videos that you know
the only you will see blatantly copy
somebody else's video and then watch it
and see what you're doing right and what
you're doing wrong and how you can
overall and prove so make a script of
exactly what they do in their video
exactly what they say in their video
maybe even special effects they use in
their video and then blatantly copy it
watch it and then see what specifically
you're doing wrong that makes your
videos less funny than this almost exact
video this will help you really hone in
on exactly what you're good at and what
you need to improve on again use a
script most of the big time people do if
you don't know what to talk about just
look for the hottest new subjects and
talk about them and some places you can
look her The Huffington Post yahoo posts
the most popular news articles of the
day Daily Mail is a london-based website
to post a lot of really salacious and
interesting topics oddly enough is a
Reuters website that posts all kinds of
funny stories and you have the Daily
Beast technorati posts again most
popular articles and then of course you
could look at Google Trends and google
insight another thing that say Frank
would often do is chase away or made it
seem as if he was trying to chase away
new viewers for example he would start
off a video saying that he was going to
go over common German phrases what this
does is it creates a general feeling
that the viewers of the video are in a
private club on a psychological level
this is extremely powerful you want to
then address all of your viewers as Club
members he addressed all of the viewers
of his videos as sports racers and
established a brand which was a rubber
duck and further reestablished that
brand by having viewers submit drawings
of the sports racer logo or the rubber
duck then what you want to do or what he
did was established the brand in a way
that it represented the group in a way
that he was the leader he often referred
to himself as knowledge then he referred
to sports racers and then on top of that
his best converts or his best viewers or
those people who were most willing to
interact with him were called members of
what he called the League of Awesomeness
you then want to use catch phrases such
as here's a catch for his he often used
I've got the wall not show me the baby
again watch the mash up and you'll get
an idea of exactly some of the neat
things
did you want to involve the viewers in
your show so you could do things like
show submitted art or pay reference to
comments or any videos that the viewers
had sent in to you this is what i mean
by how you should film your face but you
have to understand is most people are
going to view these videos i know this
is kind of a nasty picture but i just
drew it real fast see how the top of the
head and the bottom the chin are cut off
this is what is considered in general
one of the best ways to film yourself in
youtube video and if you look at most of
the big guys this is roughly where their
head angle is and I'm of the belief if a
lot of popular people are doing
something chances are there's a reason
they're doing it again edit out any
pauses never make your viewers have to
wait for anything to happen and don't
worry about when you're editing out
these pauses that your video seems kind
of jerky it actually seems like people
like these jerky movements act as if
you're talking to one person and not a
crowd of people again keep videos short
and then on top of that you should get
even better responses if you segment the
short three to three-and-a-half minute
long videos into smaller segments so
that it seems like everything in the
video is constantly changing for the
people that are watching it so one of
the reoccurring segments in the safe
rank videos was something from the
comments and then he would read
something from his comments how do you
get more comments and likes I talked
about this in a previous video but I'm
gonna go through this because a lot of
people sent any questions they didn't
understand what I was talking about what
you want to do is go out of your way to
read any comments people leave in your
comment section especially if they're
funny and what's a Frank did was kind of
ingenious at the time this might seem
manipulative at this point in time but
what he would do is he would post
whatever the last comment was if the
person also liked his video and here's a
demonstration down here let's say that
Jimmy also Jimmy has no idea that it's
30 seconds till the show but he posts
last in the comments section he's
excited yay I'm king of the comments
okay that's 30 seconds till the show
well Paul wanting to be the king of the
comment goes into the comment section
and posts again now it's 20 seconds till
the show and then mark jumps in trying
to be the king of the comments and posts
five seconds before the show mark wins
mark is the king of the comments this
was his a frank thing that he did also
there was Queen in the comments so what
this does I think you can say very
quickly would generate an immense number
of comments because people don't know
when your shows going to start how he
was able to get a lot of video responses
was to be a member of the League of
Awesomeness you were required to upload
a video of yourself doing something
goofy which he called a Power Move so
that was one way that he increased his
video responses also you could offer
prizes to anybody that issues a video
response free advertising say that you
will post a link to their channel for
example if they host a video response or
you will pick somebody at random and
talk about their channel if they post a
video response or you could do the
obligatory question of the day which is
what a lot of people do and of course
you want to reward people by showing any
video responses in your video another
way to increase activity is to get
people to do funny things like he had
the earth sandwich project which was one
person on one side of the world would
input their latitude and longitude of
where they would put a piece of bread
and then a person exactly in the
opposite side of the world was supposed
to play another piece of bread it was
just a goofy sort of interactive things
that not many people do online another
thing you can do is show other vloggers
and cross advertise so let's say that
there's a vlogger who gets a lot of
traffic but you still get a half decent
amount one thing you could do is pay
reference to that other video of lager
that other people might not know about
and then send your viewers over to that
vlog and say for example say Frank sent
me here that's sort of like a way to
sort of break into somebody else's you
have log and take some of their traffic
and bring it over to you also you could
allow viewers to control your show say
Frank had a system where that he called
fabuloso Friday that if he would allow
viewers to tell him exactly what he had
to do every single Friday then he would
build a show based off of what his
subscribers wanted him to do and again
in regards to content you want to mix
serious news and comedy back and forth
back and forth people love change just
to show all about news with no comedy is
boring and just to show all about comedy
is like kind of stale as well but if you
switch them back and forth gets kind of
an interesting take viewers on trips I'd
love to see what Australia or Africa or
whatever looks like show people what
your town looks like it's interesting it
really is then again you can create
music videos however you wouldn't want
to use copyrighted content because it
would just get banned by YouTube
eventually and again further ways to
segment the show that would be effective
would be to use a theme song or a funny
name for a segment and here are some say
Frank show segments
things i like that are gay and say the
opposite something in comments which i
mentioned before again you could attack
people that the majority of people don't
like another thing he would do that
would be interesting and break up the
show is he would show a picture and he
would make up a story about it like for
example shown here President Bush
pictured wishing he had a mustache it
was kind of just a funny weird thing to
do that help break up the show could
also talk about imaginary co-workers and
of course you want to end your show with
an interesting catchphrase his was
thinking so you don't have to and on the
right side of the screen is kind of
blurry but i thought i'd show some of my
most popular videos and what you'll also
see here is the thumbnails associated
with those videos also we're very very
interesting the fact is is if you have a
nice thumbnail chances you're going to
get more views goes up dramatically and
only partners are allowed to define
their thumbnail but there's nothing
keeping you from using interesting
pictures throughout your presentations
which will dramatically increase the
odds that you will get a nice thumbnail
in the end of course use good titles
don't use music people do not like it
that was one of the most common
complaints I got on all of my videos is
my use of music you think it sounds
great but it really I guess doesn't and
I've also been irritated by music in
other people's presentations do use
transitions for some reason people
really in the transitions use the
annotations to drive people to your
channel as well as to subscribe to you
and also to other videos that are common
in interests to the current video you're
filming put all of your videos they have
anything to do with each other in the
playlist so the odds are better that
somebody's going to continue watching
other videos that you have made on
subjects that are similar to the current
video and also watch what everybody else
is watching and see what's good about it
lists down on a piece of paper why did I
liked this video and then try to
incorporate those into your videos and
basically the end is just practice
practice practice and like doing what
you're doing that's the only way you're
ever going to make a lot of videos so
that's pretty much everything I know
about how to increase your overall
traffic on your videos again I don't do
a lot of these things just because I
can't really copy it's something that's
like inside of me if you have any other
questions or comments leave them below
and I will do my best to answer them
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
