tutorial on how to make a website HTTP
compliant as you can see here in the
upper left hand corner if you can't you
can view this full screen but either way
you can see that this website here I
have secured as HTTPS and this one I
have not scored as HTTPS
now if you can't see what this little
error code looks like right here it
actually looks like this right here
so now I'm going to show you how to make
this error code go away first thing
you're gonna need to do of course is to
get an SSL certificate now these range
in between twelve to a hundred dollars
but what I would do if I was you is just
go to support google.com the link that I
have here on the screen and it's gonna
show you all of Google checkouts
approved SSL certificates so chances are
if they are on the list then you are
going to be able to buy these and they
are gonna work so you might as well just
buy the cheapest one and I bought a
GoDaddy one you by no means have to but
the GoDaddy one is only $12.99 a month
and that is what I use and that is what
I used on this site to make it a hundred
percent compliant so why spend hundred
dollars when you could spend thirteen
instead then what you're gonna want to
do is go into your WordPress site but
this will work on anything I'm gonna
show you every website but I'm going to
start off with WordPress first because
it's extremely easy to secure so you
just go into your WP dash admin section
of your wordpress site and this is my
wordpress shopping cart that I have
right here there's a link to that
tutorial above because it's free and
it's awesome you like making money
anyway then what you're gonna want to do
is go down to settings inside of
WordPress and then right here where it
says WordPress address URL and site
address URL you want to make sure this
is HTTP s that's after you get a secure
socket layer certificate and you want to
change both those de tu PS instead of
HTTP and then you want to come down here
and hit Save Changes now for a lot of
you that's gonna solve all the problems
you're ever gonna have because what
WordPress is gonna do is it's gonna
convert every single link on the site
for the most part into a secure format
if you get this error like you I have
here on this website the reason why
you're getting that is because somewhere
within your code there is an HTTP link
and Google Chrome specifically doesn't
like that and pretty much know what else
likes that so one quick way
you can solve that it is to go and get
the firefox browser if you do not have
that and you want to download it and
then you also want to download a little
plugin or add-on called Firebug now you
can do this in a couple different ways
you can go to get Firebug dot-com
forward slash downloads and download it
that way or you can go under tools come
to add-ons click on that and then just
type in Firebug up here in the search
box just like I just did but my
situation nothing's gonna pop up because
I already have it if I go to my add-ons
you can see that Firebug is right here
so there's Firebug and then it's very
very easy to install all you do is come
over hit the install button and then hit
OK a whole bunch of times and then
you'll have Firebug well why that's cool
is if I go to a website that I'm trying
to secure for HTTPS and what I simply
have to do now since I have Firebug
installed is go and click on net and
then if nothing comes up down here
underneath this is gonna show me all the
different links all you need to do is
just go up and reload your browser just
click on the reload button up here then
stuff will start to show up you want to
make sure that you have all clicked on
down here and then you can see all the
different links pop up then what you
want to do is drift your mouse and this
works on every site not just WordPress
sites you want to go through every
single one of these links by just
putting your mouse over top of it and
making sure that every single one of
them is HTTPS after you have gotten to
the point where every one of these is
HTTPS like I have on my screen then
chances are your site should work and it
should be compliant even though it is
not immediately showing up as a proper
site inside a Google Chrome it seems
like you have to refresh your cache and
do a couple other things wait maybe a
day or a couple hours after you get rid
of all your HTTP links and so forth
normally it'll correct itself however if
it doesn't the final thing you can do
and I'm going to show you this on a
wordpress site again just for the heck
of it you can do it with any site this
is what it works inside of google chrome
you just click on view you do this in
any browser also and then go view source
and it's gonna show all your source code
for your home page and then what you
want to do is just do a find and type in
a TEP colon and it's gonna show you all
of your offending code it's gonna
highlight all of it and you're gonna be
able to go through here and check all
that code off and change these to http
link's instead of HTTP links and then
everything's gonna be wonderful now
however let's say that you want to go in
and change that offending code and so
outta WordPress you just do this in a
text editor for a plain Jane website but
if you wanted to do this inside of
WordPress you just come over to
appearance and then you go to editor
come over here and first off you're
gonna want to start in your index area
and now that we're in next dot PHP what
I want to do is I want to perform a find
for HTTP colon and you also want to do
the same thing inside of your header
file the header dot PHP file inside
WordPress is normally where you'll find
all these offending HTTP links and that
is how you secure an HTTP site leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
