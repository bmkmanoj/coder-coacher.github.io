8 of my wordpress theme tutorial and
here are links to all the previous
versions first where I showed you how to
turn a Photoshop file or regular image
into an HTML file then I showed you the
CSS that goes into turning that into a
working ready to be made into a
wordpress file and then in the next
tutorial I showed you how to turn that
HTML website into a wordpress theme and
then I showed you how to create a
wordpress menu and how to fix up the
style sheets well if you went through
all of that and there's a link to all
that code and a zip archive in the
underbar you probably went and looked at
this guy and then clicked on for example
sample page and went oh no it doesn't
work or you clicked on the home page and
went oh no it didn't work or you went in
a search field and typed in something
like garlic and we know no it doesn't
work well in this part of the tutorial
I'm going to show you how to fix all
those other pages and on top of that the
most requested thing is for me to show
you how to embed a Twitter feed in a
WordPress site I'm going to show you
that as well and a bunch of other
different things well first what you
need to do is open up some files in your
favorite plain text editor and those
specific files you're going to want to
open or archive PHP page that PHP search
dot PHP and single dot PHP and then what
we're gonna do is pretty much copy and
paste code from index.php into those
guys to make everything work perfectly
so I have index dot PHP and I want my
sidebars to be set up right like they
are in index dot PHP this is what's
showing up properly over here so what I
simply want to do is come in here and
select this and copy it and then jump
over to page PHP and right after the
header I want to come in here and paste
that in there
and this is where the loop begins so
we're gonna paste that code directly
inside of there and just so we don't
forget we're gonna come down here to the
git sidebar part and we're gonna delete
that to make sure that that other
sidebar does not show up then while we
still have that selected we want to jump
over into search dot PHP and right after
where it says template path right here
we want to jump in here and paste our
code inside of there and then you can
straighten this stuff up so that it
looks a lot nicer and then we're going
jump into single dot php' come up here
again right after the header again I'm
doing this right before the loop starts
on all these pages I'm gonna paste on my
code in there so it looks all nice and
neat and then I'm gonna jump into
archive dot PHP and right after header
again I'll jump in here and paste
everything in so that it's all nice and
neat okay now we're ready for round two
we're gonna go back into index dot PHP
which is set up properly and then I'm
gonna grab this div right here called
post lists and I'm gonna copy that and
then I'm gonna jump back into page dot
PHP and right before div class post this
guy right here PHP ID I'm gonna come in
here and paste that inside of there then
I'm gonna jump into search in here right
before we have the title area surrounded
with h2 tags I'm gonna paste my post
list in there and I forgot to delete my
side boy last time so I'm gonna delete
it this time then I'm gonna jump into
single dot PHP scroll down here right
after the loop starts I'm gonna paste in
that div again this is just so we can
surround everything and target it with
our CSS code get rid of sidebar again
don't forget that and then I'm gonna
jump into archive dot PHP and then we're
gonna have to scroll through all of this
stuff right here to try to figure out
which archive are gonna pull up until we
come down here again right inside the
loop and right before post class and
paste that inside of there then we need
to jump back into index again and we're
gonna look for this guy right here h2
post title dadada copy that jump into
page dot PHP and right after this guy
right here we're gonna delete this title
thing and paste that in there instead
then jump into search scroll up a little
bit and again right after this ID we
have right here we're gonna delete this
title area and paste in our own code
jump into single dot PHP look again for
post class right here where it's this
the title we're gonna replace this again
right like that and then jump back into
archive and in this situation I'm gonna
jump in here and I'm gonna put a class
inside of here instead class is equal to
quotes I'm gonna say post title because
it ends up this is exactly the same
thing we've been copying and pasting and
then we're almost
again we're gonna jump into index and
this time we're gonna come down here to
this thing called the post excerpt copy
it jump into page and we're gonna
actually paste right over here
again this is just a container a
paragraph container that's gonna allow
us to edit that CSS code or edit it with
CSS code then jump into search go to
this excerpt part pasted over that clean
up the code jump into single PHP there's
the content again paste over it and then
go into archive and then and again jump
in here paste that inside of that and
then all we have to do at this point is
to come in here and close off our divs
that we created I'm gonna grab this one
this is for the post list div copy that
jump into page dot PHP and then the
thing to look for here is the end while
and end if statement we're gonna go
right after that paste that in there
and then just to save some time we're
also going to create another div close
this off and this one is going to be
specific to end the main content div
right like that and of course this is a
comment you don't need to do this but it
definitely will help you in the future
so page is all fixed so we can file save
it and then we can go into search and
then we're gonna come in here right
before the end Wow and paste that inside
of there and then right after the end
wow we're gonna come in here and end the
main content keep typing code 10th so
that's all clean and nice I will file
save that jump into single dot PHP
scroll to the bottom of the screen and
Wow and if we're gonna come in here
close off post lists and then close off
main content and then we'll file save
that that's all clean and perfect then
we'll jump over into archive dot PHP
make sure to delete the get sidebar and
then we're gonna look for end while
again close off posts lists and then
close off main content and then file
save that and now if we jump over here
and click on single page you're gonna
see that everything works out nicely
there's home and here I'll zoom in so
you can actually see it sample page
there shows up and then if we type in
our garlic any at search you can see
that that also shows up nicely and if we
click on archives the archives page is
all
so works beautifully okay so now I'm
gonna show you how to make a twitter
feed what we're gonna do is go to
Twitter and if you go to twitter.com
about resources widgets which you can
see right there on your screen you can
click on for website and then you can
click on profile widget and what you can
type in your username right inside of
there and then you can come inside of
here and fill in all your preferences
and change your colors and your
dimensions and all these different
things well whenever you're happy with
what you got there and it will actually
show you did what it would look like you
need to copy and paste this code into
your WordPress website so what I'm gonna
do is to jump back in my text editor and
then I'm gonna go to sidebar - second
which we created previously open that
guy up and then I'm gonna come in here
right after the part where it says
subscribe and it's real simple I'm just
gonna type in h2 and I'll type in
Twitter feed just for the heck of it and
in a future I'm going to show you how to
do this using widgets and plugins and
it's gonna be much much cooler and then
you take that Twitter code that you got
previously and you can actually edit the
colors and such inside of here
and paste it and if you file save that
and you reload your webpage you can see
right here that it was able to jump out
there and it's grabbing my Twitter feed
and displaying it right there inside of
my WordPress site which is kind of cool
and remember if you want me to make a
theme for you for free in an upcoming
tutorials send me a large image of what
you want that theme to look like and
I'll pick the best one I get please

information because obviously I can't do
anything with that and if you would
prefer to watch something funny or
bizarre or depressing I got you covered
