my wordpress newspaper theme tutorial in
this tutorial i am showing you how to
turn this basic basic basic wordpress
theme into this really really really
nice wordpress theme it has a featured
content tool it's going to have a
lightbox it has everything you can
pretty much want if you haven't seen the
tutorial in which i created this guy
right here which is simplistic you
should definitely check it out otherwise
you will be confused i promise you that
well when i left you off last time this
is what we had we had this menu bar
system all set up however this was a
little bit garbled up here i'm gonna fix
that in one second all i need to do is
the code that we had previously i got
here on the screen and i'm going to
paste in the google library that's going
to link to jquery that's all i did there
just pasted that in you can see the link
here and this is exactly what you would
do is just copy and paste if you want to
link to the actual code i provide that
in the underbar underneath this video if
we file save that and reload you could
see that everything is all nice and
pretty everything's fixed up here with
the featured content tool so now i'm
going to continue on if you look at the
difference between this right here and
the previous guy that I had here on the
screen right here you can see that the
top bar is quite a mess so we're going
to come in here and we're going to fix
that now we're going to do that is by
using google web fonts many people don't
know this but there's all kinds of great
flaunts you can use for free from google
and i'm going to come in here and i'm
going to get one of them it's very very
easy i'm looking for a lobster which is
one that I just thought kind of worked
for this and there it is if you want to
add this be able to use this font in
your website you just click on the font
you want then click on use this font and
then what I normally do is come down to
advanced techniques and get this little
import right here and copy it then I'm
going to open up my style dot CSS file
and before anything else I'm going to
paste that in there great now I can use
that font which is really cool I'm also
going to change a lot of other things in
this tutorial as you can see this
background just doesn't work this is
much better and I provide a link to a
repeating background tutorial if you
don't know how to do these repeating
backgrounds so you can use real small
images that just continually go all over
the background of your page and keep
everything all nice and neat I'm just
going to jump right in here remember
this is style dot CSS and I'm going to
change some things here I'm going to put
in
background image like I said it's a
repeating background so how do i do that
i just go background dot image colon URL
this is going to link out to my image
and it's called lines dash 8 for no
particular reason and then you have to
go background repeat' if you want it to
repeat up and down the screen and just
type in repeating i'm also going to come
down into body i'm getting rid of these
filters which i used previously and i'm
just gonna jump up here and grab this
guy that i just typed in copy and paste
that in there i mean if i file save that
jump over here you can see now i have a
nice repeating background looks really
sharp so i'm going to continue cleaning
up everything here in the CSS code then
i'm going to jump back into the HTML and
play around a lot so i have to fix up
the header so what am I going to do I'm
going to come in here in the background
color I'm going to go 67 67 67 just
seems to work and then after that I'm
gonna paste in that repeating image
again file save link just that easy
that's all it takes and we're coming
down to blog title because I want to
style this remember using the lobster I
just need to change the positioning a
little bit here so I want it to be 26
pixels from the left 15 pixels down
still works great for me and white as a
color works great for me for font I'm
gonna leave all of this the same except
for this guy and i'm going to type in
lobster which is the font that I got
from google right at the beginning this
tutorial to houma and then i'm going to
type in sans-serif and in for text
shadow i'm going to type in 67 67 67 and
i'm going to make the blur on this text
shadow for pixels and this is going to
be two down and two to the right that's
all that is if i'll save that reload it
there you go there's my nice little
thing now what's a mess here is that the
logo is behind there I decided just to
get rid of the logo for now I'm going to
jump over into index PHP which is our
main file and i'm gonna scroll down into
this and you can see right here this is
where the logo shows up well i decided i
just want to get rid of logo you could
put the logo in there obviously if you
wanted to and i can leave everything
else here the same then i'm going to
jump back into my style dot CSS file
again the codes and the under barks if
you want to get it and it's free of
course i want to position that slogan so
it lines up a little bit better so i'm
going to change this to 124 pixels from
the left 40 pixels from the
the screen then I'm going to change my
font here we can get rid of the bold i'm
going to put 20 pixels in here and i'm
just going to leave this as georgia
serif i'm going to change this
background text shadow to 67 67 67 and
i'm going to make it only go down one
pixel to the right one pixel downwards
and i'm going to change this to two
pixels for the shadowing if i'll save
that reload it and there you can see i
have that real nice font inside of there
the repeating background everything is
really nice and sharp and coming
together so now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to get rid of this sidebar
here and start cleaning up all that code
so what I do I'm still in index dot PHP
I'm not making any changes to menu here
you can see here this is where I loaded
my featured content last time there's
the first sidebar and I decided I don't
want a second side Boris what am I going
to do I'm just going to come in here and
delete it okay there goes that second
sidebar now I'm going to come into my
first sidebar I'm start making some
change this with this guy sideboard
title I decided I don't want anything to
have a sidebar title as you can see here
I'm just going to put these images in
here that are going to allow people to
go to so different social networks so
for now I'm just going to delete this
out sidebar excerpt not going to be any
text inside of here but instead there's
going to be images how do i load an
image i go image source is equal to
images and i want to put an RSS feed in
there and it's going to have a class
equal to n TT which stands for new think
tank featured thumb trying to use class
names that no one else is going to use
and then alt text will just say RSS
title and we'll just say RSS again and
then close that off and then we're just
going to copy this image is copied boink
boink now i give everything a name that
is very similar so if i want the
facebook logo in there i just do that
twitter logo and then linked in which i
never use and then i'm going to change
my alt text for all of these all this
stuff's going to load dynamically later
but you always need to create basic HTML
and CSS before you can create a theme or
at least that's the way I do it and
because there's no real tutorials online
on how to create wordpress themes and
like video tutorials I don't know how
other people do it I'm just showing you
how I do it we file save that link you
can see there's little images are
popping up there on the right side of
screen so that's good we don't need
click for more here because there's
nothing to click
that and we come down to sidebar title
and let's say I want to put my pages
inside of here just for now sidebar
excerpt again this is going to change
I'm going to put it on ordered list in
here for now it was studied them i'm
going to say about again later on this
is going to be dynamic but i always do
everything in pieces because i don't
know how else to do it better close off
this on an ordered list i'm going to
grab this all right communication sales
I don't know I'm just typing in stuff
well but development marketing investing
and most popular and again we're not
going to need this click for more and
then let's say I want to put this banner
image in here this would be like an
advertisement how do I do that again I
just load an image I'm going to take out
this title here for now sidebar excerpt
and let's cheat come up here in the
image and this is called ad sample
because that's exactly what it is just
gives me an idea of what this is going
to look like I'm just going to put an ad
for now I'm gonna leave this click for
more in here just for the heck of it so
it's file save that and reload it and if
we come in here you can see that it's
not quite exactly what we want so how do
we fix that well we fix it with CSS
styling so we go into style dot CSS and
we come down to first sidebar their
second side bar remember that doesn't
exist so we can get rid of that code we
don't need it alright so what are we
going to do style-wise here well we got
to change the width on this to 250 and I
made it 250 because there are pleaseth
at verizon's that are available at 250
pixels so that's the reason why I chose
that you could of course change it
change it to 0 just the margin on the
top we don't need that and then I
decided I wanted to have a nice little
border on the left side so how do you
create a border on a div you go border
left one pixel it's going to be
extremely light gray solid DC DC DC so
that's a very very light gray color then
we're going to come in here to sidebar
title make a couple more changes I
decided this looks better at 14 pixels
gonna change this to 17 pixels changes
to Helvetica and sans-serif spine and I
decided I wanted this always to be
uppercase the text I'm going to force
that with text transform an upper case
then the color needs to change obviously
f2e and then I want these guys over here
these dots gone I want this to look a
little out neither like it does here
with the little borders and all
these different things so I'm going to
show you how to do that so if I want to
target an unordered list inside of here
I know the ID for this div on the right
side of the screen is first sidebar so I
want to target on an ordered list and a
list item that's how you do it with CSS
code and I'm going to go font I'm just
going to copy this and I'm gonna copy
uppercase copy okay so I got that in
there so it's going to force an
uppercase and all the fonts going to
look real nice and neat but I'm only
doing this on list items list style if I
want to get rid of that little dot or
bullet it's exactly how i do it just
type in list down none I want to put in
a border on the bottom study being bored
or bottom one pixel i'm going to say i
want it to be dashed and then I want it
to be not that noticeable so I'm gonna
use a light gray and I'm going to make
sure the separation looks nice for this
guy so I'm going to go board or bottom
or padding bottom I'm going to make that
three pixels and I'm going to put some
padding on the top too so it's divided
very nicely above and below and I need
to make my margin on the Left different
because remember I got rid of that one
side bar I'll make it third negative 30
pixels and since footer is already here
i'm going to style that up a little bit
text-align center is fine white is fine
adding 20 pixels is fine wherever I'm
going to define a height for my footer
to make sure that it is 220 pixels and
if we file save it reload it you can see
that the sidebar is looking really nice
and short and so is the footer area one
thing that's a little bit messed up
there is the image for the advertisement
new problem just come in here and define
a width equal to 250 pixels make sure
those quotes are the same and a height
equal to 250 pixels and we're going to
get rid of this class here file save
reload and there you can see the
advertisements in there it's jumping
down a little bit don't worry about that
that's going to fix itself now I have to
come in here and actually fix all this
content that's inside here i'm not going
to fix it all in this one tutorial but
i'm going to take a big bite out of it
so that's all contained in this day of
called main content i'm going to create
a new div and i'm going to give it a new
class and everything else in this new
class is going to be called featured
postive I'll put a little comment in
here because you're positive so that I
know when that ends just a nice place
holder keeps me from getting confused
and then
I'm going to create an unordered list
inside of here I'm going to give it an
ID that's going to be equal to featured
lists and then there's going to be a
list item and it's going to contain all
of my information for this post that's
going to show up inside of here Oh
another thing I can do is get rid of
intra title and intro paragraph because
I don't want those there anymore they're
gone if you're wondering this is intro
title this is intro paragraph if you
wanted to keep them there keep them
around okay title is going to be a ch3
class is equal to featured title I'm
just going to say post title goes here
remember this is all just sort of
creating a framework we're not creating
a final final thing I'm going to create
a paragraph and it's going to have a
class equal to featured excerpt and I'm
just going to grab some lorem ipsum down
from here this guy right here copy that
paste it in then I'm going to put an h
reference which is just going to hold
nothing for right now class equal to
click for more type in the word more for
the link there and that's going to link
them to the main article if they click
on it and I just got clothes off that
paragraph and then I want to get my
image which i'm lazy so i'm actually
going to scroll up here and just grab
this guy right here paste that in there
and because featured content is
eventually going to become a plug-in i'm
going to actually treat it that way so
that i'm linking to the plug-in itself
so it's it includes this image that i'm
grabbing featured content images and i'm
just going to use polar bear dash 60 by
60 jpg and i'm also using the name there
because WordPress automatically creates
60 by 60 images whenever you upload any
image to wordpress in alt text is just
going to be polar bear guess what title
is going to be is golf so when we pull
the bear and this is going to be 60 by
60 pixels and it's going to have a class
name this is very important if we're
going to be styling this guy of featured
image and we're going to close off the
list tag and then we're going to create
a whole bunch of these how many we
create I forgot I'll one two three or
four we're going to create four of them
so just to do this real quick I'm just
going to copy this two three four got
that in there and then I'm going to jump
over into I'm going to file save that
first then I'm going to jump over into
home
CSS and we're going to make cup of
changes here this is main content
remember this is where I was put in the
main content don't know how to describe
it any better net and let's say I wanted
to have a height of 200 pixels because
that sort of seems like that would be
good remember i drew deleted intro title
and intro paragraph so there's no reason
for those to exist anymore over here
this is called post lists this is what
I'm going to be making changes to this
guy right here and I'm also going to be
putting in that brand new stuff sooo
since I changed the margin and got rid
of that sidebar I'm going to change
margin right to 330 pixels and I'm also
going to give it a border on the bottom
of one pixel it's going to be solid and
it's going to be gray it's important to
keep your borders and all this stuff the
same otherwise it's gonna look dorky
remember post title that's this right
here that's what I'm changing won't
change the color on that so that it's
more fitting with my overall color
scheme so make it I decided the text
shadow is looking too gaudy so I got rid
of it margin left will be equal to 90
pixels text transform I decided I wanted
all of the titles to be uppercase so
this is going to force that font will be
bold 14 pixels 17 pixels and i'm going
to use helvetica or sans-serif angle
spell it right eventually there we go
post image is also going to change a
little bit and make that seven pixels
from the top and zero pixels from the
left I'm just cleaning this up a little
bit post excerpt is also going to change
a little bit it's going to be 95 pixels
if you don't know how padding works this
is top padding this is right this is
bottom this is left padding colors fine
line Heights fine i'm going to create a
margin on the top negative 20 pixels for
that image post content is perfectly
fine however i created all those new
featured posts and all that stuff well
to end this part of the tutorial i'm
going to come in here and actually fix
that up and then in the next part of the
tutorial i'll fix up everything that's
been left so i decided what font i'm a
featured post to be 13 pixels for and
Georgia and serif and I want the color
for that text to be 666 which is very
ominous padding top 15 pixels let's give
myself some space so
you can actually see what I'm doing here
patting tops actually going to be zero
and let's copy this padding right is
going to be five fixins padding bottom
he's going to be 15 pixels so I'm doing
is I'm moving these image this stuff
around on the screen that's all I'm
doing here it's nothing that fancy
padding left is going to be 10 pixels
and I'm going to give it a background
color white we'll give it a width of 250
pixels I'm going to text a line at left
I'm going to float it right all that
means is on bounce it over to the right
side of the containing div that's all if
you've seen my other tutorials you know
that and if you have and I'm sure you
stopped watching this tutorial
margin-top again making negative 10
pixels again these are just chosen
because I know what I want this to look
like when it's done so I just keep
moving these paddings and margins around
until it looks like what I want solid
yeah there's that light gray again so
now i get actually start fixing up the
actual content no it's called featured
lists from before this is Annie index
dot PHP file position it relative that
just means one basically position it so
that it goes with the flow of course
spell it right I would change my list
style to none cause I don't want the
bullets to show up that would just look
dorky let's scroll this up now I'm going
to come in and style the actual list
items so it's all you do it this is the
enclosing div and this is the list item
inside of it if you don't remember say
this stuff this is what I'm styling
right here specifically styling that
right there jump back over here again I
just want to position it relative just
go with the flow so all that basically
means margin left I don't want it to
have a margin more engine right note
that's fine and then I get a style the
title featured play you know background
color is going to be white color of the
text won't be a very dark blue went
padding around my title of five pixels
on all sides so I just put in padding
and five pixels and I ended up going in
here and change them a padding on the
left zero pixels batting top 0 pixels
and then I went and changed my margin on
the left 20 pixels text transform again
for San everything to be upper case just
because I like the way that looks for
this theme on
want it to be bold I'm using the same
fonts as you can tell here for the most
part because you don't want your phone
to changing constantly again it just
looks bad that's my future title and
then I only have two more things to
style here got my featured image that's
the image that's going to be associated
with these posts it's going position it
absolutely that means I want to tell it
exactly where to position itself but you
don't type in absolutely just type in
absolute I want it to be 20 pixels from
the top the enclosing div and 0 pixels
and then I've got my feature to excerpt
which is going to be the excerpt for the
article it's going to show up position
it relative adding 0 pixels 0 pixels 0
pixels and 65 pixels text color going to
be this gray again line height it's
going to be 1.5 and margin top is going
to be negative 20 pixels and if we file
save that jump over an index and file
save that let's see what we got reload
and you can see here this is coming
together real real nicely and the right
sidebar is looking great and everything
up here is looking great you can see
just that fast and pulling this theme
together in the next part of the
tutorial I'm going to fix this show you
how to put all this in here and fix my
footer and then we'll go on to create an
actual wordpress the newspaper theme
