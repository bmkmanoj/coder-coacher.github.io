one of my wordpress shopping cart
tutorial in which I will show you how to
make a totally functional shopping cart
system inside of WordPress technically
part 1 of this tutorial is my how to
design a website in which we made this
guy right here and I provide a link to
that if you want to check that out
because you should understand how this
works I'm going to be using the WP
e-commerce plugin in this tutorial
pretty much everybody loves it the one
thing they don't love about it it is not
highly customizable and that's where I
come in because this tutorial is going
to show you how to customize it and use
our jquery slider that we had previously
and it does all kinds of cool things
like clicking Add to Cart if you look
over here say that the product
automatically jumps in there it's going
to calculate shipping it's going to do
pretty much anything you could ever
imagine that you would like a shopping
cart system to do and this is what it's
going to look like in its semi final
situation or layout and this is what we
currently have so in this tutorial I'm
going to show you how to fix everything
here to make this look like this the
first thing you don't want to do is go
to get shopped dot-org and it looks like
this and this is where you're going to
be able to download the WP e-commerce
plugin and all you have to do is come up
here where it says download plug-in now
and click on that and it's automatically
going to download the WP e-commerce code
in a sip file you want to uncompress it
and then this was basically what it is
and then you want to take this folder
and copy it and then go wherever you
have your WordPress installation this is
what the folder should look like if you
can't see this view at full screen
you're going to want to go to a folder
called WP content open that up then go
to plugins and inside of the plugins
folder you're going to want to paste the
WP e-commerce folder that you just
copied and then we can close this we can
jump into our WordPress dashboard and
then go down to plugins on the left side
of the screen click on installed plugins
come down here to where it says WP
e-commerce click activate then you're
going to be sent a little warning
message it says WP commerce is ready if
you plan on editing look of your site
the blah blah blah update your active
theme just click on update your active
theme and it's going to automatically
load all the pages you need for the
shopping cart system to work not going
to have to do anything and I'm not
really going to go over all this stuff
right now I'm going to cover
that in later tutorial and then you're
just going to check off all of these
different boxes you have here and click
move template files and now we're going
to get into the nitty-gritty of actually
coding this guy so that it looks nice
like you see here on the screen so I'm
going to open up text Wrangler this is
my normally used text editing tool it's
free if you want it notepad plus plus
for PCs also works good and basically
we're just going to be using the same
code we used from my how to design a
website tutorial you're going to scroll
down here because this is where we're
going to be making all our changes this
is the little scrolling guy that you see
right here this guy that allows you to
scroll back and forth throughout your
different products so we're just going
to come inside of here downward says
demo inside of my code and I'm going to
show you how to pull very intricate
information out of this guy
scroll content item is a div that
surrounds all of the little pieces of
this jQuery slider let me bounce it back
out here so scroll content item
surrounds each one of these being the
picture the title the more info button
in the Add to Cart button so what we're
going to want to do is create a loop
that is going to automatically spit out
all this information I don't need all of
this so I'm just going to delete this
out of here down to where it says end of
scroll content item there now we have a
lot less information on our screen now
like I've described in previous
tutorials whenever you want to pull
information from the wordpress database
you have to use what is called WP query
here i'm going to show you how to do it
first off you're going to want to make
sure there's no white space on the left
side in here because wordpress sometimes
flips out if you have white space there
then you want to go my underscore query
is equal to new WP query and this allows
you to query the wordpress database and
we're going to say that we want to pull
post underscore type make sure you have
the quotes there is equal to then you're
going to want to say WP SC - product
just like you see there on the screen
like I said there's code underneath of
this video what that's going to do is
it's going to pull all of the products
and ignore the posts and the pages and
so forth it's just going to pull
products now I have to tell it how many
posts I want to get so I'm going to say
posts per page like that and I'm going
to say 11 because that's what works best
for my little tool I'm gonna put another
comma and then I'm going to say WP SC
product underscore category I like that
and I'm going to say that I want all the
products that are in the featured
category that's what that means right
there and then close that off that's
gonna give me 11 products that are in
the featured category inside of this
tool okay so it's pretty easy to
understand and I'm just going to close
that off and what I'm going to say is
while there are still posts to be pulled
I'm going to say my underscore query
have posts pretty much exactly what it
says there while I have posts that meet
the above criteria my underscore query
what this is going to do is it's going
to pull all the information later on
I'll show you how to load information
into those guys and nothing changed this
guy right here is just going to go right
here so we're just pasting exactly what
I was describing there make sure it
comes after div class scroll - content
like you see right there then when I
have scroll content item these contain
the image the title and then all my
buttons so basically I just have to come
in here and point at that information
now the first thing we're going to work
with is product image or prod image as I
have right here
and I'm going to come in here to the
source section and a query WordPress to
get me exactly what I want which is the
thumbnail that is associated with the
product and you just OWP SC the
underscore product and then underscore
thumbnail took me a while to dig up all
of these different things then I'm going
to say I want it to be 125 by 125 pixels
next thing I just leave blank and then
I'm going to put in single right like
that then close off the PHP and this is
going to pull in the actual location for
the product thumbnail and it's going to
give it these dimensions so that's all
it's done 125 125 pixels not rocket
science then we're going to leave class
the product the same as all it was
before except we're going to add alt
text to this guy and this alt text is
going to be the title so we're going to
call the title WordPress that's pretty
cool
makes it real easier to remember what
you want and close off that PHP and then
put yourself a little closing quote so
that's going to grab my thumbnail and
it's also going to grab the title and
assign it to alt text so as you can see
here I'm not really changing that many
different things and we're coming down
to product name now again I want to make
this
dynamic so I'm going to go inside of
here now if I want the actual page
assigned to this product name to be
loaded if somebody clicks on that title
I'm going to do another PHP block inside
of here I'm going to go echo I'm going
to say get my link and that's going to
automatically transpose inside of there
the location for the product page for
the URL I just have to say product
- little caret symbol and input ID
inside of there and then we can close
that off and then close off my PHP code
and just leave that quote inside of
there that's fine and then inside is of
this anchor tag I'm also going to play
title is equal to I'm going to make
another call to PHP I'm going to go echo
and I'm going to call a function called
get the title and this is also going to
return the title product - carrot ID so
that I have a little bit more
information and close off the PHP
section and then don't forget to put
little quotes around that and then
quotes at the end of that and then
inside here we have to actually fetch
the title and we also want to make sure
that the title isn't too long so I'm
going to go PHP and I'm going to say ntt
which is shorthand I use all the time
new think-tank my website the underscore
and I do that so that I don't conflict
with anything else that might be going
on inside here I'll try to avoid using
variables that are used elsewhere and to
get the title I'm going to go ID like
that that's going to assign the title
for the actual product to ntt title and
then I'm going to go echo call the
substring function inside of PHP and go
ntt the title and I'm going to say I
want the first 43 character so from the
zero character of the first character to
the little 43rd character because that
fits nice and then that goes well now we
got to get that into the product more
info button in this situation I'm going
to show you how to provide a button on
the screen that is going to take you to
the product page so in this situation
I'm just going to get rid of this all
together and instead I'm going to type
in input typ e is equal to and I'm going
to say button value and value is going
to be what is going to be printed on my
button gonna be more info class it's
going to be equal to NT T sub MIT but
and I'm putting that on there so that I
can style this and then
say on-click is equal to window dot
location dot H reference is equal to and
in here I got to fetch the actual
location for the product page again get
perma link product - ID close that off
goes off my PHP code put that little
quote inside of there semicolon quote
and enclose that off so that's going to
give me a button that I'm going to be
able to style because I have this class
assigned to it and if that button is
clicked it's going to send them to the
location for the product page itself so
that's what all that does then there's
actually a shortcut that I can use for
the Add to Cart button and this is
really cool
so I'm just going to go inside here and
this is provided by WP e-commerce the
plug-in itself this PHP you can just go
echo WP SC Add to Cart button ID that's
the ID for the page and for the product
right like that and then that's all done
so that's cool
and then right here I have to actually
close my while loop see here's the while
loop that I'm talking about so I have to
actually close that guy I'm just going
to go PHP and while this guy right here
is actually going to be the scroll
content bang I like to put comments
inside of here so this is going to be
scroll content div that surrounds that
and pretty much everything else here can
be exactly the same but what I need to
do now is go into the Style section so I
could actually save this guy and then
what I need to do is go into JQ slider
two which is from the previous tutorial
I'm kind of guessing that you've seen
that if you have and again watch it
otherwise you've probably already left
this thing anyway and then inside of
here what I'm going to want to do is
change those buttons that we just
created and let's go back and take a
look at this again what I'm basically
going to do is change the styling on
these buttons so that they look really
nice like you see in real on the screen
and this by the way is a way to change
buttons and using WP commerce this is an
often question that is posed to people
and so that's one of the reasons why I'm
doing it another thing is how to create
a slider inside of WP e-commerce which
obviously I'm showing how to do that as
well basically what I want to do is I'm
going to get rid of the styling just by
commenting it out I know it's not
supposed to do this but this is the way
I develop so I'm going to get rid of all
the other stylings because these are
buttons now there
not links so there's no reason to try to
treat them like they are links so that's
commented out and what I'm going to do
is I'm going to make styling changes to
ntt sub knits but right like that and
this is the class that's assigned to the
submission button right here that is
called more information tab that in
Andrus a background - color and I'm just
going to use exactly what we used before
which is five three five three five
three no usin typing that out just do
that and then I'm also going to change
font size this is all subjective what
I'm doing here you can do whatever you
want this is just the way that you style
buttons inside of pretty much anything
but this is how you style buttons we're
using WP e-commerce which is a question
that people have and if you play around
with it for a while you also have it and
then what I'm going to do is also style
the second but face that inside of there
and this guy you may actually wonder how
I even know what this is so I'm going to
show you for this guy right here I'm
going to come in and I showed you this
in the previous tutorial this is Google
Chrome when I'm having what I have here
and I'm going to click on inspect
element now if I want to figure out what
class is assigned to this button right
here Add to Cart because remember that
was all pulled in dynamically using the
special code that's provided by WP
e-commerce so for right now let's just
file save that and then we'll jump back
over to index so I can show you alright
so we're in index dot PHP and if we come
down here just refresh your memory right
here we're using a customized thing that
is a customized function that's built
into WP e-commerce this is going to pull
out the button and display it on the
screen which is all great except for the
fact if I want to change styling on this
button how do I know how to do that well
that's where I'm gonna show you now so
again inspect element come in to this
guy and we're basically just going to
float around here until what I want to
edit or see more about is highlighted
I'm going to open that up and then I
know it's contained inside the demo
class so I'm going to open up the demo
class and then it's also going to be
inside a scroll pane and it's also going
to be inside of scroll content scroll
content item and then if we come down
here to div class product Add to Cart
you can see right here that there is a
class assign to this button and if we
click further into the form you can see
right here that class WP SC by button
sorry I can't increase the text size on
this
just trust me that there's a class here
called WPS C underscore by underscore
button and I use Google Chrome to be
able to find all that information out so
now I know I need to style that specific
class so let's open this back up and
then we'll jump over into jQuery slider
to jQuery product slider dot CSS and
we're going to scroll back down inside
of here again alright so here's where I
have this so instead of ntt submit
button I'm going to go WP SC by Dutt o n
and this is going to allow me to perform
styling on that so I'm just going to
copy what we used before except now it's
going to be a cool-looking button
instead of boring stuff alright and
change the background on this star that
out and then come down here because
these aren't anchor tags anymore the
buttons gonna get rid of it boom and
that's all you need to do to make this
guy work so if you make all those
changes you'll see exactly what I have
here on your screen and the next part of
the tutorial I'm going to show you how
to play around with WP e-commerce change
all kinds of things
fix your show up and card fix your
shipping go over all the different
options available to you and a whole
bunch more leave any questions or
comments below otherwise still next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
