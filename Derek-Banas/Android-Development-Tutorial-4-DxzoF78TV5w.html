4 of my android development tutorial
over the next two tutorials we are going
to cover radio buttons radio groups
checkboxes drop downs or spinners
buttons corona' meters change listeners
items selected listeners and on-click
listeners and a whole bunch of other
things so I have a lot to do so let's
get into it okay in the last part of the
tutorial we created this crazy tip
calculator and these are going to be all
the different things I am going to be
adding to it over the course of this
tutorial in the next tutorial so of
course we've already covered text views
edit views spinners and a whole bunch of
different listeners well we're going to
cover a whole bunch of other listeners
along with all of these other different
things and if you don't know what this
is this is a drop down box or a spinner
so basically what I'm going to do is I'm
going to model what's here on the left
side of the screen on the right side of
the screen and all the code is available
to link underneath the video and what
I'm going to be playing with is the
Activity XML file the strings.xml file
and then the crazy tip Calva file so
basically the first thing I need to do
is go into graphical layout for the
Activity XML file it's called activity
crazy tip now because that's what I
called it in last part of the tutorial
and basically what I want to do is just
put all of these different pieces in
over here so the very first thing we
need to do I'm going to try to zoom in
here in a weird way so you can sort of
see what's going on I'm going to first
come in here and put introduction in
there and all these other different
things well that basically means I need
to go into strings.xml and define them
first so I'm just going to grab a whole
bunch of these guys and I'm going to
give them names that make sense so I'm
going to go something like intro text
view and then I'm going to call this
introduction just like you see right
there so all these different words I'm
going to define them over in my
strings.xml file so let's make a whole
bunch more of these and here I'm going
to need to define all of my check boxes
so I'm going to call this something like
intro friendly textview and here we're
just going to check if our waiter or
waitress was friendly might as well just
paste these in here and we're going to
check today remind us of the specials
that were available and then I'm just
going to put specials
if you can't see this view at full
screen it's a 1080p video and did they
offer their opinion on the different
things that I asked for I don't know I'm
just guessing here I'm just making up a
whole bunch of things just so I have
something to grade the waitress on okay
then after I have that to fine I'm going
to set up everything that I need for my
radio buttons and first thing we're
going to check is their availability
whenever we needed them to do something
for us so just change that to
availability paste that in there and
then I'm going to say bad radio button
and then just copy that down here and
then we'll go okay we're good depending
upon how available they were and then
for these I'm just gonna change it to
bad okay and good of course now I'm
gonna do the same thing for my
chronometer and the chronometer is going
to allow me to come in here and actually
take note of how long I have to wait for
service like I said I'm just making up a
bunch of different ways to grade my
server
I definitely don't mean to be mean and
if you're wondering I normally give good
tips so being forced to be mean in this
situation and then we're going to do
start chronometer button then we're
going to define a whole bunch of buttons
to start pause and reset the chronometer
which is just a little timer and just
change that to start pause and reset and
then for the spinner this guy right here
what we need to define for that if we're
going to be doing this in slightly a
different way we're going to actually
need to define this like a list so this
is going to be string - array name and
then I'm going to call this
problem-solving like that and then
change this to string array get rid of
this reset and then inside of this we're
gonna go item and we're going to put all
of our items so if I want this to just
to be problem-solving I'm going to put
it like that and then the next item I'm
going to keep this real simple I'm going
to say bad okay and good again and there
we are that's all the resources I need
because that is all the text that we
have here so now what I got to do is
save that and then go into the activity
XML file and start creating everything
I'm going to trust you you can see
that's good enough just so that I can
keep this all nice and tight
so the very first thing I'm going to do
of course is grab a little text view and
drag it down inside of here and then I'm
going to put introduction inside of it
and to do that there's my text view
right here and then for this guy I'm
going to call this intro text view get
rid of that part click over here and
click on yes and here for the actual
text I'm going to click in here and then
come over here and look for intro text
view and now that's going to say
introduction there we are the next thing
I need to do is get all my check boxes
here on the screen and to do that I'm
just going to grab some check boxes and
throw them on the screen here there's
one and I'm going to do these one by one
and I'm going to call this friendly
check box con yes click on OK
and then come in here to the check box
area and of course it's going to be
intro friendly text view and you can see
that it now shows up and then I'm going
to grab another check box drag it on the
screen come back over here and then this
guy is going to be specials
check box click over here click on yes
click on OK and then for the text just
go
intro specials text view and then change
the specials and then come here grab
another check box throw it on the screen
come over here
call this opinion check box click here
click yes click OK and then here for the
text it's going to be intro opinion and
there we go
now I got all my check boxes all set up
now the next thing I need to do is set
up availability and then I'm going to
have to create a radio group and then
put a bunch of radio buttons inside of
it so availability is going to be very
easy I'm just going to drag a text view
down here come over here I'm gonna say
available text you get rid of that click
yes click OK click this available text
view and now we have that all set up
that now says availability well now if I
want a grouping of radio buttons what I
need to do is come down here and this is
a radio group and I'm going to grab it
and just throw it in there I know we
don't want it to be set up this way so
if we want it to be horizontal we just
need to come over here at orientation
click on that change this to horizontal
click on OK and there we go
we got a horizontal one now I actually
prefer whenever I'm playing around with
this not to edit everything over there
I'm actually going to come down into the
raw XML file and edit everything it's a
lot easier for you to read as well and
then this is going to be set for true by
default which is perfectly fine and then
I'm going to name all of these different
names so for radio group you can knock
that one off of there and I'm going to
change this to available radio group
don't need to change anything else there
unless you want to and then for the
radio button
I put available radio and then for the
first one I'm going to put bad and I'm
going to copy that paste that in there
call this okay and then for this radio
button paste it in there as well and
here I'm going to say good so got all
this jump back over into the graphical
layout and these don't have the right
names on them so I have to go in there
and correct that so the first one we got
is text and this is going to be bad so
available bad radio button and now
that's set right and then we come into
this one and this is going to be okay
available okay radio button got that set
click on this go back over here click on
that and this one's going to be good
radio button there we are
got all those set up now what I need to
do is come in here and set up my spinner
now for the spinner that's this weird
thing right here we're just gonna grab
it and drag it down here and drop it in
somewhere I know it looks really weird
and I'm gonna resize it a little bit
then for this guy I'm gonna come over
here change the ID for this and I'm
going to call this problems spinner rid
of that of course it yes and that's just
updating the our Java file that's all
that's doing then we get that set up and
also with working with spinners I like
to just go in here and mess around with
the raw stuff we got here so here is our
spinner problem spinner all that's fun
and everything else is okay we just have
to point to this guy that we created
this string array right here so come in
here and to do that we go Android and we
type in entries is equal to and here
we're going to put at array problem
solving and that's going to grab that
array and put it inside of there for us
and that just leaves us with this
textview the chronometer and these three
buttons so go into
EXIF you again drag it down here throw
this in here somewhere
come over here give it a name and I'm
going to call this time waiting text
view click of course it yes and hit OK
and then over here for the text that's
going to be time waiting text to do and
there we go
time waiting for service so now what we
need to do is put the chronometer inside
of there and that is down here under
time and date and there's chronometer
it's a little feller just gonna throw
that in there right there and I'm not
gonna do a whole lot with it
well I go select it first I'm gonna come
in here and call that time waiting
chronometer capitalize that and that's
really there just so I can use it to
code easily and then we need to get our
three buttons start pause and reset and
that is up inside of form widgets and
this time I'm just gonna grab this small
button here it doesn't matter both
buttons work the same just look a little
bit different actually I'm just gonna
grab all three of them here right in a
row and they're gonna resize depending
upon the text that's inside of them
you're also going to line up themselves
okay so I can just select that and I'm
going to call this start chronometer
button we got here click yes click OK of
course and then in the text that comes
up click there and start chronometer
button and I gotta get this button which
is going to be pause change this to
pause chronometer a button click on that
click yes click OK and that's paused
chronometer button and you can see
that's fixed and then finally we got to
do reset and then under text click over
here and finally reset chronometer
button so we go we just created our
whole entire interface so I can get rid
of this guy and we have everything set
up so now basically I just need to go
into crazy tip calc and initialize all
those components all together so here we
are in crazy typical Java and I'm just
going to come down here into this area
and the very first thing I want to do
here is as I'm checking off all these
things I'm going to keep track of them
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
sum all the totals for all the radio
buttons checkboxes and all these
different things and I'm going to create
a private int integer array and I'm
going to call it check list values and
just understand I'm not
doing everything here in any way to
optimize things because I'm trying to
show you 50 million different things and
make it understandable and sometimes
optimizing things makes things less
understandable so we're going to have
that then what I want to do is declare
all my check boxes so I'm going to go
check box friendly and if you're
wondering what I have sitting in front
of me it is strings dot XML this is what
I did so after I have all those
different things set up inside of here I
print out strings.xml and then I write
all this code from it so we're gonna go
check box and I have three check boxes
and the first one is friendly next one
is specials and then finally we have
opinion okay so we got all those setup
declared or whatever after I get the
check boxes all set up I now want to do
the radio group and that's just
available radio group and that is just
this stuff right here let's just click
down here inside of this see available
radio group this is where all this
different stuff is coming from
then I'm going to do the same thing for
radio button available add radio and I'm
going to do the same thing for all the
other ones and this is going to be okay
radio and this is going to be good radio
now I want to do my spinner so I'm gonna
go spinner call this the problem spinner
I need to declare all my buttons you
just do that by typing in button start
chronometer button and this is going to
be pause button and this is going to be
reset and then I'm going to need to
declare my chronometer just chronometer
and I'm gonna call it time waiting
chronometer and then what I'm also gonna
do with this is I'm actually going to
log the number of seconds in this
situation in the real world you would
use minutes if you're trying to track
the performance of a waitress but so
that we can actually see results when we
run the code and stuff I'm actually
going only gonna give my waitress 10
seconds to get me my meal just
understand that's just something that
I'm doing because this is a video
tutorial and we can't afford to wait 10
minutes as it does it stuff and I might
want to do something with the text view
for the firm owner I'm I'm not certain
about that yet but it's not going to
hurt anything just to declare this so
I'm just going to call that time waiting
textview and now inside of on create
what we're gonna do is initialize all
these things so just keep coming down
here and I'm going to come back to the
very very end of this and so I don't
spell anything wrong I'm actually gonna
copy these guys come down inside of here
again paste that in there get rid of
this and get rid of this and then inside
of this to initialize it we need to have
to do checkbox then we're gonna go find
view by ID and we get the ID from the
our Java file and this guy is going to
be friendly checkbox so just scroll
through here rather than typing that out
friendly checkbox and there it is and
there we go and then to save myself an
insane amount of time just going to copy
that paste that in paste that in these
are all check boxes and here I just need
to go specials and then here I just need
to go opinion and there we are got that
set and then what I'm going to do is set
up all of my listeners for this stuff
and I'm going to cover that in the next
part of the tutorials I'm just going to
call this setup intro check boxes and
I'll just do that in the next part of
the tutorial
then we're have to set up all of our
radio buttons so again I'm going to come
up here so I don't make any types of
mistakes actually I'm going to do it for
the radio buttons and the radio group of
course back down inside of here face
that in there okay so we have the radio
group and it's going to be pretty much
the same as this I just need to change a
little bit
so for radio group paste that in there
of course change this to radio group
instead of radio button or checkbox
whatever it was and then inside of that
click back available radio group is
right there so we are got that setup
copy that again do the same thing here
for the radio button and here I'm just
going to knock the group fart off of
this and then I'm going to put available
bad radio copied out paste that in there
this is going to be available think it's
uppercase okay didn't get an error good
and then for this one it's going to be
good radio button file save good and
after I have all that setup what I'm
going to need to do next time is put
some change listeners so I'm going to
call this add change listeners to radio
radio
shows multiple don't really have to
anything for the radio group that time
when I initialize my spinner or my
drop-down box for some reason that's
what they call it in the Android world
is equal to face that in their spinner
and this is called problems spinner and
then I'm gonna have to of course add
another item selected listener to my
spinner to find out what item was
selected and I'm going to do that in a
separate method that we're gonna cover
as well in the next part of the tutorial
I'm gonna call it a item selected
listener to spinner a little bit
long-winded but I like it being
descriptive and then I want to
initialize all my buttons so start
chronometer button it's going to be
equal to paste that there change us to
button and then put a dot there and look
for a start chronometer button where is
it come over here in the activity XML
file make sure I have it set up and I do
have it set up I think I know what
happened though and yes it was right I
just didn't have that file saved so
start chronometer button and then do the
same thing for pause chronometer button
and reset chronometer button and then
I'm just gonna call this pause and reset
there we are
now all the buttons are initialized and
then again in the next part of the
tutorial I'm gonna show you how to
handle click listeners and there are
those are and then finally I need to
initialize my chronometer which is just
a little timer tall it is sounds really
fancy but just take seconds and minutes
and all that stuff and I'm going to copy
this chronometer period and look for
time waiting chronometer and there that
is and then finally like I said I
haven't decided if I'm gonna do anything
with the textview that is next to the
chronometer or not so for now I'm gonna
come in here and initialize it just in
case for a dot and then time waiting
textview if I'll save so there you go
there is fifty million different things
you can do inside of Android in the next
part of the tutorial I will completely
solve everything and you will have a
completely insane looking app leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
