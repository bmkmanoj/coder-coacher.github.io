13 in my C++ video tutorial today we're
going to talk a lot about using some
functional techniques inside a C++ so
I'm going to talk about things like
passing functions of functions vectors
of functions and you guys also asked for
some more complicated problems so I'm
going to include those as well like
always all the code as well as a
transcript of this video is available in
a description underneath this video and
if you haven't watched any of the other
previous parts of this tutorial series
you probably should otherwise you will
be confused and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it
all right so here we are know a lot of
people don't know this what I'm gonna do
here is I'm just going to create a
simple function and I'm gonna call it
malt by two and basically it is going to
receive a double and then what it is
going to do is quite simply multiply
whatever it received times two and
return that value okay so that's boring
but we're gonna do something more
interesting here let's just get rid of
all this stuff up here alright so what I
want to do here is I want to show you
something that might be surprising you
can actually store functions as
variables and you can just use auto in
this situation and you could go times
two for example is equal to and then
just reference the function name and
there you go now you have stored that
inside of a variable now that might seem
like it's not that exciting but you can
do some really cool things first off I'm
going to go and print out the
calculation that we have here so I can
just go times two and pass a five inside
of it and then we can do a newline
obviously and you can see that all of
this stuff works alright five times two
is equal to ten all right so you might
think well that's not that important
well let's go and do something even more
complex and I promise you by the end of
this tutorial you will be saying yeah
that's pretty complicated stuff so what
we're gonna do now is you're also going
to be able to receive other functions
inside of a function so what this guy's
going to do I'm going to call
it do math and what we want to do is we
want to pass a function into it now to
do that what you need to do is go
standard function and then you're going
to list the return type for whatever
that is and then you're going to only to
list the the return type for the
function that's going to be passed into
this function and then what you're gonna
do is also and that is this right here
and then you're going to list any
attributes in this situation there is
only one however and then you're going
to and that guy all right so we're not
just gonna receive that we are also
going to receive a number so let's go
and throw that inside of there and there
we go so what this guy is going to do
now is it's going to take the function
well I'm gonna go up here and throw
functions out of here all right so that
we are next line as you can see it all
right so it's gonna receive a function
and it's also going to receive a value
and it is going to call that function
and it's going to pass that value into
it so what we are going to do then down
inside of here is we're gonna set this
all up and I'm going to in this
situation I'll say something like six
times two is equal to and then come down
here and then I can just call do math
and then I can go and take times two
which is defined as a variable up inside
of here also pass in our six and then a
new line and you could say that it's
going to be able to perform that
calculation as well so that's how we can
pass functions into functions also
pretty neat stuff another thing you can
do is you're actually going to be able
to store functions in a vector so let's
go and create another function that we
have here I'm gonna call this x three
and double and num and guess what it's
gonna do if you thought well it's going
to take the number and multiply times
three and return it well you are correct
and what we're gonna do down here is we
are going to store different functions
inside of a vector so to do that
I need to go and create a vector and
then inside of it I'm going to define
the structure for my function just like
I did before which is going to be that
it's gonna have a return type of a
double and it is going to receive a
double and the only thing here caveat is
that you are going to have to use
functions that have the same return type
as well as these same attributes for
this to work and I'm going to call this
function I'm going to say that there's
going to be two stored inside of it then
what we can do is we can just go funks
and reference by index and say that this
is going to be equal to x 2 and then
funks 1 is going to be equal to x 3 all
right and those are stored inside of
there and what we're gonna do is we're
going to output some information and
that is going to be that 2 times 10 is
going to be equal to and then we can
just go and reference the vector that we
have here by the index and then pass in
our value that we also want passed into
our function and there we go and there
we go and you can see that that also
worked and of course if you went and put
index well let's just do it there it is
and there it is and now you can see it's
30
all right so cool stuff and that is
going to bring us a to our very first
problem now the problem that I want you
to solve is I want you to create a
function that receives a list as well as
a function and the function passed is
going to return a true or false if
they've list value is odd and the
surrounding function will return a list
of said odd numbers ok so that is enough
information for you to go ahead and do
it and you can pause your video now or
what you can do is I'll show you what's
going to be in the main function to give
you a tip all right so what we're gonna
do here is we are going to create a
vector once again if you want to pause
and try to solve it go for it and of
course everything is free
with in regards that you can go on the
internet and you can use the Internet to
try to solve these problems I'm not
restricting you only to what I have
alright so here we go we created a list
of vector values integers so what we're
gonna do is we are then going to create
another vector and it is also going to
contain integer values and it is going
to be called odd list and what it's
gonna do is it's gonna call a function
called change list that is going to
receive a vector of numbers let's call
this list of noms so it's gonna receive
that list of nomes that we just created
right there and it's also going to
receive a function that is called is it
odd and you're gonna have to create that
there and what else should it do well
it's going to also come in here then and
let's just say that it wants to print
out list of odds and then it's going to
cycle through all of those different
items so I'm gonna say get our odd list
that was generated and that's just gonna
print all those values out so and there
you go
alright so now your job is to go and
create the function call change list as
well as the function is it odd you can
go ahead and pause your video and give
that a try otherwise I am going to
create both right now all right
so very first thing we want to do is
create is it odd so what its gonna do
it's going to check if a value is odd or
not so of course it's going to be
returning a boolean and it's going to
receive a value inside of here and it's
quite simple it's just gonna go if num
modulus 2 is equal to 0 well in that
situation it's gonna return false and
else it's going to return true so that
was pretty easy we went and created our
first function that we're gonna need
then the next function is called change
list it's going to receive
list of gnomes so let's go and just copy
this right here so I don't have to type
out that long thing all right so it is
going to return a vector of integers of
course it's called change lists and if
you guys figure out some cool way of
doing what I'm doing here in a different
way please list it in the comment field
below I find it interesting and other
people will find it helpful and
interesting as well then receipt we're
receiving a function what's that
function that function is is it odd so
we know that we are going to have return
a boolean type and we know that it is
going to receive an integer type all
right and I'm just gonna call this funk
just to keep it nice and simple and then
I'm going to create a vector inside of
it and an injury vector and it is going
to be called odd list and then all I
need to do is go full for auto and I for
all of our list items we want to cycle
through and then I'm gonna say if and
then I can just go func
and I and then after that if it comes
back as true I am going to go and get
our oddest and add that item to our
vector like this then after I cycle
through every single one of those I can
go return odd list and be done all right
so there is everything can I keep get it
all on the screen and that too much
information so we'll save it and we'll
run it and you see a list of odds comes
back as one three and five so hopefully
you guys got that but if you didn't
don't worry about it the goal here is
just like always to understand the final
problem and not necessarily get it right
but if you did get it right please leave
that in the comments and I'll take a
look and on now I'm gonna go on and to
our second problem for this video all
right to keep this simple what I want
you to do now is to generate a hundred
either heads or tails and then output on
the screen the number of heads that you
randomly generated as well as the number
of tails that you randomly generated so
you can pause your video right now
go and give that a try otherwise what
I'm gonna do is walk you through the
process okay so basically what we would
need to do if we wanted to do what I
just said is we're gonna need to create
a function that's going to create a
random list using a Lim limited number
of values which would be either heads or
tails then we're gonna have to create
another function that checks for the
number of matches in that randomly
generated list and then we're going to
have to create a random list of heads
and tails and an output how many of the
heads were generated randomly and how
many tails were generated randomly okay
so what I'm gonna do here first is I'm
going to go into main and I'm actually
gonna create everything inside of here
so I can go vector and I know I'm gonna
use characters because it's gonna either
be heads or tails and this is going to
be possible values and I know that I'm
either gonna have a head or I am going
to have a tail those are the only
possible values for my thing that I want
to do here all right then I said that I
wanted to have 100 of them so I am going
to have a list right here which is going
to be a character vector and I'm gonna
call this H and see list for head and
tail list I'm going to create a function
that is going to get H and T list and
how it's going to do that is it's going
to receive a list of possible values in
the way of a vector and then I'm gonna
say that I want a hundred of said values
because that's how I described this
earlier and then I'm going to output on
our screen the number of heads and I am
also going to well of course I'm gonna
have to go and call another function and
it's gonna be called get number of
matches and I'm gonna pass in our list
that we went
just generated here as well as well
specifically what I'm looking for and
make sure those are single quotes
otherwise you will get an error and then
we can just go and do a new line on that
and then we're gonna do exactly the same
thing for tails so we can just copy this
as well paste that in there get number
of tails and then we're gonna to change
this to tea instead of H alright so
there we got that so now what we need to
do is go and create this guy right here
as well as get number of matches
otherwise you can do it on your own all
right so what is get H and T list what's
it gonna return well obviously it's
gonna return a vector there's full of
characters so we're gonna paste that
inside of there and then it's gonna be
called to get HN to you list so let's
just copy but paste that inside of there
and then what is it gonna do well it is
going to receive this guy right here so
let's just go and copy that and paste
that inside of there as well and what do
I want to call this I'm gonna call this
possible values and then we are also
going to receive int and just call this
number values to generate just because
that's really long and very descriptive
all right so what we want to do here is
well we are going to and make sure that
you have C time inside of here for this
to work what we are going to do is we
are going to generate some random value
so I'm gonna go SRAM's and time and then
null and I talked about how this is
going to help us generate random values
based off of the number of seconds and
time since nine you arey first 1970
there's a interesting thing alright so
and we're gonna have a vector of
characters and I'm gonna call it H and T
list and then it's going to generate
those how's it gonna do it let's go and
use this guy so X is equal to 0 and X
less Sun and this is gonna be number of
values to generate let's just copy that
and paste it in there cuz I'm feeling
lazy so there we are and then I'm going
to have the value of x increment of
course then what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna go int and I'm gonna go rands
index is gonna be equal to and I'm gonna
go Rams and I'm gonna get the modulus of
two because we know that if we do a
division or a modulus division by two
that it's impossible to receive a value
that is two we're only going to receive
zeroes and ones so then what I can do is
go H and T lists and push back and add
each of those values onto this and
that's just gonna be possible values
Anne's brand index so there we go we
went and we generated that and then we
got our list at the end here so we can
just say return and it's going to be H
and T a list where is that a Chanti list
there we go copy this guy pasted inside
of there alright so there we got it
handled so that we were generating a
random list that is going to contain
only HS and TS now what we need to do is
receive a list and then sum the number
for each of those matching characters so
I'm gonna go int and this is called get
number of matches so copy this guy right
here paste it inside of there and it's
going to receive standard vector and of
course that is a character list and I'm
just gonna call it list and then it's
also going to receive character which is
going to be I'm gonna call this value to
find and like this and then what else
can we do well we're gonna go and find
num of matches which is going to start
off at 0 of course and then we are just
going to cycle through that and of
course we're gonna get characters out of
this list cause it's a character list
obviously and whoops whoops whoops what
I do
list there we are all right so what can
we do well we're gonna cycle through
there we're gonna get each of those
individual characters and we're just
gonna say if C is equal to value to find
and then we can just say no of matches
and increment it pretty simple all right
and we can get out of there and then
what we can do is we can say return num
of matches and there we are okay and
then we can test it and see if it worked
and it looks like it did so bring this
over here and the first time we rolled
we received 51 heads and forty nine
tails let's do it again
39 and 61 and 50 and 50 and 52 and 48
and so forth and so on so hopefully you
guys enjoyed that and you were able to
work out those problems and like always
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
