my java video tutorial series this
tutorial is going to be a big one
because not only am I going to start
making a video game which if you can't
guess its asteroids this is in its very
beginning stage as what's on the left
side of the screen and I'm also going to
start teaching you object-oriented
design principles I've held off for this
long because whenever you're introduced
to okay in my situation here I want you
to see it as a great thing and not
something that's complicated or
burdensome whenever you see how the
design and opie now if you've watched
all the other videos you're going to see
it as the easiest thing on earth so what
I'm going to do here is I'm going to use
unified modeling language or my version
of it over here on the right side of the
screen and model out all of these
asteroids to figure out what type of
object they are and this is called a
class diagram and this is what I'm going
to call it a rock and then I'm going to
look at this on the left side of the
screen or in my situation I looked at it
on a notepad and figure out what are all
the things this rock needs well I want
to keep track of the upper left hand x
position for each one of the rocks and
that's going to be an integer because
there's no reason for it to be anything
else and then I also want to define the
upper left Y position and this is all
just so that I can track whenever this
is bouncing into things here on the
screen and also throw all the asteroids
in original situations another thing I'm
going to need to do is figure out how to
change the direction on all of these
asteroids as they bounce around on the
screen so I'm going to need both an X
Direction which is also going to be an
integer and this is also going to help
me figure out how to handle speed so
while the asteroids don't move around on
the screen at the same speed and then of
course I'm also going to need to track
the direction in the Y direction so I'm
just modeling everything out here on the
screen and this is exactly how you do
this you look at what you want to create
you know figure out how to make it well
another thing I'd like to track is the
width of the board that all these
asteroids are going to get thrown onto
and there you go so that's an integer
and I'm also going to need the board
height and this is to keep them on the
board and a whole bunch of other
different things and later on I'm going
to design the board as a totally
separate object well since these are
poly
yawns which is pretty much the most
complicated shape you're going to ever
draw on the screen I'm going to need to
track each of these points because a
polygon is made up of a series of x and
y points that are then connected with
lines so I'm going to throw those all
into an array so I'm going to call it
poly X array and it's going to be an
integer array right like that and then
I'm also going to need the Y points so
change that to Y and I'm also going to
want both the starting position for
every polygon again so I can randomize
everything so I'm just going to change
that to SP and SP and that is my
solution every single rock or asteroid
on the screen is going to use all of
these different variables here and
you're going to see since I'm taking all
the time to create this it's going to be
a lot easier to write all the code
afterwards well then I'm going to need a
rock constructor and there's going to be
a whole bunch of different things it's
going to need one thing it's going to
need are these two polygon arrays passed
over whenever it's created so paste that
inside of there separate it with a comma
and another thing that it's going to you
need is the number of points for the
polygon and that is so that I don't I'm
not stuck with just one type of polygon
I'll be using here I can go and create
multiple different types of polygons and
integers and then lastly I'm going to
need both the random starting x position
so starting x position passed over
that's also going to be an integer and
then I'm also going to have the random Y
that's going to be passed over paste
that in there and there you go so I've
defined my constructor and it's going to
return nothing so I'm going to throw
void in there so there we are so we got
all that design another thing I'm going
to need to do is figure out how to move
these guys and I don't see any reason
why anything needs to be passed because
all the information for moving is
already stored inside of here
so you want to keep these methods that
you have down here as simplistic as
possible and void because there's no
reason to return anything and then the
other thing I want to need to do here is
create a way to generate polygon
positions based off of being sent a
random starting position all that means
is I say ok at the 100 X 100 Y spot on
the screen I want to generate a polygon
send me all of my polygons
values that I need to be able to do that
so I'm going to go get Polly x-ray is
going to be the name the method and it's
going to require that a random starting
position be sent to it and it's going to
be an integer of course and then in
return what is it going to send back
well it's going to send back an integer
array and then the last method that I'm
going to need here for this rock at
least for now is a Y polygon generating
thing so there are random Y position and
there it is so this is all we need right
here to now create as an actual Java
class so I'm going to close this and get
into the code okay so I left up my class
diagram here on the right side of the
screen and over here I'm going to create
the class itself you can see how simple
it is okay so what am I going to do here
this rock or asteroid is going to be
based off of polygons so I'm going to
bring in the polygon class and use a lot
of it to design everything and then of
course I need to extend the polygon
class so I'm going to be drawing
polygons I just need to come in here and
actually create some customized stuff
and then I'm just going to look on the
right side of my screen and create
everything as I go along so I'm going to
need an integer upper left-hand X
position you already know that is an
upper left-hand Y position this is just
going to be the upper left-hand corner
for my polygon that I'm going to be
creating here just copy and everything
from the right side to the left and then
I'm going to create my X direction and y
direction which is going to be used like
I said before to change the direction
the asteroid whenever it hits something
and also as well it's going to determine
how fast this asteroid is going to move
and all this code is available in the
link under the video and if you really
want to learn this stuff you should
download it it's free so go do it and
it's heavily commented and then I'm also
going to need to do the same thing with
y-direction now I need to get the board
width and height which I'm actually
going to create in the next part of the
tutorial and it's going to be called
lesson 50 so I'm going to go board width
and then I'm also going to need to get
the height of the board see as you say
I'm just copying from the left to the
right that's all I'm doing here and I'm
keeping everything separate so that it's
very easy to change things then I need
to
come in here and create my integer array
and this is going to hold the
expositions and the Y positions for all
of my polygons or for each polygon
that's going to be defined by this class
anyway and then I'm going to come in
here and go public static I'm going to
create an integer array that's going to
be publicly available that's the reason
why it's going to be static and Static
just to reinforce this means that this
belongs to the class this array belongs
to the class so every single object that
has ever created is going to use this
same integer array okay so that's what
that stands for I'm going to call this s
poly X array and then I actually went
inside of Illustrator and drew this
polygon and figured out what all the
points were I didn't see any reason to
show you that because it's you could do
the same thing on graph paper if you
want it to and there you go there's your
polygon array and I'm just going to copy
this and do the same thing for my Y
positions like I said before this is the
starting positions for all the polygons
that are going to be drawn on the screen
and there's all those now I need to
create my constructor that's going to
allow people to generate asteroids and
it's going to get passed an integer
array poly X array and it's also going
to get a wire a pass to an integer
points in poly that's the total number
of points to make up each polygon
integer random starting x position just
like I had before and there's my random
starting Y position and that is all that
I need to create for that constructor
and then I need to actually create the
polygon well since I'm extending the
polygon class up here that allows me to
have the polygon class go and generate a
lot of things for me so all I need to do
is pass it an X array of integers and
I'm also going to pass it the Y array
and then it needs me to tell it how many
points total are in the polygon that I
want it to create for me and there you
go it just went and created my polygon
for me then I'm going to go this which
is reference to the object that I'm
creating here is x-direction which again
pertains to which direction it's moving
on the screen as well as speed and I'm
gonna need to cast this to an integer
then I'm going to go
random so that everything isn't moving
at the same speed on the screen I'm
going to say four here plus one and then
I'm going to do the same thing for the Y
direction and Y speed and just let that
exactly the same and then the last thing
I need to do is define the upper
left-hand corner x position for each one
of these that's created and that's just
going to be a random starting X position
right like that which is passed to the
constructor and then I have the same
thing for the Y and that's just so that
all the polygons show up in different
parts of the screen and there you go
there's your constructor that I just
created
pretty simple then we're going to go
public void move remember move doesn't
get any attribute sent to it and it also
does not send anything that's the reason
why the voids in there so the first
thing I need to do is get the upper
left-hand topmost point for the polygon
and in this situation we're going to
change this later on but for this moment
this works I'm going to go super which
is a reference to the polygon superclass
and I'm going to type in X points which
is how it references this array I'm
gonna get the 0 most array point for the
polygon I'm also going to do the same
thing for the upper Y position and I'm
going to leave this exactly the same
except going to changes to Y if you have
any questions or comments leave them
below I do my best to answer all your
questions
and then we're going to go
upper-left-hand what this is going to do
is I'm going to check to see if the rock
is going to hit one of the walls whether
it be on the left top right or bottom
and if it does I'm just going to change
its direction so I'm going to say what
is the upper left-hand x position if
it's less than zero which means we're
off the board and we need to change the
direction or upper left-hand x position
and I'm going to change this to 25 to
allow for additional space on the
polygon that I'm going to be drawn to
the screen and width is a reference to
the actual width of my game board if
those things are true that means it just
hit a wall so I'm just going to change
the direction so I'm going to say the
x-direction is going to be equal to the
negative of whatever the x-direction
currently is and there you go that was
pretty simple way to change the
direction that my polygon is going to be
going on the screen and I'm just
basically going to do this
same thing here for the Y position
except of course changes to that and
then I'm going to increase this to 50
which is just going to give me a little
bit more space and then this needs to be
changed to height and this needs to be
changed to y-direction instead of X
direction if you're not quite getting it
like I said get the code read the
comments you'll figure it out and then I
need to change all the points for the
polygon based off of this new direction
because these points are going to be set
then they're going to be drawn to the
screen the polygon is going to be drawn
to the screen then the points are going
to be changed again and then it's going
to be redrawn on the screen over and
over and over again so this is going to
change those points for every single
polygon that we'll be working with here
when I set it to zero and go I super
which is a reference to the polygon
points dot length and then I'm just
gonna increment that guy then I'm going
to go super dot X points and throw I
inside of there and then I'm going to
figure out whatever the new value for
Direction is and again Direction is just
whether I want to increment the X point
or I want to decrement it and how
quickly and I just need to do exactly
the same thing for the Y position so
we're just going to go Y points and then
Y Direction and that's going to change
that and then I'm going to make two
methods here that are going to be used
by the game board one's going to be
called public you can see what's coming
up just by looking on the right side of
the screen public static int it's going
to return an integer array and go get
poly X array and then go into random
start X position that's what's going to
be sent to it and what this guy's going
to do is just create all of my X arrays
so I'm going to go integer and I'm going
to create a temporary holding cell for
an x-ray and to do this of course you're
going to need to use the clone method
because if you just copy my starting
point array which I created before it's
going to overwrite it so instead we're
going to cast this into an integer array
and call s poly X array and then call
clone and that's going to give me a copy
of the integer array but it's not going
to have any links at all to the original
and then we're just going to go for int
I is equal to zero while I is less than
Paulie X array the length of that guy
and then I'm just going to increment hi
again and then I'm going to go temp
Paulie X array through I inside of there
and I'm going to move it around on my
game board based off of whatever the
random starting x position was that was
set and then after that I just need to
return my new brand new array X ray with
all my new X points and then the last
thing I need to do is create this same
type of method except in this situation
it's going to return a y array so just
paste that in there and then we're just
going to need to change this to Y random
starting Y position temporary Y position
why why why and why and there you go and
that's going to go in there and
automatically generate both x and y
polygons array points for me and send
them back to the game board so that's
all for this part of the tutorial in the
next part I'm going to create the game
board you're going to see all the stuff
you saw at the very beginning of the
tutorial leave any questions or comments
below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
