14 my c-sharp video tutorial this one is
going to be covering custom collections
indexers enumerators operator
overloading custom casting anonymous
types and a whole bunch more so a whole
bunch of complicated topics all in one
video and like always all the code and
the transcript of the video is available
in the description underneath the video
and I have a lot to do so let's get into
it okay so here we are what we're going
to do is create a custom collection so
I'm just going to use something very
very simple here I'm just going to come
in to and create an animal class and I'm
going to go string and name and create
this property and the getters and the
setters alright so we have that all set
up and then I'm going to create a
constructor and that's going to be all
we're going to do with this guy so
animal and it's going to receive a
string and that's going to be the name
and we're going to say no name as a
default and then I'm going to set the
name right here alright so pretty simple
stuff and and make sure that's
capitalized and make sure that's
capitalized all right so we have that
all set up and now we're going to jump
over and create our custom collection
alright so I called this guy animal form
and what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to have this inherit enumerable
which is going to provide for the option
to iterate over our collection so I'm
going to go on and numerable and that's
going to give me an error that's going
to say that I need to fix things but I'm
going to do that on my own right here
now this is going to hold a list of
animals so I'm going to create a private
list generic animal list here and I'm
going to call it animal list and we'll
go new list and animals is going to be
stored inside of there of course and
there we go got that all set up and
we're going to be using that now I'm
going to create our constructor for this
guy so animal form once again and it's
going to receive a list of animals and
it's going to be animalist I'm going to
go this animal list is equal to the
animal list that was passed inside of
there okay so we have that set up
alright keep moving on I'm also going to
create a constructor that doesn't
receive anything so let's go animal form
and that's not going to get anything
we'll just leave that just the way that
it is and now what I'm going to do is
create an indexer and how we're going to
use or create this is go animal and then
to create an indexer you're going to use
this followed with the brackets and then
I want to use integers as the indexes
for this and then I just need to define
what's going to happen whenever we call
for individual pieces of this collection
so it's going to return an animal and
that's going to be from the animal list
and the index that is provided inside of
it so there we go
and of course it's what curly brackets
in front of this instead of the other
thing we had right there and close that
off and then put the curly brackets
there at the end then I need to define
what happens if I try to set a value I
go animal list once again and I'm going
to call insert and the index that I want
to insert into and then the value that I
want to insert into and that's it now
that allows me to define exactly what's
going to happen whenever the user wants
to pull information from the collection
or set information back here close that
guy off we can also come in here and set
up accounts so that it works properly
how we do that is just go public int and
count and then we'll just define get for
this because there is no set and what
it's going to do is just return animal
list and we can call counts on it inside
of here all right so there we are so now
we have the ability to pull information
add information as well as receive the
number of stored variables inside of it
now this guy up here is complaining
because we need to create another
function down here and we're going to
call this in
narrator and will go I enumerator or a
numerable I'm in and get a numerator and
what this is going to do is return a
numerator that's going to be used to
iterate through our collection so we
need to define how this is going to be
set up and it's quite simple you just
say return animal list and then you call
get a numerator and we're going to do
that every single time doesn't matter
what you're working with okay so we have
all that set up and the error message is
gone so we will save it now we'll go
test it over in the program file all
right so here we are and I'm going to
come down here and into main and just
start doing some stuff and like I said
indexers are just going to allow you to
access items like an array like like a
collection like we've seen so many
different collections so what I want to
do here is create an animal form object
so I'm going to go inform my animals is
equal to new and animal form and create
that guy now I'm going to add some
animals to it so we'll say my animals
and I'm going to say what index I want
them to go into and they're
automatically going to go in there
because we set it up with the getters
and setters so we're going to throw an
animal inside of there and its name is
going to be Wilbur now let's throw a
couple more inside here whoops forgot to
put the equal sign inside of there now
we have that set up throw a couple more
random animals inside of here change the
indexes for this guy's too and change
that to three and we'll throw another
one inside of here Templeton and we will
put Gander and one more why don't we put
Charlotte's completely random names have
no idea there's no connection between
them alright so now we can cycle through
them just to show with this collections
workings we'll go and we'll I in animal
or my animals and then we can print this
out and I normally don't use shortcuts
but I'll show you this and I guess every
single time I do it I'll just explain
what I'm doing if you want to go and get
right line to show up on the screen just
go CW and tab tab and it pops up there
I know that sometimes confuses people
because they're like why are did that
pop up so quick well that's what it is
all right so there we go that's going to
print out all of our animals and why
don't we save that and run it and see
how it works and there you can see quite
simply it prints out Wilbur Templeton
gander and Charlotte's alright so cool
stuff now what I want to do is create
another class and I'm going to show you
how to do things like operator
overloading and how to cast into
different types and so forth and so on
so I'm going to create another class
called box okay so here we are inside of
our box class and I'm going to define a
couple different properties so we are
going to have a double it's going to
store the length inside of here so we'll
go gets and sets and then we're going to
do the same thing it's a three
dimensional box so I'm going to throw
some more stuff inside of here so box is
also going to have a width and it's also
going to have breadth okay so we have
all those now of course we're going to
have to create our constructors so I'm
going to go public box and handle the
situation in which they don't enter
anything into this down here and we'll
say this and the defaults are going to
be 1 1 1 1 1 and that's going to be
passed to the main constructor now the
main constructor is going to obviously
be called box and it's going to receive
a double and I'm just going to call this
L and it's also going to get another
double called W and another W or another
tubble that I will call B for Brett and
then we'll just come in and go length is
equal to L and width is equal to W and
Brett is going to be equal to B okay so
we have those constructors all set up as
well and we'll keep going here now what
I'm going to do is show you how you can
overload operators now you're going to
be able to override a whole bunch of
different operators like cloths and -
and multiplication and
and modulus not equals to not equal to
greater than less than greater than or
equal to less than or equal to and then
the shortcut increment and decrement
okay so those are going to be the guys
you can pause there or like I said the
codes always available in the
description what I want to over override
or overload is the plus some one I
define what happens if somebody tries to
add two boxes together okay it's going
to return a box and you're going to put
operator followed by the operator you
want to overload and this is going to
receive one box which is going to be box
one it's going to receive another box
just capitalized whoops
capitalized and that's going to be box
two and then what you do is you just
define what happens so what we're going
to have happen here is I'm going to say
the length well first off I want to
create a new box so I'm going to say box
new box is equal to the new box and I'm
going to find what happens with this new
box based off of the two boxes past end
well length is going to be equal to
whatever box one's length is plus
whatever our box twos length is and feel
like that's and we're going to do
exactly the same thing for our width and
our breath so we'll go with and width
and width and breadth breath and breath
and breath okay okay we got all those
set up here and I have to close off this
box right there so I stop getting error
messages and at the end of this I have
to put a semicolon
OOP might have a next one in here so
let's get rid of that
oh how that happened let's put a
semicolon right there and we'll put a
semicolon there I should have put a
comma there instead got that fixed and
then get rid of that one all together my
microphone was them away there that's
the reason why I messed that up and this
is going to be tabbed in here and then
after we have all that set up we're
going to say return new box with all of
the new settings that we defined inside
of it close off that other curly bracket
we have right there and then what we're
going to do is
going to overload the abilities to
subtract two boxes let's just copy all
that and come down here and paste that
in here and we'll just change this plus
to a negative and then we'll change
these pluses to negatives so now we'll
be able to add and subtract boxes quite
easily now we're also going to I'm going
to show you how equality works and then
I'm sure you can figure out all of the
other different things you can overload
basically what we're going to do here
let's just paste this in here save a
little bit of time the operator that we
paste it in I'm going to change this
into equals and then we can get rid of
all this stuff right here and instead
what I'm going to do is I'm going to say
if and we'll go box one link is equal to
box to link and then we're going to say
m because they have to all match up
we're going to do the same exact thing
here we're going to copy this right here
so just copy that right there and taste
this inside of here and then we'll go
and once again and then we will paste
that inside of there and we'll just
change this to width because we're going
to say that the length width and breadth
have to all be the same and change this
to breadth and change this to breath so
if all of those things right there are
going to be equal what we're going to do
is return and true because these two
boxes are equal otherwise we're going to
return false and I need to come up here
and this is going to return a bowl not a
box so we'll change that to boolean and
this has given me an error saying I need
to do a matching not equal to so no
problem I'll do that as well paste that
in there and we're going to say not
equal to and then what we'll do here is
we'll say not equal to and then we'll
change these two or because if any of
them are not going to match then we will
have problems will change the store and
then we will change this to not equal
all right so we have all of those set up
now let's say we also want to define how
your object is going to be converted
into a string well we can do that quite
easily just by overriding the two string
method and you've seen this before
so we're just going to say do it real
quick override you can also convert into
other different data types
I'm going to show you that next so I'm
going to say two string and whenever
this guy is going to be called what it
is going to do whoops give me this silly
thing let's just get rid of that
altogether
what this is going to do is return and
then you can put anything you want
inside here so I'm going to do a string
format and I'm going to say the string
that's returns is going to say box with
Heights and then throw in whatever the
height is inside of there with and throw
in the width and then throw in breadth
and whatever that's going to be come out
of here and then just go length width
and breadth and there you go now
whenever two string is called for this
or whenever we try to print this out as
if it is a string this is the message
it's going to print out you could also
however and this is not going to make
total sense but I'm just going to do it
and you'll know how to convert a
different datatype into an integer let's
say you want to convert from a box into
an INT
well how you would do that is you would
say public static explicit operator and
int and it's going to be receiving a box
and trying to turn it into an integer so
you're going to have to define what that
looks like what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say I'm going to go in and then
I am going to look outside of that I am
going to then go be length plus B with
plus B breadth and then take those
different guys and get the average and
return that as an integer all right just
to give you an example of something but
other situations it's going to make
sense how to turn an object into an
integer a double or whatever and to do
that you just change this to double or
whatever else you wanted to turn it into
so it's going to receive a box and
return an int let's do it the other way
where we are going to convert from an
int into a box to do that you say public
static implicit once again operator and
here you're going to say box and what
you're going to be receiving is an int
and you're going to convert it into a
box this might make a little bit more
sense in this situation I'm going to
return a
to box objects and it's going to contain
whatever the values are for the width
length and breadth of the box okay
now that we have all that set up I'm
going to jump over into the program file
and test it all out all right so we're
back where we were before and let's say
I want to test operator overloading
first I need to create a box one put a
new box I'm going to say two three and
four and I'm going to create another box
objects and in this one I'm going to
change this box to obviously and then
I'll change this to five six and seven
and then we can test what it looks like
whenever we add these if I want to
create another box that is going to be
made up of adding these two boxes
together and you get box 1 plus box 2
and there we go and you're going to see
what that looks like here because I'm
going to go say use the shortcut again
and here I'm going to go box 3 and then
I can use the two string here so I can
just say box 3 like this and it's
automatically going to convert it into
some text we can run that just to see if
that works and yes it does see box 3 box
height 7 width 9 breaths okay so it
added those values together and also to
string worked to print that out properly
we're also going to be able to come in
here and convert it into an int so here
what I'm going to do is I'm going to say
box int so this is what the box looks
like as an int and then inside of here
I'm going to say that I wanted to cast
it into an int put box 3 inside of there
like that and then I'm also going to
convert an int into a box so I'm going
to say box box 4 is equal to and I'm
going to say that I'm going to cast into
the box and this is going to be a for
integer is what I'm using and if I want
to go and output that I can do it of
course if I can hit the right button on
the keyboard I can say box 4 and then
here what I'm going to do is cast this
integer into a box type so I'm going to
throw the 4 down inside of there like
this
put that there and then close that off
and we can save it and run it and you
can see that we converted a zani box
into a nine by taking these values
adding them up dividing by three and you
can see here that we generated the box
from the integer type okay so I got a
little bit more time let's do another
one
another thing that it's sometimes useful
is sometimes you want to build a simple
class that's just going to contain
fields and in some situations what is
called an anonymous type is going to be
great for doing that just a simple
situation so let's say I wanted to say
something like I want to define a toy
here equal to new and we can give it say
that this is going to have a name and
it's going to be shopkins and it's also
going to have a price and we're going to
say that that's $4.99 all right there
you go went and created that looks nice
and neat now let's go and use it so we
will go like this and then I'm just
going to say I'm going to pull in some
information here cost and then this and
then this close that off and then to
pull information from it I can just say
shopkins followed by name and then
shopkins again followed by the price I'm
going to do something a little bit more
complicated you're also going to be able
to store these anonymous types inside an
array so I'm going to create one so I'm
going to call this toy array equal to
new and throw the brackets inside of
there like that and then we're going to
say new and then we're going to define
our names and prices so you can say name
is equal to yo Kai Tak and then I can do
a price equal to $4.99 and then we're
going to do the same thing we'll go new
and define another one
oops like that and name is going to be
equal to Legos and our price in this
situation is going to be $9.99 and then
come down here throw a semicolon there
and we're going to be able to cycle
through this also so we'd be able to say
for each put bar inside of there because
I don't know
working with and we'll say item and then
in toy array and then to output the
information we can do so by just like
this and then going to the cost and then
throw it all the Sun right there and
then one and then go and pull the
information out and how we pull that out
is to go item whoops here that extra one
there item followed by the name and then
item followed by the price and after we
have that all set up and I don't think
we have an error let's run it see what
it looks like uh-oh
little error what'd I do wrong actually
I did I should have put this in here and
just just miss clicked put that right
there because it's still running yes
let's kill doubt look okay and we'll put
this right here and throw our comments
out of there like that and now
everything looks peachy keen let's run
it again and there you can see that it
went and printed out the first anonymous
type information and then it also cycled
through the array with anonymous types
okay so there is a whole bunch of new
information we're getting near the end
of the core of the c-sharp language and
I think I'm going to be covering link in
a lot of detail in the next part of the
video and just like always please leave
your questions and comments below alive
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
