6 of my JavaScript video tutorial today
I am going to cover JavaScript regular
expressions I didn't plan on doing this
because I've covered regular expressions
to such an extent in other tutorials but
you guys asked for it so here it is as
you can see here on the left side of the
screen this is just the basic setup that
I keep using over and over throughout
this tutorial it's just basic HTML now a
regular expression and I think this is
the disconnect for the reason why people
keep asking me for regular expression
tutorials a regular expression is just a
series of codes used to describe a
series of characters that you are
searching for the way you define a
series of characters using regular
expressions is almost exactly Universal
no matter what programming language
you're using so that means whether
you're programming a JavaScript or PHP
or Python or anything chances are you
are going to define characters using
codes in every language in exactly the
same way so I provided a link to some
tutorials using regular expressions in
PHP that are very advanced if you want
to look into that here I'm going to
cover the basics of using regular
expressions in JavaScript and really the
only thing that changes is the methods
that you use in the specific languages
to perform your searches now what you
have to understand is I'm going to
define a regular expression right here
I'm just going to call it reg Pat just
like you define a string with quotes
regular expressions are surrounded with
slashes these are called delimiters you
want the very specific name and here I'm
going to give you a sample regular
expression let's say I am looking for a
string of characters that is going to
start off with a number between 0 and 9
and I expect that number to be either 1
in length or 5 in length that's what
this is doing here this is saying what
we're looking for and this is saying how
many of these things we expect to find
so we expect a string to start off with
1 to 5 numbers that's what that says we
then can expect a space to be found
there and then we expect uppercase
letters between A to Z and we expect
exactly two of those
then we expect a word boundary this is
almost exactly the same as a space the
only difference is is a word boundary
always must have something else next to
it so for example if I had de Rek space
and nothing left that would be
considered a space but not a word
boundary now if I put one more character
in now all of a sudden that is a word
boundary this space inside of here so
that's the only difference between word
boundaries and spaces and then let's
just say we expect the end of our
regular expression to have lowercase
digits inside of it and we expect it to
have two or more so we're not going to
put anything inside of there and that is
one way that you can define a regular
expression and don't forget the ending
slash another way you can define regular
expression or a series of characters is
by typing this in followed by new
followed by reg exp you see these
regular expressions are actually of type
object reg exp which we're going to get
into here in a little bit but you could
define this regular expression in much
the same way and here I'm going to
define this exact same thing that we
have up here except I'm going to use a
couple different codes now let's say you
wanted to define these digits all of
these these five characters into just
two well what you just do is just put a
slash inside of there and D and then you
could define everything exactly the same
then put in a space again and there
really is no way to just define
uppercase letters inside of here or no
standard way of doing so so everything
else technically would be the same so
let's just say it's like this and
everything else is exactly the same you
just put your quotes around it and done
that unto that so there's another way to
define regular expressions actually the
two ways to do that so I'm going to
create a long string and put all kinds
of random information inside of it and
all of this code is on my website I'm
sorry
new think tank comm I'm sorry it's a bit
slow I'm trying to adjust to the insane
rise in traffic I've been getting right
recently I promise if you go there you
can get it okay so there's my string and
has my name and has has some random
information inside of here so I'm going
to show you some of the methods that are
available
for searching through this string filled
full of information I'm actually going
to copy it because it runs off the side
of the screen little bit here and I'm
going to put it right there so you can
see it all on one screen so what I'm
going to do call document right I'm
going to use the search function to
search for a very specific regular
expression inside of here now remember
you could have actually defined this
regular expression like I previously
showed you or using search you should
actually embed it inside of it well here
I'm going to say that I'm looking for
uppercase letters A through Z lowercase
letters A through Z and I'm expecting
one two fifteen and length for these
characters followed by space and this is
going to print out the index for the
first match to screen and as you can see
zero is a match that is what search does
it finds the first location where this
regular expression matches and says
where is the index so obviously my name
matches and what is the index for this
strength zero so that's the reason why I
print zero out the screen search isn't
very exciting not very useful don't use
it much I'll go through some of the
other ways to represent different types
of characters if you put a dot down this
represents any one character but not a
newline and you represent newline
characters with a backslash n by the way
so that represents pretty much
everything scroll up here so you can see
all of these then just like we use the
brackets before if you have a bracket
and it carried inside of it let's say
we're specifically searching for
anything that is not a number that is
exactly how you would do that is to slap
the bracket inside of there and just you
remember this would match for any length
of numbers by putting the carrot in
there represents that there we are
specifically looking for anything that
is not a number backslash and W will
match for anything uppercase a through Z
lowercase a through Z zero through nine
or an underscore if you uppercase the W
that will match for anything that is not
one of these things listed and that is
going to always be true this is going to
match for a space just like we said
before and this is going to match for
anything that is not a space and also
just like this is a match for a number
this is a match for anything that's not
a number and this would be
a match for anything that was not a word
boundary being the uppercase B now
there's some other codes as well let's
say for example you wanted to search for
0 to 1 numbers but no more than that you
would do it just like this put the
brackets and then follow that with a
question mark the question mark
represents zero to one number
likewise if you put a plus sign after
the plus sign represents one or more
numbers so we are saying there's
definitely going to be at least one
number here and if you put the star next
to it that represents zero or more
numbers that means the number can be
there but it doesn't have to be and if
you would come in here and put an
uppercase a for a lowercase a that is
going to match for exactly one uppercase
a or one lowercase a and the carat also
does double duty if you put a carrot
inside of a regular expression that
represents the beginning of a string and
a dollar sign represents the end of a
string now I always learn by example
better so what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to come in here and just
show you how to search for a whole bunch
of different things such as emails and
so forth and this time I'm going to use
the search function just like we did
before except I'm going to change the
regular expression inside of it alright
so everything's the same just like we
had before and I'm actually going to
create this regular expression down
below just so you can see it on-screen
so what does an email address have well
it starts and can contain uppercase
letters lowercase letters numbers dots
underscores or dashes so we're going to
put that inside of there then we're
going to say that we expect one or more
of those followed by an @ symbol and yes
I know that a email address can have
more than these different codes but for
security purposes I'm leaving out
everything that I don't have listed
there and then I expect again uppercase
letters lowercase letters zero through
nine dots dashes dotted a one or more of
those and then I expect a period well a
period remember represents any character
except new lines since it's outside of
these brackets here we have to put a
backslash for it to allow that I'm sure
this far along in the tutorials that you
understand why we use backslashes and
then I'm going to say well we expect
ComNet dot whatever well those are
always either uppercase letters or
lowercase letters and we can trust
Felice say that they are going to be
between two to four characters in length
and that is it that is how you get an
email so what I'm going to do is
actually come up here copy that paste it
inside of here just like that that's the
reason why I put it on a separate line
because I knew it wouldn't show up and
if I run that search you can see that it
found a match at the fiftieth index and
you're just going to have to trust me
that that is exactly what this is right
here or right here so that's how you do
a very specific search for an email
address another thing you can do is use
what we call the replace function I'm
actually going to come in here go
document write string and I'm going to
type in replace instead and here I'm
going to say that I just simply want to
replace all digits that are five in
length close off the regular expression
with just a bunch of fives your replace
function is much more useful and you can
see that it printed out right here is
the zip code that originally had real
numbers inside of it and it replaced it
with five five five five five but I want
you to also understand that just because
I ran that function it did not change
the string itself in any way as you can
see the zip code shows up right there
now what would be really useful and what
is useful is whenever we are able to
find every single match and you can do
that with the match function that's
available inside of JavaScript and here
I'm going to create an array that's
going to store the results of calling
this match function inside of here I'm
going to say that I want to match for
four to five digits in length and here
is another thing you can do with regular
expressions if you put a G after the
regular expression that represents that
you want to find every single match
throughout the whole entire string which
is very useful instead of just getting
one of them and then you can cycle
through all these guys if you wanted to
as you print them the screen but I'm
just going to print them all to screen
at once you can see there's the two
matches for this regular expression
there are other codes just like G like
for example there's I and you would use
that if you
wanted your search to be
case-insensitive meaning you don't care
if it matches for uppercase or lowercase
and then you have em and if you put an M
at the end just like we did with the G
the dollar sign is now going to
representative of the end of the line or
string whether there is a new line or
not so if you don't use em if it hits
new line it's going to automatically
consider the dollar sign in your regular
expression to equal that new line in the
final way you can use regular
expressions as remember I said before
that regular expressions are considered
to be objects and here I'm just going to
create a regular expression and I'm
going to say document right then I'm
going to use the instance of and you can
see that that comes back true well since
it's an object it has some built-in
functions or methods if you will and I'm
just going to go over the exec here
because I normally don't use this I know
there's other people that love to use
these different objects but I personally
don't find them any more useful than
what I just showed you I find it much
more useful to use the match function
but that's just me if you want to
there's the exec function and if you run
it on the long string like we had before
you could then call reg match and what
it's going to do is it's going to shoot
out the index for the very first match
and if you continue to run this exec
function on this string it's going to
continue to kick those out to you over
and over and over again so reg match
this is going to print out the actual
match and then you can do a couple other
semi useful things with it like printing
out the index for the match just by
following it with dot index and if you
file save that you can see that it found
a match at 1 2 3 and if we come up here
you can see there's the match and that
lies at the index position of 6 0 1 2 3
4 5 6 just like we got it there so
that's an introduction to regular
expressions in JavaScript in the next
tutorial I'm going to show you how to do
form validation in JavaScript and I'm
gonna give you a slew of regular
expression examples if you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
