I think is going to be a great tutorial
thanks to this guy above he requested me
to do a tutorial on how to find great
domain names and in this tutorial I'm
going to show you how to find the
perfect domain name no matter what the
subject I'm going to go over all the
tools you need don't worry they're all
one hundred percent free I'm going to
show you how to use the google keyword
tool to be able to find these good
keywords that you're then going to use
in your domain name I'm going to show
you how to double check Google's results
to make sure that they are accurate then
I'm going to show you how to check to
see that the name's not already taken
and a bunch of other useful tricks here
at the end first the tools that you will
need you'll need Google you'll need the
Google Adwords Keyword tool and you'll
need or at least I use the godaddy
domain name search tool and don't worry
I'll give you the location of the Google
Adwords Keyword tool in a minute then
you have to make a decision on what your
site is going to be about and I leave it
to you to be either as vague or as
specific as you want to be you just want
to make sure that this is a website
you're going to be able to continue to
use then you just go to google and enter
those keyword phrases because you want
to know who currently ranks on the first
page for all of these phrases then you
want to write down all of those sites
and in my situation or my example here
I'm going to specifically try to find
domain names that are specific to
celebrity gossip being that this is a
topic that's very hot on the internet
and if i type in celebrity and gossip
and celebrity gossip and a whole bunch
of other different things these are the
websites that pop up multiple times and
you can see here is an example of how
important a domain name is just simply
by putting celebrity gossip this person
here is ranked number one on google just
purely based off the domain names as you
can see there are many big hitters here
on the screen i'm going to go in and i'm
going to look at what keywords they're
using to drive traffic how I do that is
I use the Google's keyword tool you can
see it here it's AdWords google com
select keyword tool external and you can
go ahead and pause the screen if you
want to write that down otherwise I also
have a link to it along with all the
other tools in the underbar and what
this guy does is it provides the best
keyword phrases based off of either
websites at you enter or keyword phrases
you enter and automatically will go in
look at what you entered and then try to
find better keywords and keyword phrases
based off that information or if you put
a website in it's going to show you the
best keyword phrases for that specific
website it's also going to show you how
much competition a phrase has and that's
extremely important you do not want to
go after very competitive keyword
phrases and it's going to show you
approximately how many times that
keyword phrase is searched for every
month and I want to underline
approximately here and here is the
google keywords tool here on your screen
and I'm specifically going to go after
the press hilton website here this is
always what I do I go after the websites
first and then the keywords afterwards
so you just type in the website you want
to get more information on type in the
CAPTCHA phrase and hit Search oh it's
going to go over there and it's going to
pull up all this information here on
your screen alright so here you're going
to see all of the keyword phrases that
it pulled up here is going to be the
competition area remember you want to
look for competition that is very low
this is extremely low and then you also
want to look at the overall global
monthly searches I don't pay any
attention to local i only pay attention
to globe now if you click on competition
it's going to show you the highest most
competitive keyword phrase but you do
not want this absolutely because it's
way too competitive especially based off
of the number of small searches that it
has here so instead what we want to do
is we want to look for some top searches
that have no competition now if you
wanted to do a website about brad pitt
man jolina jolie you could definitely go
after these keyword phrases however I
want to go for some better ones so let's
look down here we have ninety thousand
five hundred searches gossip in
Hollywood so you want to write this down
celo competition hi keyword phrases see
low competition high number of monthly
searches so you want to write this down
and you want to write down gossip from
Hollywood and Hollywood and gossip and
as many of these other phrases that sort
of match up with what you are overall
looking for it to do with your website
now you want to do that for every
website that ranked well remember i
clicked on global monthly searches and
then i'm looking for low competition so
i start
it off with Perez Hilton I'm going to go
ahead and I'm going to do the same thing
with all the other websites that ranked
on the first page and after I do that
I'm going to end up with my main keyword
phrases from all of those different
websites now I don't always trust
Google's keyword tool so I want to go in
and make sure that my matches are
actually good so what I did was I went
in and I typed in gossip in Hollywood
and it came back with 37 million two
hundred thousand hits for this phrase
now if you want to see how many times
this phrase is use on websites exactly
all you do is surround it with quotes
see you can see that there is a large
interest in this keyword phrase however
this specific phrase is only used eleven
thousand four hundred times believe me
this number is very small for a keyword
phrase that is this powerful and i'll
show you specifically how i did this so
i'm going to jump over to google and i'm
going to type in gossip in hollywood and
you can see here that it came back with
39 million three hundred thousand this
number constantly changes but it's
roughly the same every time what i want
to do this is the total matches meaning
that these words exist together on a
page however they don't actually exist
in this exact format to see how many
websites actually use this phrase
exactly you want to surround it with
quotes and hit enter and you can see
11,500 pops back here on the screen so
this is a great keyword phrase so that's
where these numbers come from so then
after I have this masterless all put
together I want to go through and I want
to look at which of these are the best
and I've pretty much decided that I like
this one this one this one this one and
this one these are all good keyword
phrases that I'd love to be able to to
own so then what I do is figure out how
many of them are owned guess what only
one of them gossip in Hollywood calm is
the only keyword phrase that is taken
that means unless everyone's already
bought these other keyword phrases this
phrase right here is available Hollywood
and gossiper available celebrities and
gossip calm these are all comms that I'm
looking for it never buy anything but
calm em rumors celebrity calm are all
keyword phrases that people are going to
be
for so there are four absolutely
fabulous domain names based off of
celebrity gossip but again you can do
this with anything else on top of that
also there's a link in the under bored
of this I point it out all of the
different words that Google disregards
now it doesn't completely disregard
these words it just Waits them
differently it doesn't consider them
quite as important these are the types
of words that you would want to use now
of course you want to use accordingly
because it's very very long but if you
would use these in a domain name such as
gossip in Hollywood you would be able to
more than likely capture that keyword
phrase just based off of the fact that
these words are not weighted as equally
as normal work then on top of that i put
together the most popular search words
and if you ever thought Paris Hilton was
stupid you would be wrong and this is
proof you can see these are the most
popular most common words that are typed
into Google on a regular basis and you
can see here that almost every single
one of these words are nonsense
conjunction words whatever connection
words right up until the point where you
get too hot ends up that hot is the most
commonly searched for phrase on google
that is not an adjective or a
conjunction so I hope that helps you
find really good domain names if you
have any questions or comments leave
them below and if you have a special
tutorial that you'd like me to do post
that in the comments or email it to me
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
