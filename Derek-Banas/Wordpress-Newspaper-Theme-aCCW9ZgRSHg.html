wordpress theme tutorial in this
tutorial series I'm going to teach you
how to make this absolutely beautiful
wordpress theme that you see here right
in front of you we're going to start off
by creating a basic HTML CSS website and
then as this progresses we're going to
turn this nice little thing into a
wordpress theme the prerequisite to
actually watching and understanding
what's going on here is to check out my
wordpress theme tutorial far as i know
it's the only free wordpress theme
tutorial that teaches you how to make
wordpress themes from scratch in that
tutorial we created this theme right
here that you see in front of you kind
of basic but we have to start off basic
before we get absolutely wild like I
said check out that tutorial if you
haven't seen it before otherwise just
consider this a brush up on how to use
HTML and CSS all the code that i use
here in this tutorial is available in a
link in the underbar and basically what
i did was i copied that original theme
that i showed you before and then to
that I added my featured content plugin
in the include section but like I said
you don't need to worry about that
because you can download all this stuff
all in one place if you want it now I'm
going to jump right into the code and
you can see how this guy is going to
progressively turn into this guy okay so
we got this guy right here on the side
of the screen I'm going to jump right
into the code and add everything that I
need so from the previous tutorial
nothing's going to change her that much
and actually copy this I need to bring
over some style sheets from my featured
content tutorial so instead of home it's
going to be includes and just link out
to my stylesheet I got that done and
then I'm gonna have to link out to my
JavaScript code that's going to make my
featured content tool also work and just
copy and paste that in there then I'm
going to copy this guy right here paste
that in there j/s Trude content alright
so now I'm linked to the JavaScript as
well as the other code that we have here
I'm going to make some changes this is
what I'm changing by the way what's on
the right side of screen couple things
I'm going to come in here and I'm just
gonna call this do you think time and
then blog slogan I'm just gonna simplify
this and just put me solve problems then
this menu is not going to change in
regards to what's on the screen what I'm
talking about is this menu up here
scroll way down to the bottom I am going
to get rid of the featured banner and
instead put the featured content this
little guy right here and there
instead so I could just come in here
select that and delete it out then I'm
going to dynamically load the featured
content directly inside of here so I got
to create a new div class is equal to
and TT featured content and this is
going to allow this plug-in to be used
on any wordpress site basically all
somebody's going to have to do to get it
to work is do exactly what I'm doing
right here make sure there's no
whitespace because WordPress doesn't
like white space on my call PHP I'm
going to go ntt stored FC is equal to
and I'm going to go file get contents a
function in PHP which grabs the contents
of a file file is going to be called
featured data one dot txt it's going to
dynamically load in the featured content
information and then what I'm going to
do is call echo and I'm just going to go
ntt stored then that's dancer featured
content that's going to echo all that
out to the screen and whenever this
plug-in is actually done somebody will
just have to copy and paste this
wherever they want the featured content
tool to show up and this is featured
data just so you can see what that looks
like open it and there you can see this
is all the information from my previous
featured content tutorial so I'm going
to dynamically load all that information
onto the screen and those are the only
changes i'm going to make to index so
far i'm going to jump in here now start
styling the menu bar to make it look
nicer and this has not changed from the
previous tutorial that dramatically i'm
going to have to create a div it's going
to be menu and i'm going to change my
background color to like a blue and then
i'm going to position relative to what
surrounds it and then i'm going to give
it a z-index what this is going to do is
it's going to make the menu float above
anything else that's on the screen why
I'm doing that is as you can see
whenever I go over the menu over here on
the side of the screen see how it floats
over the featured content even though
featured content follows it well I'm
changing the z-index to be above the
featured content so that's why I put
that in there then we go into table
navbar i decided i was going to change
the font on this and also not make it
bold so it wasn't so gaudy and i'm gonna
set this to georgia coma Sarah I'm gonna
get rid of font weight bold because like
I said before is kind of ugly I don't
need this border in there but I am going
to use a text shadow what that's going
to do is just put black and background
it's going to be one pixel down
one pixel to the right and it's going to
have a blur of one pixel come in here
again get rid of bold that's all I
needed to change their scroll up then
you come into menu normal takeout
font-weight bold again don't need that
I'm also not going to use this
background color today I'm going to use
vertical line top and then to add a nice
little gradient to this guy first going
to type in background something goes
wrong with the gradient to e i'm also
going to put a border on right for this
table 1 pixel i'm going to make it solid
OB again these are going to be blues I
just think blue looks a little bit
classier border on the left one pixel
solid and you guys always ask me what
type of skills you could put on that
would make you more attractive as an
employee or as a programmer if you learn
how to make wordpress themes i guarantee
you can get a job just about anywhere
because it's a skill that very few
people have and i'm actually going to
grab my background from my already
finished menu CSS file i'm going to
paste it in here you can look at this
code on the website but basically what
it's going to do is it's just going to
create a gradient effect for the menu
that's all it does and it works with all
the different browsers but it's kind of
tedious to type all that out that's all
I need to do there and we'll scroll down
the menu hover to change the effects
whenever someone hovers over the menu
I'm gonna have to come in here to color
and let change this to this color right
up here so it looks a little bit nicer
so paste that in there get rid of the
extra hash change this slightly font way
bold again get rid of that vertical line
tops fine get rid of background color
and then what I'm going to do is
actually come up here i'm going to use
the same grade in again and i'm going to
use the same borders i'm going to use
the same everything so I'm just going to
copy down paste that on the screen so
there I got that Finch menu normal I
decided to change the font on this as
you can see i'm getting rid of bold
everywhere change the size of it and i'm
going to change this to home and leave
everything else the same come down to
div menu hover i'm going to get rid of
the border so it looks kind of cheesy
i'm going to get rid of the bold on the
font yes i should put this over there
then change this to home again and i'm
gonna replace background color with that
nice gradient that i put everywhere else
say I'm just pasted on that in there
again come down to the actual link text
decoration nun gets rid of the underline
underneath that link and i'll leave all
this the same say i'm going to come in
here and delete that and I
guess what I'm going to do I'm going to
paste in the gradient again and you item
visited you've all this exactly the same
except again and get rid of the border
and I'm going to get rid of the
background color and paste in my filter
that's going to provide for the gradient
to show up going to change the text
color whenever the person hovers over it
and how I do that just simply like this
and here I'm going to change the
background to a blue border bottom i'm
going to change this to one pixel so
it's not so gaudy and then i'm also
going to put a border on the top one
pixel solid and i'm going to use another
blue in here nothing else needs to
change there and get to the final part
for my menu change this to d8 AF ve
padding is going to say the same kind of
changes from the background color to
background put in a nice blue again and
then here I'm actually going to just
copy these borders and replace this one
and if we file save that and reload this
point you can see everything changed
right there on your screen now we have a
much more attractive menu system even
though it doesn't match up with a
website I'm going to fix that and then
I'm going to go into index file save
that reload this you can see that it
load the featured content information in
there but it's all messed up so I got to
go in and fix all that so I'm open up
the featured content styling page and
I'm going to change my width on it to a
thousand because that's what the site is
set at I'm going to change my width for
the text area that's this guy right here
24 24 I'm going to get rid of this
background image because there's no
reason for it to be in there and instead
go background color change that to a
nice blue ntt article title going to be
this guy right here I'm going to change
whole bunch of things here I'm going to
change its position for left and that
just means how far it's going to be from
the left border to 30 leave this all the
same change this color right here which
is the color for the text to white
change the width to 345 again I'm doing
that because I want this to expand to
the full size of the browser down here
under text shadow i'm going to change
this to a nicer color for the horizontal
role which is this guy right here i'm
going to come in here and change a
couple things mainly the width is going
to be changed to 385 in the background
color for it meaning that i want the
actual color for that horizontal role to
be white article excerpt
that's this text inside of here it's
color is going to be white so that you
can see the text on the dark blue change
the width the 385 again I'm just really
changing just very few things here
article excerpt again color of the text
that shows up I want it to be white and
the width to be 385 read more i
basically just want it to be floated
over to the right a little bit because
this thing's expanding featured pic it's
going to be for 24 nothing else needs to
change with it then you got the thumb
box that's this guy down here I want
that to be for 24 from the left side of
the screen and the background color for
this is going to be blue one two three
f2e this guy right here there's actually
a border around these images I kind of
thought that looked kind of cheesy after
I did it so I'm just going to get rid of
that all together featured thumb which
are these little images inside of here
nothing needs to be changed there I do
however need to move the left button
which is this little arrow tool here 438
pixels and I'm also going to change the
opacity on that guy to fifty percent so
that it sort of blends into the
background and to get this to work with
all browsers you're also going to have
to go in filter alpha opacity is equal
to 50 and then for the right button
going to have to move it over a little
bit 971 and then I'm going to take the
opacity from up here and copy and paste
it down here so I want that to also
blend into the background and nothing
else really needs to change there and
there you can see i styled the menu and
i also style this featured content this
is a little bit mangled up but in the
next part of the tutorial i'm going to
fix that up and then continue to create
all the other little nice things until
this theme looks like this nice
beautiful piece of work as you see on
the screen leave any questions or
