mega drop-down menu one of you guys
asked me if I could recreate the mega
drop-down used on the Boston Globe's
website which this person told me is a
great example of responsive web design
so I decided what the heck I'm gonna do
that so what I'm going to do I didn't
look at any of the code on the Boston
Globe web site I'm just purely going to
look at what it looks like and recreate
the entire thing in this one video so
what I'm gonna do right now is jump into
the future and show you what I complete
by the end of this video and then we'll
make it and here we are guys this is the
final piece and you can actually see
here if you looked at a time so it's
1157 this is what I have at the end of
the tutorial
and this is the mega drop-down we
created here is the Boston Globe's
version of it and you can see that both
of them automatically are going to scale
and it's a fluid sort of design if we go
and scale that down you can see that it
automatically scales and stays in sync
no matter how small that I would make
and now of course eventually it's gonna
break but you can see that for the most
part it sticks together really nice so
now we're gonna go over and write all
the code and show you exactly how this
was made
okay so you guys saw the final mega
drop-down and this is basically what it
is on the Boston Globe's website don't
think I'm doing anything here that's bad
what I'm gonna do is recreate this whole
entire thing or at least I hope to now
what I did ahead of time was I went and
spaced out and measured every single
thing on the website so I figured out
there was 19 pixels here don't know if
you can see that which is going to
measure out the 1.9 percent this is
going to be a fluid design and the
entire bar is 9 7 9 pixels I then
measured out this is 113 pixels which
equals out to 11.5% of the total space
allowed and 19 and 19 which is 3.8 and
all of that so that is what I did ahead
of time so I did that for the entire
menu bar that we have right here and now
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take all
those numbers and translate that into
this drop-down that you see right here
all right there there's the drop-down so
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to start
off with the basic HTML and this is
layout text dot HTML
my own little things inside of here what
I like to do ahead of time is almost
always I will create a div and it will
get the name of rapper and of course all
of the code that I have here is
available in a link and the description
for this video and I like to close this
off so I know where this is and of
rapper and there we go so there we go I
got a rapper that goes around every
single thing that is in the body section
now what I have to do is create the
navigation bar so I'm going to do that
by creating an unordered list and I'm
gonna give this the class name of now
and hopefully the way that I set this up
this is going to allow you to create
pretty much any type of drop-down and
I'm gonna close off that alright so
inside of this now what I have to do is
create all of my list items so there's a
list item and I'm going to see no reason
to give this class name I am however
going to provide a link inside of here
and I'm gonna do sort of the bare
minimum I'm not gonna put the actual
links inside of here I'm just gonna do
this and close that off and I'm going to
have this be news even though this is
uppercase right here I'm going to style
that in the CSS and then I'm gonna close
off that link now I need to create a
whole bunch of these guys so let's
create this and then let's put Metro
inside of here and then while we have
this open one I just go and throw a make
a drop down inside of the Metro section
I'm not gonna do it for every single one
of them because everything's gonna be
exactly the same so right after the
Metro link inside of the link area here
I'm going to start creating the drop
down now here is the drop down in all of
its glory so I have to come in here and
put a divider inside of here an article
section another article section a bunch
of links and then a whole bunch of other
links to all of the other different
parts of the website zoom in here a
little bit so well I'm gonna decide I
want to put a div around the entire
thing because whenever this drop down
comes down it has a little bit of a tech
shadowing that shows up so like this and
you can see there's a little bit of a
shadow and there's box around it and a
whole bunch of other things so I'm
definitely going to want to create a
class here that is just
to be that and I'm just gonna call this
an Ave main just because that's the
first thing that comes to mind and we
can close that off now inside an Ave
main the very first thing I see here
whenever I look at my art where I went
and measured everything is there's a
divider here so I'm going to throw a
divider in there myself so I'm going to
create a div and I'm going to give this
the class name and these names mean
nothing they're just things I use so
this isn't like something that's in
stone that you have to type in nav
divider it's just something I made up
all right so I got my nav divider now
what I got to do well I have to create
this art section which has a little
image and it has a little title and it
has an author's name so I'm gonna come
in again create another div and I'm
going to give this the class name of nav
focus art for article and there's that
div now I need to come in here and throw
an image inside of here so I'm gonna go
image class and this time I'm going to
use images that you guys can get ahold
of very easily sorry about in the last
detour I went and used my own custom
things we call this nav art image and
then the source directory for this is
I'm going to use HTTP lorem pixel I use
a couple of these and they just throw in
junk folders and what you can do is just
put in whatever you want your height and
width debate and it's automatically
going to go out there and grab an image
for you that fits those sizes that's all
you need to do and then techniques like
this is going to give me like a
technological picture so I'm just gonna
throw that in there you can go to their
website and they'll show you all kinds
of things and I'll just say article
image just to keep this nice and simple
and then I'm gonna close that off so
there is my image and now what I need to
do is throw in a author so I'm going to
use a span right here and class name and
I'm gonna call this nav art author and
let's put Eric Schmidt inside of here
you guys are gonna see there's a little
bit of a trend here to what I'm using
whoops man and let's throw a break
statement inside of there and then I'm
gonna throw another span inside of here
class is equal to and this one's going
to be now
art title and the name of this is going
to be we messed up the comments again
and there we are and that is all I need
to do for this and there is the closing
div that I have for this so I could come
in here and say something like and of
that well now if we look over here we
can also see that there's actually two
dividers inside of here or at least
that's how I saw it so these are equal
width apart from this so this times two
equals the division right there so what
can I do with that well I could either
put two of those dividers in there or I
could just put in another one and I am
deciding I want to put in another one
and I'm just working like off the cuff
here so that's what's going on all right
so nav divider and why don't I call this
a nav divider too then what I'll do is
I'll just double up that guy and it'll
allow me to have a lot of flexibility so
then what we have well we have another
one of these like this you go like this
and throw in another focused article and
here I'm just gonna change this lorem
pixel the size is going to be exactly
the same except I'm gonna put in animals
here I can put in my name and I could
call this something like why I can't
answer comments anymore
if you're catching on to the trend here
YouTube messed up the comments again and
it's almost impossible for me to answer
comments so just to let everybody know
if you want me to answer comments put
the comments no matter what the video is
on my latest video and I will be able to
find it okay so let's go and otherwise I
will never be able to find it unless
YouTube changes that so there's another
than have divider and you can see
there's the nav divider that is through
in there and have divider too and now I
need to create this section which has
all of our headlines right there so just
need to come in
and create another div class is equal to
and I'm gonna call this nav headlines
and of nav headlines and there we go
now I need to create all of these well
they're just a bunch of divs that's all
they are or at least that's what I want
them to face there's just a whole bunch
of divs so just come in here and we're
gonna target this one up here that has
the red by actually using first child
and other things like that as you're
gonna see when we get into the CSS but I
like to do the HTML ahead of time so
we're just gonna go div class is equal
to and then basically I'm just giving
names to things classes and so forth
whenever I think I'm gonna need to edit
them so there's all sorts of things
going on here styling wise so I think I
need a class I think I need to edit it
so I'm gonna do that and I'm using the
globe sort of style here more headlines
and sometimes I'm deviating from that
all right and now I just need to create
a whole bunch of these for all the
different headlines that we have and I
just went in there and pasted all those
in there say there are all of the
different headlines that I want to use
inside of my mega drop-down alright so
now that we have that set up what I need
to do is come over here you can see
there's another divider right here and
then we're gonna have additional links
to other parts of the website so I need
to get another nav divider too which is
a doubled up divider throw that in here
right behind that guy and now I need to
create my nav links now I want to keep
them all inside of a master div so that
I can style all those and I'm gonna call
this if class is equal to and this is
gonna be nav links and just bear with me
because I'm creating like I said I'm
just creating this as I see it
so my name's might not be perfect for
what I'm doing here it's just the very
first thing that comes to mind is what
comes out on the page so there's uh have
links and I'm going to show you
everything here real time except for one
thing if I'm playing around with okay
should the text size be 0.7 EMS or 0.8
EMS I'm just gonna skip that part but
everything else is gonna be a hundred
percent a lot throw in another div so
I'm gonna call this nav link this is
gonna be an individual one and this is
gonna be more in news
because that's what the Boston Globe has
there and I just went in there and
through all those links inside of it and
there we have them all nice and
organized so then I basically just need
to do the same thing again and create
another nav links sort of section here
right next to the other one I'm just
copying what I say that's all I'm doing
I'm just breaking everything down
everything's done I did this in
Illustrator you could do this in
Inkscape I have tutorials on illustrator
and Inkscape so there's that and I went
in there and through additional divs
inside of it and there they are all
sorted out so what's left to do here
well pretty much nothing here is this
closing div and there's this closing div
and then this is going to be the closing
part for the drop down so that's what
that is so now what I need to do is just
put in the little rest of the links for
the navigation bar across the top of the
screen and I just went ahead and threw
those in there so there we go
arts business sports opinion da da da da
so there's the rest of the navigation
bar and that is all of the HTML that is
all you're gonna need to do so now what
I need to do his first save it we can
jump over here and look at exactly what
this looks like and you can see it looks
like a mess okay there it is there is
every single thing that I just created
so what I need to do now is come in here
and style everything based off of this
little design that I have right here so
we're going to create our CSS file and a
lot of things that I do here in the
beginning I do on every single web page
so I'm going to target every single
element right now and I'm an add in
border boxing and what that's gonna do
for us is whenever we define an element
and we say it's gonna be this width and
this height it is automatically going to
fit any padding and margins and borders
and so forth inside of that space
another thing that I also always do for
every element when it first starts off
if I give everything padding of 0 and a
margin of 0 then I can style all of it
all my elements individually and just
worry about them individually let's come
in here and create our font family for
our whole entire site I didn't even look
at what the globe is using I'm just
using this because this looks good sans
serif is the default font I'm going to
use here for the entire thing I'm going
to come in for
my background and what do I want to do
let's try it at 5:00 to 5:05 just for
the heck of it and then what I want to
do is document why'd I want to set my
font size 262 0.5% and I've talked about
this in previous tutorials basically
what this is gonna allow me to do is
whenever I type in 1.6 e M that is going
to be equivalent to 16 points so it's
just a little math trick that I use and
that's pretty much all you need to know
about it and and that's just gonna allow
me to do exactly what I just showed you
there cuz we I don't know it's just
something I've always done so let's go
and now let's create our wrapper font
size and there you go
1.6 a.m. now I can use that document
wide across my whole entire every single
element on my page and I'm gonna go
padding and I'm gonna go to e M this
really doesn't have anything to do with
the website at this point these are just
defaults that I want to use so if I want
my wrapper to automatically Center when
it goes zero and auto and then I can do
a width of 95% so that it's going to
center but it is also always going to
have like a little bit of a margin on
the side and background color and let's
make this white and there we go now well
as things go on here we'll be getting
into the nitty gritty and now that's
basically what we're gonna do so we're
gonna be targeting the navigation bar
right now so we can jump over here and
let's just come in here and look at what
we got see our first class is nav so
we're going to be targeting that guy
somebody go now and the styling I'm
gonna provide well first off I want my
background to be white I want the width
to automatically adjust so I'm gonna
have this beyond a percent I'm doing a
fluid layout here so as things move
everything is going to automatically fit
then I'm gonna have a height and as I
played around with this 43 pixels looks
good and that's based off of my
measurements all the stuff I'm doing up
here now if I want to be able to
position the drop-down menu underneath
the navigation bar I'm going to have to
set position to a relative so the
positioning for the drop-down that comes
underneath the navigation bar is going
to be relative to the position in the
navigation bar and then I'm going to
and put a 1 pixel solid bar underneath
of it and I'm gonna have this BB to be
eb-5 and I got that off the wiki colors
website just type in wiki colors and
Google and you will get that and that is
a gray color so now let's continue on
here getting into the more than
nitty-gritty now I want to target the
individual list items that are inside of
our navigation bar and that is how I do
it and if we just come in here and we
look and there's nav and there's Li so
I'm targeting today's sky right here so
let's come back over here and let's
start styling it well the first thing I
know that I do not want any bullets to
show up for this list item so I'm going
to set that to none nice thing I'm going
to do is I want everything to flow to
the left side of the screen so that
everything is gonna fit real nice I then
want to text the line everything to the
center for all of our list items I want
the width I have 10 items here so I'm
going to have this be 10% so each of
them is going to each list item in our
navigation bar it's gonna take up 10%
another thing I can do and I have that
in there is a default because I could
also use calc 100% and this is
automatically going to adjust for our
fluid design but some browsers don't
allow this to work so in that situation
we'll just use with 10% and see how that
works out and as far as I'm concerned
that is all I'm gonna need to do for our
navigation bar for release for the list
items
now I specifically want to come in here
we can come over here and reload this to
say what's happening and you can see
there are our list items okay so now
what I want to do is come in here to the
actual items and style of those how I do
that is just go now li and well let's go
now oh I and a so we're going to style
the links within our list item so we're
going to go with a color here and I'm
going to use like I said I'm just
pulling that from the wiki colors web
site and a color it looks nice that's
what I'm going to use and these
individual links in the Boston Globe
website look like they are bold say they
are they look bold to me anyway so I'm
going to make the font weight on these
bold font size don't
no this is rhomin have to play around a
little bit so let's do this and let's
look at this
alright so reload alright so now they're
great and I don't know let's try
something like 1.6 a.m. reload new
that's way too small let's try 7
reload no sorting look ok so let's just
leave it that way and of course you can
come back and change if we decide get
rid that text-decoration because that
looks terrible those are the underlines
underneath of all of our links and let's
have our line height be exactly the same
as our height for our little bar that we
have there assess 43 pixels again
let's do padding of 0 and 20 pixels and
height remember I said is 43 pixels so
let's just make sure that that fits
inside of there and you can say here's
say 43 pixels for the navigation bar
that's where this is coming from and I
wanted to also go and make sure that
those are uppercase because remember I
didn't put them in as uppercase whenever
I first created it and now if we reload
it you can see that it's starting to
look pretty good so yeah there's the
Boston Globe there's me okay
looking pretty good so now what do I
need to target well I need to start
targeting what's gonna happen whenever
these guys are hovered over right now
nothing happens and on the Boston Globe
website one of you hover over them they
put little borders on the left and the
right so let's do the same thing so I'm
gonna go nav target my list items
specifically target them when they are
hovered over and when they are hovered
over I'm gonna say that I want my border
on the right I'm gonna make that one
pixel and they're gonna be solid and I'm
going to use I'm going to use this
consistent color let's use this guy
right here so we're gonna use grayish
color I'm gonna do the same thing on the
left so that's whenever those list items
are hovered over or they are going to
automatically throw a border on there
just like the Boston Globe site does
this is gonna be exactly like the Boston
Globe it's gonna be very very close and
if you guys play around with it a little
bit more you can make it perfect or you
can just use this to create whatever you
want to create so now what I want to do
is I want to show my drop-down box
whenever the individual items are
hovered over so I'm gonna go list item
hover
and I'm gonna target a div and in this
situation I'm going to display my div
the drop-down box as block so it's going
to show whenever it's hovered over and
it's not gonna show whenever it's not
hovered up so now what I need to do is
position my menu drop down relative to
my nav bars so I'm gonna go now and list
item div so the div that's contained
inside of the list item let's go over
here and look at that just to make sure
we know what we're talking about
so here's Metro this is the one link
that has a drop down and I'm
specifically coming in here to get this
do so we will position it absolutely no
absolute and remember we're going to be
doing this because we set this position
right here to relative so because that
is relative this absolute positioning is
gonna be based off of that navigation
bar so I'm going to say that I want it
to be left 0 I want it to be exactly
where the navigation bar is and I want
the top to be don't know that's like 43
so let's just try 40 pixels so that's
where it's going to be positioned and
let's reload it and let's see that's
kind of a mess I don't know we'll come
back to that and look and see what we
need to change here for that let's just
change it I don't know 41 or something
like that let's see what happens we also
want to say that this nav shouldn't show
unless it is hovered over so again we're
targeting the drop-down box and you
could say if I reload that see now it
doesn't show no it does show oh look at
that see there it is it looks like it's
gonna line up nicely whenever it's down
there all right so what else do we need
to do with that div well we're gonna
have to give it a background color maybe
let's just say background color and
let's just make that white again you
just type in a white you could do
whatever you want to do let's go and set
our padding on this div let's just say
something like 10 pixels and 10 pixels
just to see how that looks when I come
back and change that
and remember also the Boston Globe had a
box shadow so I'm just gonna go box
shadow for now and later on if I have to
come in here and define all the
different box shadows for all the
different process
types RGBA and I'm going to say that I
just want this to be black and I'm gonna
change the opacity on this guy so zero
let's say it's bike 40% opacity and
we'll see how that looks
and then overflow we want to hide
overflow we want to hide anything that
goes outside of that div when it pops up
there just so it looks nice and neat and
these are like things would always do
whenever we're working with these sorts
of stylings and so forth as far as I
know that is the end of the navigation
bar styling for now so what I want to do
now is come in here and actually create
the navigation bar see everything looks
pretty okay could see the little box
shadow there and now I need to style all
these guys which means I need to look at
this and figure out how exactly that's
gonna be styled well the very first
thing I want to do is let's come in and
let's look there's nav main what do I
want to do with nav main which is gonna
be the box that surrounds the entire
thing I'm gonna go nav main first thing
I want to do is I want to make sure that
it's exactly the same width as my
navigation bar that contains it so I'm
gonna have that be a hundred percent
because that's what the globe's website
does and then I'm also going to come in
here and throw a border around it again
because those cloves site does this I'm
gonna say solid and no I didn't I did
save it okay so there is and there is
our gray that we've been using over and
over again so let's just use that as far
as I know that is all I need to do for
the div that contains everything in or
drop-down next thing I want to do well
we have these dividers right here so
there is the very first nav divider and
it's going to take up 1.9 percent of the
screen so we'll go nav divider target
that guy we want to display:inline-block
because we want to be able to set things
like padding and margins and borders and
so forth but we want it to act like an
inline item so that it doesn't jump to
the next base because everything of
course goes from left to right so if it
jumped down there
and that would be a bad thing and then
we'll say are with and I know I put 1.9
but for now I'm just gonna take it down
just a little hair below that and see
how that works because that normally
ends up working better and now that
comes into our actual art section here
or the article section with the pictures
and the name for the authors and all
that stuff so that is called nav focus
art so we'll target that guy and again
we're going to display this inline block
again of course because it goes from
left to right we want our width in this
situation what do I have it set for here
I have it set for 11.5 so let's make
that 11.5 exactly what it is see the
dividers I normally take a hair down and
everything else I keep right on exactly
what it shows or what I measured out
before vertical alignment I want this to
be top want it to be you know at the top
of the div that's inside of and my text
I want that to have an alignment of
center again because that's what the
globe has so we do that and let's go
them in here see this is centered
centered okay but for the most part I'm
looking at this time this is centered
also alright so as far as I know that's
all I need to do for that guy so now
let's go in and target the author and
the title of course I could come in here
and do them separately or I could do
them at the same time and so I with an
Ave art author and nav art title like
that if I felt like doing it that way if
I don't plan on changing anything that
works beautifully well go
display:inline-block and the padding on
this let's just make it 10 pixels and 0
whoops padding and let's make it 10
pixels and let's make it zero pixels and
then I want to do some more specific
things so let's say our font right here
there's the author's name and this is
bigger than that so let's now I'll go in
and get the specifics rather than the
generic so I'm going to go nav art
author and what am I gonna change on
this well one thing let's make our font
size let's make it point
I don't know see if that works out and
then we'll go color and in this
situation we'll make it red because
that's what the globe does now the
actual article name is a little bit
different so we'll go nav art title and
we'll change the font size for that to
1.4 a.m. and then the image which is
this picture right here let's come in
here what do I need to style on that
well I can go nav or image and I can't
think anything I don't have any borders
around it whoops
display I know that I want it to be
inline block though there's nothing else
that I can think of I want to do with
that so I'm gonna let it be inline block
and not style anything else of course I
can throw a border around it or padding
or whatever but right now I don't need
nothing and that brings us to the
divider that comes remember here are the
dividers this divider it's twice as big
as the other one so we got an F divided
her let's go and copy that and we'll
throw that inside of there and this is
called nav divider - I'm right change
the name slightly still gonna be
inline-block and let's chuck this up
23.8% just like that that brings us to
our headlines here are our headlines and
we need to style those as well not much
work here we'll just go nav headlines
and what do we need to do well we need
to do display:inline-block again because
every one of those needs to be set that
way our width I already kicked went and
measured that 34.5% you can see like
most of the works done here and philetus
doesn't take longer though I'm just
measuring it out with a little roller
it's simple so 34.5% let's have our font
size be equal to and this isn't gonna be
exact by any means I'm just throwing
this in here and just taking it by eye
what it looks like to me font weight and
we will say font weight is bold because
those look bold in comparison to the
other fonts there let's do a text
alignment of left because that's aligned
left and let's do a little bit padding
on the right maybe
now do I want to do I'll do a little bit
of padding on the right let's just say
little three pixels that I'm not even
certain that I want but I left it in
there anyway
duh and what else do we need to do well
the individual border or these guys
right here these individual items have
borders across the bottom so let's go in
and target those as well and those have
the name of now bar link where are they
they are have headline link this guy
right here so let's go in and and style
those specifically
I have headline link and what do they
need to do well they need to have a
border on the bottom because that's the
way they look on the screen we'll just
go one pixel and that's gonna be solid
and then we'll get our little gray that
we have up here there it is right there
take it down here paste that in there
got that set up and then they need to
have a little bit of a padding on them
so let's just say ten pixels again stick
with what we've basically been doing and
ten pixels and there we are and that
brings us down to the last child element
down here this one doesn't have a border
on it so it doesn't have a border across
the bottom so what do we do whenever we
want to target that last child well we
just go and copy this guy we'll say the
last child element of this class type so
last child saying very simple we'll just
set its border with two zero pixels and
that will get rid of the border only on
the last child element for those links
what do we need now well now when you
have our Naville inks that are gonna be
these guys over here so we need to style
those as well so we're gonna have links
and how do we want to style them well
we're gonna have them be
display:inline-block again because that
worked good before and what is going to
be the width for each of these well if
we zoom in here you can see it's eleven
point nine five so eleven point nine
five percent they are going to be
vertically aligned to the top of our
little elemental section and text
aligned they are text aligned to the
left so we will make them text aligned
to the left as well not much else to do
there what else do we have so there's
our now
link's there's no links that is and then
we can target our individual nav links
let's just copy that jump over here
class name have links yeah what are we
gonna do with these guys
pretty much nothing I can really think
of let's go and reload this see what
happens reload and have links they're
gonna need a little bit of space between
them maybe I don't know that's about all
I can think of to do so let's go and put
a little bit of padding on the bottom
and we'll just say something like 20
pixels what else do we have here jump
over well as I'm looking at this you can
see it says more in the news here and
say more in the news and there's nothing
up there so I'm gonna have to jump back
over into my HTML and let's create
another day of where it says
investigations just throw that inside of
there and paste that in there and this
guy I'm gonna give a specific name I'm
going to call this nav empty cell okay
and it's not gonna have anything in
there it's just gonna take up some space
so nav empty cell yeah why don't we do
the styling on that so that we'll be
able to fit that inside of there it's
right down here we'll go and have empty
cell and what can we do for it well we
can just do some padding on the top of
it and we'll just say 30 pixels cuz I'm
not sure and if we look at it you can
see well say more in the news and it
looks like it needs to go down just a
hair more so we'll go I don't know 40
pixels and reload it and that is about
perfect maybe 41 I don't know 41 42
something like that you get the idea and
there it looks like it's just about
perfect okay so there's a nav empty cell
which was something I didn't catch
whatever I was first trying to think
about what we're doing what else do we
need to do well this needs to be read
and this needs to be read so let's go in
and make those read so we'll go now and
headline link and I want the first child
in this situation as well so we'll say
first child that's what I want to target
and I'll just make the color for that
red just like I did before and then I
can do the same thing for the nav link
which are these guys over here app link
I need to make the first child red as
well and reload that and everything is
looking okay there's just some sort of
error right here and I think it
figured out what it is nav headline
should actually beam have headlines and
let's save that and that's nav headlines
as you can see right here so you now
have headlines and that's what was
messing that up so let's save it and
reload it and there we go there you go
guys you can see right here if I go and
resize this it's automatically going to
scale so I can put that over that again
and if I scale it down even further it's
still gonna scale and it looks doggone
close to what we get with the Boston
Globe so there you are hope you guys
