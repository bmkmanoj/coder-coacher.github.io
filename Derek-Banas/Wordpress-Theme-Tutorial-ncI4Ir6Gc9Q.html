my wordpress theme tutorial in which
you're going to learn exactly how to
make themes inside of WordPress we're
going to start off with really
simplistic ones and eventually get into
very very complicated ones if they're
specifically something you'd like me to
create send a comment below and I will
do my best to do it well this right here
is what's called the kubrik or the
default theme inside of WordPress and
just so you understand this is
considered the header this is considered
the main body of index.php which is the
name of the opening page whenever you
would click on it this over here is the
sidebar and this is the footer and I'm
going to mainly focus on the four files
that are needed to create this window
right here and all the functions that
are needed inside of WordPress to have
this guy setup properly well I'm going
to jump over into index you can see the
four functions I'm going to be
explaining here the four files I'm going
to be explaining here right there but
this is indexed up PHP and the very
first thing it does is it calls get
header which is a function that just
simply calls and runs all the code
that's contained inside of a program
that is called header diapey HP so let's
just jump right into header dot PHP and
explain everything that's inside of here
okay first off we have our doctype where
we're defining just basic HTML this is
in HTML transitional file and that's all
we're defining if you understand HTML
you understand what that means
then we come to our first WordPress
function right inside of here a size for
the header function that we called
previously this is called language
attributes and simply what this does is
it prints out the language that you are
going to be using inside of this file in
my case since I am English I'm going to
print out language equals e and s us
right there that's all this function
does is print out this string right
there and that just tells the browser
that I'm going to be speaking or writing
in English that's it
that's all it does nothing more this guy
right here is a bit confusing and just
to show you how it important it is I
could actually delete it out of here
without hurting anything
but I'm going to leave it inside here
basically what this function here does
it provides you with a way to define
your relationship to any links on your
blog so if you link to somebody it
provides you with the opportunity to say
hey this is my friend and to give you an
example of what the
actually looks like this is on the link
part of your dashboard inside of
WordPress if you come down here where
you're defining all your links above you
can see here that you can come in here
and define the relationship you have
with the person that you're linking to
okay
nothing really to worry about nothing
really to dwell upon but that's just
what it is blog info this function right
here displays blog information based off
of the parameters that you send it so
you can say HTML type for example and
you can see this is just basic HTML and
it's just polling this information in
automatically most of the time when you
create a theme this will not change this
stuff's all going to be the same every
single time this just says basically
what type of HTML are you using you
could also put name inside of there it
will shoot back the blog name or
description or the admin email or URL or
the WordPress URL stylesheet URL links
to all of your RSS feeds the pain back
URL which would just be the URL if
somebody would copy some of your content
that would be used language character
set text direction in my case is going
to be left-to-right or version so those
are all the different things that blog
info does you ask it for specific things
and it shoots it back out at you you can
see here's character set is being used
as well then you have WP title what this
guy does I'll actually show it to you
before we get into it because they up
here where it says blog sample site
right up here what this is basically
doing this line of code is creating this
and putting this little bracket mark
right here these two bracket marks and
that right here represents the two
bracket marks that you have right there
it's going to display the title of the
page followed by these two things if you
can't remember but you can also define
other separators that you want to use
you can put a dash inside of there or
any other separator just whatever you
put between quotes that's what's going
to show up there
and if this is marked as true you're
going to echo the title of the screen if
it's marked as false a simple PHP string
is going to be returned whenever you
call WP title and then right defines
where the title shows up in relation to
this separator then down here you can
see I'm making another call to blog info
I'm just saying hey where's the style
sheet at that's all I'm doing
then down here I'm defining the pane
back URL nothing all that complicated
down here with comments is a global
variable that defines if comments should
be displayed on the page or not if it's
marked as false of course
going to display the comments that's all
this guy does is single checks if only a
single post is being displayed and this
is basically just saying if so don't
display a sidebar and this can also be
used to check if posts 17 for example is
being used if I would come in here and
define this it would say is the post
that has the ID 17 being displayed and
if so do certain things this would never
be used in this circumstance but I'm
just showing you some of the other
different things or of course you could
put in a very specific post title for
this situation to check if a specific
post was being displayed but I'm not
going to do anything I'm just simply
going to ask is there a single post
being displayed and if there is then I
do not want to create a sidebar that's
what all this code is saying here then
we have just basic stylesheet
information asking for that text
direction again basic stuff this is
saying if there is no sidebar then we're
going to again make a call to the
stylesheet directory and look for any
specific information that's there and we
jump down here to this PHP information
here is singular checks if a single page
or post is being displayed that's what
that's asking and if it does this
function right here that I have
highlighted is used to call built-in
JavaScript scripts and this one right
here specifically sets up threading on
the screen in regards to comments that's
what these do and just to give you a
couple more examples of some other
things you can do with this function
later on again not here but later on so
that you understand these guys a little
bit better if you wanted to example put
jQuery little actual framework for
jQuery and siding or all you have to do
is come in here and type in jQuery
inside of quotes and it would
automatically load and put in the jQuery
framework code that would be needed to
use that framework and you could also
come in here and actually define your
own scripts
meaning mainly JavaScript code that you
would want to run by coming in here and
typing in register which is another
function that is used to define a
customized script and then I could come
in here and say my j/s code for example
would be the name of my script and then
I could put you around to script inside
of quotes you could then define an array
of scripts that need to be called before
this is called
then you could put in a version or the
specific script and then if you also
would come in here and type in true that
would make this code fire at the end of
the body and then you could come in now
that you have to find your own script
and you've created your own little tag
to use it you could fire it off just by
coming in here and going my Jas code for
example it would automatically provide
you with a way to come in and run
customized JavaScript code right inside
of here it's a little bit confusing that
don't worry about it's not really a big
deal then you come into some of the real
power of WordPress with WP head what
this guy does is it's called a hook and
what they what allows you to do is this
provides a warning that says hey the
head section of this page is about ready
to close would you like to run any
additional functions we're going to get
more into this because this is more in
relation to how plugins work inside of
WordPress but what this guy does it's
kind of a warning the head sections
about ready to close do you need me to
run any functions before we close the
head section if so run those functions
if not don't worry about it you don't
need to worry about necessarily anymore
about that guy the one I just explained
you to create themes that's more plugin
type thing but I just wanted to go over
it so that you knew exactly what that
meant and then we jump down through here
right here body class generates a custom
class ID based off of what page your
user is currently on and you could also
define a custom class by just providing
a class name you personally created
inside of here inside of quotes so if
that's of any use to you as well that's
how that operates and you have good
option home here this returns the blog
URL just like blog info dot URL is used
and mainly from what I know this is only
used when you want to move your
WordPress folders outside of the root
directory and then point towards them
again if it's at all confusing don't
worry about it it's something you're
never really going to have to pay a lot
of attention to so those are all the
different things asides from description
and so forth that you would use inside
of the header dot PHP file so then we're
going to jump back over into index and
I'm going to continue explaining
everything that goes into this guy so
you remember get a header function which
we had before here we're just defining
some classes and ID's for this div which
is main I pointed out where main lies
before and then right here is the
beginning of what wordpress calls the
loop what it does is it loops through
every post based off the value
you stored inside of a object called WP
query and WP query will contain
information on how many posts to display
how they qualify for being displayed
meaning that if you were looking
specifically for categories IDs authors
pages etc that's what WP query has it
basically says okay I want to see
everything you have in regards to
cooking recipes which lies in a category
and WP query knows that for example you
have 50 of those inside of that specific
category what it's going to do is it's
going to say as long as WP query
continues to tell me that there are
posts to be displayed I'm going to
continue to loop through this guy and
then have posts basically ask WP query
if any posts qualify for displaying and
then right here you're defining while
there are still posts to display the
post function will continue to load post
data and then when we come down here
post class will print to screen any
class ID specific to this post and then
the idea prints out the ID that is
specific to the post a permalink is the
permanent URL for all of your posts
meaning this will never change even if
the title changes and the permalink
function prints that link out to screen
so that you can find it this part right
here the permanent link to part prints
out permanent link to followed by the
title of the post which is provided by a
function called the title the time
prints out the date and time when the
post was first created and the author
prints out the author's name so that's
what all of those different functions
inside of there do if we scroll this guy
up then you have the content what this
is going to do is it's going to print
the content of the post up till the more
tag is reached and if you don't know
what the more tag is that means you
don't I use WordPress very well and I
don't really have time to get into that
but go check out any of my WordPress
tutorials you can easily will learn
anything you'd want to know about
WordPress there and you can of course
define the text to display for the more
tag as they did in the string that you
see right here read the rest of this
entry this is what is going to replace
the actual more tag whenever all these
posted printed out on the screen and
then we come down here to the tags
function what this does is returns all
the tags that are associated with the
post and tags are pretty much exactly
the same as keywords but they're called
tags in WordPress and then
you can see I'm going to Center in here
on all these functions the get category
list just simply returns all the
categories this post is associated with
separated by whatever you define as the
separator and here you can see that is a
comma and if a person is logged in and
has permission to edit the post that's
on the screen edit post link will
display a link that allows them to click
on it and then go directly in and edit
that page comments pop-up link displays
a custom message based off of the number
of comments and you can come in here you
can see right here the first message
that you put in here would be the
message is shown if there are no
comments and then here you can see this
is what would be praying the screen if
there's one comment and you could also
go in there and print a default string
that's going to show up if there are
numerous comments and then here if the
comments are closed this string is going
to print out so that's what that
function does and again a lot of this
stuff just copy and paste so let's
scroll up we get to end while and end
while would be Matt whenever the all
that information in regards to the post
is done printing out the screen and it
would start and continue printing out
additional information on all those
other posts that WP query says or fine
post to print and then this guy right
here next post link prints out a link to
any additional posts that couldn't fit
on the current page and you can also
define what message should print and
what symbol should or can be shown at
that point in time you might remember
this guy it looks like this oops went
down there right there so that's what
that guy does there I got rid of it and
then previous posts link just prints a
link out on the screen that works in the
exact opposite way of the next post link
function then you come down here to the
underscore e function simply what this
does is it prints out the error message
that you provide if no posts were found
that's all it does it's kind of print
and I found or sorry you but you are
looking for something that isn't here
that's all it does it prints a custom
message out to screen and then you call
the get search form and this is going to
print out search information on the page
and then this closes the whole entire
thing and then we get down into this guy
right here which is going to call for
all the information that is in the
function called sidebar dot PHP and then
finally this is going to call all of the
code that is found in footer dot PHP and
print all that out to screen so let's
jump over into sidebar okay we're in
sidebar dot PHP
and here what we're doing this is more
PHP a code than it is WordPress code but
it's asking if a function exists meaning
as a plug-in being installed that has a
function called dynamic sidebar if it
has then it's going to go about creating
that sidebar here we're going to get the
capabilities for searching inside of the
website let's just jump over here for a
second because you haven't seen this in
a while we're talking about this guy
right here that's what that does it
prints that out on the screen provides
that functionality here as it says
actually in the commenting of sidebar
dot PHP it allows you to decide if you
want the author meaning you to be
displayed here on the screen and you
come down here and here we're doing a
bunch of if checks or conditionals and
basically what this is doing is is 404
it's checking if any 404 error is being
displayed on the screen or here we're
checking if a category archive page is
being displayed and everything else if
you understand these two things you'll
understand the rest of them is this
printing out based off of how many posts
are displayed on a day on a month on a
year is this search results or is this a
paid and that's what although these
different little guys are doing inside
of here and then based off of its
further checking if page currently being
displayed on the screen is a 404 error
it's going to do certain things and if
it is a category page it's going to do
certain other things and here just to go
through all these functions so you
understand what all of them do single
capital returns the title for the
category if this is marked as true it's
actually marked as false and the first
string if defined where here we are not
defining a string will print before the
category name so this is just printing
out the category title onto the screen
nothing really that complicated then we
come down inside of here and again this
is just printing out words or echoing
out information onto the screen basic
HTML here I'm getting the blog name here
I'm getting a URL here I'm getting the
time that it was created again getting
the URL getting the blog name getting
the date that it was created this is all
based off of all these different things
changing it's making multiple calls to
get blog info over and over and over
again and here we come to a function we
haven't seen before this is WP special
characters and what this does is it
converts any special characters into
their regular HTML entities and you're
technically supposed to use another
function now called escape HTML
since Kubrick's kind of old this still
does work but you probably should use
the other function or just leave it here
it doesn't really matter whenever you're
first starting off in theme development
and then this function gets search
query' what if this will do is it will
actually return the string that was
previously typed into the search box
that brought up the page that's now
being displayed on the screen then this
is all basic HTML and PHP and get blog
info which I hope you understand at this
point real simple simple stuff and we
get down here to another function you
haven't seen us called WP list pages
what it does is returns a list of all
the pages as a list of links and you can
define numerous options in this function
and I will actually provide a link in
the underbar below that will provide you
access to all the different options that
are provided through the use of this
function it's actually quite a useful
function as our most functions inside of
WordPress then you have WP get archives
and this returns a list to all the
archived pages and again there's
multiple options that can be provided or
found in the underbar below just so you
understand what I'm saying like open the
program up over here I'm talking about
this see it's printing out pages it's
printing out archives you're going to
see in a second it's going to print out
categories a blogroll da-da-da-da-da so
that's what this is doing we're working
in the sidebar and it's printing out the
proper content based off of what type of
content you currently have on the screen
and this right here this function right
here actually does print out all the
categories in a nice little list and a
link to all of those the guys and here
is home returns true if you are on the
main home page and his page returns true
if you are on a regular page and not on
a post and if you are indeed either on
the home page or on a regular page then
we're going to come down here and create
all these different little guys and WP
list bookmarks displays all of the links
that are defined in the administration -
links panel and I actually have this guy
right here and you can see this right
here
and what I'm talking about is all of
these links that are provided right here
so that's where we're at in the sidebar
at this point ton and I provide another
link in the underbar below to more
information and options in regards to
that function then as we scroll down
here to the very next WordPress specific
function inside of here WP Register
displays a link if an administrator is
logged in or register
if they are not logged in and you can
also define and numerous different
things inside here like if you want to
set up your WordPress site so that it
would only work if people were logged in
you could come in here and define
multiple different defaults so I could
come in here and this would be the
string to display for the link itself
and anytime there's a small number of
options I'll actually go through them
and in the next string you'll put the
string to display after the link and
then if you put true inside of this guy
it's going to echo a link and if you put
false inside of this guy it is going to
echo out a PHP string so these functions
do double duty they both echo out to the
screen and also you can call them to get
information to be used in other ways
then we come to WP login out and what
this does is if the person is logged in
it will show a log out link and if
they're logged out it'll show a logged
in link and you could also redirect the
user to a login page automatically if
they aren't already logged in and if you
want to do that it would be real simple
you just come in here and type in
whatever your login URL is that you want
them to automatically be sent to if they
currently are not logged into your
WordPress site there's ways to protect
access to different pages inside of
WordPress and then here's the underscore
a function again this just sends a
message out to the screen if we had any
type of error in our code or we couldn't
properly provide information to them
here is a link back to that guy that
allows you to show your relationship to
any links that are on your WordPress
site remember we talked about at the
very beginning I said it's kind of goofy
and then down here WP meta what that
does is just like the WP head function
we saw before it provides you with a way
to run custom functions before the
sidebar is closed again this is often
used for plugins we'll get more into
this later I just did wanted to let you
know that's what it's doing
just like before this is a wordpress
hook that says hey the sidebar is about
ready to close would you like to run
some functions and if it says yes then
it runs them and if you say no it
doesn't and then endif closes off the
sidebar and we're almost done because if
you jump over into index again we're
going to call to get footer function
which basically runs all the code that's
found in footer dot PHP and this has
been a rip-roaring tutorial hopefully
understand what
talking about if you don't leave a
comment below or chances are you
probably already left already so what
are we going to do in the footer section
real basic basic stuff I'm going to
print out some just basic information
about WordPress and so forth and so on
being that your blog is proudly powered
by WordPress and here we're going to
make a call for the information in
regards to the name on your blog there's
a link over to WordPress and then this
guy down here this call to get blog info
is actually going to provide a link back
to your RSS feed and print it out there
on the screen and this last guy down
here get num queries which is found
right here this is a special wordpress
function that retrieves the number of
database queries that were issued while
WordPress was being run on this page and
again WP footers called this is another
hook that says hey the footer is about
ready to close would you like to run
some functions and that is WordPress
that is every single thing that goes
into it hopefully I didn't make it seem
more confusing that it is I was trying
to make it seem not that confusing
basically all you're doing is creating
basic HTML basic CSS code you're calling
custom JavaScript files using special
wordpress functions that are created for
you and you're calling multiple
different functions inside of WordPress
to pull information dynamically from the
database and update it if you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below otherwise till
