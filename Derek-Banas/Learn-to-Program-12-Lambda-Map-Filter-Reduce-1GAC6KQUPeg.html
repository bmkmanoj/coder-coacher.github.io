12 of my learn to program series in this
part of the tutorial we're going to do a
lot of advanced things with functions
I'm going to cover how to use functions
as objects function annotations lambda
or anonymous functions map filter reduce
and I'll have a whole bunch of problems
for us to practice with if you haven't
watched any of the previous parts of
this tutorial I provide a link here in
the video to the complete playlist
you should definitely start from the
beginning and in the description
underneath the video I have a link to
all of the code that is heavily
commented as well as a transcript from
the video and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay so here we aren't
inside a PyCharm so the very first thing
I'm going to do is I'm going to create a
function and I'm going to call it x 2
and it is going to receive a number and
I'm going to show you a whole bunch of
different ways maybe odd sort of ways we
can use functions first off we're going
to be able to well let's go in here and
finish this up and it's just going to
multiply this times 2 we're going to be
able to assign them to a name so let's
say I create a variable called x 2 I can
assign the function I just created to it
so x 2 and we can just chop that part
off right there and then what I'll be
able to do is come in here and do a
print and we can say something like 4
times 2 is equal to jump out of here and
then go times 2 like that and pass a 4
inside of it and you can see right there
4 times 2 is equal to 8 so that's one
way to use functions another thing you
can do is pass a function into a
function so let's create one let's just
call this do math just to keep it simple
and you can see I'm going to pass a
function inside of here and I'm also
going to pass in a value for that
function to operate on we can then refer
to our function just with func because
that's the way we define it in the
attributes and then we can come out of
here and say something like print eight
times two is going to be equal to and
then we can call do math up here and
then pass in our multiplication function
inside of there but we're just going to
pass it in by name and then pass in the
value of eight and if we run that you
can see right there
back is eight times two is equal to
sixteen so another neat thing we can do
with functions let's do some more let's
create first off I'm going to return a
function and on top of that I'm going to
make this be a dynamically created
function inside of a function so pretty
cool stuff
and you should practice and create your
own functions here to really get this
stuff down so I'm going to say x num and
let's say that I want to pass in a value
inside of here and then I'll dynamically
create a function that's going to
receive this value up here for num and
then return the entire function and
perform a custom multiplication on it so
let's go and to find another function
inside of this function so let's just
call this x and it is going to receive a
value and then it is going to do a
calculation based off of the number that
was passed into this outside function
that surrounds it and then multiply that
x value so you can see it's dynamically
creating this guy and then we will come
in here and return x get rid of that
part right there and then let's come
down here and I'll just say generated
function is equal to and I can go get
function x number and inside of this guy
pass a five inside of there and we'll
see right here that we're going to be
able to say five times ten is equal to
and then come out here and say generated
function and then pass in the value of
ten inside of our generated function and
run it and you can see indeed that works
so that's how we can create a dynamic
function and also how to return a
function from a function it's all pretty
cool stuff another thing we're going to
be able to do is come in here and embed
a function into a data structure so
let's just leave all those functions
there on our screen and then we will
store them inside of a list so I'm going
to call this list of funks is equal to
and we can throw
our times too inside of there and we can
also throw our generated function inside
of there so here is the times to
function which is going to multiply
times two and then the generated
function also which is this guy right
here and we come down here and we can
actually run these so we can say
something like print and five times
times nine is equal to and then we can
refer to these using the list itself so
we can just say one and then inside of
here let's pass in the value of nine
into said function and run it and you
can see indeed that it came through and
was able to print that and we'll get
more into storing these inside of lists
later on and doing some cool things but
now it's time for us to do our very
first problem all right so what I want
you to do here is to create a function
it's going to receive a list and a
function the function passed is going to
return true or false if a list value is
odd and the surrounding function will
return a list of odd numbers so
basically we're going to have one
function that is going to be used to
determine if a number is odd or not and
I'll give you a little hint you can use
modulus to do that you were then going
to pass that function as well as a list
into another function and then you're
going to use that function against that
list to generate a list of just simply
odd numbers so you can pause the video
here right now and try that out
otherwise I am going to create it for
you alright so we can come in here and
we can say is it's odd and it's going to
receive a number and to find out if the
number is odd or not we're going to come
in here and go numb modulus two and if
that is equal to zero that means it is a
multiple of two which means that it is
definitely even so in that situation I
will return false otherwise I will
return true so there's that function
it's going to tell us if it's odd or not
now I'm going to create another function
that is going to come in here
and create our list that is going to be
a list of odd numbers so we're going to
get a list passed into it as well as a
function and it's going to be this
function right here we're going to
generate our odd list that we are going
to throw a whole bunch of odd numbers
inside of and then we're going to cycle
through this list and determine what is
odd and what is an odd we're going to
refer to our is it odd function by going
if func and I and if that comes back as
true we're going to call append to throw
that number into our list otherwise we
are going to return our oddest after we
have cycled through all of those
different numbers that are available to
us now all we need to do is to create
our list so I'm going to go create a
series of values from 1 to 20 random
values and then I can come in and say
print change list and then inside of
here we want to pass the list as well as
our function is it odd and if we run
that up give me a little bit an error
let's see what I did wrong Oh pi charms
auto-completion messed me up there I
want to get rid of that whenever you're
passing the function you just do it by
name you don't put the parentheses after
it and run it and you can see indeed
that that list that it received from 1
to 20 was converted to just the odd
numbers so fill you got that right and
if you didn't that is perfectly okay the
whole idea here is just to show you a
whole bunch of common problems so that
whenever you see them in the future you
will be able to solve them and now we're
going to jump over into something a
little bit odd and it is called function
annotations now it is possible to define
the data types of attributes and the
return values with things called
annotations but just be aware that
they're going to have no impact on how
the function operates but instead
they're mainly used as documentation
just one to cover them just so that I
can say that I've covered pretty much
everything so we can come in here and we
can generate a function and we can say
that name is going to be a string and
age is going to be an integer and weight
is going to be a float and
and we can also come in here and say
that we're going to be returning a
string so there is a function with all
of the different annotations we can then
come in and we can print out the name
and you can also do it with all the
other different values I'm going to show
you that it can work but also that it
can be broken like I said this is for
documentation reasons only and it isn't
necessarily something you can rely on
it's not enforced but it does have its
uses okay so we'll just go wait and wait
and then we can come in here just so we
have output that we can put on the
screen and we could say something like
blank is blank years old and ways blank
and then of course we're going to use
format here to throw in the proper
information and that's going to be named
and it's going to be age and it's going
to be weight and that's what our
function does and then we can come in
here and say print and call random
function to execute and we can pass in
good data inside of here we can follow
the rules that we have set and five
point five but just know that you're not
going to get an error if you would come
in and do the same thing print and
random function and then let's just
throw in 89 and Derrick and turtle just
throw some completely nonsense inside of
here and other thing we can do just to
show you the last thing we can do is
print the annotations out on the screen
so we can just go random function get
rid of this part and then go to
underscores annotations let's go in here
and throw turtle inside of there and run
it and here you can see if we run this
you can see all of the output that came
out on the screen but more importantly
you're going to see 89 is Derek years
old and waste
turtle so complete nonsense and here in
this situation you can see whenever the
information goes in there properly it
makes more sense but in fact you can
break the annotations and do whatever
you want
so there are function annotations and
now I'm going to jump over into
something a little bit more interesting
and those are anonymous functions using
lambda now lambda is very similar to
Det define or D EF or whatever you want
to refer to a task but rather than
allowing you to assign a function to a
name like you do with define lambda
instead is just simply going to return
it and because there is no name that is
the reason why lambda functions are also
known as anonymous functions however you
can assign a lambda function to a name
so it'll make more sense when I show you
a couple examples now the basic format
of a lambda function is you're going to
have lambda and then you're going to
have argument 1 and argument 2 and as
many arguments as a one after that and
this is going to be followed by a colon
and then you're going to have some type
of expression that is going to use the
arguments in one way or another
so let's come in here and just go and
create one I'll make a whole bunch of
sense so let's say you wanted to and
like I said you can assign a lambda to a
name let's say I want to come in here
and create a sum function remember it's
going to receive two attributes x and y
in this situation they're going to put a
colon down inside of here and then
you're going to follow that with
whatever you want to do with those two
attributes which in this situation is to
add them together and you may ask
yourself well why would you ever use
lambdas lambdas are used whenever you
need a small function but you don't want
to junk up your code with a whole bunch
of temporary function names that may
cause naming conflicts among other
different issues so there we go got that
all in there and now let's use it we can
just come in and say print and then we
could say sum and call for this to
execute so four and five and run it and
the sum comes back as not see exactly
how that works another thing we can do
is use a ternary operator to see for
example if someone can vote so let's
just come in here and we'll say can vote
is going to be equal to lambda and it's
going to receive an age and it's going
to return true if age is greater than or
equal to 18 else it's going to return a
false and this is going to allow us to
come in
and just quite simply say can votes and
then call for can vote and then we'll
pass in sixteen for example and if we
run it can vote it's going to come back
as false and if we change this to 19 you
can see that it comes back it's true and
let's do a couple more examples here you
could also create a list of functions so
let's say we wanted to create a power
list that's going to convert these two
different powers up convert numbers to
different powers
so let's come in and go lamda going to
receive X and it is then going to take X
to the power of two and let's come in
and also well before we go out of that
let's do the same thing here for a
couple other ones so copy that like that
and we'll do ^ 3 and then we'll do one
more and this will be to the power of 4
and now we'll be able to refer to these
functions that are inside of these lists
so let's say I want to run these
different functions against one value I
can say for funk in and power list and
then I can just come in and say print
and call whatever the function is x 4
and you could say that it went and ran
each one of those functions against the
one value that I passed inside of it
another thing we could do is we can
store lambdas inside of dictionaries so
let's say that we wanted to add some
type of random information member a
million years ago whenever we created
the warriors that fought to their death
let's say that we wanted to have some
type of random information that pops out
on the screen whenever the warriors
fought against each other well we could
go and create a dictionary and we could
say quick is going to be an option and
then inside of here : and we could throw
our lambda inside of here and this guy
is just simply going to print out quick
attack and then we're going to do this
for a couple other ones let's go and
copy this I guess it's not a million
years ago that we created our warriors
of fought to the death and we could also
do another one this would be a power
attack and then we could do
now the one in this situation we could
have a situation in which the warrior
missed the attack kind of neat we could
then come in and go attack and pass in
quick to get just the quick function to
execute but like I said we want to do
this randomly and we can also do this
randomly we need to import our random
module here and then we could go tack T
is going to be equal to and random here
I'm going to use random choice and what
random choice is going to do is pick a
random value from a list so I have to
come in here and I'm going to have to
call list on this dictionary to convert
it from a dictionary into a list that
will be able to search through and grab
an a random value from and then I can
call keys on this guy and keys is going
to return an iterable so we can convert
it into a list and now the cool thing we
can do is go attack and then call for
attack key and the attack key port is
going to be randomly generated and run a
function on that and if we run it you're
going to see power attack shows up right
there quick attack shows up right there
quick attack again missed attack and so
forth and so on that's a very easy way
to come in here and randomly generate a
whole bunch of random things and just
throw them in and it adds all kinds of
diverse options to your objects or
whatever you're working with so pretty
neat stuff and now it's time for the
next problem and remember this guy and
the problems that are coming up here
somebody asked me this question just the
other day and I wrote the code and I
thought boy that would be a fun little
problem to come in here and cover in my
tutorial series basically the question
was the student wanted an easy way to
generate a list of heads and tails and
then to quickly go in and calculate how
common the heads and tails were if from
the random value generator so what I
want you to do is create a random list
filled with characters either H or T and
those of course going to represent heads
and tails and you're going to output the
number of heads and the number of tails
and here is your example output after
it's
already so you can jump in there and try
to do the problem yourself otherwise I
will go in and do it for you so what do
we have to do here well we know we're
going to have to create the list that's
going to hold all the heads and tails
inside of it we also know then that
we're going to have to populate the list
with 100 H's and T's what else we're
going to have to do little hint here
you're going to use choice for that guy
right there and then finally you're
going to output the results so pretty
simple thing so let's go in here first
we'll create our list you can call this
whatever you want
I call this flip list then you need to
populate the list with 100 randomly
generated H's and T's so I'm going to
say for I in range 1 through 101
whatever you're trying to solve these
problems feel free to use Google to come
in there and try to help yourself along
just don't search for the specific
problem because it might exist somewhere
on the internet instead look for ways to
populate a list with a whole bunch of
random values okay so something to do
perfectly fine to go and use Google if
you get stuck so we'll go flip flip is
going to be equal to remember I said we
wanted you to come in there and use
random choice which I just talked about
earlier and then inside of here we can
throw an H and also we can throw a T
inside of there and then of course
you're going to have to output your
results which very simply we're just
going to say heads and then call flip
list
and we want to count the number of heads
so you're going to have to look back
through what we previously did with
lists and things like that in your
previous tutorials if you can't remember
this stuff and here we will do tails and
I don't expect you to remember all this
stuff either and if you do that and run
it well forgot to go and import my
random random and run it and you can see
right there first time through almost
came to 50% 52 to 48 run it again
42 look at that almost always comes in
very
very close to 5050 no matter how many
times you do it and of course you could
take this up as big as you wanted let's
do a thousand then we are on there we
are and there we are and there we are
so a pretty cool thing and pretty fun
little problem and if you didn't get it
that's okay we learn something new and
now let's jump over and cover something
really cool which is the map function
now map is going to allow us to execute
a function on each item in a list so
what we're going to do here is let's say
we generate a list and we'll just call
this one two ten is going to be equal to
and we're going to use range of course
throw one inside of there and eleven and
then we'll have to create the function
we are going to pass in to the map
function so I'm going to call this
double num just to make something pretty
simple there's double num and of course
it's going to return whatever the number
that was passed into it was times two
and not eight two times two there we go
so now we can come in and we could say
prints and we want to convert whatever
the results of the map were into a list
so we're going to throw a list inside of
there and then we're going to go map and
then inside a map we're going to pass in
a function and double nomes going to be
the function except get rid of that
stuff right there the parentheses and
then we'll pass in one to ten inside of
there as well and if we run it you're
going to see that it went in there and
took all of those values from 1 to 10
and multiply them times 2 so pretty cool
stuff let's do a couple more things here
with maps so you get a little bit more
used to it now you're also going to be
able to do the same thing with lambda
instead of passing a function in you can
put the function directly inside of
there
so let's go in here and we'll say print
you need to convert this into a list and
then we'll have map and then inside of
it we'll have lambda which is going to
receive X as a value and this time we'll
multiply everything times 3 I'm outside
of the lambda part right there that's
inside of the parentheses and we'll go 1
to 10 like that and run it and there you
can see we were able to multiply
everything in the list times 3 in that
situation
some pretty cool stuff and another thing
we can do is actually perform
calculations against multiple different
lists so let's go and generate a list
here I have to call list on this call
map on that and we'll come in and do
another lambda inside of here it's going
to receive X&amp;amp;Y
it's going to add those two values
together X plus y come outside of the
lambda section here and we will perform
calculations on two lists so you men and
we can separate our lists we want to
perform the calculations on just by
throwing a comma inside of there and a 3
and then we can come in and print a list
out on the screen and there you can see
what it did here was added one to one
got to 2 to 2 to get 4 and 3 to 3 to get
6 so cool stuff we can do with map now
let's jump over and check out filter now
filter is going to select items from a
list based off of a function so let's
say we want to print out the even values
from a list I will go in and create
print we need to generate a list in this
situation and here is the filter part
let's go and throw a lambda inside of
here and it is going to receive X as a
value and we want to find out if it is
going to be an even value or not so
we're going to go X and modulus 2 it
comes back at 0 for that we know that it
is a multiple of 2 and it's an even
value and then we can throw a range in
here let's say we want to go 110 that's
how we do it and run it and you can see
that it went in to that list and just
pulled out only the even values and with
that information while we go and create
another problem for our next problem I
want you to find multiples of 9 from a
random 100 value list that is going to
have and the items inside a list are
going to have values between 1 and 1000
so pause the video right there unless
you want a couple hints in regards to
how to do this and you can try to solve
that problem otherwise what are we going
to have to
doing this for we're going to have to
generate a random list and you can do
that with random int between 1 and 1000
and of course you're going to use range
to generate 100 values which is what I
want to generate and then after that
you're going to use modulus to find
multiples of 9 by passing that list into
your function alright so that should be
enough of a hint right there to be able
to create that otherwise I'm just going
to do the code right now so I'm going to
go and create a random list and we can
say list and I can call random followed
by random int and I want to generate
values between 1 and a thousand so I'm
going to put 1001 inside of there I'm
going to say for I in range of 100 so I
want to generate 100 random values
between 1 and 1000 that's what that guy
does right there and it's giving me an
error right here because I need to
import random ok so we got that all set
anything else I need to do now that's
good
alright so now I'm going to come in here
and I'm going to use filter so we're
going to generate a list and I'm going
to use filter and let's throw a lamb and
inside of there you don't have to throw
a lamb to inside there you could just
create an outside function sometimes
that's preferable because it's kind of
gets a little busy sometimes and we want
to find out if it's multiple of none and
throw 0 inside of there and then your
random list is what you're going to pass
inside of filter and we're going to
basically run this comparison right here
based off of all the different values
inside of there and if we run it you can
see that it jumped through there and
generated a whole bunch of values and
sometimes it gets more and sometimes
gets less so kind of neat little example
right there and now to finish off the
tutorial we're going to cover a reduce
now reduce is going to receive a list
and then return a single result not to
use resist we're going to have to import
it and it is in function tools and
specifically we want to import
reduce and let's say we want to add up
the values and list with reduce how
could we do that well we just call
reduce we don't need list here because
I'm not returning a list we're just
returning one value and we could throw a
lambda inside of there and x and y and
then add x and y together so that is our
function we're going to be using and
then we can throw a range inside of
there say we want the values from 1 to 5
throw a 6 inside of them and run it and
you can see we got the sum that we were
expecting which is 15 so there you go
guys that is a lot of information on
advanced things you can do with
functions of course go in there and run
your own examples and test a whole bunch
of things to really get this stuff
ingrained in your head and just like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
