cascading style sheets drop-down menu
tutorial here I'm going to teach you how
to make drop-down menus like you see
down here and this is a very crazy
presentation but it should be very easy
to understand I'm going to go down
through here first off and explain what
it takes to build this little guy and
it's not that complicated after you
watch this you should be able to easily
make these menus first I have the entire
menu system encapsulated with a div then
inside of the div I have a table and you
can see right here it is called it were
referred to in cascading style sheets as
table dot navbar then underneath of that
I have the individual columns that
contain the menu bar and it is referred
to as TV menu normal inside of that is a
table the drop down part right here is a
table that contains individual divs
whenever you want to make styling
changes to the whole entire table itself
you would refer to it as table menu and
then if you want to make changes to the
individual pieces you would make changes
with cascading style sheets to div diet
menu normal now the most important part
of this whole entire menu is the
cascading style sheets so that is what
I'm going to focus on to make sure you
completely understand how those operate
you can see here again remember the
whole entire thing is a table inside of
a div element so here I am changing all
the styling inside of the entire table
then Here I am changing all the styling
for the table that contains the divs in
the drop-down menu here I'm making
styling changes to the individual
elements the main part of the menu bar
here i'm showing you what will occur to
these individual elements whenever I put
my mouse over top of them and you can
see here what happens is the background
color changes to a light blue from a
dark blue this is the first part of the
cascading style sheet that you might
understand and if you don't understand
on cascading style sheets at all watch
my cascading style sheet tutorial here
I'm changing the position attribute to
static and making that the normal
attribute for menu normal however if
somebody puts their mouse over top of
this item right here what I'm going to
do is display it for them to be so that
they were able to see it and I do that
by changing the display to inline and
then I also change the positioning to
absolute positioning meaning that I want
to place it in a very specific position
here is all the styling changes i am
making for all of the different anchor
text and that is pretty much all that
goes into designing a cascading style
sheet menu in regards to just the
cascading style sheet part now i'm going
to go over to the HTML you're starting
off my HTML file exactly the way that I
normally do i'm using transitional
instead of strict and that doesn't make
sense take a look at the HTML tutorial
here i'm linking out to my cascading
style sheets which you just saw over
here here i'm linking to my javascript
code which you're going to see down here
and then I'm opening up everything
remember I refer to the fact that I have
the whole entire menu bar inside of a
dip well this is the divot that contains
the entire menu bar this drop-down menu
is created using a table name nap or and
it has a default width of 800 pixels
here we are creating the first column in
the table and assigning the CSS
attributes assigned to menu normal we
are setting the width of each column in
the menu bar 1260 pixels right here and
we will trigger JavaScript functions on
both the onmouseover and on Mouse out
events as you can see here and you can
see here this is the menu item name that
will appear at the top of the screen
inside of a box so see your menu one
here I have menu six that's where you
define what shows up there each drop
down menu is contained within a div
element nested within each top-level
column element there is a table nested
inside of each of the
divs and win a onmouseover event is
triggered the divs attribute display is
switched from none to in line as we saw
her here with the cascading style sheets
code and this allows the visitor to see
the div on the screen and this is really
all there is to creating each of these
menu items so there's not a whole lot
you need to know or remember you
basically everything starts and stops in
this area right here so basically I'm
defining the entire menu I only do this
once defining the total with the menu
bar I do this once and then here is from
this point right here the definition of
this column down to the closing of this
column right here this is the only code
that you will need to duplicate to make
additional menu items so let's say you
wanted to add a menu item 8 and 9 and 10
and so forth and so on well of course
you're going to have to change the width
on that to accompany the fact that the
entire menu is 800 pixels wide so if you
want everything to fit within at 800
pixels you're going to have to continue
to define smaller and smaller widths
each time you add an additional item to
the menu bar and remember I said that on
a mouse over event and a on Mouse out
event we're going to call javascript
well that javascript is right down here
and this is what it does when a on mouse
over event is triggered by a mouse
pointer going over top of a specific div
what we're doing here with the
javascript is saying okay what gives
specifically triggered the onmouseover
event and we want to assign the
identification name to this variable
right here and then we want to change
the class which we defined over here for
that specific give to a menu hover
version of the class instead of the
previous class definition that was menu
normal and then on a on Mouse out event
we are going to instead
collapse and change the styling of that
div back to menu normal and that is
basically all that goes into designing
an entire menu system using a little
tiny bit of JavaScript a little bit of
HTML and a good bit of cascading style
sheets you can see here this is a pretty
elaborate little menu system of course I
can make it more elaborate but I kept it
quite simple just so there would be easy
to understand how I put it together if
you have any questions leave them in the
