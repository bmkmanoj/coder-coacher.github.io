website looks like right now you're in
the right place i'm going to show you
how to fix this basically what happens
is once you get a half-decent rating
with your website tackers are going to
target you the good thing is it's pretty
easy to fix everything up because
they're normally not terribly malicious
and no I'm not daring anybody to hack my
website but it is definitely true that
if you have a website that's kind of
popular that you're gonna start getting
some hacker attacks here and there my
site personally has been a hacked twice
but you know it's easy effects i'm gonna
show you how okay go to your this is how
you fix it if you have a godaddy account
by the way and no this is not a godaddy
only issue i've had sites hacked all
over the place normally only wordpress
sites and i think it has something to do
with faulty plugins but i'm not certain
so you go to go daddy you go over here
under the my product section if you
don't see this click on my products
click on hosting then you find whatever
website you want to fix let's say it's
this one click on manage it go appear
your files click on that what we're
doing here is we're going to go in this
site hasn't been that packed or anything
but what we're going to do is I'm going
to show you exactly how to fix
everything what you need to do is go to
history click on that then what you need
to do what we're going to do is
automatically restore all the files to
what they were before they were
corrupted click on restore then what you
do is you would click on this check mark
right here which check marks everything
and then you click on OK and it will
restore every single file to its
previous safe good way of operating and
that's it everything's restored
everything's fixed but there's a couple
other things you want to do I'm going to
cancel in my case but if you did get a
site that was either hacked or corrupted
you would definitely want to do that now
go to settings manage ftp users you want
to click on that and you want to go in
here click on change password and change
your ftp password and make it a password
that's different than your wordpress
password or your website password in
general
and you should be okay on that end but
maybe your website being this guy right
here the dashboard is all corrupted a
lot of people don't know how to fix that
WordPress what you do is you go down the
tools over here click on that then you
click on upgrade and then if you click
on reinstall automatically it will
completely reinstall and fix everything
that was corrupted on the WordPress end
so that's how to fix either a hacked or
corrupted website on WordPress with
godaddy till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
