android studio tutorial today i'm going
to show you how to install and configure
android studio i'm also going to show
you how to set up github and how to push
to remote repositories I'm going to
cover exactly what is Gradle and the
Android studio interface so I have a lot
to do so let's get into it
okay so you may ask yourself eclipse is
working perfectly fine why should I use
Android studio well I'm going to go over
a couple of different reasons here real
quick
first off Gradle integration is going to
make it very easy for you to make
different versions of your same
application doesn't sound that important
but as you develop more and more Android
apps it most definitely will be more
important so for example let's say you
wanted to have a free app and a paid app
well Gradle is going to make that easy
for you live preview is going to show
you different layouts very easy
depending upon a resolution Android
version country and a whole bunch of
other different things Android studio
also has native support for Google cloud
yes I know
Eclipse has that through a plug-in but
this is going to be built in and it's
going to make it very easy for you to
run server-side code using Google App
Engine Android studio also includes
support for j-unit and this is going to
make it very easy for us to test our
applications it also is going to allow
you to import remote libraries from
maven central again all this stuff is
built in accuracy has going to be very
ramped up in comparison to eclipse code
completion wise and since everything is
built just to make Android apps Android
studio is going to have a much more
logical type of system because it only
needs to make Android apps and then
finally the drag-and-drop interface is
going to save you a ton of time in
regards to designing your app now of
course there's many other reasons but we
will cover those whenever I create my
new Android tutorial which is coming
very very soon
so now let's go and install it okay of
course the very first thing you need to
do is install java so in your terminal
in your command prompt whatever you have
just type in Java - version and
hopefully something comes up focus on
using either Java version 1.6 or Java
version 1.7 1.7 works perfectly fine on
everything I've tested so feel free to
use 1.7 if you do not have it
just go to this great big giant long URL
I will put it underneath the video and
you're going to just decide on what you
need based off of your operating system
okay now that you have that installed
I'm going to show you first how to
install everything on a Mac you're going
to go to developer.android.com forward
slash sdk installing studio HTML then
you're going to come down here and you
are going to click on download Android
studio for Mac whatever you do there
it's going to show you a dmg file you
are going to double click on it and then
you're going to grab this icon right
here and you're going to drop it in your
Applications folder that is basically it
now if you get an error that says that
the dmg is damaged or something that is
just your Macintosh being silly what we
are going to do to fix that is you're
going to come up here to your little
apple click on that and click on
preferences this guy right here is going
to open up you're then going to click on
this guy called security &amp;amp; privacy
whenever you do this is going to open up
and then you are going to make sure that
allow applications downloaded from
anywhere is checked that is probably
going to solve any problems definitely
going to solve the problem that I
mentioned and now you're pretty much
ready to go on a Mac so let's install it
on Windows of course we need to install
Java on Windows as well and then we're
going to go well let's come up here same
exact place developer.android.com sdk
installing studio HTML and if you were
on Windows it's automatically going to
show you the Windows version so click on
that and then the setup wizard is going
to open up for you and you were going to
click on next and then you can decide
who you want to be able to use it and
then click on next and then you can put
it wherever you'll really want to and
then you're going to click on next and
then you have to decide what you want
this to be called in your Start menu and
then hit install alright so now you're
going to need to add Java to your path
so what you're going to do is just click
on the little start thing down there and
type in advanced system and whenever you
do you're going to see view advanced
system settings pop up you're going to
click on that then you're going to click
on the Advanced tab right here and then
come down here and click on environment
variables then you're going to have to
you're out exactly where your version of
Java is installed and there is mine and
here it is and here this is and you're
going to want to copy this or memorize
it or do whatever you want because then
we are going to open up the environment
variables and come in here and type in
Java underscore home uppercase and then
you're going to type in the location for
your JDK hit OK and you're ready to go
you have Android studio installed now we
need to configure it first thing you're
going to do is click on configure in
this little opening screen then you're
going to click on project defaults then
you're going to click on project
structure and whenever you do this is
going to open up now what you need to do
is locate the SDK folder for Android
studio and paste it inside of there more
than likely almost 99% of the time it's
already going to be in there and then
you're going to put whatever the
directory for your Java development kit
inside of here and if they don't show up
you're going to have to click on this
guy and go locate them pretty easy to do
and you're going to click on OK because
everything is set up properly and we're
going to come back here to the opening
screen now there is a little bit of an
error with the Android studio in regards
to making sure this is compliant with
Java 1.6 just do this don't worry about
exactly why you're doing it it just
solves any errors so what we're going to
do is click on configure and then we're
going to click on preferences and then
we're going to come over here and click
on compiler and Java compiler and then
over inside of here we are going to
click on this guy right here and switch
it to 1.6 it normally says default
switch it to 1.6 and then of course come
down here and click on ok and here we
are again at the opening screen now what
I'm going to cover is updating the SDK
manager but first off we're going to
come in here and click on new project
and a little project window is going to
open I'm going to call this low world
and app and make sure you come in here
this is going to say example select this
instead and type in either a website
domain name that you own or your own
name no spaces of course and all
lowercase you're going to define exactly
where you want your project to be saved
you're going to decide on whatever the
minimum SDK is I pretty much just leave
everything is at
the way it is you're going to make sure
that this has 6.0 override and
interfaces and you can do whatever you
want you can play around with this stuff
and see what happens and then click on
create activity and then come down here
and click on next okay so again we're
just going to keep everything simple
we're going to click on blank activity
and next and then we're going to come in
here to main activity and click on
finish and then cradle is going to build
everything for you whenever that's all
done this is what you're going to see on
your screen one thing you may have
noticed here and in my Android tutorial
I'm going to cover exactly what all
these folders do everything is in your
app folder or more specifically in your
source folder in comparison to what we
normally have with Eclipse where things
are all over the place but the important
thing here is to get our SDK manager all
updated and to do that we're going to
come up here and we're going to click on
this little Android thing with the arrow
pointing down and whenever you do the
SDK manager is going to open up you're
going to click right here where it says
updates new and you're going to click on
install three packages and then this
guy's going to pop up you're going to
select this right here you're going to
click on accept and you're going to
click on accept license you're going to
hit install and everything is going to
install for you pretty easy now let's
set up a device for us to use whenever
you open this up you might have X's all
over the place no problem we're going to
fix that we're going to click on new and
create a brand new device and this is
going to represent an emulator inside of
Android studio so let's click on new and
this guy's going to pop up and this is
what I have used sort of you're going to
see in a second I change one little
thing here I'm going to type in Nexus 7
da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da I'll take a
picture of this and I will put it a link
to it on my description under the video
or of course you can just look at this
right here or pause the screen or do
whatever you want and that works out
good for me and I'm going to click on OK
and whenever you do that you're going to
see a check mark here that is green and
that means we are able to use this
device so that is super then once you
have this whole entire thing installed
let's click on start and let's start our
emulator and you can just click on
launch and then the emulator is going to
start for us and whenever it's done this
is what it's going to look like now
whenever you do that the first time
you're going to say to yourself geez
Amman this mu
is terribly slow well we're going to try
to fix that if your computer has an
Intel microprocessor you can do this if
not you're out of luck you of a very
slow emulator sorry so what we're going
to do is we're going to open up the
Android SDK manager this guy up here
little arrow pointing down and we're
going to come down here inside of
Android 4.4.2 and we are going to put a
check mark inside of here and click on
install one package this is going to pop
up you're going to select this hit
accept and then you're going to click on
install for some reason you cannot check
accept license if you can check it but
for some reason normally it doesn't
allow me to do that now I'm going to
install then what I'm going to do is
come up here to this guy right here has
a little Android device behind his head
and I'm going to come inside here I'm
going to check on this and I'm going to
click on edit then all this is going to
pop up I'm going to click up here where
it says Intel Atom make sure that is set
properly make sure I have a checkmark in
use house GPU I did not change anything
else and I'm going to click on OK now
you're going to see your emulator opens
up very very quickly so that's awesome
now of course most of the time you're
not going to want to use an emulator
you're going to want to use a regular
Android device because it's going to
update immediately now if you were using
Linux or using a Mac all of that stuff
is almost always going to work
immediately just plug a USB cable from
your computer into your device
everything works
if however you're on Windows you're
going to have to come to this location
and you're going to have to install some
drivers to get all of that stuff to work
ok now let's come in here and figure out
how to set up github what we're going to
do first off is we're going to come up
here or if you were in whatever you're
in just click on preferences and your
windows and whenever you do you're going
to see this guy right here and what
we're going to do of course you need a
github subscription or an account free
whatever I have a tutorial on github if
you don't know how to use it and what
you're going to do after you have set up
an account is type in github comm and
whatever your login is and whatever your
password is and then you are going to
come over here and click on test and you
should see connection successful and
you're going to click on OK and
and what we're going to do is we're
going to have a master password inside
of Android studio you're going to create
one of those and you're going to click
on set password and then to continue on
you're going to see all kinds of new
things inside a VCS and VCS stands for a
version control system like I said I
have a tutorial for github it's
underneath the video again and what
we're going to do is we're going to
click on enable version control
integration after you do that we're
going to come out here and we're going
to click on git and then we're going to
click on OK and you're going to see down
here create a git repository end-users
it's going to be whatever the location
for where you are saving your projects
is okay then we're going to go back up
into VCS and come down here and go to
import into version control and go share
a project on github click on that and
you're going to type in whatever you
want the repository name to be and add a
description of exactly what this project
is and click on share and then you're
going to have to define what files you
want to send to github you can just put
a check here and a check here and it is
going to send everything and then you
can type in a message defining exactly
what you're doing here initial commit is
perfectly fine for the first one and
then click on OK now if you have any
type of problems what you're going to
want to do is go to whatever directory
you have all your files in and you're
going to want to click on git remote - V
now if you see this without the username
you have for github that can cause some
problems so what we are going to do
instead is type in this long thing get
remote set URL origin and then type out
whatever this is don't type in new think
tank type in whatever your github user
ideas and all of this other stuff ok so
that is a way to solve any problems you
might come into now that we have all
that set up what we're going to do is
we're going to come over here in our
project window and we are going to
select
every single thing that we want to
upload to get up and then we're going to
come down here and go get and then we're
going to come over here and click on
commit files now if you don't want to
use github that's perfectly fine you can
skip this part but if you do and it's
pretty nice I think anyway then we're
going to come in here and whatever you
have changed is what's going to be
committed and you can see that's
selected right there you're going to
want to come in here and type in
whatever your email address is on github
and then come down here and click on
commit and push and then you can see I
went and put a whole bunch of things
inside of here you can come down here
and create a branch I just call this set
up and then you can click on push then
you're going to come over here and make
sure you have all your files selected
you're going to right click go to get go
to repository and push and then this
guy's going to pop up you're going to
click on that type in your branch and
click on push and if we go and check on
github you can see that it is all loaded
up there so that is how to set up github
alright so now you can see Gradle is
building my project here for me and I'm
just going to run through the Android
studio interface here real quickly and
here it is and here is a tip and I'm
just going to click on close and you can
see over here is the preview window and
it is going to make a little preview
version of the little application that I
have inside of here and all this stuff
is auto-generated and while it's doing
that I'm going to come over here this
guy right here are all of your project
files and if you do not see that there
what you're going to do is just go to
view tool windows and project and if you
don't see the little preview window
that's going to show my app you just go
down here and click on preview ok so
that's how you get those to open up and
there you can see just real simple just
as a little world all right so let's
come in here and let's just play around
with a couple different things just so
you can get acclimated to the interface
before we do that I'm going to go in
here and I'm going to increase the text
size on our screen so to do that we just
go Android studio and preferences then
we're going to come down here to where
it says IDE settings and click on the
editor we're actually going to open this
up and we're going to click on colors
and fonts right there and what we're
going to do is come down here and click
on font and you're going to see this
right here and it's going to be set as
default now if I want to create
new one I'm gonna click on save as right
like this and let's say I want to have
Monaco large click on ok now it's gonna
allow me to come in here and select
something different it's going to get
all my fonts for me you may or may not
have Monaco and I'm gonna come down here
and click on Monaco and I'm gonna switch
this to 34 see that's much bigger you're
gonna be able to see everything better
I'm gonna click on apply and ok alright
now you're gonna be able to see
everything much better on my screen now
let's say we want to add an image to our
little application now I'm going to make
this a little bit silly let's go and
open up the folder and wherever you have
your project safe I'm going to go to
documents and I have it in this folder
right here and you can see right there
there's a little world now you're going
to go into app and then we're going to
go into source and we go into main and
then we're going to go into resources
and drawable hdpi
this is where I'm going to save my
images and here is your icon by the way
if you want to change the icon for your
app you could just change it right there
I have some things laying around here
for my last tutorial let's say I want
this splatter background right here as
well as this picture of a zombie I'm
just going to drag both of them inside
of there and there they are and I'm
going to come in here and I'm going to
change them though to lowercase so I'm
going to change this to splatter and the
background I'm going to put a underscore
inside of here and background and zombie
I'm going to change this to lowercase as
well so there it is and there it is
perfect okay I can close this and then
close this - now you're going to see if
you come in here to drawable hdpi and
open this up you're going to see
splatter background and zombie or inside
of there that's good now if I want to
change the background for my little
application of making here what I did
was I clicked on design down here there
you are and I was inside of activity
main this is where we're going to make
our changes so let's say I wanted to put
a different background inside of here
like I said I'm going to get more into
this slider I'm going to click on the
relative layout the text view which is
the little world you see there is
contained inside of this relative layout
now I could come down here
say I want to change my background for
this I'm gonna click on background right
inside of there click on this right here
this windows going to open up and there
is tons of things that are built into
this I'm gonna scroll way down to the
bottom and I'm gonna get a splatter
background right there and you're gonna
see the splatter background is now
inside of the application now let's say
that I want to what I did in the
previous tutorial is I created a zombie
button so let's say I want to create a
zombie button inside of here I could
just come over here and go image button
drag this guy over here it's going to
try to position it relative layout isn't
perfect for that of course and let's say
that I want it right there just drug it
inside of there and I can come in here
and I can grab these little arms and
drop it right there
and then for this I can go and also set
a different background so just click on
background and click on this right here
and then I want to get my zombie click
on that there it is click on OK and
you're gonna see that it's automatically
going to fit the zombie inside of there
and this is going to be a button so I'm
just playing around if you're wondering
I'm not making a full scale application
here or anything now let's say you want
to have a Spanish version like I said
before strings.xml is going to have all
your default strings that are going to
show up in your application let's say
that if the person has a device that is
set for Spanish versus English you want
it to automatically go and convert it to
their language of choice you're going to
come in here to resource and right click
on this and go to new and go into
directory click on that and we are going
to type in values - es that's the
country code and we're going to hit on
OK
there's values right there then what we
can do is we can just copy strings.xml
so let's just select all of this copy
and we just call this file and we're
going to call this strings.xml exactly
the same as the other one hit OK and
then we can paste inside of here and
then we could change this to a Spanish
version so let's say we want to go hold
uh and we can go hola yes I know that
says hello earth and then for settings
we could go and fig array on there we go
and then save and now we're going to
have a Spanish version and if you don't
believe me we can click on activity main
come down here click on text and you can
see over
here now if we want to change to our
Spanish version I'm going to click over
here on the little globe and change it
to Spanish and you can see everything
automatically changed so that is what's
cool about this go to default and
everything's back to the way that it was
I'm just doing a real quick run-through
of a whole bunch of different things
whenever we start developing apps it's
going to be much easier to understand
everything and get going now let's say
that you want to open a display that's
going to show any errors that you might
have just go into view tool windows and
then you're going to click on Android
and whatever you do say everything's
opening here and down here you're going
to see what is called the logcat
which is going to display your device
log messages and any errors you might
have and that brings us to Gradle and
exactly what it is I'm just going to
give you a basic run-through of Gradle
and later on I'm going to go into
debugging and all that stuff
this tutorial is getting a little long
as it is so let's just go through Gradle
now unlike eclipse all of your project
files like I had said before are going
to be stored in your source directory
and this is specifically done to allow
Gradle to provide you with the option to
have like I said before numerous build
variants Gradle is also going to manage
your project dependencies whether they
are local or remote repositories if
Gradle is provided with signing settings
it can automatically sign your apk files
during the build process Gradle also can
be set up to automatically obfuscate
your classes during the build process
using ProGuard again going to get more
into that later Gradle also is going to
generate a test apk so you don't have to
create a completely separate test
project just to be able to test things
and where all of these different rules
are set is down here in build.gradle now
this is going to be very basic because
this is a hello world thing that doesn't
really do anything but I'm just going to
run through it very quickly this first
line up here is going to define that
this Android project is an application
you're then going to define some other
different parameters for your build
you're going to have your target version
of Android set right here you're going
to have the minimal
and your target version of Android set
right here this is just the current
version of your code starts off at 1.0
you're going to see right here that
ProGuard is currently not being used
again that obfuscates your code by
basically renaming classes and fields to
different obscure names so it's harder
to understand exactly what's going on
and then down here you can see in the
dependency area that we want to include
in the build any jar files that are in
the libs directory and here what this
guy is saying is that we need the
android support library version 19 you
might be asking yourself exactly what
our dependencies dependencies are
basically just what is needed to build
the application okay so there's a whole
bunch of tips on how to use Android
studio if you guys have any questions
please leave them in the questions
