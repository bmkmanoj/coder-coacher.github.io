going to be a really fun tutorial today
I'm going to show you how to solve a
bunch of really big problems with
WordPress really quick this is based off
of a real-world scenario that happened
just two days ago to me i'm going to
show you in this presentation how to
create a custom contact form with a
captcha and anti-spam blocking system
it's going to allow people to upload
files and a whole bunch more like i said
this started off as a real world
scenario in which somebody contacted me
by email and they said they needed a
customizable contact form it must allow
for file uploads it must block spammers
maybe use a captcha system which i'm
going to use plus i'm going to use the
built-in spam blocker called akismet
that's built into wordpress it must
provide for a free ebook whenever a
person enters their email and their name
a problem and it must be done in three
hours whenever this was presented to me
I said I can have this all done in 15
minutes person didn't believe me
actually got it done and less time in
that in this presentation you're going
to see how I did all of these things all
right so here I am in the WordPress
dashboard if you can't see what else is
on the screen here just click full
screen and up the resolution you'll be
able to see everything real good well
the first thing we got to do is we got
to go get ourselves some plugins so
we're going to go into plugins we're
going to say add new alright and inside
of this install plugins area inside of
wordpress you're going to type in
contact form 7 which is a really nice
contact form that is very very
customizable just going to come in here
get install now everything updates
you're going to hit activate plugin okay
so we got that all set up now we going
to go add new under plugins again and
we're going to install our captcha
systems so i'm going to type in really
simple captcha this is going to add
capture capabilities to this customized
guy so i'm going to come in here it
install now it ok again activate plugin
alright so we got the customized form
setups and now all we got to do is set
up for the e-book so hit add new going
to come in here and i'm going to type in
contact form 7 widget and search plugins
first one on a list and install now hit
ok just like you did before activate
plugin ok so now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to jump into pages i'm going
to create just a dummy sort of page for
the e-book i'm just going to call this
free ebook get your ebook and of course
you could provide a link to that ebook
on this page and i'm gonna hit publish
then what I got to do is I'm going to
hide
this guy so in my situation that's under
theme options yours might be under menus
you might actually have to come in here
click on menus under appearance and then
define your menu but that's not the way
my theme works in that situation you
would just not include the free ebook as
an option I'm using an elegance theme
theme here so I'm going to go into that
options panel and I'm going to go into
navigation and free ebook i'm just going
to X that out you have any questions or
comments leave them down below and I'll
answer anything else you might have and
then I'm a hit save so now that link
isn't going to show up now of course if
somebody knows where it is it they'll be
able to find it of course you could give
it either dummy text meeting a bunch of
characters and numbers and so forth or
you could perform a redirect if somebody
goes to this page prior to entering in
that ebook information you could
redirect them back to the homepage or
whatever but that's not really what this
tutorial is about if you want me to get
into that just leave a comment again
like I said for now i'm going to set up
the whole entire contact form so we're
just going to come down here on the left
side you're going to see contact and
click on that and this guy is going to
allow me to add all kinds of really cool
contact form information so the way it's
set up right now it's going to ask for
the name the email subject provide for a
message to be set up and a submit well
let's say for example the person wanted
to provide a drop-down box that gave the
options of either let's say it's a hotel
room either a single double or a deluxe
room so we're going to come in here and
it's real simple to set this up just go
in here where we want us to go click on
generate tag come down to drop down menu
and we could choose that this is a
required field if we'd want to allow
multiple selections do whatever but I'm
just going to leave everything as it is
and just say single double deluxe and
then all you got to do is copy this a
little code that's down here so just
copy and paste it in there now that's
going to provide for that now of course
you're going to have to come in here and
ask a question so let's say P paragraph
tag what type of room I'm just going to
make it real simple throw in a break
statement ok and then closed off
paragraph tag alright so that's real
simple and then actually going to copy
this let's say they also wanted to ask
using checkboxes if the person requires
a kitchen Jacuzzi or a Sun Deck all
right so let's just say what options for
a room and then this situation we're not
going to use this guy right here instead
we're going to provide checkboxes so no
problem let's
generate tag check boxes I'm down here
and we'll say kitchen Jacuzzi sundeck
alright so let's say we went to all that
and we could also choose put the label
first here in this situation so the
person can see everything that they're
doing I'm just going to copy that paste
that inside of there and we'll just keep
on moving on again I'm going to copy
this guy right here and let's say we
want to put a radio buttons in here so
the person can choose what's most
important to them and I'm going to take
out that space that's most important and
then it's going to be radio so they're
going to have to choose one or the other
so radio buttons put label first that's
just going to show the label there on
the screen and you can also define IDs
and classes and so forth if you wanted
to do CSS styling but I'm going to leave
that for some other tutorial and let's
save you price or location is most
important come down here again just copy
this guy and paste it in there you could
also put information in where the person
would have to check off on a checkbox
acceptance so we hung firstborn son okay
just to be goofy and they would have to
check off on this acceptance if they
would want this make this checkbox
checked by default yeah let's say yeah
copy paste that in a closed-off the
paragraph tag and let's say we also said
that we wanted to have a CAPTCHA system
set up inside of here well that's really
simple just click on generate tag again
captcha don't really need to do anything
here just gonna select this first part
right here paste that in select this
second part copy that put it on a new
line paste that in all right now you
have a captcha system set up look
remember they also wanted upload so send
your picture let's say that was
something so if we wanted to have them
upload a picture say for an ID or
something like that how's that set up
I'll just go generate tag we're going to
go file upload right here and we're
going to copy this and here I'm going to
show you a couple other little options
let's say you only wanted to accept
certain types of fields now it's real
easy file types colon and let's say
we're accept the PDF and you're going to
put a little or symbol which is over on
the right side of the keyboard right
above return i'm going to type in text
or jpg or gif or hang or doc docx blah
blah blah blah
ah and let's say we want to limit the
upload size 22 megabytes once a to type
in limit colon 2 megabytes alright so
now they're going to be allowed to
upload files as well that's going to be
really cool and then you have the submit
button and all this information is going
to actually be emailed to you so if you
want to actually get hold of this file
have it sent in an attachment no problem
just come down here this is all the
information it's going to be sent over
to you so under file attachments we're
just going to copy and paste that in
there and put these brackets around this
guy right like that and then you can see
here if we scroll up see where it says
your name right there well if we scroll
down you can see your name is right here
so if you want to copy any of the other
information that is sent in and I'm not
going to do all of these all you're
going to need to do is come in here
right after the Select part and go menu
25 coffee and then we're going to come
down here we're going to say type of
room colon paste like that and put this
guy inside of brackets so that's really
cool and there is all that information
and if you then wanted to have all of
this information on a page no problem so
you just copy this and hit save first of
course and let's just say we want to put
this on a page so hit add new now I'm
just going to put contacts and I'm going
to throw this under a parent so I
already have a contact us then I just
take the code paste it in there that we
grabbed from before it published and you
can see here's the customized contact
form everything is right here there's a
little capture system choose file this
is going to allow them to upload any
types of files and then this will allow
them to send it so there's that now if i
want to set up the ebook this is
actually going to be extremely easy just
going to jump backwards here come down
click on contact again here i'm going to
create a new form someone hit add new
and i'm just going to hit add new again
you can choose different languages
alright so just call this free ebook and
let's say the person is required to put
their name in and this little star here
is going to make it a required field and
their email and in this situation I
don't need a subject and I don't need a
message so I'm going to get rid of both
of those who ever i would like to block
spam and here i'm going to show you how
to also block it using the kismet which
is the spam blocker for wordpress so
you're just going to come in here type
in akismet and ango author and that's
going to block
potential spammers that way kismet colon
and here you're going to type in author
email right so that's how hard it is to
set up the kismet spam blocking and it's
also say we want to also do the CAPTCHA
system so CAPTCHA do exactly the same
thing we did before paste copy paste now
let's say we want to do a redirect to
the ebook page based off of that well
that's pretty easy to do as well what
we're going to do is we're going to
scroll boy down here to additional
settings so we're going to say show
we're going to say on sent okay call one
location is equal to HTTP colon and then
here you would type in whatever your web
address is free ebook single quote
semicolon double quote everything is set
up right like that and we'll just hit
save and here we got our free contact
form so we're going to copy that and
then we're going to jump over into
widgets under appearance and we're going
to come over here in the sidebar and put
our contact form in over there so drag
it over here type in free ebook whatever
you want to do so i'm heading you chase
background labels all kinds other
different things and under this we're
going to put in what we just created in
the previous thing we're going to say
save okay so here's the free ebook in
the sidebar widget so i'm going to type
in my name and an email address and
little captcha system and it said and it
was sent through perfectly and it
automatically forwarded me over here to
get my free ebook so there's a bunch of
different ways to do really cool things
with wordpress really really quick leave
any questions or comments below
