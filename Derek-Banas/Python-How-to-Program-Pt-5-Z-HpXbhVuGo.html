5 of my Python how to program tutorial
today we're going to cover how to work
with files both inputting data from them
and exporting data to them and a whole
bunch of other things this is the file
that I'm going to be pulling information
from and here I'm going to show you how
to do it very first thing I'm going to
do is show you how to pull information
from a file and print it to screen just
creating a variable calling the open
function typing in the name of the file
that I need to get then I'm going to
create a for loop that's going to pull
each individual line in from said file
one at a time again here's the variable
referencing the file and here is the
temporary holding cell it's going to
hold one line at a time as we cycle or
iterate through the for loop then I'm
going to print said line out to the
screen I'm going to enter an attribute
for n so everything comes out the way
that I want and then I'm going to close
the file and if I jump up here boom
everything's right there and here is the
original text file you're thinking to
yourself well that wasn't very
impressive okay so now what I'll do is
I'll pull in all the information but
this time what I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to print out the best
student and that students name and to do
this I'm still going to use some of the
same code create a variable name the
best grade give it the value of 0 going
to be pulling information from the same
place and I don't need that already
explain what the other things do and I'm
going to pull using the function split
I'm going to pull each individual line
from this file and then I'm going to
split these two guys up and stick one of
those values into name being Susy and
then grade that's all this guy does and
if this doesn't make sense to you it's
because you didn't watch the other
tutorials so go watch those then
remember I need to turn this string
grade into a integer to be able to work
with it and I'm going to see if the
grade for that student is better than my
best current best grade that I have set
if it is I am going to reassign the new
grade to it and then best student as
well to the name attribute remember
whitespace very important in Python and
then I'm going to print out to the
screen with the newline character first
best grade followed by best grade and
then I'm going to print out to the
screen best student followed by the
variable best student and there's a typo
leave that in there so that you know I'm
not perfect and then we have have closed
again so if I run an oink goes through
all the different students figures out
that the best grade out of all of them
was 99 and the person I caught that was
John so there's another thing you can do
now I'm going to do the most advanced
thing I'm going to get student data I'm
going to sort it I'm going to eliminate
any garbage that's brought over into it
and then I'm going to save that data to
another file so I'm going to create a
dictionary here I use dictionaries a lot
in Python and as you become more
advanced with Python you're you're going
to do the same thing pulling that text
and again just like before doing
anything fancy here I'm going to do the
same thing with the lines of information
should lift all that other information
in there so I have typed again that's
what I'm doing just doing the same thing
here for part of this and this is where
it gets a little fancy remember I
created a dictionary to hold all this
information the reason why is I wanted
to use name value pairs so what I'm
doing with this guy right here is grade
is going to represent the the key or the
name and name is going to represent the
value stored in said dictionary up here
okay so and then after I'm done with
that I'm going to close it then I'm just
going to create an empty string and here
I'm going to sort the dictionary with
the sorted function
and then I want them in reverse order
otherwise they would list from worse
grade to best so that's why I'm doing
reverse and then print best student
based off of the key value pair that is
in it right there and then at the end of
that I'm going to put in a string and
that string is going to be followed by
their actual grade if you don't quite
get this just tell me in the comment
section below and I'll explain it
further or I might even do it on the
video then I'm going to add this line
this string of text right here to the
best student string which is empty at
the very very beginning and I'm using
shorthand with the plus equals there's
that student string just so everything
shows up a little bit nicer I think I'm
going to put a new line in here and then
all I need to do is come down here and
type BIST I'm creating a new string and
I want this file to make sense put my
new line in there put two new lines just
to keep it nice and neat and then I'm
going to put it at the end of that the
string that I created up here and stored
all of the information in and now to the
output going to just create a file
called out to file again this is just a
variable name you can make this any name
that you could possibly want it to be
I'm going to open the file that I want
to write to mode here is what I'm
telling it is I want to write to this
file if you want to read from that file
you would put an R there and if you
would want to have the ability to read
or write you'd put our plus as you see
on the screen but I want to write to it
and obviously I could do readwrite but
doesn't matter going to encode this you
don't have to really worry about what
that means it just means that every file
format has different encoding but it
and then this to file dot right and then
what am I going to write I'm going to
write this string that I spent all that
time creating and just to leave a
message for myself that this is done and
I forgot one of the other modes if you
want to append at the end of the file
you would put an A in there so that
would mean if you didn't want to
overwrite so with W it's actually going
to overwrite everything that's in that
file so let me see if I typed everything
in perfectly finished update and student
rank and yeah it worked so this is a
really quick and easy ways to put
information sort information get
information from files and put
information back into files and how to
work with another way to work with
dictionaries and another way to work
with strings and a whole bunch of other
things if you have any questions leave
them in a comment section below and in
the next video I will cover
object-oriented programming in Python
