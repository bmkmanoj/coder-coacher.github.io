tutorial on how to crochet a hat in this
tutorial we will make a beanie cap and
I'll provide a pattern so you'll be able
to make them for men women as well as
teenagers I'm as well we're going to
cover how to create circles of course
and I have a lot to do so let's get into
it
now if you haven't watched my previous
tutorial on learn to crochet I provide a
link in the video as well as the
description you should probably take a
look at that what I'm doing right now is
I am making a slipknot that I will place
my hook inside of and there it is and
you can also see here I'm using a 5.5
millimeter hook as well as 5.5
millimeter
yarn and the very first thing I'm going
to do here is I am going to create a
chain and that is going to be a three
chain and I just need to go and get my
yarn and hook it in there like that and
then slip it down through and that makes
the first chain and then I'm gonna go
and get another one here and that makes
the second and then one more time and
that makes my third chain and you're
gonna see here as I show that you can
see the three chains that are inside of
our yarn now what we're gonna do is at
the very bottom of that chain we are
going to make a double crochet stitch
and you can see exactly how we were able
to do that I'm going to first wrap the
yarn around it poke that through and
then I'm gonna reach up and get myself
some more yarn on the hook and I'm going
to pull that through and it's a little
bit complicated whenever you very first
start off but with a little practice
you'll get used to it and you'll have
three little bundles of yarn there and
you're gonna pull it through the first
two and then you're going to go and get
some more yarn and pull it through all
of them and I'm gonna go ahead and show
you how to do that once again once again
you're gonna want to wrap at around and
then go through the bottom of your chain
just like you can see right there and
and we're going to go in there and hook
our yarn and pull that through once and
that's going to give you three little
loops on there and then you're gonna go
and pull through the first two of them
and then you're going to go and pull
through all of them and that's gonna
give you another double crochet now
you're gonna continue doing this until
you have a total of ten double crochet
stitches and you can see right here I'm
going and putting in the last one so
there we go with that and then I'm gonna
pull it through two and pull it through
the last one and then I'm going to
create a slip stitch and to do that I'm
gonna go poke through the first double
crochet stitch that I have there and
then pull that through and then that'll
be all be set up and then I want to
create two more chains so just like I
created chains before once again I'm
going to create two more right here like
that and now for the next round what
we're gonna do is create two double
crochet stitches inside of each of the
stitches and then once again at the very
end of it will create another slip
stitch that we're gonna hook into the
very first of the double crochet
stitches that we created until we create
a circle so we're just doing the same
thing over and over again and that's
basically what you do to create a hat
except you're gonna change your stitches
here and there so you're going to
continue putting two double crochet
stitches underneath each one of your
loops and here I am completing
everything so I'm just going to go
through here and make two more double
crochet stitches and there we go and
then what I'm going to do is I'm need to
put in once again two chain stitches
like I have done with all of the other
rounds and there's the one and here is
the second one and for the next round
what I'm going to do is put two double
crochet
shake stitches in the first stitch and
then I'm gonna put one double crochet
stitch inside of the next one and then
in the next one after that I'm gonna put
two double crochet and then one and I'm
gonna continue doing that the whole way
around until I have another completed
circle and you can see here I went and
put two in the first one and now I'm
going to put another double crochet
stitch into an individual one so just
two and one two and one until you are
completely finished with that round
pretty easy stuff to remember and then
at the very end of this we're going to
put in a slip stitch just like we did
previously and then we're gonna put in
two chains once again and then we're
going to put two double crochet stitches
in the very first stitch and then we're
going to put one double crochet stitch
in the next stitch after that and
another inside of the next stitch and
then the one following is going to once
again receive two double crochet
stitches and then you're going to do a
slip stitch and then you're gonna do
another chain over and over and over and
you can see right here the entire
pattern for the completed hat so you can
see that we chained three and then we
put in ten double crochet stitches in
the third chain then we have a slip
stitch that we are going to put through
the first double crochet to join to make
the very first circle and then once
again you see to chain then you're gonna
do two double crochet in each one of
your stitches then you're going to have
a slip stitch and to the first double
crochet to join and if you understand
those couple things you can understand
the rest of the pattern you can pause
your screen here to get the first five
rounds that we're gonna create and then
this is the rest of the pattern to
complete the entire beanie hat and I'm
gonna go here real quickly and show you
how to slip stitch the whole way around
to finish the Hat and then I'll show you
the final hat and you can see right here
how to slip stitch all you're gonna do
is slide under
of your stitch and then you're gonna
pull the yarn completely the whole way
through and then you're gonna go
underneath a stitch once again and grab
the yarn and pull it all the way through
and that is a slip stitch and then after
you get your final rode done what you're
gonna do is you're gonna tie it in a
knot and you're gonna get yourself a
needle and you're gonna get the final
length of string that you have and weave
it through your hat and try to hide the
string and now you have a completed
crocheted hat and here is the completed
hat and it's slouchy just like I wanted
it to be and really really happy with
the final results so hopefully you guys
enjoyed that and like always please
