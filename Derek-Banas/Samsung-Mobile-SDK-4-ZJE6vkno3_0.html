four of my samsung mobile sdk tutorial
today we're going to focus in on the
samsung s look tools that are provided
to us as well as specifically writing
buddy and if you didn't watch part 3 you
absolutely have to watch it because I'm
just continuing with the code that was
written in that part of the tutorial and
I provide a link to it in the upper
right hand corner and of course these
tutorials are brought to you because of
the samsung smart app challenge and i
provide a ton of information in regards
to how you can win as well as from me a
samsung galaxy note 3 in the description
under this video so let's get into
exactly what we're going to do in this
tutorial basically last time we created
this list activity which just had a
whole bunch of list items inside of it
then what we did was set it up so that
if writing buddy was clicked on that
this list activity was going to open up
what we're going to do this time is
create exactly what you see here on the
screen which is going to provide us with
the capability to click on this little
pen icon over here and then write out
our answer and then have it
automatically translated into normal
text so everything you see right here is
basically what we're going to create as
well as the capability to draw a happy
potato on your screen so I've allowed to
do so let's start writing that code okay
so just so you remember last time we
created writing buddy activity Java and
this time we're going to create this
class right here writing buddy edit text
activity now the very first thing I'm
going to want to do here is think about
our layout which is basically nothing
right now as you can see right there
however this is what we're going to want
to put on our screen so we're going to
have two buttons that are laid out on
the horizon so we're going to want to
create a linear layout here and put
those two buttons inside of it then
we're going to have an editable text
area which you can see right here we
don't need to have those in the linear
layout because everything already is in
a linear layout which is already set to
vertical so the editable text area is
going to go right there an output image
right here is just going to be a text
view and then finally we're going to
have an image view that we're going to
actually write on so let's jump back
into the layout tools and create this
okay so here we are jump into the
graphical layout and I'm going to click
on layouts and then I'm going to
gone linear layout horizontal drag that
in there and just drop it anywhere then
inside of this I'm going to need two
buttons so form widgets up here grab a
button and drag it right there grab
another button and drag it right there
and there we are now I'm going to jump
down here and actually look at the xml
code see what I'm going to need to
change basically match parent is fine
Rep content is fine the orientation on
this however is going to be horizontal
I'm just going to copy this paste that
in there and change this to horizontal
there we go and we have our two buttons
i'm going to call this button enable
because this is going to be actually the
button being enabled meaning that we
want to use the writing buddy enable and
that's just an ID it doesn't the name
doesn't mean anything other than what I
just said and then here for text I'm
going to put disabled and that's what's
going to show up there now I should go
and actually put disabled inside of
strings.xml but for now I'm not going to
do that for our next button this is
going to deal with whether we're going
to allow the person to just draw images
or whether we're going to allow them to
write out text and then we're
automatically going to translate it I'm
going to have the image drawing part
disabled so i'm going to put button
enable thinking that most of the time
when we click in an editable text area
we're not going to want to draw a
picture we're going to instead want to
actually write text wrap contents fine
rep contents fine and inside of here for
the text part i'm going to have enable
image listener now the last part of the
tutorial actually was pretty general
android wise this parts going to be more
in regards to samsung specific tools
that we have available i'm going to jump
back out into the graphical layout you
can see that everything pretty much
looks exactly like what we want to
create then we're going to need an
editable text area i'm going to click on
text fields and just grab this guy right
here and slap that in there and then i'm
going to need a text view so so click on
form widgets grab a textview drag it
throw it in there and then for the
imageview I'm just actually just going
to write that code directly inside of
the xml down inside of here okay so
let's come in here and see what we got
everything looks
fine so far then we have our editable
text area I'm going to have this be edit
input I'm going to have this be wrapped
content because we want it to take up
all that area and down here for a hint
i'm going to type in please right here
by S Pen get rid of requests focus and
then for the text view this really
doesn't matter at all so I'm just going
to get rid of the ID because i'm not
going to need to do anything with the
textview actually for this guy now that
I'm thinking about it I want this to be
parents that works and I'm going to do
exactly the same thing here for this guy
parent so that it fills up that whole
area and then down here for the text i'm
going to put output image and then for
our image view create that i'm going to
call android give it an ID of image
output you're going to see in a minute
what we're going to do with that and
then the width and the height and
actually have both of those be wrap and
there's wrap content and there's wrap
content and there we go and if we look
at the graphical layout you can see that
it pretty much looks exactly the way
that we wanted it to look now we're
going to jump over into writing buddy
edit text activity and i'm going to walk
your line by line through exactly what
we're going to do here now the very
first thing going to need to do is
create an s look writing buddy object
and basically what this is going to do
is just provide the methods that are
going to allow the user to click in the
editable text area and then write and
have the text automatically translated
or draw an image and basically it's
going to assume that everything is
either text or numbers so if you do go
in there and start drawing a picture
it's going to try to turn it into a
number or a letter or a word then we're
going to set the use of the writing
buddy by default to be true because
remember we want it to be used by
default and then we're going to set the
ability to draw an image by default to
false and that's what those guys are
going to do for us then down inside of
on create this is where all the magic is
going to happen we need to set content
view to be equal to a hard layout and
activity writing buddy edit tack
where's that at there it is that is the
layout that we just created previously
then we need to come in here and
initialize the editable text and the
image view so we're just going to go
edit text edit input convert it to
editable text because it's a view by
default whenever we call find view by ID
call r dot ID dot and it's going to be
where is it edit input right there guy
that we just created then we're also up
inside of here outside of on create
forgot to do this we're going to want to
have an image view that's going to load
our image so private and this is an
imageview call this M output image view
and then we're going to initialize this
guy down below inside of all and create
initialize it by just going like this
saying hey this is an imageview find
view by ID again but in this situation
is going to be image output like we had
before and there we go then we just need
to create an instance of the writing
buddy for the supplied editable text
area so we're going to go em right thing
buddy this is equal to New call s look
writing buddy and we need to pass it the
editable text area and there that is and
we need to initialize the button that's
going to enable the writing buddy and
add a click listener to it and we're
going to do that by calling find view by
ID again except in this situation we're
going to call button enabled and then
get an able button and call set on click
listener new view on click listener and
if we zoom in on this it's going to say
hey you need to add an unimplemented
method okay go do that for me and there
it is then basically what we're going to
do with this might as well put the
semicolon in there basically what we're
going to do with this guy is we're going
to set these buttons so that if they are
clicked the opposite state is going to
be used so we're going to say if is
enabled which means that that's true
then we're going to call button and the
view specific to that button and we're
going to call set text to enable then
we're going to say am
is enabled which is a reference to this
guy right here and we're going to change
its state to false in this situation
we're going to say else and basically we
do the opposite so we can just copy this
paste that in there change this to
disable set this to true and there we go
then after we figure out what is the
state in regards to are we using the
writing buddy or not writing buddy is
going to be told if it's enabled or not
and if it is it's going to display that
little pen icon we saw before and if not
it won't show it m is enabled so
whatever the value is for that button
that's going to set whether the writing
buddy shows or not and that's really
kind of cool because that's all you need
to worry about then we need to handle
the image listener so basically we're
going to create our button and it's
going to be mode button equal to convert
this to button type and then find view
by ID and this is going to be button
enable image and this is going to handle
whether we're going to be able to draw
on the screen or not and when you go
mode button set on click listener new
call the view on click listener put
semicolon inside of there come in here
say hey I need to implement my own
implemented methods and there it is I
mean basically we're going to do the
same type of thing we did up here but
I'm just going to type it out because it
is a little bit different so I'm going
to say if M enable image and that's
given us an error because I think I used
a different name let's just use this one
instead it's come up here outside of our
class yes here I just have em enabled
what I'm going to do is change this to M
enabled image there you go because this
is a reference to whether we have the
writing buddy itself enabled and this is
a reference to whether we have the image
view enabled okay sorry about that roll
back down here here in medieval image if
that was true we're going to change it
to false then we're going to call the
writing buddy and disable the ability to
draw a picture by calling set image
writing listener and passing it the
value of null and then we're just going
to set the new value for our button by
just getting the view that was passed in
here the view
was clicked that's what that is in
reference to and then calling set text
enable image listener now we're going
down here and say LS and we're going to
do the opposite we're going to get the
enabled image state and change it to
true and then if drawing inside of this
image is going to be possible we're
going to call the writing buddy again
see the writing buddies going to do a
lot of work for us we're going to say
set image writing listener new and then
down here we're going to call s look
writing buddy image writing listener put
a semicolon inside of that and we're
gonna have to add an unimplemented
method again this one's going to be on
image received and this time we're going
to go output and we're going to set our
background image view set background and
call new bitmap drawable and define
resource we want to draw with so get
resources and then I'm just going to go
r0 and that's it basically the writing
buddies going to do all the rest of the
work for us the only thing will be
required to do is set the new value for
a button and again we're going to do
that in exactly the same way I call in
the view that was clicked on and setting
the text for disabled image listener and
i see i have a little bug here I just
come up here and change that to am
writing buddy if we have that all set up
whenever edit text is clicked on here is
going to be the layout that opens up
here's going to be disabled when we
click on it it's going to change to
enable but our little icon which is
going to make our writing body work
isn't going to show up anymore click it
again it's going to show up disabled
whenever it is enabled now whenever we
click on the pen we're going to be able
to rewrite inside of here with the s pen
it's automatically going to convert the
text or the numbers if we click on
enable image listener it's going to pop
up this little dialog box it's going to
say hey we're going to delete everything
and put you into drawing mode and then
we're basically going to be able to draw
inside of this image view and that's how
everything is going to work and all
these race tools the pen tool the text
tool all these other different things
are going to be built directly inside of
writing buddy so you basically have your
hands clean you don't have to think
about anything so it's pretty cool
