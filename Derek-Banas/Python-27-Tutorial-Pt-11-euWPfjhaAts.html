my programming with python 2.5 through
2.7 tutorial in this tutorial and in the
next I'm going to cover database
development with Python however this is
not quite a database what I'm gonna show
you here today is how to use a module
called shelves and it's sort of like a
somewhere between a knockoff database
slash dictionary that you will be able
to edit and in the next tutorial I'm
going to show you how to use SQL Lite 3
actually but let's start off simple and
I'm gonna go over the shelve module well
since I have this last line in here
which is going to call my main function
I better define my main function and I
did that right there and then we'll put
pass in here so it doesn't ignore the
fact that main is empty and I'm going to
create here a function called add
customer and it is going to be passed
what we are going to call a database
your going to see here in a minute what
it does here I'm going to create a empty
dictionary named customer and then what
I'm going to allow the user of this
program to do is add a new customer to
the database along with a bunch of
information on said customer and each
customer is going to have their own
unique identification number that's how
I'm going to be able to look them off
here I'm going to allow the user to
enter that unique customer number and
then I'm gonna populate the customer
dictionary if you didn't see any of the
previous tutorials you should definitely
check those out otherwise you will be
lost as you're probably used to me
saying there are tons of interesting
modules inside of Python one of the
coolest functions is the regular
expressions tool and I did a tutorial on
regular expressions with Python using
Python 3 but it totally works for python
2.5 and 2.7 as well and I'll put a link
to that here on the screen as well if
you want to check that out because
regular expressions are really cool and
over the next couple tutorials I'm gonna
do a that I of module talk first I'm
gonna talk about some database modules
or libraries whatever you want to call
them and then I'm gonna move on to some
more fun sort of modules that let you do
cool things like create automated
websites and things like that so I'm
just putting these keys into this
dictionary name
customer that I created up here and I'm
gonna change the requests I make here on
the screen so everything makes sense and
if you don't live in the United States I
am sorry
hopefully this still makes sense I think
it does okay so what i'm doing here is
assigning this customer dictionary back
over here to the database using the
unique customer number that they entered
so i'm gonna be able to look up all
these customers based off of their
customer number and then i'm gonna
return back down here to main and down
here inside of main i'm gonna actually
show you shell and how it works and how
to set it up what it's actually gonna do
is store all this information in a file
shell really shouldn't be looked at as
an alternative to a real database
application but instead it should be
looked more as a different way to work
with files and store information and
here we're going to call the shell open
method and customers thought that
actually doesn't need to be open or even
exists at this point in time if it
doesn't exist it's gonna create a new
version of it for you and if it does
exist it's just gonna pend all the
additional information that you put into
it into it and basically this can be
whatever you want it to be and you want
to make sure that right back here is set
to true and then we are gonna call add
customer the method that we just created
above and pass it our new database and
i'm just going to give this a default
value of 1 create a while loop and this
while loop is going to run as long as
the user this program does not enter the
value of 0 in here i'm gonna operate
this as a way to look up customers in
the database after an additional
customer is added i know i could do this
in better ways but I'm using this mainly
for just as a pure example this actually
should all be put into a class I'm gonna
put this if statement in here just to
guarantee that I get kicked out of the
while loop all together and then I'm
gonna put some exception handling in
here what you should know about because
I already covered exception handling and
the reason I'm putting this in here is
to protect myself from a user looking
for a customer number that does not
exist and here I'm just going to print
out the key valued pairs for our
database that we created and this key
error is what I'm protecting against see
if they type in a number that is
not defined up here where it says
customer number because everything is
going to be stored based off of unique
customer numbers it'll kick back a Kier
because you're going to be requesting a
tea that doesn't exist so that's why I'm
putting the exception in specific for
the key error I'm gonna print out the
screen customer doesn't exist and type
outbreak to cancel out of this
altogether and after I print out each
customer that is requested I'm gonna put
in a new line and then this is extremely
important you want to make sure a
hundred percent that you always close
the database otherwise it might still
exist in memory now if we run this guy
you can see over here add new customer
to the database it actually doesn't even
matter if it's unique like if there's
already a customer that exists in there
with the number one for example it's
just gonna overwrite it so let's just
put in one and I can put in a name I'm
just gonna put my name and enter all my
information this isn't my real address
by the way okay so it took all that
information and if I come in here and
hit one you can see that it actually
printed everything out here on the
screen you also see kind of the reason
why this isn't the perfect sort of tool
to use especially if you want to list
out all the data because it's sort of
randomizes the way that it prints it out
but it does store all the information
and here's some additional people that I
put in here previously and you can see
all the information is right here
available so it's sort of like a knock
off sort of database tool that you can
use and it's totally built shell that's
built into Python 22.5 through 2.7 as
well as 0.3 so it's kind of just a neat
way to store information real quickly
and in the next tutorial I'm going to
show you like I said before SQL Lite
which is actually used by Google and is
often used to a certain extent with
iPhone applications and Android
applications and a whole bunch of other
tools so if you have any questions or
comments leave them in the comment
section below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
