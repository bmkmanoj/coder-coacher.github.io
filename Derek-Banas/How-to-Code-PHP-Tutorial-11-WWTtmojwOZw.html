11 of my how to code PHP tutorial today
I'm going to show you how to create
automatically updating multiple
drop-down boxes go completely through
everything that goes into it it sounds
kind of confusing but it's really not
and it's actually quite useful here I'll
show you the code behind a semi
complicated task in which we feed new
options into a drop-down box based off
the selection made in another drop-down
box you can see what I'm talking about
in the sample images to your right first
I'll use some JavaScript scripts to
reload the form whenever the visitor
changes the values of the drop-down box
the function reload and reload three are
called when the user changes the value
of the drop-down in the form below these
functions send the visitor to the
index.php page with the new values for
the drop-down box is attached to the URL
if this doesn't make sense you should
definitely look into my JavaScript
scripting tutorial here's the PHP code
that will pull new drop-down box
information from the database here I'm
creating the options for the first
drop-down box by making a query if you
check out my SQL statements tutorial
this should all make perfect sense
that's all the coding you have to
perform to populate the first drop-down
now I'll make the second drop-down based
off the option chosen in the first drop
down here we're checking that a value it
has been set for the first drop-down box
we create an SQL query that returns the
manufacturer ID and manufacturer name
where the ID numbers match and the part
ID is equal to the value the visitor
chose in the first drop-down we then
alphabetically order these results if no
result is set for the first drop-down
box we populate the second drop-down
with every manufacturer in the database
this is all the code needed for the
second drop-down box here we perform
very similar actions with the third
drop-down box we're performing a query
that will return the model numbers when
the manufacturer ID matches whatever
value is in the variable named cat3 and
the model numbers match the value of
variable named cat now we need some PHP
code to generate the form that contains
all of our drop down this code creates a
drop down that will reload the page each
time a drop down has changed this is
done with some help from the on change
event handler the while loop will loop
through all the query data that is
returned with some help from the
you'll fetch array function the MySQL
fetch array function fetches a row of
data at a time from the array created
from the query above the rest of the
code prints out the rest of the HTML
code for the drop-down box and the rest
of the code creates the next two
drop-down boxes and is nearly identical
to the above and here you see that all
of the code that would go into creating
the rest of the form now I'd like to
talk for a second about future PHP
scripts PHP is a very powerful language
and I wouldn't have taken so much time
to record 11 tutorials if I didn't think
so
I plan on showing you additional PHP
tutorials in the future but I just like
to ask is there anything you
specifically would love for me to cover
or if you have any questions please put
them in the comments below just so you
know I plan on creating additional
tutorials on web spiders and currently
I'm working on an automated website news
aggregator you don't know what that is
leave a comment below the next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
