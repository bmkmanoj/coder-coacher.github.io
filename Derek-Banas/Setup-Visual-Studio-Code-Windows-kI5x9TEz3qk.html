you how to set up C C++ and Arduino
development with Visual Studio code on
Mac OS and in this tutorial I'm going to
show you how to do exactly the same
thing with Windows all of the links and
code I reference in this video are
available in the description underneath
this video and if you're a Mac OS user I
also provide a link to that part of the
tutorial so you can set up visual studio
code on Mac OS and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay so the very first
thing you need to do is download
minimalist canoe this is going to be
used so we can get C++ and you're gonna
be able to get that at sourceforge.net
projects mi ngw and of course you're
gonna click on download alright and then
you're just gonna click on install and
just basic stuff don't touch anything
make sure everything is exactly the same
don't change anything because that can
cause problems so continue and then
whenever that's done installing you're
then gonna open up this guy and you're
just going to make sure you have
checkmarks in all these whenever you
check one of them a whole bunch of the
other ones are going to be checked so if
you check Ming W developer tools that's
gonna check a whole bunch of these guys
here on our screen you're also gonna
want to make sure that you check Ming W
30 to base and then of course scroll
down through your list and you're also
because this is a C++ tutorial make sure
you check Ming W 32 G a G C c/g plus
plus and all of these other ones Ming W
32 gdb like I said a whole bunch of them
are gonna be checked for you then after
you do that just come up here to
installation and apply changes and click
on that and then once again you're gonna
click on apply and that of course is
going to install everything you need on
your computer and then this is gonna
come up and you're gonna click on close
now what we need to do is go to visual
studio comm and code visual studio comm
to be specific and of course you're
gonna be downloading for Windows so just
click on this this guy's gonna pop up at
the bottom of your screen click on run
and then the setup wizard is gonna open
up and you're just gonna click on next
and then click that you want to accept
the agreements and then click on next
and don't change anything let everything
install exactly where it says it once to
click on next once again that's fine
click on next and then add to path this
will save you a little bit of time so
keep that checked and
of course to make decisions on whatever
you want to do and then click on next
and then finally click on install and
that's it and then we're gonna launch
Visual Studio code so put a check in
there and click on finish and this is
what Visual Studio code looks like
you're going to see a warning up here
potentially that says get not found
install it on blah what we're gonna do
is just come over here and click on
download kit and then come down here and
click on download again for Windows and
then this is automatically going to come
and download for you you're gonna come
down here click on run of course and
then click on next a whole bunch of
times once again don't change anything
click on next
everything here is fine click on next
and next and next and then this is the
best option for you also so click on
next and then next so just click on next
all bunch times basically what I'm
saying
alright you get down to this final part
right here click on install and if you
want to view the release notes you can't
otherwise just click on uncheck that and
click on finish alright so that's all
set up and you're gonna see down here
using get comes up and everything's
working fine next thing you're gonna do
you're gonna come over here and click on
this this is extensions and we want to
install C++ so what we're gonna do is
just come over here click on install and
whenever you do this is gonna pop up and
you're just gonna click on reload there
you go you got C++ all set up now then
what you want to do is come here where
it says add workspace folder and click
on that whenever you do this is gonna
pop up I called mine C++ tutorial you
can click on add and then finally add
again to add that to your list you can
then also come in here and click on this
guy down here this little gear we have
down here and change any settings that
you would like to change what I do is
just copy and paste like I want to
change my font or my font family just
copy that paste it over here on the
right side of the screen change it to
whatever you want and then click on save
and of course you can change all kinds
of other settings there I'm gonna come
in here and click on new file and I'm
gonna call this hello world dot CPP this
pops up over here on the left side of
your screen and this is just good to
verify that everything's working
properly
whenever you open that up you're gonna
put this code that you see right here
you can pause your screen if you want to
look at that otherwise in the
description I have all this code you can
just copy and paste it and we're gonna
come over here again click on extensions
this weird-looking thing here and type
in code runner this is going to run all
of your code for you and then of course
click on install and then once again
on reload and there you go now what
you're gonna be able to do is just right
click on your screen and come inside of
here and you're gonna see run code shows
up click on it and then down at the
bottom of your screen you're gonna see
hello world printout so everything is
wonderful now what we're gonna do is set
up our Delino so you can do some organ
we know development so you're gonna type
in platform aiyo - IDE this is the one
that you want click on install this
guy's gonna pop up inside of here and
you're gonna click on reload and then
you may or may not get this error if you
see unable to open Pio home theme of
undefined we gotta fix I found a fix on
the internet anyway and once again there
is a link to that so you can just copy
and paste it what you're gonna need to
do is go in if you install it everything
like I told you exactly where it asked
to be installed under users and whatever
your username is and vs code
dot vs code and then followed with
extensions and then platform IO platform
IO IDE and then in your Lib folder
you're going to find a home dot J s file
what I did was I went and made a backup
of the original just to make sure I
didn't lose it then what you're gonna do
is you're gonna copy and paste well this
is what's causing the air and you may or
may not get this error so I'm just
covering it just so you know so what you
want to do is get rid of this part right
here once again link in the description
to exactly what you want to get rid of
she's gonna get rid of that and then
replace it with this so don't try to
copy this off the screen just go to the
link and get it and copy and paste that
in there somebody in internet found the
solution to fix this and once you save
that everything is gonna be fine
and then you can reopen or you're gonna
have to shut down Visual Studio code and
then reopen it then whenever you do that
and you click on platform i/o IDE which
is under extensions you're gonna see
this on your screen what you want to
want to do is click on new projects we
are going to use our galino who know
your so you're gonna search through the
list through that then framework Gordon
we know is gonna pop up and then click
on finish it's gonna say do you want to
save your workspace configuration as a
file say yes you come up here I called
this Arduino test and I'm gonna click on
save and then I copied and pasted it in
the source directory main dot cpp and
all of this code here and this is gonna
allow you to check that your everything
is set up properly so of course you're
going to want to plug in your arduino
into the
of your computer and then you're gonna
come down here where this check mark is
you're going to click on that that is
going to build your application for your
Arduino and then you are going to click
on this guy to load it on to the Arduino
and then you're going to notice that
you're blinking light on your Arduino is
blinking considerably faster and you
will know that everything is properly
set out so hopefully that helps you out
and like always please leave your
questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
