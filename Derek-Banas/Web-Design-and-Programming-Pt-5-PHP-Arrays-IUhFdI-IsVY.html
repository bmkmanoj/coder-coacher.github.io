of my web design and programming
tutorial and today we're going to finish
up arrays and I'm going to do a little
bit on file i/o so you know how to
manipulate files using PHP first I'm
going to show you how to convert a
string into an array let's just create
something called country string it's
equal to and we'll put the wonderful
retrieve Cuba in here Spain India France
and I'm just picking these at random and
Italy it's not the order of most liking
so hopefully I'm not deported from the
United States for doing this and not
including the United States which is
just horrible anyway so here we are if
you wanted to turn this string into an
array you would use the explode function
and what you would do is denote in side
of quotes where you want to split all of
these parts so I'm saying here I want to
split where the period is located so
Cuba Spain India France and Italy are
all going to go into their individual
compartments in our new string and then
I have to tell it what string to explode
this is really dangerous saying bad
things about the United States and
talking about the explode function and
then I'm going to go to screen the array
with the numerical keys random country
comma save that reload and you can see
it prints out Cuba and Spain which is
the values that lie in the 0 &amp;amp; 1 index 0
1 2 3 4
remember that from the last tutorial
what if I want to convert that array
back into a string easy enough just call
for the implode the opposite of explode
and here I'm going to say that I want
all of these different values in this
array to be separated by commas and the
array that I want to implode is right
here and then where the new string is
going to be stored will be country
string 2 if I go to screen country
string 2 followed by double breaks save
it reload and you can see it combined
all them together and put them back into
the string well how would I check if the
value for example India is in the array
I'm going to perform an if statement
here I'm going to call the in array
function and remember you don't need to
remember all of these different
functions
I'm just prove
finding all of them to you here and
you're going to learn them well enough
as I provide examples throughout the
rest of this tutorial I'm just trying to
do this for completionists reasons India
is in the list echo coffee-break file
save and you can see India is in the
list is printed because I asked if India
was in this array right here and since
the answer to that question was yes it
printed out India is in the list what
happens if you wouldn't want to reverse
the order of the array I'm going to call
the printer function which again is just
a print function that prints out arrays
in a human understandable manner I'm
going to call the array reverse function
and it's going to print out to screen
that array in rivers jump over here and
as you can see it prints out the
countries based off of their index value
in reverse see four three two one zero
if you would want to sort the values in
an array there are numerous different
sort functions I'm going to show you one
and then I'm going to list out all the
other ones and what they do and here I'm
going to tell I tell it I want to sort
it as if it is a string there's
different ways to sort very important
you can also sort based off of it being
a numeric meaning it's a string of
numbers and that's exactly the different
codes you would use or you would sort
regular which is going to sort based off
of ASCII codes which if you don't know
what that means basically it comes down
to this B is actually going to be
considered ahead of a so this is not
commonly used but I'm just providing it
because it is the alternative way for
sorting and now if I call again
I grabbed this guy copied print random
country followed by another break
statement and save it and jump over here
and reload you can see now everything is
printed out in alphabetical order the
other way is to do this if you may
notice here India for example now has a
new index which is three up here it was
listed as one that is because the sort
function on its own will pay no
attention to index values and reassign
those index values if you did not
want that to happen you would instead
call the a sort function and if you
would want to sort in reverse order and
again pay no attention to the indexes
you would call the are sort function and
if you wanted to sort in reverse you
would call a RS ort function and it
would keep the keep all the key value
pairs where they were at and if you want
to sort just the keys you would call K
sort and if you'd like to sort the keys
in Reverse you would call the K R sort
function so those are all the different
ways you can sort arrays inside of PHP
now if you want to populate an array
with a range function let's say with the
values of 0 to 50 what we're going to do
is I'm going to count array just create
a brand new right here call the range
function and then tell it to store the
values 0 through 50 inside of it and if
I call for each which I talked about in
previous tutorial helps you sort or
cycle through arrays as and let's just
give it a trenton um as a name roll up
here number opening curly brace and i'm
going to echo to screen print num oma
and I'm gonna put commas in between all
these guys with an extra space and a
closing curly brace and then the break
statement again that's because I like it
save it jump over here reload it and you
can see it prints out the screen the
values 0 through 50 those are contained
inside of the array called the count
array and if you would like to print out
the number of values in the array you
just call the count function and what is
the number that's going to pop up here
on the screen this is a quick quiz is it
going to be 49 50 or 51 there you are 51
why because 0 lies inside of that for a
little bit of file IO what I'm going to
do here is I'm going to call in all of
the values that are stored in a file in
the name of that file is customers dot
txt throw these into an array and just
so you know what that looks like mr.
Merz right there this is what the data
looks like it's a name followed
street followed by city followed by an
abbreviation for a state okay so that's
the information that's stored inside of
there okay and what this guy's going to
do is call the file function which means
it's going to take all of the
information stored in this text file and
store it in the variable named customers
in customers is an array and I'm going
to call the for each function customers
s customer curly brace now I'm going to
sign all the keys to all the values in
the file using the list function I'm
going to say the first one is going to
be called name the second one is going
to be called Street city state does that
all make sense to me and then I'm going
to call the function explode just like I
did previously and here I'm going to say
that all of the different information I
want is going to be separated by a comma
and I want them to be automatically
pulled out and assigned to these
different variables here and each one of
these lines is going to be labeled with
the value of customer and then there is
going to be a new line at the very end
of State so if I want to trim that off
when I get more into manipulating
strings in a later tutorial
but this is how you would use that you
would call the trim function to get rid
of that new line at the end of the state
variable and then if I want to print out
the results to the screen it's easy
enough named space
street space city space state and close
that off and print out the handy dandy
break function and the closing curly
brace and if I save it jump over here
you can see it prints out the name the
address all on individual lines for you
so that is pretty much everything you
can do with an array in PHP if you
combine this tutorial with the previous
tutorial and also this is a little bit
in regards to how to manipulate and work
with files inside of PHP up next in the
next tutorial going to cover functions
and then jump all over the place with a
gazillion Iwan examples and eventually
SQL MySQL and anything else you guys
have questions about have any questions
leave them in a comment section below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
