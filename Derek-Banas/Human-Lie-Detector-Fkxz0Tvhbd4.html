tutorial on how to detect if somebody is
lying to you based off of both body
language analysis as well as verbal
analysis all of this information comes
from countless numbers of psychology
taks hypnotherapy discoveries public law
enforcement training manuals and
countless other books chances are if
there has ever been printed a body
language or verbal analysis book I have
read it and all of the information is
congealed down into this one
presentation by the end you'll learn how
to see signs of deception and body
language
you'll learn to hear signs of deception
through verbal analysis and you also
learn a few stealth techniques you can
use to find out the truth without the
person knowing that you are questioning
one thing that I find extremely helpful
when I'm first meeting somebody
especially a stranger is whether they
are on my side well whenever you are
first meeting this person if they twist
your palm up towards the ceiling or
crush it as I demonstrate here on the
screen you know that they see you as an
inferior someone that they feel they can
manipulate however if they offer their
palm to you that means they see you as a
superior and someone that they will not
try to pull tricks on if they shake your
hand in an up-and-down manner in an
equal way as I demonstrate here they see
you as an equal so that's just a real
quick tip to find out who you're dealing
with and how they see you there are many
other hand gestures that show that a
person is either in distress or
dishonest research has shown most of
these gestures are caused because of
natural chemical reactions in the body
other people believe that children are
taught to cover their mouths when they
lie when they are small and then hence
adults try to hide this instinct by
reaching and touching their nose or
rubbing their eyes or touching their
neck or ears whenever they incidentally
find that their hand is moving towards
their mouth again this is taught to
children because whenever they say
something they shouldn't the parent
holds their finger to the lip and goes
that's what I'm talking about there
often as you can see here as I
demonstrate it when a person is lying or
has lied they will reach up and
incidentally touch their nose in fact
Bill Clinton famously touched his nose
88 times during questioning in regards
to the Monica Lewinsky
testimony there are numerous other
different ways to detect a liar based
off of just hand and arm movements I
covered some of these in my previous
body language tutorial which you can see
a link here for
hands clenched or often a definite sign
of dishonesty or definitely distressed
hands on hips actually normally mean
honesty and normally if someone reacts
in anger whenever you question them or
doubt that they are telling you the
truth chances are they are in fact
telling you the truth
picking imaginary glint also is a
definite sign of dishonesty distress or
disagreement arms crossed most
definitely as a sign of dishonesty
distress or disagreement hands in
pockets again dishonesty distress or
disagreement whoever palm displays are
almost always a definite sign that a
person is being honest however if you
notice they are constantly displaying
their palms chances are they are a very
good liar they are aware of the fact
that palm displays normally signal
honesty and in fact you should not
believe the person you are talking with
women often will use what is called a
purse wall in front of them whenever
they feel distress or they feel that
they're trying to conceal information as
well all people will use what is called
the invisible coffee wall or the
invisible drink wall by placing the
drink opposite of the hand in which
they're drinking as I demonstrate here
whenever they are under distress or are
being dishonest rubbing up the neck
again is a definite sign of dishonesty
or distress and when the hand is just
lightly touching the chin this is a true
sign of honesty and interest I talked
previously about how eyes move in a
certain direction when a person is asked
a question what I'm demonstrating here
or how the eyes will actually be looking
at you when you are talking to somebody
to make this very very simple if you ask
somebody a question and they look in
this direction to the left chances are
they're making up a story or lying if
they look in any other direction chances
are they are telling you the truth if
you want more information regards to how
the eyes move when questioned see the
previous gestures and body language
tutorial this is in fact true for 85% of
people and most people are in agreement
that the only difference it lies is
incomplete flip flop whenever a person
is left-handed versus right-handed what
you see here is a demonstration of how
eyes move when a person is right-handed
a couple other things that are of
interest in regards to what people do
with their eyes the first person that
looks away whenever they first meet with
somebody or their talk
somebody is the most submissive and the
person that is more than likely they're
under distress or trying to hide
something and very good Liars maintain
uncomfortable iron contact well over 50
percent of the time how they're able to
maintain this solid eye contact is
they're in fact not looking at your eyes
but instead looking in the between your
eyes at your forehead so that it just
seems as if they are maintaining a lot
of strong eye contact which is
considered truthful another thing that
is common is whenever a person is lying
their blink rate will dramatically
increase what I'm demonstrating here is
what is considered normal blink rate in
which a person blinks their eyes once
every 5 seconds instead as you can see
here this is more of what way blink rate
would look like when a very person is
lying meaning that they are blinking
once every 2 to 3 seconds so that is the
difference
want to see again normal blink rate and
then not normal blink rate also whenever
a person is going through long periods
of lying they will start act very oddly
lying is very very hard on a person and
as you can see here I am having trouble
swallowing because I have a dry mouth
and at worse whenever a person is trying
not to give away any signals they will
start to act very mechanical as you can
see here I am demonstrating how a person
would very mechanically pick up a drink
which is something that they would
normally do very very easily but I'm
straining to first find the drink and
then I'm moving my arms over very very
mechanically this is what someone would
do under distress or in a period of
severe dishonesty jiggling of the feet
is also a great sign of distress and
dishonesty people have a very hard time
controlling their leg movements unless
they pay direct attention to them and it
has been proven that feet will often
point towards that which they want so in
this situation if a door was to the left
of the person sitting here you would
know that they want to leave the room
that they feel uncomfortable and
pressured and don't want to give in on
their lie another sign in body language
is a person is lying is that their face
will flush quite severely you will
notice that their face gets much
whenever they are lying or in general
distress and the basic rule for all body
language analysis is to always pay
attention when people seem to be giving
mixed signals if a person's physical
gestures do not match their words trust
the body language to help detect if
someone's lying to you now I'll go over
the fact that it is very very hard for a
person in line the fact is that most
people almost never lie why is that
because it puts a lot of stress on us
remember the excessive yawning
swallowing mechanical movements I
described just a few seconds ago people
will in fact go out of their way to
avoid lying and they do so by avoiding
the questions that you posed they will
tell you what they saw or what they did
but never anything incriminating
remember I wouldn't do that is not the
same as I didn't do that
when you ask a question make sure the
person answers it also make sure your
questions are very direct because people
find it very hard to lie to direct
questions here I display an interview
given by Timothy McVeigh who was behind
the Oklahoma City bombings
whenever the Newsweek reporter asked him
this is the question that everybody
wants to know did you do it McVeigh
answered the only way we can really
answer that is that we are going to
plead not guilty the Newsweek reporter
further pressed on and asked but you've
got a chance right now to say hell no
Timothy McVeigh said we can't do that
there are numerous other examples of
people who have been found guilty of a
crime yet couldn't claim their innocence
when posed with a direct question I want
to reiterate that people given the
choice of time behind jail or death
couldn't lie people find it very hard to
lie another great way to tell that a
story has gone from truth to lies is to
inspect pronoun changes when a person
wants to distance themselves from
something they will start using pronouns
that distance them for example they may
refer to my car when they want to take
ownership of the car
however while referring to it as the car
when they want to distance themselves
from it Susan Smith did that exactly
when describing her happy travels with
her children she referred to my car
however when she described leaving the
vehicle and seeing it submerge with her
two boys inside she referred to it as
the car
the difference was my taking ownership
and then the relinquishing ownership
remember when I said you have to make
sure a person answers the exact question
asked by manipulating verb tenses most
people can get away with lying if you
asked have you ever used the illegal
drugs and someone answers I don't use
illegal drugs did they answer the
question no they didn't they simply
stated that they currently are not using
drugs they may have used them in the
past they may have used them last week
it kind of depends on their definition
of don't use not the answer to your
question please pay much attention to
verb tenses often in a missing persons
case in fact the interviewee that refers
to the missing person in the past tense
first is often a suspect another way to
detect lying is that fact that we all
have an internal dictionary we each pull
words from that dictionary to describe
events we tend to use the same words
unless we are under stress or being
deceptive if we refer to our car as a
car we usually will refer to it as a car
it is unnatural for a person to refer to
it as a car and then an automobile than
a vehicle than a Toyota in the same
story if you question someone and they
start using words from your own internal
dictionary meaning they start using your
words in their answers they are probably
lying you can see here whenever Jim
Lehrer
asked Oh Clinton you had no sexual
relationship with this young woman he
answered there is no sexual relationship
see borrowing from internal dictionary
that is accurate you can see here in
this one question and answer he didn't
answer the question
he changed the verb tense and then he
borrowed from layers internal dictionary
chances are he was lying also understand
that order in a list is very important
parents who are asked to name their
children usually name them in the order
of first time lands and superiority play
a major role in lists if they break this
rule you will see favoritism there if a
boss is asked to name his employees he
will almost always name his favorite
employees first and his least favorite
employees last remember superiority
plays a role in a list also you can
detect line whenever a person mismatches
a common phrase when oj
Simpson referred to his wife having
downs and ups instead of the more common
ups and downs police noted that fact is
someone of course answers your question
with the question deception of course
can be found there
the parent asks a child did you take the
cookies and the child responds did I
take the cookie no there you will notice
a line or if they would say could you
repeat that what they're doing is
they're trying to get themselves a
little bit more time to try to figure
out what to say when they were oppressed
or if they say what did you say again
they're trying to get them more time so
they can build up a line
you can definitely be aware that a lie
is definitely going to be coming then it
comes to one of the lesser known ways of
detecting that somebody is lying the
best way I have found it tech lives from
the best Liars is to look for
unnecessary words if a person starts a
sentence with I'll try that is equal to
no I more than likely will not do that
if they say something like the truth is
or truthfully or to be honest chances
are they have previously been lying to
you otherwise why would they say now I'm
going to be truthful which is in essence
what those words mean again maybe I'll
be able to do that again you can expect
that to be a lie to tell the truth again
you know that they previously haven't
been telling you the truth and actually
falls in line with that better yet if
someone gives you an answer followed by
really you probably just heard a lie so
they say oh it's okay that you forgot to
feed my dog for the past two days really
chances are what they just said to you
is a lie and here's a couple stealth
little tricks to figure out if
somebody's lying you can sort of
manipulate these based off of your
situation for example if you think
someone's spreading rumors about you
approach that person and say it's come
to my attention that someone is
spreading rumors can you alert me if you
hear anything if they become defensive
or change the subject they are the one
spreading the rumor or doing whatever
you're trying to figure out if they are
doing or not the reason why is by asking
this question you are not accusing them
in actuality you would never posed this
question naturally to a person that you
thought was not spreading rumors you are
actually trusting them saying look out
for somebody spreading rumors again if
they go on the defensive they are the
person that is spreading the rumor if
however they agree to help you they're
more than likely not and if you want to
find out
person truly was where they said they
were ask them if they had a lot of
traffic because of the water line break
or a bad accident or whatever if they
answer in the affirmative again very
quickly you know the person's line
another thing that's kind of neat this
sort of goes back to the handshake test
research has shown that it's easy to
find out if someone could be inclined to
do bad things just ask them the right
question phrase properly when you ask a
person rhetorical question like I have
here on the screen they will usually use
themselves as an example they won't even
notice that you asked them some pretty
private information and I would bet if
they answer all the above positively
that they are likely to take advantage
of their spouse steal from the workplace
and hurt others to get ahead so just to
review verbal analysis wise if you're
trying to figure out if somebody's lying
to you check did they answer the
question examine the pronouns did they
use unnecessary words did they change
verb tenses did they answer the question
with a question or did they borrow from
your internal dictionary what you have
to understand is whenever a person's
being questioned in an uncomfortable
situation they will do everything they
can to not give away body language
signals they will try to sit on their
hands as I demonstrate here so if you
want to force them to be honest force
them to stop sitting on their hands
force them to show palms or you can
often make a person more honest by
displaying your palms to them maintain
strong eye contact it's very hard to lie
whenever strong eye contact is being
maintained don't allow them to use the
verbal tricks that I previously talked
about also don't allow them to cross
their legs or cross their arms if at all
possible and finally if they don't
answer the question ask it again leave
any questions or comments in the comment
section below
otherwise I still next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
