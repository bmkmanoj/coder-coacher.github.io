show you how to make something extremely
easy it's a three cheese polenta with a
mushroom sauce all together it'll take
you probably about 15 minutes to make
and it's delicious and of course you can
see right here everything you're gonna
need it's just basically gonna be water
milk instant polenta three different
types of cheese which is gonna be
parmesan fontina mascarpone you're gonna
need mushrooms you're gonna need butter
flour chicken stock and of course as a
tutorial continues I'm gonna tell you
the amounts of those that you're gonna
need then in a heavy bottomed pan that's
gonna be set on high we're going to add
two big cups of milk and five cups of
water and then finally one teaspoon of
salt and then we're going to bring this
to a simmer and it's very important to
keep it on high if you want to get this
done quickly while we're waiting for
those to simmer in a pan and put in two
tablespoons of olive oil then for now
we're prior to cooking I had soaked some
dried mushrooms in just some warm water
and I'm gonna add those to a pan it
doesn't really matter what type of dried
mushrooms you use just any dried
mushrooms then I'm going to add about
eight ounces of chopped mushrooms and
I'm gonna stir stir stir for about five
minutes until they get the basic
consistency that you see right here then
it's gonna be time for us to make our
roux for our mushroom sauce so I'm going
to add two tablespoons of butter and
then about two tablespoons of flour to
that mixture and here I actually put in
about three tablespoon you're going to
whisk whisk whisk that until you get
that consistency then I'm going to add
two cups of chicken stock and then
vigorously whisk that together to make
it nice and thick I'm gonna take the
mushroom sauce and let it simmer on low
and then I'm gonna get back to my
polenta here I'm adding two cups of
instant polenta and four cloves of
garlic and then I am going to stir stir
stir stir stir the ultimate goal here is
just basically to whisk out all the
lumps and this is going to take you
roughly around three minutes maybe four
minutes and I have this on high and
whenever you see bubbles like this then
you're going to add in one
1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese and then stir
that into the polenta until it is
completely melted and then you're gonna
get some cubed fontina cheese and stir
that into your polenta as well the
amount of stirring of the fontina cheese
is going to pretty much depend upon
whatever you prefer then I'm going to be
adding in 1 cup of mascarpone cheese
which is a very very rich cheese and
then that is basically gonna be it and
then it's going to be time to taste and
now your polenta is all done immediately
remove it from the burner so it doesn't
scorch and now let's get back to
finishing up our mushroom sauce and here
it is cooking I am just going to get my
mushrooms that I cooked earlier and I'm
going to dump them in and I am going to
stir them together and then you're gonna
scoop out your polenta dump your
mushroom sauce on top and you are done
