my how to make videogames tutorial
series in this part we're going to
continue on the second part of how to
make Tetris from scratch and what I mean
by scratch is I have done nothing to
prepare ahead of this video so you're
going to see the whole thought process
of me trying to figure out how Terrace
works and how to make it work like
always all the code is available in the
description underneath the video and I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay so this is where I left you off and
I'm trusting that you guys knew that you
had to save your scene so that's the
only thing I didn't do you can see right
here now I have main scene saved inside
of there and obviously you just go file
save scene dinah got it out alright so
what do we need to do here let's zoom
out here basically we created our
interface last time we created all of
our prefabs for our walls and everything
and basically we didn't create any
scripts so what I'm going to do this
time is so I can experiment through this
whole process of creating Tetris I'm
going to create a script that's going to
spawn a shape on the screen and a good
name for that I'm going to come in here
and go create an C sharp script and I'm
going to call this shape spawner because
that's what it's doing so there we go
got that created and I'm going to open
it up and visual studio is going to open
up and I'm using Visual Studio community
2017 which is free so I get asked that
all the time so the reason why I'm
bringing it up okay so here we aren't
opens up in Visual Studio now I have to
think about what I'm going to do with
this well basically I need to randomly
open up any different numbers of shapes
so what I need to do is I need a way to
store those shapes that I'm going to
open so I'm going to say that I want to
create an array of game objects and I'm
going to call these shapes because
that's what they are and what else am I
going to have to do with them well I'm
going to have to spawn random shapes
because I'm really in the testing phase
right now and I want random shapes to
pop up on the screen so I can test to
see if they're staying within the
constraints of my box so I'm going to
create a function not going to return
anything it's just going to be called
spawn shape so let's just create that
guy and I want it to be random so how
many shapes do I have let's go check in
unity Here I am back in unity click on
prefabs and I have one two three four
five six seven shapes that we can work
with so that means that I need to
generate an index between zero and six
so I'm going to call this shape index
and I'm going to generate a random value
use random range to do that with c-sharp
and I want zero to six so it's going to
be between zero and six is what I want
to generate here and then I want it to
show on the screen how do I do that I go
instantiate and then I call shapes and I
want shape index so I'm going to get one
of those shapes out of my array and I'm
going to put the shapes in the array
that's the reason why this is public I'm
going to put the define those in the
array over in unity and then I'm going
to transform position and that's going
to be the position of wherever shape
spawner is on my screen so that's what
that is and then this crazy thing
handles rotation so I'm not going to do
anything rotation wise and that's good
all right so I have that all set up now
what I need to do to test it is just to
call that function as soon as the
program starts and that's it that's all
I need to do just for now with this now
later on I'll want to you know spawn
more shapes but I'm pretty happy with
this and let's go over into unity and
test this stuff out all right so here I
am inside of unity and I'm just going to
come in here and I'm going to say create
empty and I'm going to call this shape
spawner put that guy right there and
then I'm going to select it and I'm
going to grab my shape spawn or script
and drag it over into that guy now I
have to figure out where I want my shape
spawner to show up you can see it's down
here right now and you know I'm going to
be moving that around I guarantee it so
I'm going to select shape spawner come
over here and click on this little
doodad and move it up into place so
let's just move it up here and then over
here and we can test it out to see how
it works but I'm going to put it
somewhere in that ballpark and see how
it works out so you can go in here and
test it now let's just run it oh whoops
I forgot
put the shapes inside of there okay so
let's go open up our shape spawner that
we have right here and you can see right
here is our array shapes see whenever I
am not prepared I go and I make mistakes
so let's go and click on this guy and
let's click on six for our size and
that's one two three actually I'm going
to have to have that be seven so there
we go and then I'm going to go and grab
my prefabs which is what it's going to
throw in there so go i shape throw that
right there J shape and L shape and
Oshea and s T and Z all right so now we
got our shapes in there we will be able
to spawn them now save that and we'll
come and play it and you can see pops up
right there on the screen
less-than-ideal it's to the right looks
kind of weird let's click on this and
just go and verify that it's popping up
different shapes it that's definitely
not ideal let's move it over a little
bit to the left
so shape spawner and let's move it a
little bit to the left and let's move it
down a little bit it's going to be a lot
of tweaking involved here let's grab
this guy and move it down and play it
again
and let's see where it shows up still
way over there to the right all right so
let's just leave it at that right now
and let's now take a look at how we are
going to have the shapes stay within a
binding box this binding box right here
and at the same time how we are going to
be able to rotate and move left right
and down like we can do inside of Tetris
so what I think I want to do is create a
new script and I'm going to call it
shapes sounds good or let's call it
shape that makes sense because it's only
going to be tied to one shape so let's
open up shape see how that works out and
we're going to click reload so here is
shape now what sort of things am I going
to need to do with my shape well my
shapes are going to move in an
increasing speed as difficulty you know
increases with my tetris game so I'm
going to come in here and find speed now
I don't know if I'm going to use this
yet but I know at some point I'm going
to want to use it so let's do that what
else might I need to do um
hmm I don't know I can't think of
anything I'm sure things will come up
all right so let's go and let's go down
into our update section and what I'm
going to do here is I'm basically going
to monitor when the user clicks on
different keys so what that means is I'm
going to have to define those in the
input so let's jump back over into unity
and yes this is exactly how I work I
constantly go let's go make a script and
then I go oh wait a minute I have to go
in and set the project settings for
input so let's click on that all right
so here's accesses or AXYZ sorry about
that
and I'm going to have to create some new
ones so I'm going to want my shapes to
be able to be moved left right down and
I want to rotate them I want to have
everything set up so that it works with
aw s and D so I'm just going to create
my own things so I'm going to change
this to 22 and it's going to create a
whole bunch of cancels here boomp
and then I'm going to open up this guy
and I'm going to define my own shapes so
I'm going to give this guy the name of a
to just keep it very simple change this
to a and then get rid of that and there
we go just to find a new input sopin up
another one and I'm going to give this
one the default of D we're going to need
to monitor the D button and I'm going to
get rid of that so I'll get rid of this
and we're also going to do the same with
W W that and then finally we're going to
do one for s and there's s and s and get
rid of that okay so now we are
monitoring of those inputs now let's
jump back into the shape and let's set
them up ok so here we are so how do we
check if an input or if a button on the
keyboard has been pressed we can go if
inputs get key down and that's just
going to get one press of the button
it's not going to repetitively do it and
that's what we want with Tetris so we're
going to go if they press the a key well
then I want something to happen what do
I want to happen well I want the
position to move one to the left for our
shape well this is
these this is going to be tied to our
shapes to all of our different shapes so
that's going to work out perfectly fun
so what I can do is just go transform
and it's going to know I mean the shape
that this script is tied to position and
then I can increase or move it to the
left and how you do that is you go new
and vector3 and to the left is negative
one and on the X plane of course and
then zero zero for everything else
because we're not moving anything else
so I know I want to do that what else am
I going to want to do well I know that
I'm going to have an issue where it's
going to go outside of the grid so how
am I going to protect from that I have
no idea so what I'm going to is I'm
going to say debug log and I'm going to
print out on the screen my transform
position and then I can monitor how the
X&amp;amp;Y coordinates change as the shape
moves around on the screen so let's do
that for all of our different movements
and then we'll go in and we will add
corrections to it just to constant add
adding features I mean that's what it's
all about
then D is going to be to the right so
we're going to increase it and we're
also going to print that out and what
else are we going to do well we are
going to also want to monitor when the S
key is clicked on so that we can move
down so put that in there we're not
moving on the X plane anymore so let's
change that to zero and then we are
going to change this to negative one so
that's going to work for this and what
else do we have
we have rotate so that's going to be set
for W and for this one you go and you
don't use this guy right here instead
what you're going to use is transform
rotate and we will change that like this
and then you just change it to 90 and
we're going to move it 90 degrees
whenever the W key is pressed on and
that looks good let's go test it all
right so we're going to go click on our
prefabs and I'm going to select every
single one of these guys so to select
whoops there we are just select all of
them right like that and then
going to open up scripts and I'm going
to grab my shape and drag it over there
and drop it right in there and you can
see that speed is going to be set up
right here let's see see there's speed
I'm just going to leave that be one
we're going to save it and then we're
going to run it now you can see when
these guys pop up that I'm going to be
able to move them you can also see that
they are going too far that's not good
so we are going to move our grid over a
little bit this guy right here so that
they line up a little bit better yeah
let's do definitely do that because this
is just a mess all right so I'm going to
move my entire middle grid part over
half decent amount so let's fix that
issue before it becomes an even bigger
issue so let's select all those guys get
this right here and let's move it over
something like that
let's play it see how it works now we
are not going to 100% rely on we're not
using collisions because that would just
be a nightmare if we tried to do this
using collisions let me tell you it
would not work so what we were going to
have to do is we're going to eyeball at
the beginning and then we're going to
handle collisions on our own because
this is so tight let's move it over just
a smidge more there that is just a
smidge we just want our eyeball to you
know it to look good eyeball wise and it
looks pretty doggone perfect alright
it's not going to have to be totally
perfect all right so now look at that it
looks good to me right yeah all right so
all right it's a dog line close all
right so we're going to make it perfect
later on but we're very close right now
and that's all that matters so what I
want to do is I want to run it and then
I want to get the coordinates for the
shape whenever we touch the different
walls so I'm going to click on this and
I'm going to go like this and then I'm
going to stop all right so that's the
position before that and we're going to
see that in the console and you're going
to see it right here so it's point two
so this is definitely something we were
also going to fix but right now in the
preliminary stage everything's cool so
we're going to mark down that that is
point two on a piece of paper so point
two all right now what I'm going to do
and that's point two to the right now
what I'm going to do is figure out what
it is to the left and then finally what
is the coordinate system full
are the bottom click on this once again
and this is going to be off but we don't
care we're going to get it right okay so
that's good and on the left is going to
be negative six point eight six point
eight and then down below is going to be
roughly so this is that doesn't quite
get to bottom the screen either whatever
move it up a little bit that is going to
be negative eight point eight so
negative eight point eight eight and
let's just come in here and grab all of
those guys once again and we will move
the guys up here just slightly something
like that let's run it again just to see
and after tweaking this everything looks
pretty good so now what we can do is
worry about how we are going to
constrain everything and keep it into
space okay so I'm going to open up shape
again and I'm going to edit the code
okay here we are so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create a function that's
basically going to try to figure out if
I am within the border or not so I'm
going to call this public static it's
going to return a true or a false and I
call this is in border and it's going to
receive a vector which is going to be
the position for the shape its name this
is in border like that okay and then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
return using my temporary values for x
and y and so forth for my grid
I'm going to go position X greater than
or equal to this might be wrong also
but I'm testing it so you know let's go
and int position X less than or equal to
let's not three point five what am i
doing I wrote this down it is a negative
six point eight negative six point eight
and I trust you know where I got those
numbers at I just got them just a second
ago then this is going to be point two
and since I'm going to check the
y-direction on this and equal to and
this is going to be a negative eight
point eight and that's what it's going
to return true or false so what I'm
going to do then is I need to
find a way to stop the rotation or
movement of the shape if it is hitting
one of those borders or not so what I'm
going to do here is if it does hit one
of the borders I am going to switch it
back to the position that it was in
previously because that's the easiest
way to do it so I'm going to say if and
I'm going to say not is in border well
under that circumstance I'm just going
to do the absolute opposite of what I
just did so I'm just going to copy this
and change it to the opposite so I'll
just do like that okay pretty simple and
what I'm going to pass to it is
transform position okay so let's test
this this is going to be to move to the
left side of the screen so let's go into
unity and see if that worked
Caleb play it and then I'm going to
click on eh ah okay so it's off by one
that's it so you can see that it did
indeed stop it so let's go back to the
script and then we will jump down to the
bottom here there we are
let's change this to five and let's run
it and let's move it over ah you can see
now that it didn't quite go over the
whole entire way why is that well the
reason why is let's go back into unity
well we got unity here let's shut this
off you're going to notice that whenever
we go and click on our prefabs that they
all have completely different areas
which is considered like the center of
the shape so let's click on I shape here
and I'm going to have to zoom out let's
go and drag the shape over okay so
here's a shape we'll drag that onto the
screen and you can actually see this is
a shapes position see it's way way way
off so that's not good and we can grab J
shape
throw it on the screen and you can see
the position for it so basically what
I'm going to need to do here is I'm
going to need to check the central
position for each of these blocks when
I'm moving these around I can't trust
that because the shapes are completely
different I can't judge them based off
of some key location in the center of it
in regards to movement so hopefully that
makes sense but didn't leave a comment
below and I'll explain it better but
basically I'm going to have to cycle
through and check the center of every
child or
each cube that makes up each one of
these shapes I am NOT going to be able
to look at the shapes as a whole
okay so how I'm going to do that is I'm
going to do that in code and I'm going
to be changing some things here quite a
bit actually since I already have is in
border here what I'm going to do is
create another function and it's going
to be public pool and I'm gonna call
this is in grid and it's not going to be
passed anything and then I'm going to
cycle through all of the different child
objects and I'm also going to check the
position for the child objects that is
what I'm going to do here with child
counts so I'm going to go child
count once again I'm always thinking
about how I'm going to debug what I'm
doing here
somebody call that child counts and I'm
going to go for each and this is going
to be a transform this is going to be
the child Tube objects transform that
I'm going to have inside of here let's
call this child block in transform and
this transform is going to be the shape
as a total so then what I need to do is
go vector to and its effect is going to
be child block position so that's what
I'm going to be checking the position
the center mark for our child I'm going
to increment child counts and that's
just for debugging purposes I'm not
going to do anything other than you know
output some information and what I'm
going to infer mate or what I'm going to
put out information wise this time is
child counts plus and then I'm going to
output the child blocks position so
child block position in the console so
that I can see that and then debug where
I need to move things around then what
we're going to do is I'm going to say if
not is in border and pass the child's
vector then I want to return false
otherwise if we go through all of this
stuff which is going to be down here
after the for each block I'm going to
return true then am I going to have to
do anything different here is in border
so far nothing but I will have to change
these numbers because these numbers are
no doubt wrong so how do I need to
change all of these other guys up here
well let's go out there and take a look
well I'm going to have to change this to
is in grid and is in grid doesn't get
past anything so let's get rid of that
and everything else here is going to be
exactly the same so what we're going to
do is we're just going to copy this and
we're going to come down here to get
keydown paste that right there and then
I'm going to change is this so this is
going to be a negative one everything
else here is exactly the same come down
to the next one of these guys pop in
here is in grid and this is going to be
changed to zero and then this is going
to be changed to one to undo that and
then we'll come down here to the W which
is going to rotate so is in grid and
we're just going to do the absolute
opposite of what this is so let's just
grab this paste that inside of there and
then this is going to be negative ninety
okay so I'm going to open up these cubes
on the bottom there main walls and
actually see the cube position here so I
got the calculation a little bit off so
let's click on cube here and see where
it actually is it is actually at zero
point seven three so let's change what
we had previously so this is going to be
negative zero point seven three and I'm
betting this is the issue and then the
next one the right wall is going to be
ten point three one and then the bottom
wall is negative ten point four five so
negative ten point four five and we will
be changing those because working with
floats is not going to be something we
want to do so let's jump over into the
code and test that out here we are so
let's change this to negative zero point
seven three and we'll change this one to
ten point three one and we will change
this one to ten point four five and
we'll test this and see it's probably
going to be off but we'll test it and
let's run it and we'll move the shapes
okay so that's off so we need to be able
to go to the left one two three four
blocks jump out of there open the code
let's change this to four
jump back in play it ah look at that now
that works okay and then we'll subtract
mmm quite a bit from us let's say here
so we got one two three four five six
seven let's jump back over here so this
is going to be three three one let's
test it a little bit too much that's
good though and I'm going to have it the
spawner load these shapes lower so that
we don't have the issue words oh you
know going across the top there like
that now that works and there that works
okay good and how we doing down here
below but got that first time let's make
sure when we rotate it doesn't cause
issues and it's not letting me wrote up
there I rotate it rotate it up though ah
whenever I rotate then it's going down
so let's just verify that one thing that
I noticed one was poking around here is
whenever I define my canvas I forgot to
drag my camera over there so let's go
and grab our main camera drop it inside
of there okay so that's good save it
let's reload this again test it again
again we can move to the left and the
right those are perfect and let's move
down that seems to be good as well and
then once we get to the bottom of the
screen let's reload this again from the
top let's run it again when we get to
the bottom of the screen obviously we're
gonna have to stop everything so let's
do rotate and see what happens rotate
and that gets all wacky okay so as I
rotate this look how wacky it gets I
know why does it I went and took a look
alright so let's go and let's look at
this L and let's try to figure out why
it's not rotating the way it should
rotate let's go and find the L shape
drag it on to the scene and you will see
the answer I don't know why but
originally I thought that I had
positioned this at the zero zero mark
but obviously I didn't so what I'm going
to need to do is fix that so how do I
fix it well we're going to delete that I
could redraw all the prefabs but I would
prefer to just come in here and just fix
them all so I'm going to show you how to
fix them so here's my eye shape and we
know that's messed up and you can see
right here that it is not in the zero
zero positions what we're going to do
change that to zero change this to zero
and then I'm going to properly position
all of the cubes
around that position so we're then going
to go here click on that guy and we're
going to set him also to zero or her I
don't know what the cube is alright so
we got that in the zero zero position we
can look at our eye shape and we now see
that everything is all messed up so what
we're going to have to do is reorient
all the other cubes for our eyes shape
based off of that zero zero position so
that we will be able to properly rotate
click on this guy and we know that we
want it to be one over from our starting
zero position so we're going to change
that to one and we're going to change
this to zero now if we go click on the
eye shape you're going to see that those
are aligned down here so what we need to
do now is just get all the other ones
aligned so let's go we're not going to
have this be perfect but we're going to
have it be very very close to perfect
where the rotation is going to center
around a center point so that's negative
one we'll change that to zero click on
this cube come down here and we will
change this to two and zero and that is
going to give us a straight line of for
our eye shape right back where we were
previously and I don't know if we're
going to be able to trust the deads
let's guess go and run it and see if by
chance we get and I shape the pop-up now
let's just do it and then we got one so
now let's try rotating it and you can
see now it rotates the way that we
thought that we would want it to rotate
so now we know we're doing it the right
way so now let's go and fix all the rest
of them so JJ let's change this to zero
change this to zero come down to the
next one I'm going to zoom in here so
you can see a little bit better I just
clicked on J shape zero zero let's click
on this box right here and we're going
to orient it around so we'll go it's
obviously easier to do whenever you very
first create the shape but like I said
sometimes things get messed up your code
and so forth and this is how we can
correct this specific issue so J shit we
want to go one over and we want to go
and zero as a doubt select the next one
and this is going to be one to the right
and then nothing on the y-direction and
then for this final one we're going to
go 1 and negative 1 in the x and y
position and if we select the
J shape you can see that works and I
know the rotations are going to work
will now do it for all the other
different shapes
once again zero this out we are going to
get to the cube zero both of these outs
zero and zero that's going to be a
central point
we will get this guy and we will change
it to negative one and one one over zero
down negative one and zero and let's
come out of here and verify that it
works yes that's the way it's supposed
to look now we'll get the o'shea p--
first select the oh it is 0 and that's 0
0 that is 1 1 exactly the way that it's
supposed to be this is 1 0 okay so for
some reason the cubes were right and the
other shapes weren't okay
whatever we'll figure it out change this
to 0 0 did one of them right one of them
wrong I don't know how it happened all
right so here's the S shape change the
first one to zero it out and we're going
to go 1 &amp;amp; 0 0 and negative 1 and then
negative 1 and negative 1 save that
click on the S shape verify that it is
ok yes that's exactly what I wanted to
look like do it for the T shape as well
put this in the center click on the
first cube this is also going to be
centered grab the next part this is
going to be negative 1 and 0 negative 1
and 0 on that this is going to be 1 and
0 and then finally we are going to click
on this one and this is going to be 0
and negative 1 so this is how we can set
up shapes so that they will properly
rotate vertical wall don't need to worry
about the Z shape is going to be 0 and 0
and the cube is 0 and 0 and this guy
right here is going to be negative 1 and
0 the next one down is going to be 0 and
negative 1 and then finally to correct
every one of these shapes this is going
to be 1 and negative 1 all right and if
we click on the Z shape it looks like a
Z all right so everything is cool now
let's go and see if anything else cut
messed up whenever we were doing all
this changes so you can see we can now
properly rotate you can see that we are
staying within the confines of our box
are we staying within the
fines of the bottom no or not but it's
not really a problem with the numbers
it's a matter of the grid being off so I
just need to adjust the grid a little
bit to go in here I'm going to select
all of these boxes and bring them
together just select them over here
click on this guy and let's drag it down
about half way something like that and
then let's play it again see what it
looks like
Wow we got lucky there um it's just
about perfect all right cool
so and then I got to move it over to the
left just a smidge and then everything
else should work great see if it's okay
here yep it means to go over to the left
a smidge so now I'm just messing around
duh all right and play it again it's
perfect looks just about perfect looks
really good
okay so everything's lining up there
needs to go up just slightly just a ton
of tweaking that's what this is all
about and and I'm going to trust is that
that is all good so what else do we need
to do well the final thing I want to do
before we finish off everything
everything's staying within the grid is
I want everything to fall automatically
what I mean by that is the shapes should
fall automatically on our screen so
we're of course going to have to go into
our code and make that happen so let's
go to scripts and shape now what makes
sense for me is to tie this directly
into our git key downs for the letter S
specifically so this guy right here so
what exactly how can we add once per
second go and act as if that the S key
has been pressed so that it'll
automatically move the things down well
I'm going to have to track when the last
movement downwards was and then
basically increment that once per second
so let's go and up here and I'm going to
create a float and it's going to be
called last move down and it's going to
start off with a zero value and it's
going to increment once per second now
what I'm going to do is go down into
this box right here and I'm going to go
or and I'm going to put time time inside
of here and the very first time that we
go through this time inside of updates
it's going to have a view of value of
one and then the next you know time
throw it's going to increment so what I
need to do is I'm going to go time time
and I'm going to subtract last move down
and if it's greater than or equal to one
well then I know that one second has
passed and I can basically move my shape
down a little bit I'm gonna have to
change the code in here a little bit
more because I'm going to need to reset
last move down to the previous version
of time each time that it goes through
here so I'm going to put them right here
and right before we leave this block I'm
going to go last move down is going to
be equal to the current value for time
time and then it should automatically
work and let's go test it here we are
play it shape appears it's in good
position and you can see it's also
moving and I can also move left and
right that doesn't keep it from moving
down and I can also rotate it and that
is not keeping it from moving down and
I'm just verifying that I cannot rotate
my way through walls or move through
walls alright guys so then a lot fixed a
lot of errors learned a lot and
basically what I need to do in the next
part of the tutorial is figure out how
to stack these blocks and also to figure
out an ingenious way to keep from being
able to move the blocks around once we
get to the bottom of the screen so I
hope you guys enjoyed that I enjoyed
making it and like always please leave
your questions and comments below
