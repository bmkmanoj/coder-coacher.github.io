14 of my C video tutorial in the last
part of this tutorial I covered how to
convert from base 10 to numerous other
different bases being base 8 and binary
and hexadecimal at the end of that
tutorial I left you with a homework
assignment which was how do we write
code to convert from all of those other
bases back to base 10 and in this
tutorial I'm going to show you exactly
how to do that if you missed any of the
previous tutorials if I provide a link
in the upper right hand corner to them
and otherwise I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay so basically in
the last tutorial we talked about how
exactly base 8 works and pretty much
this shows us exactly how we're going to
be able to convert from base 8 back to
base 10 as you can see here but let's
focus in even further so let's say we
have 4 5 5 which is a representation in
base 8 of the base 10 number 301 so
basically we have to figure out exactly
how to take what we see here on the
screen and simply create it inside of a
function so what are some of the
different things we're going to need to
do well basically our function we're
going to be creating is going to be
passed the number to convert in string
form also it's going to be passed the
original base of that number that's
going to be passed in so that we know
what we're going to be converting from
and also the number of numbers in the
character array so that we know exactly
how many different numbers we're going
to be working with then what we're going
to need to do is create a loop that's
going to start at the highest point of
the array which is going to be this guy
right here and then it's going to slowly
decrement itself down then for each
number inside of our array we're going
to have to get the original base which
is going to be 8 in this situation if
we're working with base 8 and then we're
going to have to take it to the power of
an increasing number from 0 to 1 to 2
depending upon the total size of our
array then we're going to have to
multiply the character that's going to
be passed in which is going to be 5 5 4
based off of this guy right here times
these guys right here or this line that
I described previously and then of
course we're going to have to add
result to all of the other results to
get our final base 10 representation so
that's enough explaining so let's jump
over into the code okay so here we are
and there's a couple new things here I'm
going to have to have in my arsenal I'm
going to get myself to new libraries I'm
going to use a math library and it's
going to be used to be able to calculate
the power and I'm also going to get a C
type library and that is going to be
used for checking whether an alpha
number has been passed inside or a
letter passed in so that we'll be able
to convert from hexadecimal to base 10
but I'm going to keep this nice and
simple and I'm just first off going to
go through exactly how to convert
regular numbers and ignore the letters
for the moment so this guy's going to
return an integer and I'm going to go
base to decimal is the name of it and I
said previously that we're going to be
passed a character array and I'm just
simply going to call it number also said
I'm going to get the base that we are
going to be moving from well we'll just
think of it as base 8 for now size of
number which is going to be the number
of different characters in our character
array and we're going to be adding up
results over and over again and the
result is going to start off at 0 and
also we're going to have to the power of
which is going to be the increasing
value that we're going to be using it
over and over again so if it's base 8
it's going to be 8 to the power of 0 and
then it's going to be 8 to the power of
1 and so forth and so on so this guy's
going to increase starting off at 0 so
of course it would make sense to give it
a value of 0 ok and if we move on here
then we said we're going to need to
cycle through all the letters in the
array starting with the last one or the
farthest to the right so what we're
going to do is create ourselves a for
loop and I'm going to have I is equal to
and then inside of this I'm going to
have to get the size of number which is
passed into our function and then I'm
going to subtract 2 from it the reason I
do that is because the index is of
course start at 0 and also I want to
avoid coming in contact
with this null character so that's the
reason why we're subtracting two from it
and then I'm going to continue on while
I is greater than or equal to zero and
we're going to decrement I and all of
the code of course is available in a
link in the description for this video
okay then basically what we're going to
do next is we're going to copy the style
that we talked about previously it's
basically going to be let's just say 4
times 8 to the power of 1 plus and we'll
just say 5 times 8 to the power of 0 and
so forth and so on
so to copy that style what we're going
to do is say result plus or equal to and
then we're going to say number and get
the number out of our array that we
passed over inside of here and a
shortcut way to work with this is to
subtract and I'm going to put 0 inside
of here and then I'll be able to
directly multiply times the power of the
base from that we're moving from which
is going to be this guy right here and
then ^ which is this guy right here
which is going to be represented by this
1 and we're going to have to increment
that of course as we go on and then that
is the end of it and then what we need
to do is just go to the power of
increment and naught is all we need to
do pretty simple huh but of course it's
not going to work for hexadecimals but
we'll get to that and ii just want to
keep this nice and simple so i'm going
to say in the base d is equal or equals
the in-phase ton and print that out on
our screen and of course that's going to
be past number which is going to be the
number that was passed inside of here
and the base from that we're moving from
and then the result so in essence this
is going to say the number you passed in
that was in the base of let's just say 8
equals our final result in the base of
10 and that's what we're going to print
out on our screen and then on top of
that let's say we want to return the
result and there we go and I just have
all of the code
I had used previously in the last part
of the tutorial that's going to convert
from the base and we're going to use
that just to check to make sure that we
have the right answers and then let's
just continue working with the base of
eight just like we had before so what
I'm going to do here is just create a
character array I'm going to call this
number to convert is equal to let's say
74 and put it in quotes of course and
then what we can do is say base to
decimal that is what I called it isn't
it yup base to decimal and we're going
to pass in number to convert and it's
base eight and we're also going to pass
in the size of it so I'm just going to
put size of number to convert compile it
and execute and here we can see our
results previously and if we
specifically look right here 60 in base
8 is equal to 74
so that was 60 as a base 10 is equal to
in base eight 74 and you can see here 74
in base 8 equals 60 in base 10 so our
program work only problem is it's not
going to work for exa decimal so let's
think about exactly what are we going to
have to do to make this work for
hexadecimal one things we have to think
about is exactly how key codes work
because we're going to have to convert
letters A through F into actual numbers
so what we're gonna do here first off is
I'm going to just figure out exactly
what a as I know what it is but I'm just
doing this just to explain exactly my
thought process and we could go through
here and we could say a and then let's
say that we also want to do an upper
case a and figure out how we're going to
handle that if they send that in and
then just for the heck of it let's also
come in here and go b c d e and f and we
can just put those inside of there as
well because what I'm thinking I'm going
to do is set these for lowercase because
that makes sense to me and then we're
going to have to change that to a and
this to B C D D and F okay if I'll save
that compile execute and here we can see
that the lowercase a is 97 B is 98 99
100 102 so what I'm thinking I'm going
to do is to convert any A's that are set
in to
the number 10 I'm just going to take the
97 and if they send me an uppercase
letter A I'm going to convert it into a
lowercase and then let's subtract 87
from it so exactly how are we gonna do
that well let's just jump back up here
and I'm going to just change the program
that we already created which is base to
decimal so let's think about exactly
what are we going to need to change well
the for-loop isn't going to change at
all that's basically still going to work
for us one thing however we are going to
need to change is this guy right here so
let's think about exactly how we're
going to change that let's get rid of
this first thing we're going to need to
do is check to see if they sent me an
alpha character and to do that I just go
is alpha and then I'm going to go number
I and I'm going to perform a little bit
different result here a different
calculation if they sent me a letter
instead of a number which I'm used to
working with well then what I need to do
is convert my letter into the right
character code and then subtract 87 so
for example like I mentioned before
convert a lowercase letter a into 10
along with all the other letters we
might come in contact with so I'm just
going to call this character code and
I'm going to do an integer cast and then
I'm going to go to lower and then I'm
just going to take the number actually
the letter in this situation from our
array and then I'm going to subtract 87
from it because that's going to work for
me then basically I'm going to copy this
exact style here except I'm going to
make one little change so there's a
result just like before but instead of
this guy right here what I'm going to do
is put my character code inside of there
because that's a number I want to work
with everything else can stay exactly
the same it's also going to make sense
to throw an else statement inside of
here like this this is going to work for
everything it's not a letter and I can
leave my power of outside of both of
them since they're both going to need it
and that's it that's the only changes I
need to make let's come down here and
see if it actually worked for us so
let's change this to 3 see and then
we're going to have number to convert
and then we're going to put 16 we can
get rid of this because this is no
longer useful for us and that's it
that's the only thing we need to change
and then if we calculate all this out
you can see that everything worked out
just like we did previously 60 in base
16 is going to be equal to 3 see here we
s3c and we wanted it to be converted
into a base-10 which is exactly what
happened so that is how we convert from
all the other different bases back to
base 10 hopefully you like that because
you guys asked me for homework all the
time in the next part of the tutorial
I'm going to continue talking about how
we can work with binary numbers and a
whole bunch of other things please leave
any questions or comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
