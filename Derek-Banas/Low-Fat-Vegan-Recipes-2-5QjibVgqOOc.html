2 of my low-fat vegan recipes today I'm
going to show you how to make no fried
refried beans zero fat tortilla zero fat
Mexican rice and polenta with mushroom
sauce and I have a lot to make so let's
get into it to make your nonfat refried
beans you're first going to soak three
cups of pinto beans overnight and then
you're gonna get a whole onion and it
doesn't really matter how much you chop
it up then get yourself a half of a
Lupino remove all the seeds and throw
that into the pot and then we're going
to be adding nine cups of water you'll
be boiling this for one to
one-and-a-half hours at 50% on your
stovetop and then add two tablespoons of
garlic and you're ready to go now it's
time to make the no fat tortillas and
I'm gonna start off with 2 cups of white
flour you can use whole wheat flour but
I just like the white flour considerably
better every one so I'll switch it
around do whatever you'd like of course
and then to that you're gonna add 1 and
1/2 teaspoons of regular old baking
powder and then you're going to add 1
teaspoon of salt and you can use pretty
much whatever salt you have on hand and
then you're going to blend this up until
everything is very well mixed and then
you'll get 3/4 of a cup of warm water
and slowly add that in as its mixing and
then when it's done it's gonna look
exactly like this I then remove it and
put it into another pan and you can see
exactly what it looks like you might
want to knead it a little bit here and
there and then you'll get a dish cloth
that has been rinsed in warm water and
place it over the dough and let it sit
for about 2 hours and now it's time to
get back the refried beans we're gonna
add one teaspoon of black pepper and
you're gonna drain about 3/4 of the
water that is in the beans of course
this is after they've been cooked and
put into the food processor and then
we're gonna add at 1 teaspoon of salt or
2 teaspoons it really depends upon your
taste and then the final ingredient is
ground cumin we're gonna put 3/4 of a
teaspoon of ground cumin and this is
really the refried bean taste that you
taste and then we're going to blend this
until everything is very smooth and then
after everything is all blended up you
can just warm this up on the stove and
it will be ready to eat and now it's
time to cook the tortillas I took all
that dough and broke it into 8 even
pieces and then I roll
those out with a rolling pin just like
this and then on my stove in a pan I set
the pan to 60% and then I'm gonna throw
those tortillas in there and whenever
they start to puff up I'm gonna push
them down and then I'm gonna flip them
until they are done and now to finish up
our meal I'm gonna get 1 cup of rice I
have a little bit of water in there and
this pan is set on high and I'm just
gonna stir it in there just to get to
the rice a little bit covered with the
water then I'm going to add in 1
tablespoon of minced garlic and then 1/2
of a teaspoon of salt and then 1/2 of a
teaspoon of ground cumin and then I'm
going to stir this until the rice is
completely covered with all the spices
and looks kind of golden the idea here
is to have sort of a dry rice and then
after that's all stirred up I'm going to
add 1/2 of a cup of tomato sauce and
then one and a half cups of vegetable
stock however during the cooking process
you're probably gonna have to add in
another half a cup and then one
tablespoon of cilantro is gonna finish
off everything and then I just stir that
up and then turn the stove top down to
20% and put the lid on and let it cook
for 20 to 25 minutes and after 25
minutes your Spanish rice is ready and
here is everything when it's ready to go
and now I'm gonna make the polenta with
mushroom sauce to make the mushroom
sauce I'm gonna get 1/4 of a cup of
water 10 ounces of sliced mushrooms and
1/2 of an onion and add that to a pan I
have 1/4 of a cup of dried mushrooms
that I soaked in warm water 3 cups of
warm water I'm going to remove those
mushrooms and chop those up and then I'm
going to add those also to the pan and
then I'll add 2 tablespoons of minced
garlic as well as 3 tablespoons of
either liquid aminos or soy sauce and
then we're going to constantly stir that
for approximately 5 minutes until it's
done now the vegetables have been
cooking for about 4 minutes and I'm
going to get the three cups of reserved
liquid that had the dried mushrooms in
them and on to that I'm going to add 5
tablespoons of cornstarch I'm then going
to take a whisk and I'm gonna whisk that
until all of the lumps are gone just
like this you want to make sure you get
all those lumps out of there and this is
gonna act as a thickening agent then I'm
going to add that to my mushrooms and my
other vegetables and of course I'm going
to whisk that until it gets a
Recker brown--color you're gonna know it
when you see it it's gonna take right
around 40 seconds 50 seconds and then
we're also going to be cooking our
polenta the basic cooking recipe for
polenta is get four cups of water and
boil it and then you're gonna add 1 cup
of polenta and 1 teaspoon of salt and
you're just gonna stir it like crazy
till it's done well I hope you guys
