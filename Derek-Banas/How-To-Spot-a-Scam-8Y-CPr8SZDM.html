show you exactly how to spot a scam or
I'm gonna go over some of the most
common advanced techniques used to
separate you from your money almost
every single night in the local news
they talk about different scams and the
people that fall for them and here I'm
going to specifically show you some of
the more advanced scams that I'm seeing
and I'm specifically targeting a lot of
those people that are out there pushing
gold and real estate investing on
television so I recently contacted both
of these groups by phone to analyze
exactly the sales techniques that they
are using and it just so happens that
they are the exact same techniques that
are often used by scam artists it
basically comes down to this anytime a
salesperson tries to sell you through
emotions rather than facts you know
you're probably being scammed and I'm
gonna here cover all of the techniques
that are used to sell using emotions so
do these techniques work well these
techniques that you're gonna see right
here have been able to convince US
troops to commit treason during the
Korean War helped Bernie Madoff steal
billions of dollars convinced normal
citizens that it is right to torture
people with repeated electric shocks
also they are used to inadvertently
convince people to commit suicide and
almost every politician uses these
techniques to get elected first I'm
going to go over one of the most
important techniques called the yes set
if someone ever starts out a sales call
by asking you to answer in the
affirmative you are witnessing the yes
set psychology researchers have actually
found that if you get a person to answer
affirmatively
to topics that relate that's very
important seven to eight times you are
almost guaranteed to get a yes to
whatever you ultimately wanted them to
say yes to whether it's by a TV or a car
or some gold or whatever it is and in
fact every successful sales script I
have ever written starts out with the SS
so make sure you watch out for this
common trick then we come to the
scarcity principle people are much more
motivated by the thought of losing
something than by the thought of gaining
something of equal value this is where
the scarcity principle comes in so when
a salesperson uses phrases like now is
the time to make a move or real estate
prices have bottomed out or prices on
real estate can only go up or this is a
limited time offer or we only have ten
left they are trying to throw you into a
stressful situation with these words
because they know if you're under stress
you will stop thinking logically they
also know that human beings associate
value to items
that are scarce ask yourself why is a
baseball card worth a penny six years
ago now worth millions one simple word
scarcity in regards to competitive
scarcity corporate stores love to create
a powerful enticement to buy by creating
what is called competitive scarcity it
turns out that we want items most when
we are in competition for them people
every year in fact trample others to get
the special deal at Walmart why because
they are left to stew for hours
surrounded by competitors and then once
the door is open they have actually
claimed that they were so caught up in
the moment that nothing would keep them
from that $20 DVD player and then we get
to the authority principle and by the
way can someone explain to me why
exactly it is a great time to buy gold
when gold is at all-time highs I do not
understand this I actually posed this to
a sales lady whenever she was trying to
convince me to buy gold over the
telephone this is basically how it went
and I do not believe anything she says
here is true by the way she says have
you ever heard of Warren Buffett and I
say yes this is basically how she starts
off the call so she's using the S set so
I already know I'm dealing with a pretty
good salesperson then she goes on to say
the next man is also a billionaire and
she actually influences and makes sure
that I understand it it's a billionaire
not a millionaire and then she goes on
its to say but you may not know of him
have you ever heard of George Soros I
say yes playing along with her yes and I
do by the way know who George Soros is
she then goes on to say would you say
that these men know more about investing
than yourself I continue on yes
well they and numerous other
billionaires recently invested heavily
in gold what you have to understand is
in times in which there's a great deal
of uncertainty people tend to follow
those whom they consider successful this
is what is known as the authority
principle if someone starts stating that
very successful people are acting in a
certain way get them to prove it beyond
a shadow of a doubt if they can't
disregard that information did you ever
wonder why so many people ignored the
warning signs with Bernie Madoff the
reason why is he sat on a governing
Commission that was responsible for the
policing of the financial system people
simply assumed he would never do
anything wrong since he was on this
board people also like people like
themselves
there are numerous scammers looking to
take advantage of those that they sit
with at church people again assume that
Bob
Church wouldn't rip me off the same as
being done within ethnic groups and this
this has been done for years and years
and years
the reason scammers gather there is
because they assume they will have an
easier time selling to people that look
like them and they are right most of
Bernie Madoff so investors were actually
Jewish just like himself also understand
that just because a friend tells you to
trust someone does not mean that you
shouldn't do your homework maybe your
friend fell for a scam your friend may
never knowingly hurt you but never count
out the fact that they have been mislead
themselves and I just want to point out
you should never invest with someone
just because you like them personally so
how exactly do you avoid these scams
when your making decision that requires
you to invest any type of money get
opinions from numerous different people
if you were pushed to make a decision by
any of these people leave immediately
also check on the credentials of those
people that you meet there are numerous
ways to track whether people are ethical
within the financial system online let's
definitely check those out
also ask for referrals of the customers
that these people have and actually
contact them and if they steer you away
from facts at any point in time during
the sales presentation believe so why
exactly do people fall for scams because
we live in an extremely complicated
environment we use shortcuts to make
nearly every decision our mind flashes
back to previous events instantly when a
decision is to be made and we act
accordingly based off of those previous
results like I've talked about in
previous indirect hypnosis videos and
articles familiarity in the presentation
of information speaks more truth than
the facts presented if you present
information using a person's chosen what
they're called meta programs it will be
much more inclined to believe every
single thing you're saying and if you
want more information in regards to meta
program I'd provide a link here on the
screen think of it this way we can
easily fall into the habit of going to
the same restaurant or store because it
is familiar and you know what you will
get there we develop these habits
because our brain likes access to
shortcut solutions to problems hence you
feel hungry you go to McDonald's what
many people don't know is that we have
numerous habits that we are also unaware
of many of which can be manipulated to
get us to spend a lot of money that we
shouldn't so you may ask are these the
only ways that people are scammed no by
no means are they however I do cover
pretty much every single
that scammers operate in a tutorial
series called the advanced sales
technique and no I'm not trying to get
you to buy it it's completely free and
it's available in a link here on the
screen and if you'd like to see more
information in regards to the principles
that I talked about in this tutorial
they are also covered in the advanced
sales techniques videos have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below weather-wise till
