my JavaScript video tutorial today I'm
going to focus a lot on the document
object model because I've received a ton
of questions from you guys I'm going to
go over a small bit of code but I'm
going to do it in ultra detail so that
you totally get it now to understand
this code you have to understand what
the document object model is the Dom as
I'm going to refer to it from now on
allows you to access all of the
different objects that lie within your
HTML code every web page is considered
to be of the document object and every
tag it is referred to as a node inside
of the daunt
javascript can be used to manipulate all
of these elements whether they lie
between tags or they do not however it's
better to have them lie between tags by
simply referring to them as their
identification name and that is the way
I prefer to do it what you also have to
understand is the parent-child
relationship which I have here on the
screen and kind of a mangled format but
basically you can think of the document
being the parent and all other elements
that lie within it to be children of the
parent document also if you created a
div element inside of your web page and
then you had children elements like
maybe bold tags and so forth inside of
it those would be the children of the
parent div so hopefully understand that
and you then can refer to all of the
different child elements inside of this
parent element in numerous different
ways however I prefer giving this child
element an ID name and then referring to
it as that however in this tutorial
you're going to see a bunch of different
ways to refer to those different guys
first what I'm going to do here though
and this is just basic everything you've
seen in all of the previous tutorials
and I have a link to the previous
tutorial in which I went into how to
manipulate the Dom using IDs I'm again
going to do that here but I'm going to
show you a bunch of other different
things along the way I'm going to create
a span which is sort of like an inline
div and I'm going to call it span e^x
and I'm going to say on click I'm going
to want to call a function called edit
node text and I'm going to pass along
two properties one is going to be span
II X
which is the name of this ID and I'm
also going to pass along nu X is here
basically what I'm going to do is I'm
going to force this new text to appear
inside of the span whenever somebody
clicks on it
and I'm going to put change this text
inside of here and then a nice break tag
and that is all that I'm going to put
down inside of the body of this program
now I'm going to create the actual
function called edit note text and I'm
going to walk you through exactly what
I'm doing here so I'm going to jump up
inside of here and I'm going to create
the function and it's going to be called
edit node text and I'm going to create
two parameters it's going to accept and
they're going to be those two guys right
there and now I'm going to create a
reference to a node that's going to lie
inside of this document and call it node
and I'm going to refer to this span down
here by saying document which is
referring to the webpage itself this is
the shortcut way to gain access to that
I'm going to use the function get
element by ID and I'm going to use the
ID that was passed to this guy this is
going to allow me to continually refer
to this span item down here just simply
by referring to node now what I'm going
to do I'm going to say wow there are
children inside of this span down here I
want them removed so I'm going to call
the remove child function on node first
child so this is going to jump through
this span element and remove all of the
elements that lie within it all of the
children elements that lie within it
like I said going to show you additional
things then after that guy is all
cleared up I'm going to call Penn child
which is another JavaScript function and
I'm also going to call create text node
because if you want to insert text
inside of another node that lies inside
of HTML or the document object model
itself you have to call this create text
node function and I'm going to say I
want the text that they passed along to
be included into it you just have to
understand that not only as a tag
considered a node but any blocks of text
within it are also considered nodes
whether they have an identification
number assigned to them or not so that
is some pretty
simple code that we have here and if you
look here on the right side of the
screen you'll see change this text which
is what I have there originally but
you're going to see that this is going
to be changed to new text is here by
calling this function up here simply
want to click on it and there it is it
changed so that is how you would delete
the text node that was originally inside
of there which is here you would do that
with these two lines of code right there
and then this is how you would also add
this new text inside of there kay now
you could also do numerous other
different things with this guy so you
could also go document get by ID and
then the identification number assigned
to that spam node and then change the
styling like I showed you previously
like let's say we want it to be red and
you can use any of the different CSS
properties that are available I'm just
going to copy this right up to that
point paste that in there and let's be
wacky let's change a whole bunch of them
I'm also going to change positioning to
fixed and I'm also now that I have it
fixed positioning I need to tell it
where to position itself I'm going to
say a hundred pixels from the top of the
screen and I'm also going to say 300
pixels from the left side of the screen
so I can change all those different
things
if I jump reload it it actually doesn't
appear on the screen because it's over
on the other side here but if I drag
this guy out you'll see it shows up
right there new text is here so and the
text is read and it's positioned in a
weird position so those are all the
weird little things you can do with this
guy and now to show you some other
different things just so you get
acquainted with the other different
functions that are available for
manipulating the Dom inside of
JavaScript I'm going to create a div
element down here and this div element
is going to have an identification
number of div e^x and I'm going to say
on click and I'm just going to call a
different function that I'm going to
create and as I create it of course I'm
going to explain what it is all doing
yeah here I'm going to say Divi X so
that it knows the identification number
and I'm going to say new text and if
then I'm going to throw some children
elements inside of here and close off
the div now I have to create this guy
here the Edit node text function I'm
going to show you some of the more
complicated ways to edit this code and
then your
understand why I like to use ident ID
numbers to manipulate stuff instead of
paying specific attention to children
and so forth and so on so I have to
create function edit ID in here again
I'm going to copy this up here call this
node I like that and let's say that I
decide that I want to change a value in
the first child of this div element
that's exactly how I would do it and
then I could simply come in here and say
node and change the value for it with
node value equal to new text and you can
see here that I'm I clicked on that I
click on anywhere inside of this div you
can see that new text in div showed up
right there
in the position of the first child
that's why it shows up before some bold
text some bold text is the first child
inside of it and you could also do last
child like that reload it and now new
text in div shows up in the last
position inside of this div I could also
willy-nilly delete these different
little guys inside here by referring to
them like for example if I come in here
after node and say remove child and then
say node dot child nodes index of zero
I'll say and you can see that the bold
deleted because that was the zero index
for that div change that to to reload
and you can see in this situation what
it actually deleted was the break
statement if you scroll down here by
plugging to inside of there it knocked
the break statement out of it and you're
more than welcome to download this code
there's a link in the underbar to play
around with these different ways to
manipulate these different guys but I'm
also going to come in here change that
back to zero just for the heck of it and
I'm going to pay reference to the child
node in the second index position and
I'm going to say that a node value
should be equal to new text and what the
heck why don't I show you how to create
a new tag element inside of here call it
new node is equal to document dot and in
this situation you call create element
if you want to insert for example like a
horizontal rule and then you have to
come in here and say node dot append
child and call new node for the guy that
you just
created and this is going to create this
new child node for the horizontal roll
and this one's going to actually insert
it you can see there's a horizontal roll
and you can also see here where I placed
this new text in a second index area
within this div see right there new text
and div right like that actually clicked
on it which is call it causing
additional horizontal rules to actually
keep popping up and the text is changing
because as I'm doing this it's changing
the value of this child right here so
that's the reason why you're getting
sort of wacky results right there and of
course if you'd like to create a text
node that you want to insert inside of
here instead of using the create element
you're going to use something called
create text node so I'm going to create
something called random text node is
equal to document dot create text node
let's just say and then if I want to
actually insert it I need to call again
the append child function and text node
inside of it so the takeaway here is if
you want to insert some sort of element
like a horizontal roll or some other
type of tag you would use the create
element to define which element you want
to put inside of there which tag if you
want to insert a text node you would
first create it with the create text
node function inside of JavaScript and
in both situations you would actually
insert the new node by calling the
function called append node and putting
the name of inside of there and you can
see I'm random get shot in there again
if you want to define what order you
want it to be placed inside of there
you're going to have to use child nodes
and input an index value inside of it or
of course you could choose to use first
child or last child so there is what I
hope is a better explanation of exactly
how the dot document object model works
it can't get confusing but I don't think
it's confusing at all if you just refer
to everything using IDs this part yes
can get confusing and you definitely
wouldn't want to base a very very large
project on using functions such as this
because as you saw previously with the
how things are changing based off of me
clicking and child nodes are changing
and so forth and so on
but it is good to know these functions
exist in case you do need them if you
have any questions or comments leave
them below otherwise the next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
