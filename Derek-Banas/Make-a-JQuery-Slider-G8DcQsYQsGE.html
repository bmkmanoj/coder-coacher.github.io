tutorial on how to make a jQuery product
slider like you see here on the screen
now of course you're gonna have more
than just one product over and over
again I'm going to show you how quick
and easily you can design this guy and
use it on any type of website first what
you want to do is go to jQuery UI
dot-com and we're gonna use some jQuery
UI tools but I'm gonna show you how to
use them in really cool ways like I just
showed you there first what we're gonna
do is go right here where it says rich
effects in UI widgets and click browse
then under widgets you're gonna click on
slider and then if you want a slider
like I'm using that all the code is
underneath of this video you can use it
however you'd like I decided to use the
simple scroll bar that you see here on
the screen and then make changes to it
of course you're not going to want to
just have one two three four I mean this
is just boring so that's why I'm gonna
show you how to take this really boring
thing and make it really cool and then
on top of that of course you can switch
and change and get all kinds of
different little cool tools that are
available up here by changing the
overall theme if you haven't checked out
the jQuery UI you should definitely do
so but I decide to be kind of boring
because I wanted a lot of control over
what I did so I'm choosing the theme
overcast and then I'm gonna come down
here where it says view source and click
on that guy and I'm gonna come in here
and I'm gonna select everything that's
underneath today whole way down to here
where it says end mo and copy it and
open up little text editing device I'm
using text Wrangler I get asked that all
of the time and I'm gonna copy and paste
in my basic HTML stuff that's just
boring I don't feel I have to go over
and then scroll way down at the bottom
and close off the HTML section just to
make sure I don't forget to do it and
then scroll back up and then we're gonna
go back into jQuery again click the back
button alright now what we're gonna do
is we want to actually get that styling
so I want to come over here and go
explore the theme gallery and then
because I chose overcast I'm gonna find
overcast here on the left side of my
screen and here it is so I'm gonna click
on download then what I'm gonna do to
make sure that I get the least amount of
stuff possible I'm gonna click on select
all components I'm gonna deselect so now
I'm just gonna get the slider part so
click in here and what it's going to do
is it's just going to get what's needed
for the slider to work then I'm going to
click on download and everything's been
downloaded so I'm gonna come over here
double click on this guy open up this
zip file and it opens up down here I'm
gonna select everything that came with
it and close that guy then I'm gonna
jump over into the folder where I'm
gonna have everything be and I'm gonna
paste that inside of here and then I'm
going to open up index.html which came
inside of there and this is gonna save
me a little bit of time so I'm gonna be
able to come in here and just grab what
I want to need here so I'm gonna select
this guy up here where it's pointing to
all of the different information that
I'm gonna need to make this slider work
jump back over into here and right after
title I'm gonna paste that in you can
see what it does here basically it just
points it the overcast themes and then
it also points at the minimal amount of
jQuery I need for the slider to work and
all that informations right inside of
there so that saves me a lot of time and
I'm gonna get back to styling this here
in a second just gonna scroll through
make sure everything's set up properly
and right here after script on the
screen I'm gonna close the head section
and then down here is gonna be all the
information that we're gonna be playing
with so I have to create a body section
containing all that let me get rid of
this extra whitespace that shows up and
then jump down here and close off the
body all right so now everything's all
set up and if we save this we can
actually see what its gonna look like
and there you can see there's the slider
it's all ready for us to be able to use
all the stylings on there so now I just
have to correct the styling one of the
things I want to do is I want to use a
custom google web font like I've used in
the past what I want to use specifically
it's called PT sans so I'm just gonna
click on that you can see PT Sam shows
up and this is available at google.com
forward slash web fonts really cool then
I specifically want the bold version of
it so I'm going to click on quick use
and then I already have normal and bold
selected so that's cool so I'm going to
come down here to this link and select
this link then jump back over into my
working file where I have everything set
up and then right after script I'm going
to paste this in here and that's all I
need to do and now I can use that Google
font that I like so much all right now
let's start getting into the real coding
part of the website now if we look at
the menu as it is you can see here that
it is way way way too wide so I
definitely want to shrink down the
overall size of this guy so that's not a
problem all I need to do is I'm gonna
scroll down where the actual content is
and see that everything is surrounded by
a div with a class named demo so what I
want to do is come in here and edit the
size of demos so scroll back up into the
CSS
part of this and I'm gonna play the dot
demo because it is a class 'close hat
off and then I'm gonna find a width
equal to 480 pixels because that's what
works for me that's all I had to do I
just file save that jump over here
reload it and you can see that it is all
nice and tight looking really good okay
so I decided that I wanted to have three
basic boxes with everything laid out
inside of them all right so I'm gonna
have an image that's gonna have a border
around it then I'm gonna have the
information on the image or product and
then provide a button for more
information and another button for Add
to Cart so I have to build all of these
different things together so get rid of
that and make it look nice alright so
how am I going to do that well the first
thing I want to do is I want to come
down here and look at scroll content
that is what surrounds all of the
individual little boxes inside of that
nice little guy so the width is going to
have to be big enough to accommodate all
of the scroll content items so that
scroll content items is what surrounds
the outside of each individual thing and
scroll content surrounds all the
individual pieces it's a scroll content
item that's this div and scroll content
is what surrounds everything that you
see here on the screen so you have to
make sure that scroll content is wide
enough to accommodate all of these
individual pieces and also that the
scroll content items are also of the
proper size well after doing some math
and knowing how wide all of my contents
gonna be being that I'm gonna have 12
individual items and inside of there
instead of 20 which is setup right now
I'm going to change this to 1930 and I
also want my background color to be
white instead of gray so I'm gonna put
background FFF so down in scroll content
item which is what I need
fix I'm gonna change my overall width of
each one of these items to 150 pixels
and also I'm going to scroll down here
real fast and get rid of a lot of these
okay so I said I wanted to use 12
instead of 20 so I'm just gonna delete
them
this by the way is where you're gonna
put all of your content for all of your
individual things and we'll get back to
that in a second so I decided that my
content needs to be honor and 50 pixels
wide and 215 pixels tall so that's
really easy now that's gonna fit in
there real nicely and I also decided
that I don't want the font size because
I'm obviously not gonna use these
gigantic fonts so I'm gonna put in font
bold I'm going to make it 11 pixels I
want to use that nice
font that I had so peachy sands then I'm
gonna put Arial in and sans-serif
finally as potential fonts but I want to
use inside of that of course spell Arial
right and then on top of that I want to
make the background white and I also
want to make my border zero pixels
because I don't want it to show up I
also decided that I want to have a
margin right of zero pixels so that
everything fits in here a little bit
nicer now let's come down here and start
editing what's actually going to be
inside of these boxes mainly an image
and three text files okay so we're in
the scroll content item area that's
where we're gonna be making our changes
so I'm going to give myself some room so
I can find out exactly where everything
is and the first thing that I'm gonna
want to do here is to find a new div
that's going to contain my image for my
product I'm gonna call it class is equal
to prod image inside of there and I'm
gonna go image and a source and I have
the point at where the image is it's
gonna be an images folder so let's go
over here and then you can see that
there is no images folder but I have
that image saved over here right inside
of there is a little oil can so I'm just
gonna copy this guy of course you're
gonna have more than just one image
inside of here if you're gonna have
multiple products and I'm gonna paste
the item inside of there I'm gonna get
the image name for this product
copy close this down again and paste
that inside of there and it's a painting
file I'm also going to define a class
for this individual product image and
there it is the product and then close
off my image tag and then close off the
div that's gonna surround that image
well then I need to list the product
name class is equal to and I'm going to
call it prod name close that off and
then I want people to be able to click
on it to see the product so H reference
is equal to and I'm just gonna put in a
hash symbol right now until I'm actually
loading multiple products and I use this
just right to gallon oil hand-operated
waste can and it's a weird thing to use
but something I had on hand and then
closed off that div and then I have to
create my more info as well as my Add to
Cart buttons and also add hovering
effects which I'm going to do here in a
minute so what do I do I'm going to
create another div and class name it's
gonna be equal to prod more info but for
button and then creating a each
reference
equal to again just throw a hash symbol
in there for temporary storage and if I
been more info and close that off and
then close off that div and then I'm
actually gonna just copy this and then
it's gonna be prod add two clerks cuz
this is all gonna go into my new
shopping cart WordPress theme that I'm
developing and your missus they add to
and just so I know what this div is come
up here and copy this and put in on
comment and of scroll content item so
that when I'm looking at this later I
know what I'm looking at and if we file
save it let's just go look and see what
we got here it's gonna be a mess because
there's no CSS style you can see right
there there's that guy and then
nothing's really lined up but pretty
much everything is in the proper order
so we know that we're going to write
white and I also know that everything's
starting to line up horizontally so
that's also cool so let's close that go
in here and make this look perfect so
I'm gonna scroll back into my CSS
content and then scroll down to the
bottom of it right here where it says
style where they're closing off the
Style section and I want to do some
styling on the product image so broad
image close that off and this is going
to be the border that goes around the
image so I want to say border is equal
to one pixel I want it to be solid and I
want it to be a grey and that's just a
gray color that I remember because of
those numbers are quite 'rememorable and
I want to find a height for it of 135
pixels and width of 135 pixels that's
all the styling I need for that guy
let's file save it see what I did reload
it now you can see there's a border and
the image is centered inside of it but
not across the top so I'm gonna fix that
now what I'm going to do is zero in on
the image class and it is called product
I like that and I'm gonna give it a
height of 125 pixels and a width of 125
pixels and then if I wanted to be
centered I'm gonna give it a padding of
5 pixels and that's going to Center it
because the difference between 125 135
is 10 and then if you put it on on the
top right left side and the bottom that
equals out to 5 pixels and you can see
it's now centered inside of there so now
I'm gonna do the styling on the actual
product name itself let's scroll up it's
going to be prod named because that's
the name of the class that I defined put
this inside of there and I
position it relative relative to where
it is right now and from the left I'm
gonna move it to the left side of the
screen if I want to do that I have to
give it a negative number so I'm gonna
make it six pixels and then from the top
I'm gonna move it downwards 15 pixels
and then while I'm at it I'm just gonna
copy this and do the styling that I need
to do on the link itself because it is a
link inside of a div and if I want to
get rid of the underline just go
text-decoration:none and to make this
more interactive well we just show it
while we're doing it and reload it you
can see that it is indeed pretty
centered underneath of this but now all
of my Add to Cart more informations into
way so we got to go in there and correct
that I'm gonna go prod more info but
which is the name of the class that's
going to surround that link and I'm
going to change its background color to
five three five three five three which
is a grayish color also and I'm gonna
define the height for it to be 17 pixels
the width to these 61 pixels and padding
- top so there's the centered inside of
the button area of four pixels I'm gonna
position it relative to where it is and
I'm gonna move it 25 pixels down because
it's encroaching on the other stuff
reload and there you can see is the
button so I just got to put the button
in here in a way that's gonna make the
text show up I got to do pretty much the
same thing I did before in here target
the a tag off there and then I'm gonna
go text decoration change it to none
and I'm also going to change the color
of the text to white and then I'm also
gonna add some styling for whenever this
guy is hovered over so right after them
gonna put a call in and I'm gonna type
in hover and whenever the mouse hovers
over it I'm gonna change the background
color to that 666 thing we had before
reload it see the buttons in there and
it's also changing color whenever we
hover over top of it so now I got to do
is fix add to cart and I'm pretty much
gonna be doing identical things with
this so what I'm actually gonna do is
get all of this highlight it and copy it
paste that inside of there and then the
div that surrounds the Add to Cart guy
is add to word but so then I'm just
going to copy that paste that in there
paste that in there then I wanted this
to be
blue to sort of match the site that
you're eventually gonna say a and B five
and this guy's gonna be a little bit
bigger to accommodate the fact that it
says Add to Cart so I added ten more
pixels to it and from the top as you can
see here it's not quite that high up so
I'm gonna make it say four pixels from
the top of where it is right now and
from the left I need to move it over a
good bit more so let's say 75 or 65
pixels everything else I'm gonna leave
the same let's see how it works huh
reload and here you can see there's the
buttons all lined up there's the text
lined up and there's all this guy lined
up so now if I want more than one of
these to show up it's quite easy to do
so I just come down here right where
scroll content item is and I copy that
and then if I want 12 of them to show up
I'm just gonna go over top of this paste
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and there we
have our little scroll bar and I'm
looking at it and everything looks
perfect so you can see everything's
lined up here on the left the margins
are the same down the center and you can
scroll through it and now it's just up
to you to come in here and put more than
just one image and more than one links
to different products leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
