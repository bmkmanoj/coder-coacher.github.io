html5 help tutorial series and today
we're gonna stick with Candis if you
didn't watch part one definitely watch
that before this because I'm just gonna
jump right in there and you might not
understand what I'm doing here so this
is all of the information from the last
tutorial and actually I slipped
something into this guy just to see if
you would have noticed from the last
tutorial this time we're gonna cover
lines paths orcs and text but you may
notice that this should actually be a
circle but it's showing up as a simple
ellipse why is that well the reason why
is whenever you you define the height
and the width like we did here based off
of the fact that canvas was defined with
a width and a height of 500 and 400
whenever you then style this inside of
canvas using style dot height what it
actually does is stretch it are you
surprised nobody caught on to that you
guys normally catch on everything I do
I'm gonna show you how to fix that first
what I'm gonna do is save this
background is white just to make things
a little bit easier to see and then I'm
gonna show you a proper way inside of
canvas to define the width and the
height it's real simple just go like
this and let's just say we want a 600
pixels like we did before and then just
change this height jump over here and
now you can see that it is a perfect
circle and if you can't see this is an
HD video feel free to watch it full
screen but for the most part
everything's gonna be pretty big here
another thing that I'm gonna do that I
forgot to tell you about last time is
I'm gonna define the border for this guy
and how you do that meaning the canvas
itself what we're gonna be drawing
inside of and you just go style dot
border is equal to and you can define
anything you would define in basic HTML
so let's just say we want to do dotted
you could also do solid - double groove
Ridge inset outset you don't know what
any of those mean you can check out my
CSS tutorial but you guys probably do
and we're just gonna do that and we're
gonna reload this and now we're gonna
have the whole entire canvas inside of
dotted lines here on the screen on the
right side of the screen and what I'm
gonna do because we're working on a
brand new tutorial I'm gonna delete out
everything I did last time so we don't
need that right down to this point right
here so delete and everything from this
points gonna be all brand new we have to
of course call canvas draw one just like
we did before because we're gonna be
drawing on the canvas and this is how
you do it and if you want to draw a line
or a path you have to follow that with a
function called
in path real simple that's it you just
need to remember that anytime you're
trying to draw those that you need to
start with that function then if we want
to also define say our width meaning the
width of the line that we're gonna be
drawing just type in line width and all
this codes available in a link
underneath the video if you want to get
it that's all you need to do if you want
to be able to change that width and then
also if we wanted to change like the
stroke style meaning the color stroke
stop and then let's say we want to make
it purple and that's how you would do
that and then anytime you want to draw a
line or a path inside of canvas for
html5 what you have to do is you have to
actually move your pointer to the
position where you want to start drawing
in the function just like a pencil onto
a paper before you can start to draw so
let's say we want to start drawing
starting at the point 25 pixels to the
right and 25 pixels downwards well okay
we got our pencil in position and now we
need to start drawing if we want to draw
to another point from this point right
here all we got to do is go line two and
let's say we want to draw to the 300
pixel mark no we just do it like that
and then finally if we want to draw said
line we just go canvas draw one again
and type in stroke you're gonna see the
line draw and there it is draw it right
there on screen and you can change all
the line widths and all those other
different things there's not really that
many other different things you can do
with lines course you can continue with
line drawing just coffee this guy you
want to draw from this point here to
another point no problem let's say you
want to go from 300 in back up to 25 and
there you go you just drew that line
inside of there now if we want to change
these ending points for these lines
there's a couple different things that
we can do there okay I'm just draw one
come in here it just has to show up
before stroke is issued and if we want
to define that ending point there's
basically only one but technically
there's three line cap by default it's
called but and it's literally be utt yes
that's what the default is and that's
what you see on the screen is just
basically squared off well you also have
square which is exactly the same as but
except it protrudes a little bit further
out which is kind of strange and the one
that really looks different is round so
we changed that and you can see the
lines here or round it off at the end
and if you want to change these line
join areas function you're gonna use in
that situation come down here you go
line
is equal to and it's mightor which is
just a point by default MIT er and of
course you could also define it as round
and you can see it round it off and you
could also define it as bevel and it
sort of has this cutoff squared off
angle to it and those are all of the
different ways that you can draw paths
and lines however if you want to
automatically take this last drawn line
and connect it to the first point no
canvas draw one and you just type in
closed path reload and it automatically
will close that path off for you
so those are all of the different ways
that you can draw with those now there's
a save feature as well as a restore and
basically what that does is it saves and
restores stroke styles and line widths
and all those different things and just
to save some time what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna actually grab this guy down to
the end let's copy that paste in there
remember beginning path is gonna start
this guy so that's where the new drawing
is going to occur and just so it stands
out I'm gonna change this from 10 to 15
and I'm gonna change this to green
change this to 100 in just a 400 350 425
just leave it like that and if we file
save it reload it gonna see it drew this
green on here and it applied the stroke
changes as well as the width changes
that we defined both here right there
and right there
when I was talking about the save
feature what you can do is you you want
to save the stroke and the fill z' and
all these other different things inside
of here what we're gonna do is go canvas
draw one copy paste that inner type in
save and it's gonna save in the
background all of the things that you
defined right inside of here and then if
we move down here right before stroke is
called which actually draws everything
on the screen and we go canvas draw
restore and close that off remember it's
gonna restore all the things that were
defined up here you can see it true
exactly the same thing just the
dimensions are different meaning the
beginning points and the endpoints and
all that there's just another little
kind of neat thing that some people
don't know about now there was a lot of
confusion in regards to how arcs work
and I'm actually gonna come in here
clear rectangle and I'm gonna use this
to delete out everything that we just
drew here on the screen just as a kind
of a review on how you clear the canvas
and there you are it's all cleared up
and now I'm gonna focus in on arcs and
the main confusion here is that whenever
you're drawing with the arc fun
you are using radians and not degrees
and I'm going to give it a bunch of
examples so this is understand
understandable but basically the arc
function first you're gonna define the
center point just think of this like a
circle it's the center part of the
circle and that's gonna be X and then Y
X of course is from the left side to the
right and then Y is up and down or in
this situation it's going to be down
from this top point here where the
canvas is being defined then what you
need to define inside of art is the
radius which is just half of the circle
just to keep it simple half of the arc
whatever and then you're gonna define
your start angle and then you're gonna
define your end angle and then you're
gonna define if you want this to be
drawn counter clockwise or not if you
choose to draw out your arc clockwise
well that's a default so you don't need
to worry about that but if you want it
to be drawn counterclockwise you're
gonna have to put true inside of there
and now I'm gonna show you a whole bunch
of different examples okay just like
before then we got to get rid of this
guy and use canvas draw again and there
we go just put arcs inside there so you
can say all right if you want to start
drawing an arc again just like we did
before with lines you're gonna go begin
path and that's it now if you want to
draw a circle for example remember we're
using radians and not degrees I'm gonna
show you an example on how to use
degrees if you prefer to use degrees
let's say we want to start 300 pixels
from the right 300 pixels from the top
and what I'm talking about here is the
canvas 200 radius and I want to start at
the zero radians and then 2 times math
call the math function inside of
JavaScript and then false I don't want
this drawn counterclockwise and you're
gonna see here in a second exactly how
that works itself out and just like we
did with lines we're gonna make a call
to stroke file save it reload it and you
can see it's ruie perfect circle on the
screen mainly because inside of radians
this is the zero point as well as two
times pi is that exact same point and
here I'm going to give me an example if
you wanted to actually show this based
off of using degrees all right so let's
go to three to draw so let's say we want
to draw in 90 degrees well if you want
to convert 90 degrees to radians let's
just call this radiant
to draw well all you'd have to do is
pass it inside of here math dot pi
divided by 180 times to agree to draw
right like that and then what we're
gonna do is copy Radian to draw right
like that and inside of here we're gonna
paste that variable inside of there
reload and you can see this is the zero
part and it's Rou ninety degrees down to
this part right inside of there so if
you want to use degrees instead of using
radians that's perfectly fine and if we
change this guy to true I'll save it's
gonna draw from this port the whole way
down to here and cut out the part that
was previously drawn on to the screen
because it's trying to get down here but
you're telling it it can only go
counterclockwise and that's why it's in
eighty degrees
I'll save reload and it's gonna draw
again from this part over to here and if
you change this to false
I'll save reload you're gonna see it's
gonna draw the bottom part and of course
if you wanted to close the path which
means automatically close the beginning
point and connect it to the ending point
closed path called and it's going to
work just like it did with the paths and
strings as you can see there and also
with arcs you can also define fill style
this is a mistake that a lot of people
make though I'm gonna show you if you
type in red and you defined your fill
style and you file saved it you might
expect this to be filled with red guess
what it's not you want that fill to take
a fact you're actually gonna have to
call the fill function save and now it's
filled with red and of course all these
stylings need to be made before the
stroke function is called which actually
it draws everything on to the canvas and
then as a final thing I'm going to show
you how X twerks inside here let's say
we want to go create a string to draw
and I'm just gonna call it sample or
sample string is gonna be what's in
there and you can define the font just
by calling font equal to and let's say
we make this forty point Arial that will
work and also there's something called
fill text as well as stroke text fill
text is a function that draws the fill
part or the inner part of any of the
text onto the screen and Stroke will
draw any strokes or paths that go around
that text but first we got to define our
style and let's say we might get read a
known stroke style and just so that it
shows up nice on the screen I'm gonna
say black now you're gonna see fill text
and then inside of here we're gonna put
this variable for this string we created
and we're gonna say we're gonna draw in
a hundred pixels to the right from this
upper corner of the canvas and down a
hundred pixels I'll say every load and
you can see that there is sample
strength and just to make this simple to
show you how to draw the stroke just
call stroke text and also because I
can't remember what the width is for
this stroke that's gonna go around this
text I'm gonna come in here and define
it so I'm gonna type line width and this
is how you define the width of the
stroke that's gonna go around this text
and I'm gonna set it at two pixels file
say reload it and there you can see that
it drew both the fill part as well as
the stroke part and if we increase the
stroke up largely you can see that it
completely obliterates the fill part
inside that guy
the final thing I'm gonna show you is
actually kind of silly you can sort a
kind of measure the length of the text
that's on the screen the reason I say
sort of kinda is because it's not exact
and it doesn't always give proper
information what I'm basically saying is
the length of the string here on the
screen if you would want to measure that
there is a function that you call that
is called measure text and again you're
gonna copy this guy right here paste
your string inside of there or width of
chunks straighten on the function and
then you can call this is actually an
object that's returned here so you can
call a function called width and it's
gonna return the width for you and then
let's jump up here and print this new
measurement of the text to the screen
and instead we'll put it at the 200 200
point mark
I'll save reload and it says it's 331
pixels wide might be right my people
home aside from that the only other two
things that you can define in regards to
properties just like you do a line width
up here you can also define text a line
and I'm gonna get more into this later
on and it has the available properties
of start and left center and right and
you can also define text baseline which
is either alphabetic top middle or
bottom leave any questions or comments
otherwise da next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
