present a bunch of Chipotle copycat
recipes I'm going to show you how to
make Chipotle sofrito is black bean
cilantro lime rice tomato salsa
tortillas and guacamole so I have a lot
to cook so let's get into it
first I'm going to start with this
efreet is by getting some extra firm
tofu and putting it in paper towels and
putting something heavy on it for at
least an hour to drain it out and then
I'm going to get a poblano pepper and
I'm going to core and seat it then this
is going to go into an oven at 500
degrees until the skin blisters and then
it will be ready now I'm going to jump
over and start making the salsa now the
tomato salsa or pico de gallo is going
to start off with one and a half cups of
seeded thick tomatoes like Roma's like
you see right here and what you want to
do is go in and cut out the membranes as
well as the seeds so that everything's
real chunky and then you're going to
want to chop those up to your desired
thickness then you're going to want to
add 1/4 of a cup of diced Vidalia onions
1 tablespoon of cord and seeded as well
as diced jalapenos 1/4 cup of diced
cilantro and then finally 2 tablespoons
of lime juice you can use it out of a
bottle and 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt to
taste and you're going to mix that up
and it's all ready now let's jump over
and let's make this a Freitas here is my
poblano pepper I'm going to remove the
skin off the outside of it and then I'm
going to chop it up doesn't really need
to be real fine just going to blend this
anyway so I'll throw the poblano pepper
that's chopped into a blender and then
I'm also going to add one half of a
small yellow onion as well as 2
tablespoons of minced garlic or you can
go and mince it yourself as well as 2
tablespoons of tomato paste and then
also 1 tablespoon of ground cumin and
then add 2 teaspoons of ground oregano
as well as 3 teaspoons of lemon juice
and then also one tablespoon of either
soy sauce or liquid aminos depending
upon what you have on hand and then you
have to make a decision based off a
taste whether you want to add in either
three and a half ounces to seven ounces
of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and
then blend
and you're done now you're going to get
your tofu and you're going to cut it to
about that size or into about eight to
nine pieces and you're going to fry that
for three minutes per side
then you're going to get your sauce and
throw that in a pan on medium-high and
then chop up all your tofu and throw
that in you're going to simmer this for
about five minutes and there you go
there's your Chipotle sofrito
now we're going to make our black beans
I'm going to start off with one
tablespoon of minced garlic and then
you're going to get two cans of black
beans and one you're going to drain
that's that one and the other one you're
not going to drain and you're going to
throw those in a pot and then you're
going to add in one teaspoon of chili
powder and then one half of a teaspoon
of sugar as well as one half of a
teaspoon of ground cumin and then one
half of a teaspoon of salt to taste and
then mix it up and bring it to whatever
temperature you'd like and you are
finished now we're going to make
ridiculously healthy tortillas just get
yourself two cups of regular old white
flour then you're going to want to get
one and a half teaspoons of baking
powder not baking soda big difference
there and then one teaspoon of salt and
then you're going to throw that in a
blender and as its blending you're going
to add 3/4 of a cup of warm water and
blend it until it forms into a ball then
you're going to take the dough throw it
in a pan and cover it with a damp warm
cloth for an hour now while we're
waiting for that let's make welcome Olie
just go and get yourself four avocados
and of course take the gigantic seed out
of the middle and then get all the gook
out of there
throw that inside of your blender then
you're going to get two tablespoons of
lime juice again it doesn't matter where
you get the lime juice and then to that
one third of a cup of your pico de gallo
that you had previously and you're going
to blend that up until it's nice and
smooth now we're going to make our
tortillas I'm going to cut that dough
into six even pieces and I'm going to
roll it as flat as humanly possible then
I'm going to get a cast iron pan and put
it at about 60% and cook it about one
minute per side and then all of your
tortillas are ready then we're also
going to make some rice very simple just
go and get two cups of rice add in two
tablespoons of lime juice and 1/2 cup of
cilantro and there you go just go and
get your tortilla get yourself some
black beans throw on some sofrito
in some rice at in your salsa throw on
some guacamole and there you go just
like Chipotle at home except a little
bit healthier and a lot cheaper please
