all right you guys you have all asked me
to I this came about as a whim you guys
asked me in the comments and I sort of
offhandedly joked about doing a vegan
seafood taste test and it became like a
thing that everybody wanted to see and
I've never eaten vegan seafood I've no
idea what it tastes like I see you guys
there good luck thank you um this is
100% not sponsored by anybody and
anybody that knows anything about
anything by me saying that means I will
get sued if I say that what I am eating
is this stuff this is all from Sophie's
kitchen breaded vegan fish fillets I am
going to eat breaded vegan shrimp and
this is live obviously there same thing
and breaded vegan scallops so I'm giving
three different things are all going to
be eaten if you want to have any idea
what this is in this stuff let me see
here this is the breaded vegan scallops
and I'll show you what all the food
looks like and I'll eat it and and I'll
even let my kids eat it if you want a
second opinion what's in it water oh boy
konjac powder peace torch potato starch
rice flakes sea salt organic agave
nectar fee new Greek alginate from
seaweed white pepper calcium hydroxide
non-gmo mein the face a facility that
also uses tree nuts and it's as it says
meat and seafood free so and this is
everything that I have let's see if I
can properly show this I have oh boy
hard to get in the video this is the
shrimp this stuff I'll hold it up for
you this is obviously scallops
well obviously and this is the fish
fillet right there and I'm going to be
drinking water Coca Cola's not
sponsoring me either but if they would
like to
let's all jump into it okay so I'm gonna
first try this and then like I said I'll
let my kids try it because they will
tell you if something's terrible or not
very first thing I'm gonna try is the
fish this is a fish filet as you can see
right there so what it looks like it's
the best I can film it and I'm gonna
taste it and see what it tastes like
hmm explosion you hear me alright umm I
don't know it's uh kind of gritty um
it's sort of tight as like a texture of
I I think like if you would have you if
you would well you can see it let me see
if I can get it in here a little bit
better you can see it a little bit
better what the textures like the
texture isn't really like a fillet oh
I'm doing a horrible job here do this
not work as you can tell in a live
stream very often I don't know the
texture is like what-what tuna fish I
think would would be like but it doesn't
taste at all like tuna fish it's
actually kind of good yes I'm from
America
what does it taste like it doesn't taste
it's all like a fly of fish
it's not bad um I baked everything here
so it's not bad I I actually it doesn't
taste it's all like a fly of fish but is
it it's kind of like that like what I
remember maybe like I don't know it sort
of stated if the texture is like tuna
that is tuna tuna fish texture if you
made a tuna patty and breaded it and
baked it that's the texture 100% the
taste is really mild taste a little bit
to know like I guess it tastes like fish
so I mean what I say it's bad
no it's not bad $6.99 everything here
cost me $6.99 so this was $6.99 $6.99
$6.99 and I had to have it sent to me so
I the fish not bad you know it tastes
exactly like what I said it was this is
the shrimp right here and it's source
rim plike no artificial tail
and let's see what it tastes like
again same bland taste taste the Tet the
taste is like almost exactly the same as
the fish the texture I guess it's like
shrimp surprisingly enough I promise I
won't puke um and if anybody's wondering
why I'm doing this is because a
bazillion people asked me to do it it's
reason why I'm doing it
the shrimp has a kind of a weird texture
it's alright I mean no just not
something I would really like to eat but
it was all right in here sorry I'm not a
food critic you know got Anthony
Bourdain here and this is a scallop it
sort of looks like a scallop and I got
to perfect my whole thing here sort of
looks like a scallop from looking at it
I'm expecting it to taste about the same
wife actually pan-fried if
yeah I wouldn't I don't know not the
best but to fish is pretty ok and this
and the shrimp is pretty ok um oh ok so
that's it I mean that's uh not my
opinion I don't love it
is it real shrimp no no no 100% of this
is vegan this is vegan stuff you're just
tuning in it's breaded vegan scallops
from Sophie's kitchen again this isn't
sponsored again breaded vegan shrimp
Sophie's kitchen this is the only vegan
seafood stuff I could find
I mean I'm this is what I'm what I'm ya
know um and there's that one breaded
vegan fish fillets and the reason why
I'm doing this is because a bazillion
people asked for it so yeah in my
opinion the fish filets are actually
kind of good if you put some sort of you
know if you had tomato and lettuce and
something them you know like mayonnaise
or something it would actually be pretty
good weed like I said it's like a
texture like a tuna breaded thing not
bad I mean if you really want to try
that you could try it
and this No
where did that even go and you cook it
for like 15 you have to thaw it out and
then cook it for like 15 minutes what's
in what's in it I said before it's a
bunch of like water cognacs powder piece
starch potato starch rice flakes sea
salt organic agave nectar you know it's
like the same stuff
this has some paprika in it and some
white pepper and turmeric so that's a
scallops there and then sorry I don't do
live streams very often but I they're
kind of fun so and you guys asked me to
do it I'll do into tall do a video on
anything so you guys know that and don't
expect more videos like this though yeah
seaweed powder it's just a bunch of
stuff to make it taste like you know
what it's supposed to be like the
texture is what all these chemicals are
is it organic no cholesterol zero trans
fat good source of protein no
preservatives colors MSG sugar add I'm
assuming this has to be organic I mean
this thing's I don't know it doesn't say
organic come on does it non-gmo
certified Kosher gluten free soy free
cholesterol free meat and seafood free
it doesn't say organic on it so I guess
I don't know so there's that so there's
my opinion and do I think they're
healthier than the real thing I don't
know that's up to other people to figure
out I'm not a nutritionist I um you know
so let's bring my kids in come on girls
I'll let them eat it and they can give
you their opinion on it so you can have
a different opinion okay Willa mere fish
get on camera there you are I'm not
gonna eat my iPhone next time so you eat
that and you tell me what it tastes like
tell me if you like it or not that's the
fish fillet she's eating right now okay
so she likes it like I said the fish
fillets pretty good
it's like a tuna thing do you want to
taste that
okay and this is my other daughter here
you have to go in camera you taste it
she is
tell me what you think all right so they
both like it I think the fish layout is
is good tastes like tuna fish like a
breaded tuna fish but it doesn't taste
like tuna fish all right so now you want
to taste the shrimp all right so here's
a shrimp
well you think of that okay have some
weird stuff on it here you want to taste
the shrimp okay this is the other one
what you think of that then she likes
both the little one like the shrimp and
then here is a scallop already there's a
scallop
she liked the scallop and what do you
think me Ravi here scallop what'd you
think of it so there you go kids like it
and okay there you go you want to take
that alright so the kids liked all of it
um so that was there you go let me see
here the comments what oh yeah yeah my
wife says that it Cognac our products
are made with cognac root okay let's go
okay I know let's go eat you can eat
that if you want it the main thing in it
is con yak root and also note it's an
elephant yam and it's a superfood staple
across Southeast Asia and very popular
in traditional Japanese cuisine it's low
in calories high in fiber and they
combine it with seaweed and a whole
bunch of other different things this is
226 calories and 90 calories of fat
that's that got a good review I think my
kids just I don't know they like
everything and this is 50 calories and
10 calories of fat this is like this I
would never eat that the plays are ok
that's not this also I have to give this
kind of a crummy is that it's okay I'm
what I eat it again now the Flay's good
so if I'm giving my honest opinion
this is 240 calories for seven pieces on
a hundred calories of fat
so let me see here so there's my review
did my wife eat it no she didn't
I I could say that her opinion is
probably gonna be even worse than than
mine she's a little bit less she's a
little bit less whatever good at eating
things like that um thank you I'm glad
you guys enjoyed it just a goofy video
you guys asked me to do it so I did um
and I think they're gonna go eat it
right now so are they vegan my kids are
not vegan neither is my wife my little
girls are four and seven I am vegan but
my kids and my wife are not uh let me
see my one daughter is lactose
intolerant that's whenever I went whole
hog vegan because she was lactose
intolerant and I just figured you know
she's like it I used to be I was
vegetarian my entire life anybody wants
to know why in a reason why I'll I've
said this a million times I grew up in a
farm and I just thought it was weird to
eat the animals that was it and you know
I'm when I was very very little I had
that opinion so that's why I became me a
vegetarian and then I pretty much gave
up everything um I know it's just steak
or fish Baker I don't know I can tell
you the last time I ate a hamburger that
was 21 years old was when I ate a
hamburger and it was I didn't like it um
no I will never grow a beard
that I am just reading the comments
there you guys have do you ever eat dog
or cat meat no I've never eaten any of
that
I don't know oh why do I have studio
walls it dampens the echo in this room
that's the reason why these exist and
this is like really cheap stuff like
every youtuber has it so and that's it
um what stayed in my from them from
Pennsylvania do I play minecraft no I do
not really I am doing a lot can I make
hacking tutorials no that's one of the
things I will not do because I do not
need to get in trouble either from the
government one thing that I'm really
trying to will Cola make you fat
I can tell you I've read a bazillion
book I'm not a nutritionist but I've
read a bazillion books and I can tell
you diets come down to one thing
calories in calories out that is it
there if you eat more calories than you
you burn then you will gain weight and
vice versa that is it anybody says
anything different in my opinion is an
idiot
I mean it's it's just an anybody that
says that they lower their calories and
they don't lose weight is superhuman
because that basically means that you
you can exist without any food I ate the
vegan seafood already earlier in the
video if you missed that so you can
rewind it one thing that I have a
question for you guys though that are
out there because I assume most people
that are watching this or into
programming videos um I can either go
one of two ways I can go into C++ next
or I can go into c-sharp and move
towards making video games what do you
guys want to say if I go to the C++
route I'm gonna go more towards an
academic sort of way and if I go the
c-sharp direction I am going to make
video games so what do you guys want to
see and you can leave that in the
comments section because it's like I
said always you guys control what I do
and no I don't know how to make a food
making machine I'm sure that'll happen
someday
I look like Philip DeFranco come on I
wish I was as young as well - franca
okay so I'm seeing the vote thank you
for voting guys are awesome I'm C++ just
so you know C sharp means video games
C++ means not video games C++ is going
to be academic algorithms things like
that C++ or C sharp is going to be unity
video games so that is I just want the
opinion out there on which direction to
go because if I whatever direction I go
I'm gonna go in a big way I'm sort of
dipping out of the Python tutorials here
and by the end of December I will
definitely be done with Python so for
the most part I'm not saying there's
never gonna be another Python tutorial
ever I sound ok by the way if anybody
he's out there so I'm seeing a nice
mixture and I'm gonna go through it I
don't my count every single one of these
c-sharp and C++ tutorials and if you
want to know what the next video is
going to be um it's gonna be up on
Wednesday cuz I had a whole bunch of
people asked me this it's going to I'm
gonna show you how to do live streams
and play iOS device games using a
hundred percent free software live
streaming and I'm gonna play clash
royale which again I had another vote
and a whole bunch of people asked me to
do a clapping clash for all things I
don't I play clash royale but I don't
spend money on it so I'm not
particularly good at it
you sound like my girlfriend's mom
that's a great comment okay guys so
thanks a bunch if unless you have any
other questions about this food I mean I
you know it's just food and like I said
I'm not Anthony Bourdain I don't know
anything I can just tell you what it
tastes good just to understand that my
kids are a very open in regards to
eating just about anything so they are
not very much like normal kids I've I
have fed them weird things
well not weird things but I fed them
vegetables since they were infants and I
they're why pretty used to eating weird
stuff and saying things are good in my
opinion the only thing worth eating if
you really want to eat vegan seafood is
the breaded vegan fish fillet the other
two especially the scallops definitely
not okay so I will go through here and
thank you all for joining me because
this has been fun I hope it lived up to
what you thought it was gonna be I I
don't know like I said I don't play it
on having another eating video but I
thought it was a fun idea and you got a
whole bunch of people asked me for it so
I decided to do it so I'll go through
and I'll count all your SEPA are all of
your votes for either C++ and Cheese
sharp and whichever one gets the most
votes out there I will do the video on
that and another thing I'd love to get
people's opinion on what is the best
gaming headset especially when it comes
to microphones because this one is dying
out and I'm going to be buying a new one
and I want one that sounds really good
and your opinions are awesome and always
welcome just like always so please leave
any questions and comments you have
below otherwise till next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
