three of my object oriented design
tutorial unlike parts 1 &amp;amp; 2 which are
available above and you should watch
them in this part of the tutorial we're
going to be covering in riff development
the unified process I'm going to take
you through a real-world usage case now
the beginning of this tutorial is going
to be a little bit heavy in regards to
jargon because I have to explain a whole
bunch of things but as this tutorial
progresses on it'll become more
real-world and more interesting feel
free to leave any questions or comments
below now the waterfall process is one
in which you do everything up front and
hope nothing changes that's kind of what
we did in part 1 &amp;amp; 2 we jump directly
into requirements lists and then we
started diagramming and then we wrote
the code now in small projects that may
work but in larger projects you are
going to find that the iterative
development way of diagramming systems
and designing systems is the way to go
now the iterative development process is
based around creating a system in many
small pieces programming actually starts
before all the requirements have been
defined because requirements are
expected to change as developers receive
feedback and improve upon their basic
design now the unified process is the
most popular form of iterative
development the final system is created
in many blocks and up front you mainly
focus on the parts of the system that
are the riskiest or the most valuable
you are then going to get constant
feedback to verify quality of your
system and you're going to focus on the
core parts first and then add additional
functionality now the unified process
which we're going to be going over in
the next parts of this tutorial
organized work across four main phases
the inception elaboration construction
and transition in this part of the
tutorial I'm going to really focus in on
the inception part now there are seven
parts to the inception process of the
unified process and we're going to focus
on the core goal of the system by
creating 10% of the use cases that we
will then start actually programming in
the elaboration phase which is going to
be in part four of this tutorial now the
purpose isn't to define all the
requirements the goal is to find out if
although
involved agree about the goal for the
system you want to be able to answer
does everyone agree that this is the
goal worth solving most of all now the
parts of Inception is the vision process
in which you are going to define the
most important goals and create an
executive summary then we're going to
get into use case modeling in which
we're going to define names for most use
cases and analyze approximately 10% of
those that are the riskiest or provide
the most value up front then we get into
the Supplemental specification in which
we're going to describe briefly other
requirements that are going to be needed
for our system then we'll get into risk
management plan which is going to
discuss the biggest risks and how they
can be solved proof of concepts is going
to clarify the vision for the system the
iteration plan to describe what to do in
the first elaboration iteration and if
you're not quite getting all this don't
worry about it I'm just giving you an
overall view of everything digest as
much as you can and feel free to move on
as because things become more
interactive as we move on here then
we're going to get into the software
development plan in which we're going to
describe the time needed for each
iteration remember we're going to be
writing all this code and creating our
system as a whole in blocks in pieces
and the goal above all is to make sure
everyone involved in the inception phase
completely understands each other and
the overall plan and whenever I'm
talking about requirements you're going
to be defining requirements using the
unified process and our main goal here
is going to be finding while tracking
requirements that are expected to change
and if you try to define all the
requirements from the beginning like we
did with the waterfall plan which we did
in part 1 and 2 of this tutorial
chances are very well that your project
will fail if it is sizable in any way
now the unified process requirements are
structured based off of what is called
the firts plus model and this breaks
down into functional which is going to
be all your features and security
usability which are going to be those
parts of your system that are going to
help your user directly reliability
which is going to be how are you going
to recover from failure performance
which is going to be based on speed
accuracy and proper resource usage and
support ability
which is going to show how your system
is going to be maintained as well as be
configurable in the future now the plus
side of Ferb's is going to include four
main parts which is going to be
implementation in which you're going to
list resource limitations and different
tools or languages that you want to use
the interface which is going to cover
interfacing to external systems
operations which is going to cover
system management and then finally
licensing so then we get into the meat
of this tutorial which is the use case
or as I like to call it the usage case
which I like much more as a name use
cases are going to provide a simple way
to discover and record system
requirements you're going to start a use
case by writing a story about how each
actor or participant year system will
use your system and an actor is anything
included in or uses your system this
could be basic users admins computers
databases etc and there are three basic
types of actors you're going to have
your primary user which is going to be
the person the system is designed for
supporting actors which are going to be
external computer systems verifiers and
sometimes people and offstage actors
which are going to be outside elements
that have an interest in your system but
aren't key to the system's primary use
so then what is a scenario which is
every use case is going to be built on a
very specific scenario a scenario
documents a series of interactions
between actors and your system and each
actor could have numerous scenarios
while interacting with your system as an
example some scenarios might end
successfully while others will end in a
bad way or will be considered a failed
scenario and the use case is just going
to be a collection of scenarios
involving your system and an actor for
example we're going to be focusing again
on working with an ATM machine and a
common scenario we might have here is
cash withdraw from checking alternate
scenarios might be account is out of
funds or PIN is incorrect your job when
creating these usage cases is to cover
all of those scenarios and there
basically are three use case formats
first you have brief which is just going
to be one paragraph that describes the
main successful scenario casual which is
going to be many paragraphs that cover
many scenarios and then full dress which
is what I'm going to really focus on
here and it's going to list every step
in variation written out in detail now
when using the unified process we're
going to focus in on scenarios that are
going to cover the most important 10% of
your system up front and the most
commonly followed fully-dressed use case
format is the alistair cockburn format
and that is what i'm going to cover in
this tutorial so let's get into some
real-world system design here you can
see on your screen the basic format of
the alistair cockburn format for
creating usage designs and the very
first thing you're going to do is
provide a use case name now this
normally should begin with a verb and
what we're going to do here is go
provide a TM user with money from
checking account remember this is one
scenario and this is our goal then we're
going to go into the scope which is
going to be the name of our whole system
and I'm just going to call this ATM
software application kind of doing this
out of my head this is normally done
using numerous different people and then
you're going to get into level which is
either going to be user goal or sub
function now most of the time it's going
to be user goal the only time you're
going to have this listed as sub
function is whenever it's used for
duplicate interactions for example if
you wanted to document an interaction
that's going to be used in numerous
other use cases rather than repetitively
just writing the same thing over and
over again
you would just type in sub function and
have it work this way
but in this situation this is going to
be a user goal and our primary actor who
is going to be the main participant in
our system is going to be a bank
customer remember I'm just focusing in
on the most common things we're going to
be doing here then we get to
stakeholders and these are going to be
all actors involved and their role in
our system and basically you just have
to think about all the people it could
use our system
well bank customers definitely going to
be one of them the ATM machine itself is
going to be
them your bank home office computer
would be another one and then finally
let's say fraud Department to check if a
card is fraudulent or not well then
after you list all of your actors then
your job in the stakeholders area is to
basically list all of the requirements
these different actors going to have
whenever they use your system so a bank
customer is going to have access to all
the funds in both their savings and
checking they may also want to deposit
checks check their balance
I'm just doing a lot it is out of my
head so I'm just sort of like thinking
through I want to make sure their money
is safe and then they want to receive a
receipt okay and then what you're going
to do is you're going to continue going
through here and figure out all the
different things that all these actors
need so the ATM machine itself is going
to provide funds available to customers
automatically update fund changes
immediately so that if two different
people are accessing the same account we
don't have any type problem there
protect the bank and customers from
false cards or pins or whatever and I'm
going to type out a whole bunch of other
ones and there's a link under the video
to give you a more precise example of
this bank home office number one is
going to provide accurate account funds
information and you would normally do
this in a team format where people will
just basically be yelling out exactly
you know different things that you would
want to include and it would also be
nice if people at the bank were there to
also provide information which they
normally would be
systemwide there are update immediately
when a transaction occurs this to mine
and a whole bunch of other things like I
said under the video can get the whole
entire list I'm going to write out a
whole bunch for you guys and then we'll
have fraud Department
if sent card information they will
verify if a card is stolen okay so after
we list our actors and the main things
that they want to get out of our system
then we're going to go into our
preconditions and these are quite simply
everything that must occur at the point
in which the system is prepared
for execution so a valid card is entered
technically power to the ATM machine but
I'm just going to start here is entered
that matches I mean normally would just
type out everything and then worry about
getting it perfect later on that's the
whole process of this okay so valid
cards entered in a valid PIN is entered
okay and then we're going to be able to
execute some things post conditions
customer is happy with the transaction
the transaction is disseminated to all
bank systems maybe we want to have a
photo of the customer is taken to
protect against fraud or something like
that occurring receipt definitely needs
to be generated and the only other thing
I think of his card is provided back to
the customer so there's some examples of
some post conditions and then you're
going to create your main success
scenario and this is just going to be a
step-by-step list of interactions that
will occur during the most common
successful scenario so you're going to
list that everything step by step and
then what you're going to do down here
under extensions it's going to be a
step-by-step list of interactions for
other alternative scenarios outside of
the norm and you're going to see some
examples of rows here so let's get back
to the main success scenario so we're
going to have the ATM displays a message
on-screen identifying itself to
customers and we're just going to do
this step by step
and we're going to say customer inserts
their card the ATM verifies the
legitimacy of the card and let's just
jump down here to extensions as exactly
something we could play with here and
spell legitimacy correct okay so down in
extensions what you're going to do like
I said before is cover scenarios outside
of the norm and I always have extensions
here that are basically going to start
off with at any time so what is an at
any time outside of the norm thing that
could occur well if the ATM runs out of
funds well we should definitely have
something that we'd want to do if that
occurs so we might say display a closed
message and
and we're going to say shut down the
machine and then send a message that a
technician needs to fill the ATM with
funds and what's another example and
this is the star and you're going to
have a letter and that's going to be the
other thing that you're going to do with
this well another thing that could occur
and in this situation we're going to put
a B inside of here at any time if the
ATM runs out of what something else it
could run out
well receipt paper web display closed
message shutdown machine send a message
technician ease the filty ATM with paper
now let's jump back up here again the
ATM is going to verify the legitimacy of
a card whether there's a lot of
alternative scenarios that can occur and
those alternative scenarios should not
be listed here they should be listed
down in extensions so this starts off
with a number three so if we want to
list things outside of the norm we're
going to go 3a down here so that we can
pair those two we're going to say the
card is from another Bank
that's something that could occur and
then we're going to list some
alternative things that we're going to
do here so we could say connect to the
other bank to verify funds now there's
another alternative scenario we could
say the other bank isn't reachable at
this time okay
so there's something we could do now
what are we going to do in that
situation see they don't skip over it we
just keep going so if the bank isn't
reachable we want to inform the customer
that a transaction can't be made and
what else could we do well we could
provide the customer with their card you
know that would be good and anything
else so well let's just say n
transaction and another thing could be
four and provide the customer with a
receipt so I'd be nice to do as well and
I can't think anything else
so the bank isn't reachable what are
some other things that could occur under
here and that is our goal here is to
figure out all these different things
one of them could be the other bank is
reachable and then we're going to list
what we're going to do here if the but
in another number we could say something
like if the
strimer must pay a fee inform them of
that and then let's throw something else
under here another thing you can do is
just put like an eye in there kind of
like a Roman numeral say something like
receive verification that the customer
understands any fees another thing we
could do actually let's throw this under
here and these Roman numerals and things
start to get a little crazy but this as
late as we can say add the fee as part
of the transaction if the customer
allows and then we say if the customer
declines record that and provide the
customer with their card and receipt and
so forth and so on so that's what you're
going to basically do you're going to
list out the main scenario with a step
by step interaction or list of what's
going to happen in the situation of
which our ATM is going to provide users
funds from the checking account which is
the use case and then you have all the
alternative things D down here inside of
extensions like I said if you want to
read some more I got a whole bunch more
under the video then the final thing or
the next of one of the next of the final
things is special requirements and this
could be something like the text must be
readable by color blind people and
something else we would have is the text
was just copy this must be readable by
people who speak other languages and you
know other things like they must be
readable from 3 feet away or some way to
handle Braille and so forth and so on so
there's going to be special things that
we need to cover and we're going to have
data variations lists and this is going
to provide specific information on the
type of data that's expected like data
types or special hardware data types or
something like that and other special
requirements might be time instances
like transactions should take no longer
than 10 seconds things like that but
data variation in this situation is all
data uses 256 bit AES encryption that
could be an example you know a data type
or ways of passing data with frequency
Curren you're basically just going to
list how often the system will enter a
new scenario in this situation that
could be constantly if they cancel the
current transaction and move into
another one we have to always be
prepared for that and then the final
part of the usage case is going to be
some random things that come up during
the discussion like is there anything we
can do to improve user experience or the
blind for example or something like can
polarized screens help improve security
you know like weird sort of things like
that questions that we want to get
answered so there you go that is a
rundown of a usage case and how they're
actually created in the real world when
one is using it rift development versus
waterfall development in the unified
process feel free to leave any questions
or comments below and in the next part
of the tutorial I'm going to get into
the elaboration phase until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
