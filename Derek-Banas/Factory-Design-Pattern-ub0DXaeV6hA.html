my design patterns video tutorial today
we're going to talk about the factory
pattern and like before I'm going to
show you this in multiple different ways
we're going to see it as a presentation
format we're going to look at it as UML
diagram and then I'm going to go through
all the code from start to finish and
this is honor percent self-contained
tutorial however if you need to brush up
on basic opie concepts there are links
above to those so what is the factory
pattern
well basically by definition you would
use the factory pattern whenever you
would want a method to return one of
several possible classes that share a
common superclass so in my John the
video tutorial I created a video game so
let's say I wanted to shoot a enemy onto
the screen at random well if everything
is hard-coded and I don't know what type
of enemy that's going to go onto the
screen using basic programming
techniques that makes it very hard
however let's say that I create a random
number generator and each potential
enemy class is a designed one of the
numbers that could pop out of that
random number generator I could then
send that number to the factory object
and it will return for me a dynamically
created enemy and throw it on the screen
so it's very important the MOL main
concept here is we want the capability
to have classes chosen at runtime and
that's what the factory pattern provides
for us
so when would you use the factory
pattern when you don't know ahead of
time what class objects you might need
however there's a caveat to that make
sure that all the potential classes are
of the same subclass hierarchy which
means somewhere up the list they all
have the same superclass you would also
use a factory pattern to centralise
class selection code when you don't want
the user to have to know every single
potential subclass and of course like
all ways to encapsulate object creation
which is always great and here is a UML
diagram that explains the basic layout
or creation of a factory pattern you're
going to have the client which is the
user the main program and it's going to
be to call the factory object and say
hey make me an enemy ship and here we're
providing a string instead of a random
number and it's going to go over here to
the abstract class called enemy ship and
it's going to implement all of the
common different methods that we would
need for any enemy that we would use in
our video game then from that we're
going to create UFO enemy ship and
rocket enemy ship they're all
going to implement this abstract enemy
ship class and just to reinforce this
the factory pattern allows you to create
objects without specifying the exact
class of an object that will be created
at runtime so let's get into the code
and explain this further
now all the code in this tutorial is
available in a link underneath the video
just like always it's heavily commented
to help you learn this stuff the first
thing we're going to create of course is
the enemy ship class and I'm going to go
the whole way through this so that you
completely get it
and understand why you would need the
factory pattern so here is enemy ship
and it's going to have couple private
fields such as named double the amount
of damage it could entail on our hero
and then public string get name which is
going to return the name for our enemy
ship public void set name which is going
to receive name for our ship equal to
new name and then we're going to would
do exactly the same thing
make sure capitalized that there we are
and then we're also going to do the same
thing for damage return amount of damage
that it does and then set damage and
it's will be a double new damage new
damage amount of damage and set that to
double okay so that provides me access
to those different fields and then we're
going to come in and go public figure
out all the different things that all of
our enemy ships are going to have in
common well one thing is we would like
to have code that automatically just
makes it go out there
and follow the hero ship because that's
something that every single enemy is
going to want to do just go get name is
following the hero then basically we're
going to have two more methods that are
going to do pretty much exactly the same
sort of thing here what's something else
we would want to do well we would want
to display the enemy ship we're just
going to say is on the screen enemy ship
and our enemy ship is definitely going
to shoot and we're going to say attacks
and does get damaged there we are so all
of our enemy ships are going to do all
three of those different things so now
that we have this abstract class enemy
ship created now we're going to create
UFO enemy ship and this is going to be
very simple we're just going to go
public class UFO enemy ship extends
enemy ship and for this tutorial we're
going to keep this quite simple we're
just going to create ourselves
instructor setname UFO enemy ship set
damage and let's say that it does 20
damage so real simple now that we got
that created we can go into rocket enemy
ship do pretty much the same exact thing
course go change the rocket and our
rocket is going to be a little bit
faster but it's not going to do as much
damage breaking everything down into
that and then we're going to jump into
enemy ship testing and we're going to
look at this for multiple different
angles so that you can understand why
the factory pattern is used so I'm going
to allow the user to come in here and
pick their ship at runtime so we're
going to need scanner to monitor
keyboard input enemy ship testing and
this is the main program so public
static void main is needed here we want
to run this guy there we go so what are
we going to do inside of main well let's
approach this using the old way of
creating objects and you're going to see
exactly why factory pattern is going to
be very nice we're going to create a new
UFO ship because that's the only way to
use it if we are just simply using
inheritance like this so there's our UFO
ship and then we can say we want our
enemy ship to do stuff with the UFO ship
object that we just created and of
course we have to create do stuff public
static void juice to enemy and it's
going to receive our object or enemy
ship an enemy ship and then what are we
going to have it to we're going to have
it display the enemy ship of course
because it's not on screen it's not
worth much and then we're also going to
have it follow the hero and then if it's
going to follow the hero it's also going
to want to shoot it to hero and there
you go
so this is our old-style way of
implementing this sort of stuff and it
kind of stinks but it does work say
there's UFO and if he ships on screen
it's following hero and then it attacks
and does 20 damage okay
well of course you can see why that's
not any good because it's not dynamic so
we're going to come in here and just
using inherit and see what we get so I'm
going to go scanner user input this is
going to allow the user at runtime to
define exactly what type of enemy ship
to put on our screen so at least it's
going to be dynamic we know that that's
good
so string enemy ship option just amount
and then we're going to say what
type of remember you or our if user
input and we're going to say has next
line because they're going to be giving
us a string just so you know I want to
reinforce the fact that this has nothing
to do with the factory pattern it is
more about why you need the factory
pattern because I want you to be able to
spot that whenever you're writing code
you go wait a minute I'm doing this bad
thing I shouldn't be doing I should use
the factory pattern I'm going to go next
line which is going to read that string
there and assign it to enemy ship option
and then what we're going to need to do
is this is a big sign that the pattern
is needed we're going to go enemy ship
option now since we have two potential
options here you have to put in a bunch
of if statements so we go the enemy is
equal to new UFO enemy ship like that
I'm going to get rid of that just type
in the enemy give it a value of null so
here we're going to create that class
dynamically and then we'll go else and
then basically the same exact thing or
is the other option and then we're going
to send do stuff the enemy then I'll run
this now and you can see what type of
ship and let's type in our and you can
see the wrong thing popped up and the
reason why is I forgot to go rocket lets
file save it execute it again our and
there you can see rocket enemy ship is
on the screen so that's dynamic however
it doesn't close the code from being
modified and that is bad so you don't
want this sort of stuff to be going on
inside of your actual program tons of
if-then-else statements and then making
all sorts of changes based off of that
so now i'm going to show you how to do
all this using the factory pattern so
let's just go in delete all this bad
stuff and i'm going to over here jump
first just to make a point and create a
subclass of the UFO enemy ship and call
it big UFO enemy ship I'm just gonna
jump in here copy that
jump over into this paste it and this is
going to be big so let's say this is
like a boss or something like that big
and it does 40 damage and this is just
big so this is going to be a subclass of
UFO enemy ship just to show you that
that can indeed work and then we're
going to jump over into enemy ship
factory Java and show you exactly what
is so Factory about this Factory
so how do we get a public class I'm
going to call this enemy ship factory
basically what we're going to do is
we're going to take all that
decision-making and move it totally out
into another class let me go a public
enemy ship it's what it's going to
receive and we're going to say make
enemy ship and we're going to be
provided both a string just like before
and we're going to go enemy ship new
ship is equal to null then we're going
to put our if statements inside of there
so we're going to go new ship type
equals and let's say they sent us at you
and yes I know they can put a lowercase
one in there and that would mess
everything up but I'm just trying to
keep this simple
so it's going to return in that
situation a UFO enemy show this is going
to completely encapsulate ship creation
so that whenever we have to modify
something there's only one place where
we're going to have to make those
modifications else we're basically going
to do the same thing we're going to go
armed
if they give us an R we're going to
change this to rocket else if they send
us a B we're going to give them a big
UFO enemy ship and else we're going to
return null and there you are you just
created yourself a factory so now let's
try out that factory we're going to jump
back into enemy ship testing and now
we're going to create our factory object
so it's going to be enemy ship factory
I'm gonna call it ship factory is equal
to new there we are so we just created
that guy create a new enemy ship the
enemy give it a value a null and then
we're going to still use the scanner
what type of ship just like before
except this time we're going to say they
can enter out you an arm or a B if user
input as next line when you get that
string and I'm going to call it a string
type of ship and that's going to be
equal to user input get them a string
and save it then I'm gonna go to the
enemy is equal to ship factory that
object that we just created above and
then we're going to call the method make
enemy ship and pass it the code that is
going to be tied to the class that needs
to be created then of course I don't
need that there's that then we're just
going to check to make sure enemy has a
value not equal to null and then if it
works out for us we're going to throw
that side of there and then
otherwise we'll say else and give them a
little bit of a warning next time there
we are so let's try out the factory and
see what happens so there we are what
type let's just say B enter there you go
big UFO enemy ship
everything's created dynamically using
the enemy ship dot Java factory object
so that is the beginning of using
factory patterns and up next I'm going
to cover the abstract factory pattern as
well as a whole bunch of other different
things please leave any questions or
comments below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
