to program tutorial this tutorial is
brought to you because I received a
bunch of comments from ghent 2910
squeaky wheel gets the oil and since he
commented he gets what he wants
gonna start this off the same way I
normally start off any Python programs
that are going to be run on their own
going to put a hash mark and I'm going
to signify the location of the Python
interpreter and my location happens to
be hash exclamation mark forward slash
user been horse lash Python threads and
your location may be different in mine
but this is pretty much the default
location where it should be now I'm
going to define an if statement that
basically is saying if this program is
being run on its own then execute the
function named main that's in essence
what this says okay so two underscores
name two underscores is equal to two
underscores main two underscores colon
call the function man okay and this is
going to be the last line of code that
you have now I have to define the
function named main and you see here
this has an error because there's no
body to this function if I want to get
rid of that I just type in pass and then
basically what that does is that allows
me to define all my functions and then
not trigger any errors on any of the
ones so if I want to create a whole
bunch of functions but I wanted to test
them individually I would just type pass
in there as I was going through so that
I didn't throw any errors so that's sort
of like a shortcut now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to create a function and
basically what i'm doing here is
reviewing a bunch of things based off of
things that you guys have told me you're
having problems understanding and then
at the same time going to get into
catching errors as they develop inside
of your python code so i'm going to
create a variable named var one and I'm
going to give it the top default value
of one and then I'm going to create
another one called var two and give it a
default value of one and then I'm going
to put star args and this is basically
going to allow them to send me an
infinite number of variables it's sort
of like other definition when I created
two stars Kate
a RGS this allowed a person to send an
indefinite number of key value pairs
into this function if you don't know
what I'm talking about go watch my other
tutorials because that is why you don't
understand alright so we've got that now
I'm going to create a print statement
remember I have to use the string the
STR function to turn var one into a
string if I want to be able to print it
out on the screen I'm going to use these
two curly brackets here to define where
I want the value that the function
format is going to generate to appear so
where this is that's where whatever this
value is is going to be transported and
I can easily put these curly brackets
over here put them anywhere I want and
add what I'm going to do because I'm
working with two arguments just going to
copy that paste that out here put two in
there and then put two inside of there
jump down here into main and I'm going
to call doubles equal to I'm going to
call this function that I just defined
up here and pass it a bunch of values
and it's only it's expecting a whole
bunch of them but if I didn't have this
guy on here it would throw an error
we're going to cover later on Iran you
can see it prints out one times two is
two died out of that it doesn't throw
any errors or anything even though more
arguments are passed however I want to
be able to catch those arguments and
actually use them but first what I'm
going to do I'm going to create a list
and a store the variables pass times two
in said list let's just copy this so now
that list is going to be there I'll just
print that to screen so that you know
what that looks like and I keep getting
a lot of questions about like the
variable names I use there's nothing
special about them I'm just picking them
out of the air
I'll see I'm using a RGS not the star
here and what this is going to do is
it's going to cycle through all of those
arguments sent and it's going to append
them to the end of the list with the
append command then because it says
doubles that means it's what looking for
a return value to assign to the variable
doubles so I'm going to do a return I'm
going to send back is the list you run
then
this C 1 times 2 is 2 2 times 2 is 4 and
then this is the list that's being
printed out right here and nothing was
printed out down here because I need to
create a for statement down here that's
going to print those out so for I in
doubles : and I'm going to cycle through
and print all of those values to screen
and if I do that you can see that it
does just that that's what this does
this right here does this okay
so that's some of the things that you
guys have been telling me you've been
having problems with now I'm going to go
through a couple other ones seems to be
problems in regards to understanding how
if else--if and and so forth works so
I'm going to go into that we call this
how old I'm going to put age in here as
one of the variables it's accepted see
there's an error down here but I'm not
going to type pass in because I'm not
going to worry about that if the value
of this variable passed is greater than
35 I'm going to return the value you're
older than me then it's a LIF naught
else if it's e LIF age is less than you
could put an indefinite number of these
you could have 50 l lifts if you want be
very unproductive but okay and then you
put the else statement and yes you could
put what follows after this on the same
line okay so these are the return values
and we've come down here go to main I'll
put the function how old directly into
this print command that's right here if
I jump up here and hit run you're older
than me that's because 43 is greater
than 35 another thing you guys been
having trouble with our conditional
expressions so I'm going to do another
one of those for you here I'm going to
create a function called an animal and
this is going to get an argument I'm
going to named your animal and basically
what the conditional expression does is
if one condition is true or it's going
to assign one value
to set variable animal preference and if
it's not true it's going to assign
another value to the variable named
animal preference okay
and you start off as what type in same
as me so if this condition that follows
if your animal is equal to cat then same
as me will be assigned to animal
preference this is where the else comes
in and you type else and if they type
anything else and then this value boo
hiss this string is going to be assigned
to animal preference so that's how that
works okay and I'm going to return
animal preference I have to jump down
here obviously put this function again
say I types they type in dog
you see boo hiss shows up and if
somebody types in cat comes up here you
can see same as me see same as me same
as me your animal is equal to cat now
I'm going to define a function that
basically all it does is divide two
values that are sent to it I'm going to
call it divided and stuff and it's going
to accept two arguments being x and y
and if I come down here I go div result
is equal to X divided by Y then I'm
going to print to the screen
remember again go to use the STR
function to change this integer into a
string so it can be printed on to the
screen
okay so that's going to print that out
to the screen then down here what I'm
going to actually do is I'm going to
allow the user to enter the values so
I'm going to type in first Val is equal
to input and then I'm actually going to
copy this to second second and I'm going
to make a call to divide and stuff what
I'm going to pass to it or remember
these whenever we use this input
function here it assigns whatever is
here this is considered a string so we
have to convert these to integers and
said of what you might be used to which
is constantly changing everything into
strings copy that paste that second
these are little things that cause a
whole bunch of different errors okay so
I'm using the int function here to turn
these strings into integers setting them
up here and then I'm going to print
something to screen okay so let's run so
hit one and two you can see 1/2 equals
0.5 okay that's real nice and easy it
works great because I was nice let's say
instead I run the command again and this
time I enter 1 and then I enter nothing
I got a value where we're going to get
rid of that so we got a value error here
we could also have another problem let's
run this again type 1 and this time type
0 in boom you got a 0 division error
okay there are ways to actually solve
for these problems I'm going to show you
how basically all you need to do is come
in here and type try followed by a colon
you're going to jump down here and go 1
2 3 4 so that that is inside of that
code block that we have right there and
then we're going to come down here and
type accept and we're going to have our
0 0 division error okay we're going to
be able to catch that and instead
whenever we have this error occur we're
going to say division by 0 and that's
going to print that out to the screen
however if we don't get that error
we're going to do is type LS : and we're
going to proceed to do it we want to do
alright just like that so if we run it
again click run shut down here enter a
number one zero division by error pops
up instead of that sloppy mess that you
just saw over there and there's
countless numbers of different errors
you can put multiple different accepts
in here like for example type error will
come up if I try to pass only one value
and this is accepting there is expecting
two values to be able to pass and I can
also type as e that sloppy mess you saw
that right there if you would want to
store that to a variable if you type as
e in here it's going to store all that
mess that was brought out here onto the
screen with a normal error it's going to
sign up to the variable named E and then
you could type in for example not enough
argument sent and so you could catch
every single other exception by just
typing in except exception then what
this guy basically does is catches
everything so I can just type you
normally would never want to do this but
I'm just showing you all the different
things that are possible you would never
really want to catch all those different
exceptions but that's something just to
think about and if you would want to
always have something print out to
screen no matter what happens whether
they're an exception is triggered or not
you would use this finally tag but it's
not often used like I said I'm just
showing you jump up here and hit run and
this time we'll just enter a value
that's there made it C made it printed
out even though there was no error
triggered so there's a whole bunch of
things you guys I covered a whole bunch
of things that you told me that you were
having trouble with and then I also went
into exception handling so if you have
any questions or comments leave them in
the comment section below
and as you can see whatever you guys
request that is what I cover till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
