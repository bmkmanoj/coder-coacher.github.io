23 of my java video tutorial series in
the last part part 22 obviously we
created this interface that you see
right here this application and I laid
out all of the components that you see
here on your screen if you can't say it
view it full screen and everything is in
HD video a little wonderful and in this
part what I'm going to do is I'm going
to allow everything to interact so
whenever you put checkbox marks inside
of here or you check these different
radio buttons or you slide the slider as
you can see here this number is going to
change over here and this label we're
going to make everything work let's jump
back into the code and there's a link
underneath this video to all of the
completed code and the very first thing
we're going to do is we're going to
implement the action listener so that
we'll be able to know whenever the
button is pressed so what we're going to
do we know private class listen for
button implements action listener and
the action we're going to be listening
for is a button press then every single
time this is an interface so every
single time the same methods need to be
created and we're going to go action
event E and then what we're going to do
like we did in previous tutorials is we
are going to make sure that the button
is the action that we are dealing with
here so we just pass along the button
name and then what we're going to do is
we're going to create a try block here
to catch any potential errors and I'm
going to go number one is going to be
equal to and then we're going to have to
turn what is a string in the text field
1 we get that string by calling it text
we're going to have to turn it using
double parse double into a double to
save it as number 1 because that's what
number one expects and then we're pretty
much going to do exactly the same thing
whenever we get the value that's stored
in the other text field just change this
to 2 and then change the text field into
2 so that's all we're protecting there
just making sure that we have a number
inside of there instead of a string that
can't be converted into a number and
that's the reason why we threw this into
this try block here to protect if
somebody would actually throw like a
letter or something inside of there and
give this a different name now I'm going
to show you something else if you want
to put up like an error message in this
situation in a little pop
you call je option pain show message
dialog and I don't believe I've ever
shown you this thing before nice little
tool then we're going to type in here
exactly what frame this is going to be
tied to job a lesson 22.4 information to
this guy then we're going to say put a
little error message please enter the
right info I'm just going to put that in
there then we have to give a little
title for the pop-up window and I'm just
going to say error and then you have to
define what type of icon you want to
show up whenever this guy pops up and
then close that off and then you could
also put warning message again all in
uppercase letters or question message or
plain message and you can play along on
with those and see exactly what types of
information they throw up there and then
what I'm going to do is since they
entered the wrong information I'm going
to call system exit zero and this is
going to close the whole entire job app
so they won't be able to continue from
that point just so you can see what that
looks like here it is right here and I'm
going to put in gah
obviously not something that's good and
then hit calculate say please enter the
right information and here is the icon I
was referring to and I click OK and it
kills everything so that's how that
works we also want to make sure that
we're able to handle whenever the right
information is put in so I'm going to
call add nums is selected and that is a
radio button that we created in the last
tutorial and if that radio button is
selected I'm going to add the value to
total calc by calling a method that
doesn't exist yet it's going to be
called add numbers and add numbers we're
going to pass it the value of number one
number two and we're also going to pass
it value that is stored in the slider so
we're going to how many times and we're
going to say get the value for the
slider we're going to pass all that
information that's going to tell it how
many times it needs to perform those
calculations and then we're going to go
else if and then I'm actually just going
to copy all this because not many things
are going to change paste that in there
and instead of add I'm going to put
subtract numbs and then down here we're
going to call subtract numbers which is
a method again that I'm going to create
here in a minute
and everything else here is exactly the
same bounce down here and then guess
what we're going to do the same thing
again
so copy this paste that in there then
we're going to say else if malt numbers
that means they have the radio button
for multiplication selected multiply
numbers and everything else is exactly
the same come down the end of here and
then finally we're going to put else in
this situation we know that the division
must be selected so we're just going to
get rid of all of that and we're going
to say total calc and this is going to
be divide numbers and everything else
there is going to be the sign and there
you go so now we're going to be able to
perform the right calculations based off
of whatever components are selected what
else do we want to do well we want to
see if the dollar check box is selected
and if it is we want to print out dollar
signs and commas and all that stuff so
to check if it's selected just go is
selected and that's going to tell me if
that check box is selected and if it is
what we're going to do here is to find a
number format and this guy is going to
allow us to format that number and put
in dollar signs and commas and decimal
places and all that other information
this is a good thing to know about when
you go get currency instance like I said
this is going to give me dollar signs
and commas and all that other stuff and
I'm going to call J option pain show
message dialog it's going to create that
pop up of a lesson 22.9 the message that
we want to put out on the screen we're
going to call num format and then call
format total and that's going to print
it out on the screen and make it look
real nice and then let's say we want to
put a little title in here called
solution and then we want to use J
option pain and we just want to put in
an information icon stating that
basically everything's golden here and
we like the way everything's working out
now what if the dollar sign isn't
selected else if what if comma is
selected instead well we're going to
check to make sure that's true and just
like before that's all it's going to
take for us to figure that out then I'm
actually going to copy this because
we're going to be performing pretty much
same exact things bonk all right then we
got to come in here figure out how to
change this and in this situation I'm
going to say number instance which is
going to perform a comma but it's not
going to put the dollar signs and all
those other information in there and
then everything else can be
exactly the same because right here
we're going to find exactly what how
we're going to format it and then we're
just going to let this guy go ahead and
perform all the necessary changes on its
own so it's great whenever we don't have
to change codes that much we can just
copy and paste as much as possible
otherwise we are going to just print out
the plain number with no formatting and
I'm going to call J option pane again
but in this situation because they have
not decided that they want any
formatting to occur I'm going to get rid
of that format right there
but everything else I'm going to leave
exactly the same and if we jump over
here you can see exactly how that's
going to work okay so let's say we put
in a 4 here and a 5 here and we check on
dollars and we click on multiply and we
just pick something arbitrary and
calculate can see $200 shows up there
and there's the dollar sign and all that
other information however if I would
just put commas inside of here hit
calculate well in that situation nothing
happens so let's just put 50 in there
and calculate you can see it puts a
comma but no dollar sign and if I got
rid of that all together it would just
print out plain number we don't need to
see that so now we're going to come in
here and actually create the change
listener and this of course is going to
be called whenever this slider has
changed so we're going to go listen for
slider implements change listener like
that and then like you saw before we can
come in here and say add on the
implemented methods because we have all
this defines so just click on that that
keeps us from having to remember exactly
what changes or what things we need to
do with this which is always nice and
we'll just come in here and change that
to a just because I always do change
that to E and then come in here to this
method and make it work proper so I'm
going to go if e dot get source here I'm
going to check that how many times or
the slider was the guy that called this
make sure that the names are all proper
of course and then if the slide or
indeed was changed we're going to go a
label 3 I want to set your text to
perform how many times and then go + and
then I'm going to go how many times and
I'm going to get the value for the
slider and change it just like that and
that's oh we need to do to make that guy
work get rid of some of these spaces and
then what's left to do well we have to
go in here and create all of our little
methods that are going to
our arithmetic for us so they're going
to return doubles because everything
we're working with here is a double and
we're just going to go add numbers and
what are we going to do well double
number one is going to be sent to it and
if you don't remember this is what I'm
doing right here it's up here add nums
well add numbers what's going to be sent
to it number one number two and how many
times that's what's going to be sent to
it so I get to come in here and just
create all those different guys double
number two and then int how many and
then we have to perform our arithmetic
and I'm going to create a double called
total give it a value of zero in the
beginning and I'm going to create an
integer I which is just going to be a
little incrementer for us and then I'm
gonna go a while I and there this is
just kind of like brainless sort of
calculating here I just looking for an
excuse to be able to show you as many
components as possible so plus and then
number one plus number two and then of
course don't forget to increment the I
and then at the end of course we want a
return total back to the program and
then that's the end of that except we're
going to need four of these guys because
we're forming four different types of
arithmetic so I'm just going to copy it
because not many things are going to
change here what's going to change well
this is going to be subtract numbers all
this other information is going to be
exactly the same except for what well
down here instead of an addition I'm
going to put a subtraction and I'm gonna
let everything else be exactly the same
because there's no reason to change it
and of course I could condense all this
into one method like I said this is all
done just to figure out ways of creating
components it's not really done for
anything useful so here we're going to
go multiply and in here I'm going to
change this to multiply now I'm gonna
leave everything else be basically the
same and then finally come in here and
go divided by numbers and then here
we're just going to go and put a
division inside there and that is all
the code you need to make this whole
entire thing work kind of a neat little
tool that I created here yeah and feel
free to experiment with it make it into
something a little bit more useful in
the next part of the tutorial I'm going
to cover all of the other remaining
components and then in future tutorials
I'm going to get into all of the other
different type of layouts that are
available to you using Java swing leave
any questions or comments blue otherwise
