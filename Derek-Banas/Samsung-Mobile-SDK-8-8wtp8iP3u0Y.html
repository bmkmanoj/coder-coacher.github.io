8 of my Samsung Mobile SDK tutorial in
today's tutorial we're gonna continue
covering the S Pen and all the different
tools it provides as well as finishing
up the application we started in part 7
of this tutorial series which if you
haven't seen it I provide a link in the
upper right hand corner I'm also gonna
cover how to create event listeners to
use with our toolbar as well as our
settings window and redo and undo and
then we're going to reach out to the
picture gallery open it up select images
and then return them to our app using
startactivityforresult
and on activity for result which of
course I will also be covering and this
is all brought to us because of the
Samsung smart app challenge in which up
to 12 winners are going to divvy up 1.1
million dollars in prizes and I provided
information in the description on how
you can enter as well as how you can
enter to win a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 or
103 Samsung Galaxy gear or watches which
I am giving away ok so here is our app
this is the guy we are going to finish
up this time and basically what I need
to do is just set up the event listener
so when people click on the pen eraser
undo/redo or the image background
grabber or whatever you want to call it
it's actually going to do something so
this part of the tutorial is going to
make all of these different things work
so let's get into it ok so I'm just
gonna carry on from where I left off in
the last tutorial what we're gonna do
here is we are going to call an outside
method which we're gonna create here in
a second which is gonna set all of our
default settings for our pen as well as
our eraser and like I did previously I'm
going to call this initiate setting info
and so we know exactly what this guy
does I'm just gonna create it right now
come down inside of here and I'm gonna
go private void there it is and I'm just
gonna set the defaults for our pen and
eraser and to do so I'm gonna go S Pen
setting and info and info is equal to
new just gonna copy this so I don't have
to retype it there we go let's scroll
this up so we can see it a little bit
better and then for our pen I'm going to
set our default color to blue by going
color blue
and then also I'm going to set the
default size for our stroke to ten call
the pen surfaceview
and then call pen setting info and pass
this new information to it and then call
pen setting view and set that
information as well there there we are
now I'm going to do basically exactly
the same thing for our eraser so call
setting eraser info call this eraser
info equal to new got that all set up
scroll that up a bit and then just go
eraser the eraser doesn't have many
things to set but it does have a size
and I'm gonna set that to 30 and then I
basically just have to pass this
information to the surface view as well
as the eraser setting view set eraser
and then pass a racer change this to
eraser and then set this to eraser and
there you go now you know exactly what
initialize setting info is going to do
for us now I need to set the method
that's gonna handle color changes so I'm
gonna call s pen surface view again and
set color picker listener and this is
going to be for our pen pass it the
color picker listener which we're going
to create here in a second so I'm gonna
create it right now just copy this come
down here come inside of here and then
we're gonna go private and it's gonna
return an S Pen color picker listener
paste that in there is equal to new s
pen color picker listener and let's just
go and put this on the next line in
there and then create all this in line
raw send me : right there yes so say hey
you need to implement some unimplemented
methods okay just do that for me click
on it there it is and then this is
actually going to be passed caller and
then this is going to be x and y so just
change those to x and y then i'm going
to get my settings changes set in the
settings view and save them to my pen
object I'm just going to go and check to
make sure that the pen setting view is
not equal to null and then I'm gonna go
s pen setting and info pen
is equal to and then call pen setting
view and get info to retrieve that
information and then attach to an info
the color that was passed to this and
then pen setting view set the info for
it to the changed and information and
that is all we're gonna have to do now
that is going to handle the event in
which the color for our stroke was
changed and actually it's gonna change
for the color or the size of the stroke
and a whole bunch of other different
things so basically if the setting
window is open that's gonna be called
now we're gonna have to create the
method it's gonna handle history changes
because we're gonna do undo and redo in
this application as well so call the
page dock set history listener because
that is where things are going to be
undoing and redoing inside of the page
dock remember the page docks or inside
of the note docks and this is gonna be
called history listener which of course
doesn't exist either so we're gonna come
down inside of here again and we're
gonna call private it's going to return
a history listener and M history
listener is the name new and like I said
this is gonna handle changes of the
state for undo as well as the redo
button whenever there it and of course
those changes are gonna occur only if
there is an option to do so in the
history stack and this is of course a
history listener create this in line
just like for put our semicolon down
here it's gonna say hey we need to
implement some methods no problem add
them it's gonna add them in there for me
so I don't have to remember them and on
commit we can just ignore I don't know
just leave that in there and then on
renewable this is actually going to be a
reference to the page so let's just
change the name to that this is going to
be renewable boolean and then basically
if the redo button is gonna be hit we're
gonna say redo button sets enabled and
whatever renewable is which was passed
into this method no basically gonna do
exactly the same thing for undo paste
that in there and this is going to be
undo button set enabled and let's just
set this to page and redo able just like
we did before so this is gonna be paid
and this is gonna be whatever it should
be set to and like I said this is
basically just gonna handle if there's
nothing left undoing the history then we
want to disable the button if there is
something that can be undone we want to
enable the button and then we're gonna
do exactly the same thing for the redo
button so we got those set up I'm back
up inside of here now we're gonna do
something similar to make the Settings
window or settings view for our racer
work so call a racer setting view and
set the eraser listener and this is
gonna be eraser listener and of course
it doesn't exist either so we're gonna
create it so just scroll down inside of
here again there we go now I'm just
gonna catch whenever the eraser icon is
clicked on so private it's gonna return
an event listener an eraser listener is
equal to and then just to go down the
next line new event listener and guess
what throw the semicolon in say hey I
want to implement them on implemented
methods there they are
let's open them up there that is and
then whenever it's clicked on we are
going to allow the user to erase all the
objects on the current layer and to do
that we just go S Pen page doc remove
all objects if it's all we need to do
and then we go and do the same thing for
the surface view we just need to call it
and say update okay don't go back into
on create way up here where is it there
it is basically just want to initialize
all the icon images and add listeners
for them so we got n button is equal to
cast it to an image listener or an image
view fine view by ID of course it's our
dot ID dot and it's gonna be pen button
let's just come in here and find it
there's pen button and then add a
listener to it set on click listener and
then we're gonna have to create this guy
click listener which we will do here in
a hot second copy that come after this
initialize settings it doesn't matter
where we put it really private vinyl on
click listener pen button click listener
is equal to new on click listener throw
in our semicolon it's going to say add
on
methods no problem there we go and
basically on click what we're gonna do
here first is to check if the current
tool is the stroke or the pen tool
whatever II want to refer to it as and
we can just call the surface view to
find that out
get tool type action that is being used
am tool type and we're gonna check if
it's equal to our action stroke or the
stroke tool or the pen tool or whatever
you want to call it and surface view has
that stored as action stroke there it is
we then want to check if the pen
settings window is open do that by just
go in pen setting view and asking if it
is shown and if it is since the pen tool
was clicked on we want to close it set
visibility to go on there it is now it's
not showing else if it's not showing on
the screen and they click on the pen
tool like we showed in the application
we're gonna say that we want it to be
shown so set View mode S Pen setting and
layout dot View mode and now will be
shown so there it is otherwise there's
another else situation and that is that
the pen settings tool wasn't being used
and on top of that the pen settings
window was not being shown in that
situation we want to change to start
using the pen tool so we'll go select
button and change it to our pen button
and then go S Pen surface view and set
our tool type and then it's gonna be the
action stroke that we had right here so
that is the name for our pen there it is
oh and we also want to go in here and
separate these so this else is actually
a reference to that guy right there okay
so now we have those separated no we can
get rid of this one right here and then
we're just gonna have to create select
button here which is gonna be called to
set the button sent as active on our
toolbar while making all of the other
ones inactive let's just go way down the
bottom here throw it in right here so a
private this is basically for looks here
so that we have the buttons active or
inactive properly and we're just gonna
say hey pen button set selected to false
we say hey eraser button set selected to
false i set both of them to false the
undoing
new buttons are going to be handled on
their own and this is button like this
and then for the view that was passed in
here set selected to true for that one
that's the one that we won't selected
and then we want to call and close both
the eraser and the pen settings views if
either one of them are open and since we
have that set there we might as well
just go close them right now and we're
gonna do that by calling private void
closed setting view and then calling
eraser setting view set visibility to s
pen surface view dot gone just like we
used before and then we're gonna do
exactly the same thing for pen setting
view so or that in there change this to
pen setting view set visibility to go on
as well and that's all we're gonna need
to do for that so now we need to go back
up inside of on create and do pretty
much exactly the same thing for our
eraser button and add an event listener
for it as well okay so took me a little
bit longer than I would have expected to
finish its application so what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna hold this off into part
nine and then guarantee gonna finish the
whole entire application in the next
part of this tutorial
