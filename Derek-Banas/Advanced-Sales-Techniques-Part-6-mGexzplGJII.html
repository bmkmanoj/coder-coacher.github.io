6 of my sales and closing strategies
tutorial today I'm going to talk about
closing techniques and handling
objections first I'm going to cover
buying signals before you present your
plan you definitely want to make sure
that the customer is ready to buy when a
customer is ready to buy they will start
acting as a participant rather than a
spectator for example they'll start
playing with the product they also will
start looking at the product or service
contract very closely they'll start
asking you questions about delivery and
if they ask about payment options you
know they are ready to buy the product
they also ask questions about the
contract tell you others would love this
start a green with the benefits you
describe ask how it works and ask if
they can try it
the best way to handle objections is to
answer them during the sales
presentation you will never cover every
objection but understand that if the
prospect didn't have any interest in
your products they wouldn't bother to
object they raise objections to gather
more reasons to buy if they give an
objection for why they won't buy respond
simply by saying so what you're telling
me is if I prove I can overcome that
objection then you'll buy right of
course put in the whatever they said not
overcome the objection if they say I'm
going to look at your competitors tell
them you'll help them with that right
now ask what company they want more
information on and then present them
with the data you have gathered an easy
way to get negative information on your
competition is to contact the Better
Business Bureau if they have an
unbelievable offer from a competitor
that you suspect to be a bait-and-switch
tactic you should contact a competitor
on the phone while the client is there
and compare apples to apples you also
need to make sure the offer is for real
and that the offer is in your clients
best interest if it is either match the
offer or tell them to take the competing
offer the client will love you for it
and refer your business in the future if
they state they can't afford it what you
need to do is prove how affordable the
product is through payment plans by
describing the cost over a monthly
weekly and daily basis or over the money
that will either make them or save them
if they say they need to talk to their
spouse you should try and avoid this by
getting the decision makers there ahead
of time if you're not certain that all
the decision makers are at the table you
should head off this objection in the
beginning you can do this by
acknowledging that they are the decision
makers
the meeting tell them it's refreshing to
work with someone that knows what they
want state you appear as a person that
just wants a fair deal and if they feel
the deal is fair they'll take advantage
of it and they know it is important in
life to be able to make the right
decision on their own without others
telling them what to do if they state
they have a friend in a business ask the
person respectively so you're telling me
you'll do business with your friend if
my offer is equal or less than your
friend obviously you'll definitely do
business with your friend if they have a
better offer but I also see you as a
person that is open to doing business
with someone else if that offer is in
your best interest right I would think
your friend would also want you to do
what's best for you and if he couldn't
offer you a better deal than I offer you
he'd tell you to do business with me
also write in a general objection such
as I'm buying because if you have a
definite solution for their objections
seal the deal say so what you're telling
me is if I have a solution for your need
you'll say yes to me today right and
then talk about the objection don't talk
vaguely or you could also say if I get
you whatever your item is you're trying
to sell at this price you'll buy today
right remember you always want to be
assuming they're gonna buy or if I get
you this feature you'll buy today right
every day people make important big
decisions in a snap the reason most
people give the objection I need to
think about it is because they sense you
don't believe they should make a snap
decision prospects often mimic both your
excitement and your hesitation most
sales are lost to this objection because
you hesitated when you were about to
give your clothes you must be 100%
behind your product throughout your
sales call if you're not you will get I
need to think about an objection
throughout the call you must talk in
affirmations you'll love whatever
product or service you're selling you're
going to I know you'll if you affirm
they will enjoy the product or service
throughout the call and through the
clothes you don't need to worry about
this objection or most objections at all
also start out the sales call by stating
that you know their time is valuable
also that your time is valuable tell
them you want them to promise you one
thing
after you have presented your solution
to them you ask only that if it works
for them they say yes to the idea and if
the idea doesn't work for them say no
and you
on your way now ask again can you
promise you'll do this one thing for me
I used to start most of my presentations
off like this and most of the time
people would say yes they would do this
one thing for me and if they did do that
I knew that I was more than likely gonna
make the sale in part 7 of my sales and
closing strategies tutorial I'm going to
cover closing techniques and multiple
different closes till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
