9 of my learn to program series in this
part of the tutorial we will learn about
object oriented programming with Python
that will bestow upon you godlike power
to create pretty much anything you can
imagine however if you have not watched
the previous parts of this tutorial you
definitely should because this is
becoming a tutorial that is getting
progressively more complex as it
continues and you may be lost and I
provide a link to all of the different
videos in this series in this video
right here on your screen as well you
will find a transcript and all the code
from this video in the description
underneath the video we'll start off by
creating a simple dog than a square and
then we will create two warriors that
will fight until one is dead so it
should be fun and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it ok so everybody thinks
object-oriented programming is
complicated whenever they first start
out with it but it it really isn't just
think about it what we were creating are
objects and real world objects all have
two things they have attributes and they
have capabilities well in
object-oriented programming you are just
going to define these attributes and
these capabilities so let's use a dog
for example because we will be creating
a dog object what attributes does a dog
have well a dog can have a height it can
have a weight it can have a favorite
food what type of dog capabilities are
there well a dog would have the
capability to run to walk to eat all
right so what we need to do is just
define these attributes and capabilities
now the only thing that complicates this
at all is inside of object-oriented
programming attributes are called fields
yes I know it's silly and if I ever
invent my own language I will instead of
calling these fields I will call these
attributes and the capabilities are
called methods another name for methods
is a function which you've already seen
functions but we must call them methods
because it's object-oriented programming
also fields are basically
just variables which you've also seen so
far so what we're going to do now is
jump in here and we will create some dog
objects now a dog object is created from
a template and that template is called a
class and what will you do in these
classes you will define the attributes
and capabilities of your dog object and
to create a class for your dog you just
type in class and dog with uppercase
letters and then you start defining now
whenever you first create a dog there
are probably some things that you would
like to set such as its name its height
and its weight whenever it is first
created you will create these things in
the init method and we are going to
define it just like we define all of our
other different functions and first off
what you're going to pass inside here is
self up created it for me already and
you may be confused by self well self
just allows an object to refer to itself
just like you would refer to yourself as
my so you would refer to my height my
weight my favorite food self is exactly
the same as that why would we use that
well we are going to be able to create
very custom dogs such as the dogs spot
well we are going to create spot using
the template or class that is defined
here but we must create the class before
we name spot and this gets into the
whole chicken or the egg sort of
situation we cannot create a spot dog
until we create a template that defines
how to create dogs hence the use of the
word self so if you have any confusion
about that leave a question in the
comment section I answer all my comments
and I'll be happy to clear anything up
you may have what we're then going to do
is to define what is going to be passed
inside of here I'm going to define
defaults so the name is going to be
nothing if they don't pass anything into
it I'm basically setting it up like this
just as a default so that we can create
a dog without necessarily providing a
height or a weight and that is the
reason why I
default values inside of there now what
we need to do is say my or self name is
going to be the name that they passed
inside of here also we're going to do
the same thing for height and self
weights is going to be the weight that
they passed inside of here so we have
also defined the attributes of our dog
now we need to define some of its
capabilities and how we will do that is
remember we wanted our dog to run and
we're going to define that and self is
inside of there and we could do
something like print the dog runs and
what we're going to do is then call
format on this and get the dog's name
and how you do that is by using self and
name and we can create a whole bunch of
these different guys let's also give the
dog the capability to be able to come in
here and eat and if it had a favorite
food defined inside of here it would be
able to say it ate that but I'm just
going to say the dog eats and then we
can come in also and say that the dog is
going to bark so here we are
create a dot and just say barks so
really simple don't worry we're going to
get really complicated here in a moment
now what we're going to do is we're
going to define our main method which
we've talked about previously this is
where all the execution occurs and we
come down here and we call from main to
execute remember even though we have
these functions and classes and so forth
and functions inside of these classes we
are not going to execute them the first
thing that's going to be executed is
this guy down here because it's not a
function so inside of here we can create
a new dog object remember I said I want
to create spot how we create it is refer
to it with the dog with the uppercase D
and then we're going to pass inside of
it the name you don't pass in self that
gets passed in there automatically and
let's say it's 66 and 26 we can then
come in here and just call for spot two
bark just by doing this and our and you
can see spot the dog barks and
automatically through
bar spots name inside of there and
likewise we can come in here and create
as many different dogs as we would like
let's say we want Advisor we just come
in here and go dog like this and however
if we would go and say that we want
Bowser to do something let's have Bowser
bark because we haven't defined a name
for it it's just going to say the dog
barks so there is a very very quick
rundown and the basics of
object-oriented programming using Python
now what I'm going to do is show you
what are called getters and setters and
explain exactly why they are useful now
getters and setters are going to be used
to protect our objects from assigning
bad field values to them or also to
provide improved output so we're going
to create another boring one here we're
going to create the warders here in a
moment don't worry about it so we'll
create a class called square we of
course are going to come in here and
initialize this guy and self of course
is going to be inside of here and we're
going to have this be height and we're
going to put a default value of zero
inside of there and we are also going to
have width and zero inside of there as
well we can then assign it to the actual
shape object by getting the path the
value that was passed in there for the
height as well as the width and then we
are going to define a getter now what we
need to do first is go property and this
is going to allow us to refer to these
individual fields inside of here to get
these values we will then say height and
self is going to go in there
automatically and then we could do
something like to improve our output you
could do something like retrieving the
height and just have that be something
that gets printed on the screen whatever
the user decides that they need the
height then likewise we could return the
height value by going self and dot and
then you're going to put two underscores
underneath of there because this is
going to be a private field we're going
to try to protect our data and that is
it so this is going to be the function
that's called any time a user for your
where's is going to require the value
for the height now likewise we are going
to create a setter and that is going to
protect us from putting bad data inside
of our squares first thing we need to do
is go at height and define this as our
setter and then define height so and the
value that is going to be passed inside
of here now let's say we want to protect
height from receiving a bad value for
example we want to make sure that the
value passed in is a digit what we could
do to guarantee that that would work
that way
is we could say if value is digit you've
seen this function before well if it is
a digit then what we want to do is store
it inside of height so to do so we'll go
self dot underscore two times and height
is going to be equal to the value that
they sign in if however they try to pass
in a value that is not a digit what
we're going to say is please only enter
numbers for height and it will not
assign the value in that situation so
hopefully you can see there how that is
providing us a way for us to protect our
data likewise we're going to do exactly
the same thing for width so paste that
in there and then here we'll just change
all these to whit so we'll say with
retrieving the width change this the
width change this the width this the
width again wit da da da and width all
right so we have our getters in our
setters all set up for both height and
width and now something that would be
useful to do with our shape is to do
something like get the area so we will
come in and we will create that guy and
here we will just return and we're going
to convert these from strings into
integers and we'll refer to them with
two underscores and multiply that times
again int and self dot two underscores
and the height now we can come down here
after we've defined that and we can come
into the main method
and start creating everything so main
and we'll create a square and then we
will just create an empty square object
and then we will use the getters and
setters to set everything so we could do
something like height is equal to input
and ask the user to enter the height
likewise we could come in and ask them
to enter the width and of course make
sure you put your quotes inside of here
we can then call for our square object
to assign the height and what this guy
up here does what these guys do this and
then the property is it allows us to
refer to these values just as height
otherwise I'd have to come in here and
put that there
but now because we have property set up
here in this set up with setter we can
just refer to them the way that they are
likewise we are going to change or edit
our width and then we can also call for
this information to print out on the
screen so we could go height and call a
square again and to get the height call
together we could do it just like that
likewise we're going to also be able to
come in and do the same exact thing with
wit and width and then finally we can
also call the get area function so we
come in and say the area is and then to
call that guy we'll just go a square and
get area and after this of course we
want to call our main function to
execute and if we run it you can see
enter height we can type in 12 and our
width 12 and you can see right here
retrieving the height and we got 12
retrieving the width we got 12 and the
final area is 144 so there is another
rundown of another type of object that
we can create inside of Python and now
it is time for us to enter and create
our warriors and have them fight to the
death
okay so this is going to be sample
output from the program we are going to
create we're going to have a water
called Sam and a water called Paul of
course they're going to be user defined
and you can see here Sam is going to
attack Paul and do a certain amount of
damage both our warriors are
going to be equipped with both a sword
as well as a shield and the attacks are
going to be randomized so a certain
amount of an attack is going to that is
a random attack is going to hit a shield
which is going to block a random amount
of damage on our warrior and they're
basically going to take turns Sam's
going to tack Paul Paul's gonna stock
Sam Sam's going to attack Paul and over
and over again until one of the Warriors
dies and the other one is left
victorious you actually have enough
knowledge to create this what you see on
the screen right now
that would be a heck of a challenge and
if you'd like to pause your video and go
and see if you can make it go for it
otherwise I'm going to give you a couple
little hints here in regards to what we
want to do well basically what we're
going to need to do at least as far as I
see it is we're going to have to create
a warrior and a battle class because we
want to divide everything up just like
we like to divide everything up with
functions and like I said before
warriors will have names they're also
going to have health because we need to
know how much you know whenever one of
the Warriors dies so we're gonna have to
decrement that and they're going to have
attack and block maximums because we
need to know how much damage and how
much damage is going to be blocked and
so forth and so on so that's some of the
things we know attribute wise in regards
to capabilities they will have the
capabilities or the methods to attack
and block random amounts so those are
the attributes and the capabilities for
our warriors and it's just up to us to
create those things if we want to get
more specific into the attack what is
going to happen is we are going to
basically use a random function and I
think it would make sense random on its
own is going to give us a value of zero
point zero to one point zero and I think
that what we want to do is we want to
multiply that times whatever the maximum
attack is and then probably
well you know times times max attack and
that's going to give us a smaller
percentage of max attack and then maybe
we would like to come in here and add
0.5 to it just so the game doesn't go on
for a lifetime so something to think
about
likewise you know block will use random
as well and also use the plus 5 and this
will just be max block okay so that's a
rundown of how those two things are
going to work then we're going to have
our battle class and it's going to have
the capability of looping until one
warrior dies that's something we need to
do and then also warriors will each get
a turn and I'm just walking through the
whole process of thinking how that's
going to work to attack each other just
as you saw in the sample code right here
see same attacks Paul Paul sack Sam so
forth and so on so that's going to be
handled inside of a loop inside of a
method of some sort or another and then
you're going to have another function
that is basically going to handle the
attack phase so that function gets two
warriors one warrior attacks the other
and that's it because we don't want to
have repeat code so basically this
function is going to have one more
attack another and then inside of our
looping structure we will then say okay
the first word attack the other one now
we want to call this function down here
again and have that process repeat again
so one word attacks the other and like
we said up here there's going to be a
maximum attack and a maximum block that
is going to be defined and then we're
going to basically figure out who's
going to survive and who isn't going to
survive also I think it makes sense to
have the attacks and blocks the integers
because that's the way our output is see
it says ten health it doesn't say ten
point five health so just something that
I did there with our you know what we
were aiming to do and aside from those
tips right there I think that pretty
much narrows down exactly what we need
to do so once again you can pause the
video and create it otherwise I'm going
to come in here and show you just my
example of how we're going to create it
so what do we want to do here well we're
going to need to import a couple
different things we're going to need to
import random because we are going to be
using that and I'm also going to import
math because I'm going to need to use
couple different math functions now down
inside of here we're going to create our
warrior class
so we'll just go class and warrior and
of course we're going to have to
initialize our warrior so we'll go and
knit and what's going to be passed
inside of it well we already defined
that we're going to have a name and I'm
going to give it just a default name of
warrior we're also going to have a
health which I'm going to give a default
value of zero we're going to have an
attack maximum which is also going to be
zero it's going to be a very weak
warrior by default and the block max
which is also going to be equal to zero
then I just have to come in here and go
self name is going to be the name they
passed inside of it going to do the same
for health TAC maximum block maximum and
that's pretty good alright so then so we
got this out of the way so let's go and
get rid of all that stuff those are our
attributes then what do we need to do
well we're going to have to have the
capability to attack and block random
amounts so that means we need to create
a method
so we'll go define and let's just call
it attack works well for me and what
this is going to do is randomly
calculate the attack amount so I'll just
go attack amount is going to be equal to
so and that's going to be the attack
maximum and then I'll multiply that
times random and random and that's going
to give us a value put this inside of
there that's going to give us a value
between 0 and 1 and just so the game
doesn't go on for a lifetime I'm going
to increase whatever that is 5.5 and
then it's going to return that value so
attack them out likewise we're going to
do pretty much exactly the same thing
for block amounts we'll come in here and
we'll just
- as block and this is going to be block
amount which is going to be equal to
block max so I just changed this to
block max random random 0.5 everything
else there looks perfectly fine and then
I'll just get the block amount and throw
that inside of there and that's it
so I got all the capabilities or the
attributes of my warrior as well as all
of the capabilities or the methods for
my warrior to find and now what I need
to do well let's get rid of this let's
get rid of this and now we need to
create our battle class so we're going
to go class battle once again we're
going to come in here and have to
initialize this well actually you know
what I don't even think I do this
basically is going to work great as just
a basically a utility class which is
going to have the capabilities to loop
and then the capabilities to have the
Warriors fight against each other and
I'm going to come in and I'm going to go
define start fight and start fight
whenever it is called it is going to be
passed warrior 1 and warrior 2 what's
going to happen inside here well we're
going to continue looping until a
warrior dies and then we're going to
switch back and forth as the Warriors
attack each other so since I don't know
when I know I need to loop but I don't
know for how long I'm going to use a
while true in that situation just like
we always do whenever we come to a
situation which we want to do that and
then I'm going to say if self get attack
result which is a function I'm going to
create here in a second and I'm going to
pass in warrior 1 inside of there and
then I'm also going to pass inside of
there warrior 2 so there they go
likewise I'm then going to say if I get
a result sent back to me for game over
what does that mean that means I'm going
to print out on the screen game over or
I could just put you know whatever this
result is but whatever that works fine
and then I'm going to break out of my
wild true loop
likewise now I need to do the absolute
opposite using warrior 2 and warrior 1
so come in here and just change this to
two and change this to 1 and everything
else can be
be exactly the same and that leaves me
to the creation of get attack result
let's come down here out of the start
fight guy and this guy is not going to
require the use of self everything that
it needs is going to be passed inside of
these attributes right here in
situations like this this is truly what
we would call a class method meaning
that it is not tied to any type of
object it has no need to refer to self
all of the information it is getting is
going to be passed in the attributes
doesn't need to use self so what does
that mean that means it should be marked
as a static method doesn't have to be
I'm going to get more into static
methods in the next part of the tutorial
just wanted to introduce that but
basically what a static method is is it
is a method or a capability of the class
so let's say for example I just want to
get into this for a second just to
explain a little bit about static let's
say we are creating dog objects and one
of the methods inside of here let's say
one of the attributes is dog count and
dog count is going to be a field or an
attribute that is going to be
incremented every single time a new dog
object is created there's also going to
be a method inside of our dog object
that is going to call increments dog
counts and all this guy is going to do
is increment or increase the value for
dog count by one all right so that is
the whole purpose every single time a
dog object is created this method is
going to be called and this is going to
be increased by one well you may think
to yourself can a real world dog object
count the answer to that is no any time
you create a method or you have an
attribute that isn't directly related to
a real world object that you were trying
to model in that situation that thing
should be static and that's just a brief
overview of static if you're confused by
it at all don't worry about it and
explore the tutorial I'll get more into
how static works pretty the way we're
going to make this a static method
and we're going to come in here and
define get attack result it is going to
be past warrior one and warrior two I'm
going to call them warrior a and warrior
B because two and one are going to be
switching back and forth and I want to
avoid any confusion and now what I need
to do is just figure out what the attack
amount is going to be for this guy so
let's go here did uh let's get rid of
that we can refer to these two guys down
here so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say warrior a attack amount is
going to be equal to warrior a attack
and I'm going to call this guy up here
this one right here and it's going to
tell me what the attack amount is going
to be okay a random number very good
then I need to come in here and also
find out what warrior B's block amount
is going to be equal to and that is just
going to be warrior B and I'm going to
call block on it and it's going to give
me that random value then what I need to
do is find out what the damage to
warrior B is going to be and remember
that I want this to be set as an integer
if I don't do this it's going to have it
be a float and how I figure it out as I
say warrior a attack amount minus
warrior B block amount and that is how
we'll figure out how much damage the
warrior is going to be taking likewise
we're going to be continually looping
until warrior B in this situations
health is going to be equal to zero so
we want to find out what the health is
and how we find that out is go warrior B
and ask for its health and then subtract
from it the damage to warrior B and once
again the health amount is going to be
up here inside of our warrior Saye and
we set that and that's going to be
decremented for us if you have an order
time following get the code the
description and put that in front and
it'll be easier to follow here now all
that's left for us to do is to come up
here and print out these messages all
right so we know how the Warriors are
going to interact and we just have to
print out my
so we'll say print and we're going to
say attacks and deals damage and we'll
call format for this and we'll say
warrior a dot name put a column inside
of there and then we're going to come
down here so it's a little bit easier to
see what's going on and then we'll say a
warrior B and get warrior B's name and
then we want to get the damage to the
warrior and that's going to be printed
out likewise we're going to do the same
thing we're going to tell the wire how
much it's down so remember we come up
here fall attack Sam and deal seven
damage and then it's going to say Sam is
down to a certain amount of health so
we'll come in here and we will model
that so here we're going to get that is
down to this health and once again we're
going to say format and here we'll get a
warrior B name and then we'll go warrior
B and get warrior B's health now we have
to handle the situation in which we have
to pass back game over or some other
result that's going to allow us to end
our looping so we have to define if
warrior B's health is going to be less
than zero so we'll say warrior B and
health if it is less than or equal to
zero well in that situation we want to
say that the warrior is dead so this has
died and the other warrior is victorious
call format on this and then basically
just put the names in there again so
warrior be named and then warrior a name
and then likewise we want to come down
here and return game over otherwise we
want to say else and we can return
anything it doesn't matter what it is
we're only looking for game over we'll
just say fight again just as a result we
can throw inside of there well now we
get the test to see if I have any bugs
in my code well we're going to create
Maine if you have any questions leave
them down below I will definitely answer
them so what do we need to do well we
need to create two warriors so let's
create Maximus I don't know if I spelled
that right but that's how he spells it
so that's good
and we're going to create a warrior and
Maximus is going to be the name for our
warrior he is going to have a total
health of 50 he is going to have an
attack value of 20 and he is going to
have a block value of 10 remember those
are maximums and we're going to have him
fight up against goal axon I don't know
there's collects on and relax on and
let's make them be equal to each other
then what we need to do is since we have
our warrior set up we need to create our
battle object and we'll just go battle
like this and then quite simply to start
the battle we're going to say battle and
we're going to call start fight and then
we just pass in Maximus and then we will
pass in Galax on and that is it nice and
neat we know where when we look at main
we know we're creating two objects and
that are going to be warrior types we're
going to create a battle we're going to
start our fight and then the fight is
going to end and we'll call main and
we'll see if I have any errors in my
code run nope don't have any errors in
my code as far as I can tell let's take
a closer look and it says Maximus
attacks klaxon deals 18 damage black
stone is down to 32 health black stone
attacks Maximus does 6 damage
da-da-da-dah and so forth and so on and
who is the final winner
