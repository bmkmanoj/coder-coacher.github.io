my design patterns video tutorial today
we're going to talk about the state
design pattern so what is the state
design pattern it allows objects to
alter its behavior when its internal
state changes and in doing so the object
will appear to change its class just
like in previous design pattern
tutorials this one's all about
composition and you're going to have
three main parts and this is going to be
probably the most confusing slide you
see in this whole entire presentation
and of course tons of code is going to
follow this first you're going to have
what is called the context or the
account what it's going to do is
maintain an instance of a concrete state
subclass that is going to define the
current state and if that makes their
sense - it will when I start showing you
pictures here in a second then you're
going to have the state which defines an
interface for encapsulating the behavior
associated with a particular state of
the context and then you have the
concrete state each subclass is going to
implement a behavior associated with a
state of the context so let's look into
some pictures and make sense of this all
right
in this example I'm going to talk about
an ATM machine now what you need to
think about is what are all the states
or possible situations an ATM is going
to find itself in now I really dumb this
down to make this easy to understand but
basically an ATM is going to have
roughly four states it either has a card
inserted or it doesn't have a card
inserted it has the correct pin entered
and it either has cash or it doesn't
have cash in this situation we're able
to combine everything down to the point
where it has no cash now whenever you're
trying to implement this state design
pattern you want to try to get as few
states as possible otherwise things can
get quite confusing then what you want
to do is think about all the different
ways the user can use the ATM they can
insert a card they can eject a card they
can insert a pin and they can request
cash and that is going to be the basis
of how we're going to implement this
state design pattern and here you see
the actual implementation here is going
to be the interface this over here by
the way is the context which we talked
about previously if you want to rewind
and look at that again but this is the
interface that everything is going to be
based off of and what did I do here I
just
listed all the methods that a user is
going to be able to do in regards to
using a ATM machine then from that I'm
going to take all the possible states
and throw all those methods inside of
these states so these three states down
here are also going to have these
methods inside of it and then based off
of which state or class is going to be
defined insert card is going to do
different things based off of what it is
then over here what you're going to do
is you're going to store the current
state in ATM state and then you're going
to define all these different classes
right here and then you're just going to
simply based off the state of the ATM
machine change this value up here also
we're going to monitor inside of a field
whether there is still cash inside of
machine and also we're going to monitor
using a boolean whether the correct pin
number was entered then on top of that
what we're going to do is allow the user
to change the state based off of things
that go on over inside of here and
that's what's going on with set ATM
state and then these guys insert card
eject card insert pin and request cash
what they were going to do is whenever
they're called simply send the user to
the specific method that is specific to
this state that is set here now
hopefully you're getting about 30
percent there and understanding the
state design pattern so now we're going
to get into the code and explain it step
by step
okay so we're into the code area and the
first thing we're going to do here is
define our interface which is going to
be called ATM State Java and all of the
code is underneath the video and you
should probably get it because then you
will totally understand this stuff so
like I said before what are we going to
do here well we're going to define all
of the ways that the user is going to be
able to work with our ATM machine so
they're going to be able to insert a
card they're going to be able to eject a
card they're also going to be able to
insert a pin and then we're just going
to go in here and go int n entered and
then they're also going to be able to
request cash and this is also just to be
simple here I'm just going to have this
be an int because I've never seen an ATM
shoot out pennies and there you go there
is your interface that's all you're
going to have to do with this guy
now what I'm going to do is go into ATM
machine Java and start playing around
with the context or the account that we
refer to right here see context account
that's going to be our actual ATM
machine so back to the code alright now
inside of ATM machine we're going to
define all our different states and I
haven't defined these yet so error
message is going to pop up all over the
place so we're just going to go coffee
that and there's basically going to be
four states so it's going to have halves
card and then there's going to be no
card and then we're going to have as
correct in and then we're going to have
ATM out of money so those are going to
be our different guys we're going to
work with and then this the actual ATM
state that's going to be stored inside
of here is going to change its state
value based off of conditions then we're
going to go into cash in machine and
just again just keep the simple I'm
going to set this to 2,000 and then
we're also going to have a boolean
inside of here I sense a correct pin
entered and I'm going to start off with
false because you know there's no pin
entered whenever they first start and
then we're gonna go public ATM machine
create a constructor for this guy and
then we're going to have all of these
guys initialize themselves so paste that
there and then let's just get rid of all
that okay so now we just have to
initialize them is equal to new as card
and that's going to be past this which
is a reference to itself
da-da-da-da-da-da and this is going to
be no card and then we're going to
define these in a second here and this
is going to be as pin and then this last
one is going to be no cash and then
we're going to also come in here and go
ATM state and give ATM state an initial
state of no card stick with me here if
you're not quite getting it it'll catch
on it's all composition just like before
and then we're going to come in here and
go if cash in machine is less than 0
ATM state is going to be equal to ATM Oh
money and then we need to set all of our
different states so we're going to also
allow them to change the ATM states
meaning the other states whenever
certain actions occur like if we run out
of money we're going to change our state
to no cash
so new ATM state and that's going to be
passed over new ATM state and that'll be
set and then we're going to go public
void set cash in machine we're going to
have to allow them to set the value for
cash in machine so that we also know if
we're running out of money and that's
just gonna be cash in machine is equal
to new cash in machines
the only thing confusing about this is
the number of different classes you need
just like most design patterns if they
hang you up you know the reason why is
you're using more classes than you're
used to and that's just something you
have to work with and get over because
anyone who's new to writing more
advanced code is going to have a little
bit of a problem struggling with writing
so many classes but ultimately it'll
make your code better and it will make
everything much more understandable
because look how simple this is and then
what we're going to do is we're just
going to pass it to the right state see
ATM state is going to be changing and
the way that ATM state is going to be
changing is with this guy right here
so all this guy is going to do is take
whatever you send to it and pass it
along to the new state that is being
defined by the ATM and that's you know
either
I have card I don't have a card I have a
pin or I have no cash okay so don't let
that confuse you then we're going to go
eject card and then what's this going to
do it's just going to pass it to the
right place like that and we're going to
be going to be doing the same thing over
and over again here for all the possible
ways that the user can interact with
this so we're going to go request cash
and then this is going to be in cash to
withdraw and then what's going to go on
basically you're going to pass that to
the method that's defined in the current
state that it's defined and then the
final thing is insert pin
and then this is just going to be an
integer and it's pin entered and these
are all the things that are defined in
ATM state say right there so that's all
that's going on with that
I just need to define them right and
then of course pass this along to the
right method inside of that class that
we're going to define here in a second
and then we're also going to have to
provide a way for them to get the
current state so we're going to say get
yes card state meaning do they have a
card or not returned as card so that's
going to allow them to change States as
well get this is going to be no card
state and then this is going to be
changed to no card get as pin and this
is going to return as correct in then
the last one is going to be get no cash
state which is going to return a
reference to the object that we create
ATM out of money and all of these guys
just come from here so those are just
going to return those state objects that
you define there that's all these four
things do right there so get rid of all
that white space and we are done with
the context and of course get rid of
that and get rid of that there we are
I'll save and everything is looking
dandy except for the fact that we need
to create all of these guys has card no
card has pin and no cash so let's go
into has card dot Java and there we are
and you can see here implements ATM
state and a foot put the mouse over this
it's going to say Adam unimplemented
methods and then I just need to come in
here and think about logically what I
need to do in all these different
situations now one thing I'm going to
have to do is I'm going to need to store
the context which is the actual object
that I'm going to be working with here
and also I'm going to have to come in
here and go public as card which is
going to be when they pass over the ATM
object that we are required to use so
that we're using the same ATM object and
not you know messing that up so we're
going to pass a reference to our ATM
machine over to this we're going to take
that whoops we're going to take this guy
and assign it to our temporary holding
cell make some changes to it
okay so if you have a card and then they
try to insert another card what are you
going to say this is all logic from now
on this is piece of cake no problem
totally understandable you're gonna have
to say you can't enter more than one
card say that's all you're done and
that's it that's all you need to do now
we don't need to change state because
well it has a card they tried to enter a
new card that the state didn't change
you just gave them a warning sign okay
so what are we going to do if they try
to eject the card in that situation
we're gonna print out a different
message let's just say card ejected
there we are
and then what are we going to do well
now we don't have a card so we're going
to need to change the state for our ATM
machine so we're going to go ATM machine
which comes from this guy right here and
then we're gonna have to go set ATM
state we need to change the state for
our ATM machine because it just changed
and to set it we're gonna go ATM machine
when you say get no card state pass that
back boom boo-boom and now the state has
changed and set ATM state is found we're
in ATM machine Java and if you scroll
down see set ATM state and how is the
state being passed right down here with
these guys say these get set it out of
that alright so let's get back in here
and continue fixing this off so that's
all we're doing is dynamically changing
the class based off of different actions
that are being performed so then they
come in and they say okay well I want to
insert a pin
well they inserted cards so that sort of
makes sense so now we're going to go pin
entered and we're going to check is it
equal to one two three four now I've
really again we're not checking anything
here rule sophisticated okay so let's
just say yeah they entered one two three
four and that is the correct one now you
could say something like if you're
correct in and then what are you going
to need to do well you're going to have
to change ATM machine you're going to
have to say hey the ATM machine correct
pin entered this guy right here
well it's false so they entered the
correct pin so now what are we going to
have to do well we're going to have to
come in and change that value so ATM
machine correct pin entered and we're
going to set it to true
all done and then of course da alright
so we got that set and then what do we
need to do well we need to change the
state for this and that state is going
to be gay get as pin done you just did
all that right away and then we're going
to come in and go else they entered the
wrong pin well we're gonna have to
punish them for that
and we're going to come in here to this
copy shoot that out there and we could
say something like wrong pin and we're
gonna make sure this is set to false I
don't know if that needs to be done that
way or not I cranked this code out
pretty quickly and then I'm just gonna
come up here doink and I'm gonna say
something like car dejected let's just
copy what that says up there and then
we're going to need to change the state
because remember we're in halves card
well if the cards ejected well what does
that mean well that means we're no
longer a has card state because we just
injected a card and make that go through
we're gonna go no get no card state
change that to that that's good and then
down here for request cache if they
request cash what are we gonna do that's
just giving them an error message and
say there enter in first okay
there are hash cards done so we're gonna
save that and we're gonna move on to no
card guess what we're pretty much going
to do the same thing so go to no card
add-on implemented methods click on that
that opens up and now you got to define
all the different things you want to do
here differently so let's just come in
here doctored I'm going to do this copy
that jump back over in the new car java
paste that in there because I need a
copy or a reference to the ATM machine
and this is just going to be changed to
no card so that's all fine and this is
going to be perfectly fine as well
now if there is no card and they enter a
card what are we gonna do we're gonna
have to print a message out to them so
on that message is gonna be please enter
a pen and then what are we going to do
we're gonna change our card state to yes
card state because we got card because
they just inserted a card so you know
that's great and then eject card well
what are we gonna do here well we're in
no card so that doesn't work so we're
gonna print out a message enter a card
first can't eject a card if they don't
give us one come down here and just to
make this simple I'm going to do the
same thing and record first because you
can't insert a pin until you enter your
card and then request cash is also going
to be exactly the same thing so just
coffee Don come and arm tada boom you're
done so there you are no cards done if
I'll save it so what happens whenever
they have a pen well that's where has
pinned our java comes in when jump
inside of here again come in here add on
implemented methods one Don with that as
pin that just simply means that they
entered a pin and it worked out gonna do
this and then we're going to change this
to has pin like that leave everything
else the same and then down here insert
card well that's going to be already
entered a card so I'm actually going to
copy this from that jump back over into
has pin they already entered a card and
they already entered a pen well guess
what we don't want another card set
shoot that in there eject card is gonna
do the same exact thing as has card did
over here so I'm going to jump over here
copy that and we're gonna give them the
card that they just entered even though
they also entered the right pin this is
all just pure logic insert pan well they
already entered the tricked pin so let's
just get rid of that and make this
simple already entered pin and then down
here request cache well they entered the
right pin so they should be able to come
in here and request cache so we're just
got to make sure they have enough cash
so we're going to say if cash to with
draw is greater than which is what they
passed over to us and then we're going
to go ATM machine and we're going to
check cash in machine to make sure
there's enough cash in our machine
before we go and start trying to give
them cash it doesn't exist and then
we're going to come on here give them a
message like this they tried to ask for
more cash than what we actually have so
we're gonna come in here copy that and
I'm gonna say something like don't have
that cash there you are and then I'm
gonna eject the card and shut set their
status back to no card else I'm gonna
give them a little message that tells
them how much cash was ejected so let's
just copy this paste that in there
and then I'm going to go cash to
withdraw + and say something like is
provided by the machine and then I'm
going to go into ATM machine and set
cash in machine
I'm just accessing that field back there
I'm going to go ATM machine dot cash in
machine - cash - withdraw so I'm going
to make sure that that is set up
properly and there we are and then we're
gonna go your card is ejected and then
set the status back to get no card so
pretty simple there and then maybe as
one additional little change we could
throw something in here like if ATM
machine cash in machine is less than or
equal to zero then we're going to also
come in here and change the state for
our ATM machine and that state is going
to be set to get no cash state see the
ATM machine is officially out of cash
and I think that's it yes it is ok so
file save that and then we just need to
go into the last thing which is going to
be no cash dot Java this is going to be
really easy let's copy this guy right
here again we're gonna do pretty much
exactly the same thing paste that there
we got a copy of our ATM machine gonna
change this to new cash that is all
gonna stay the same and then no cash is
gonna say hey you need to implement some
methods well okay here we are just
implemented them and then this is gonna
be really simple because I'm basically
going to be giving it the same message
okay so if they insert a card and we
don't have any money in our ATM machine
what are we gonna say we don't have
money okay so we're just gonna print
that out that might cause a run on the
bank but either way that's what we're
gonna to eject the card well we're just
in say we don't have money you didn't
enter a card so you know both ways we're
not gonna be able to do anything for you
insert pen we don't have money and keep
it extremely simple across cash guess
what we don't have any money we're going
to of course keep everything set to no
cash
because that's very important we have no
reason to change that so let's test it
out see if we did it right going to go
into test ATM machine here
I already did the code for this
basically what we need to do is just
create ourselves an ATM machine we need
to insert a card eject a card insert a
card enter a pin request cash insert
card enter a pin and let's just see what
happens so it's executed and you can say
please enter a pin say insert card
that's what it shoots out card ejected
please enter a pin whenever they insert
the card again this time they entered a
pen say correct pin right there they
requested two thousand dollars that's
the maximum amount we have two thousand
provided by the machine automatically
ejects the card then you insert the card
and it says we don't have money and then
it comes down here and you enter our pin
and it says we don't have money so there
it is it's a state design pattern
anything didn't make sense leave a
question or comment below of course
requests are always welcome of the last
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
