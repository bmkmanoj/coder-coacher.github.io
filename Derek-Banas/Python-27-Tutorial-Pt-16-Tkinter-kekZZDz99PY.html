my programming with Python tutorial
before you watch this tutorial you most
definitely should watch part 10 because
I'm going to do a lot with file input
and output in this tutorial and I do not
have the time to exactly go through all
the things that I'm doing with it but in
this tutorial specifically I'm going to
cover how to bring in files using TK
interface edit files and then save any
changes that were made and a whole bunch
of other things you can do with TK
interface well to start off I'm of
course going to bring in the TK
interface module as well as the message
box module here and I'm going to start
creating my app and definitely you
should watch the previous tutorial to
this because I go over all the different
things and I'm doing here and this is
just the name of my application what's
going to show up in the title bar and
then I'm going to define how big what my
application to be meaning size wise make
it five sixty by four sixty plus 200
plus 200 and then here I'm going to show
you how to make a menu bar using TK
interface going to give it a name you
have to use the menu method here and
pass it the name of your app which in my
case is app and here I'm going to define
my file menu so like I have a pure file
I'm going to define that right here you
just pretty much just type exactly what
I have here on the screen
of course all the codes available at new
think-tank comm for free in here I'm
specifically defining a new label that
I'm going to call open grades what it's
going to do is when somebody clicks on
it it's going to pull in a specific file
and it's going to do that by calling a
method I'm going to create here in a
minute called open grades then I'm going
to create another entry what I'm doing
here is I'm creating these guys all of
these different entries right here
you're going to see that in a minute
this is going to open a file that's
going to list the students ranked in
order based off of their performance on
a test I'm going to name the method
that's going to call right like that and
if I want to put a separator see these
are separators right here between these
different things if you wanted to put
one of those in there just call the add
separator
right inside of there and then this
final one is going to provide the users
of your application with the ability to
quit your application which is useful
and you do not need to define this this
is something that's built into TK
interface and then after you get all of
those individual pieces defined you want
to call the Cascade method which is
going to wrap them up in the menu bar
option and I'm going to call it file so
I'm gonna give it another name label is
equal to file comma u equal file and
that's going to create my first one if I
want to create an additional one like
help drop-down menu here call this help
menu and call it whatever you want you
have to use the menu method then call
the add cascade I'm going to keep this
guy real simple I'm just going to put in
about me in here I'm gonna call another
method called about me then I'm going
again define here in a minute
and you help you and after I do all of
that I define all of the different
options I want to put in my menu bar I
call the config method and define the
name for my menu bar and then I want to
show you exactly what this will do if I
run it but I'm going to have to define
all of the different methods that I'm
going to be calling and just put pass in
here which I'm sure you know what that
means if you saw the other tutorials
open rank okay so I got all those
defined so if I run it you'll see when I
select it file opens up up here and
these guys don't do anything now because
the methods on it don't exist yet but
you can see there's help and there's
file and that's if you're running a
Windows PC you might actually see those
inside of your actual application it all
depends on which OS you're working with
but it's either going to show up up here
I'm going to zoom in up here or it's
going to show up right in your
application so there's a working menu
bar that I built using TK interface
inside of Python and let's run it again
and you can see I can go file and quit
and it actually kills the application
using that so that's useful but like I
said I'm going to make here a
application that's going to allow you to
edit student grade files and then save
that information so I need to come in
here before I close out my entire TK
interface here with the app
Lu I'm going to define a multi-line
statement and I'm going to call it about
student you call the text method
whenever you want to create a multi-line
statement about student you then use the
insert method to define any string you
want to put in there in this multi-line
statement just going to put that you put
anything in there you want and then I
just want to pack it like I did with all
the other widgets that I used in a
previous tutorial I call them the pack
method and now I got a multi-line
statement on there one of the other
widgets I haven't shown you is the
drop-down box so I'm going to create
drop-down box called student files and
I'm telling Python that this is going to
contain a string variable that's what
I'm doing with this line right here so
it's where I'm using the set method to
set the value of this information it's
going to be contained in the drop-down
box
to none by default and then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to define a
list and this list is going to be of all
the options I want in the drop-down box
student rank and an option menu is
actually the method you call when you
want to create a drop-down box and you
pass it the name of your application
the default strings that it can possibly
contain right here with student files
and then I'm going to put a star what
this is actually going to import is a
list this list right here that you
created that's what the star does it
actually allows you to import a
never-ending supply of arguments through
a list and if somebody selects something
in the drop-down box it's going to call
a file called open files and then just
be quick here I'm going to put the pack
statement at the end of it okay so this
right here is a is going to create a
multi-line widget inside of your
application and this is going to create
a drop-down box now I'm going to create
a button and you saw me do this in a
previous tutorial but I need a button
for everything to work the way that I
want it to work and the text that I want
to be shown on my button is going to be
save grades the width I'm going to leave
equal to 20 like I did previously
whenever it is clicked it's going to
call method called save grades and here
I'm going to define using the pack
method where I want my button to show up
on the screen being the bottom and the
padding that I prefer to give to my
button there you are so that creates a
button the multi-line list and a
drop-down box and all this stuff up here
creates your menu system okay so now all
we got to do to make this guy fully
functional will allow you to bring in
information from text files and be able
to edit and then save that information
is to create these methods what I'm
doing here is I'm going on telling
Python interpreter that I want to open a
file called student grades and I could
put an R in here saying I wanted to read
from the file but by default that's
exactly what it's going to do and then a
call about student which is the
multi-line statement that we created
down here below and I'm going to tell I
thought that I want to delete everything
that is contained inside of that
multi-line widget that's what that does
about student about student right here
this is the name multi-line widget
that's what I'm doing I'm calling the
delete method on it and I'm deleting
everything that is inside of it here I'm
going to create a new string that I'm
going to be saving all the information
that I get from the file that I have
just opened I'm going to iterate through
all the lines of text in that file and
stay saving them to student grade string
using shorthand notation here I then
after I open or bring in all that
information and store it as a string I'm
going to use the insert method to paste
it into the multi-line statement or
widget here I'm closing the file that I
pulled all that information from and
here I'm exiting from the method okay
well now I'm going to also do the same
thing for another file called student
rank so I'm just going to copy this
paste this into here and change grade to
rank okay and I know there's neater and
better ways to do this I'm well-aware
I'm doing this so these tutorials are
understandable more than perfect okay
now whenever you choose something from
this drop-down being students grade and
so forth and so on I'm going to call
command open files whenever this file is
or whenever this method is opened it is
going to be beat pass
whatever was selected in this drop-down
so whenever we define this method up
here I'm going to have to be able to
gather that information as it is passed
and then perform certain actions based
off of whether it's passed what I'm
going to do is just say if selection is
equal to student grades meaning a string
with the value of student grades is
passed I am going to call my open raids
method that I just created above else
again this isn't best practice but just
doing it I'm going to open open rank and
in this method will provide the option
to save any changes that were made this
is going to get the string that is in
the multi-line statement whether it's
been changed or not and save it to this
string called grade update then I'm
going to call for the file student
grades text to be opened for writing
that's why I have that W inside of there
and then here I'm at with this method
it's actually going to write to file
it's going to overwrite to file it's
going to copy all this new information
overtop of whatever exists there just so
you know if you wanted to append to the
end you'd put an A but in this situation
I actually want to overwrite that
information I want it to be deleted and
then I close the file because I don't
need it anymore and then for the about
Me section I'm going to call message box
yeah I'm just going to put hello
underside of there and return and return
and as long as I didn't mess anything up
here as I was typing that in this should
run which it looks like it has and as
you can see here here's the multi-line
statement I can come in here and hit
help about me and a little message box
opens up close that I can come in here
and say open grades and it goes and gets
all the information that's stored in the
open grades file and come down here in
the drop down box and pulling all the
information from the student rank area
and I could also come in here to the
grades area and let's say I change marks
scored 87 because I made a mistake and I
changed Paul score to 67 because I made
a error there and I can click on save
grades and then number 87 67 then if I
jump
/ to rank bring this back up and jump
back to grades you can see that it has
been changed so I show you here pretty
much how to change text file save text
files use different GUI elements how to
create menu systems how to bring message
windows up and a bunch of other things
so if you have any questions or comments
leave them below and I'm also kind of
wondering I was going to originally do a
tutorial on Django but because it's so
hard to set up on most of the major
hosting companies I'm kind of doubting
that it's going to be useful for anybody
out there who isn't already a hardcore
coder who probably already knows Django
and doesn't need a tutorial so I'm
looking for input from you guys on
whether to continue with the Python
tutorial and if so what specifically
should I cover understanding that
there's a lot of networking things that
literally cannot be done in a video
tutorial course that you complicate it
even this tutorial today might be too
complicated to actually go through
because this is a full working
application which you never see anybody
do in a 15 minute tutorial so I'm
looking for your input out there so till
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
