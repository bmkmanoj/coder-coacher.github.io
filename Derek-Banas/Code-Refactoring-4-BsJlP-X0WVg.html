4 of my code refactoring tutorial today
I'm going to finish up all the more
simple things because part 5 and there
afterwards is going to be much more
complicated so today I'm going to talk
about extracting methods and fields from
classes as well as taking primitive or
simple types and converting them into
objects and on top of that I'm going to
show you a bunch of a clip shortcuts to
make you code much faster so I have a
whole bunch to cover so let's get into
it okay so what I did here was I just
created a simple class called customer
I'm going to be doing a whole bunch of
different things with it just to save
some time I went and created a bunch of
different fields that would be common if
you were going to create a customer
class and I kept these were very simple
so we have strings a whole bunch of
strings we have an int and we have birth
date defined as a string and we're going
to be changing a whole bunch of these
different things based off of just
thinking through this now one thing I've
never showed you inside of Eclipse is
there's a very easy way to create your
getters and setters all you need to do
is right click anywhere inside of your
window and then come down here where it
says source and it will scroll over here
and you are going to click on generate
getters and setters now you're going to
be able to come in here and just select
all those different getters and setters
you want to be able to create you can
also come down here and define where
exactly the insertion point is going to
be inside of your code you could also
define public protected default and all
these other different things I'm just
going to leave it that way and hit OK
boom there you go you just saved
yourself a ton of time because all those
guys are going to be defined for you I
want to top of that another easy way to
generate some code is the right-click
and again go into source and then we're
going to come over here we're going to
generate ourselves a constructor using
fields and another one of these guys is
going to pop up I'm just going to leave
first-name lastname da-da-da-da-da and
then after set birthday you can have
these show up wherever you want gonna
leave it that way
you define a public protected blah blah
blah blah blah and then you hit OK and
boom now you have yourself a constructor
so that saves you an insane amount of
time and as this tutorial progresses I'm
going to show you a bunch of other cool
things you can do in regards to
cogeneration with eclipse now one thing
as we're looking through here because
this class is getting
way big one thing you might want to do
is to extract some of this information
to a class and of course move different
methods and fields over and to do that
what you want to do is you want to look
for different parts of the class data
that is going to go together now if I'm
looking at this something I can easily
see I could be able to extract would be
Street city state and postal code
birthdate also might be something I'd
like to extract and I could simply come
in here and extract all this out into a
new class called address so why don't we
just do that so I just cut that out of
there that's going to cause some havoc
down here with all these other different
methods that we don't have but either
way I'm gonna come down here and create
my address class now to create it I'm
just gonna go to class address and now
we can just paste in those fields that
we previously had up on top and now
using eclipse we can easily just come in
here and highlight address and again I'm
gonna go into source and generate my
getters and setters select all these
guys and hit OK boom now we got all
those guys don't really like it that way
I like my getters and setters to always
be defined after my fields personal
preference so there we are now I have
that all set up and then of course I can
also come in here and do the same thing
with the constructor just going to
highlight address find source again and
generate my constructor using fields ok
there we are there's the constructor and
I'm just gonna paste it down inside of
there now how are we going to address
the changes that have occurred since we
took address out of that class actually
it's extremely simple we're just going
to bounce up inside of here and we're
gonna go a private address and I'm just
gonna leave it as address except now I'm
gonna mark it as null and then these
guys I'm gonna take out so the get
Street and set street and city and all
these other different things I'm just
going to come in there and take those
out technically you can leave them in
there and just call address for that
information but I mean I don't really
see the point of breaking out this class
if I'm going to leave all those guys
inside of that so for now I'm gonna get
rid of that that just means I need to
make a couple little changes here so
there's the constructor that was
previously very very busy now I'm going
to be able to come right inside of here
get rid of that and then type in
address and address and there we go got
that all set up and then I'm also going
to be able to do the same thing here
take all these guys out of here type in
address is equal to address simple
enough and of course if I wanted to test
all this stuff Publix that it would main
and then here I'm going to define my
address of course let's just say I call
this Sally Smith address is equal to new
address and I could just have this be 1
2 3 Main Street Perry and all of this
code here is available in a link
underneath the video so feel free to go
ahead and get it so there we go now I
define my address inside of there it's
not going to be all that more
complicated to create and then if I just
want to define my customer Sally Smith
is equal to new customer of course then
here I'm just going to type in her name
slam in the address right there and then
the birthdate I could just put in
whatever I want because it's not going
to matter because it's just a simple
string which is going to change here in
a second and then of course if I want to
be able to print all this stuff out this
is where you start to see some problems
now the positive of accessing fields
through access or methods is that
subclasses can override the way that
fields are accessed and also of course
it helps protect fields inside of your
class the negative however is that your
code is hard to read as you're going to
see here now if I want to be able to
print all this information out say I go
customer name I'll have to go to Sally
Smith get first name Plus Sally Smith
and then click on get last name so
that's a lot of code which we're going
to see here in a second ways to shorten
add up one thing that would really save
us a lot of time since we already have
address set up here is to go down inside
of address and define our to string
method so I'm going to go a public
string to string and then just type in
return and I could type in get Street
get city get state and get postal code
and of course now I'm going to be able
to just jump up inside of here and if I
when I print out Sally Smith's address I
can just real quickly paste inside of
here type in customer address and then
follow that up with Sally Smith die
address I'll save it and you can see it
printed out a lot more information in a
lot less space
so that is the benefits of using two
strings versus using these accessor
methods which is kind of a pain and now
I'm going to do basically the same exact
thing using birthdate
now whenever you first start developing
many of your fields you're going to
represent them as primitives or strings
or just simple datatypes however as you
develop over time you're going to see
that there are numerous benefits to
developing these fields as custom
objects anywhere that that might make
sense and in this situation birthdate
definitely is going to make sense
instead of having it as a string which
is kind of worthless so I'm going to
define a class here birthday course that
hasn't been defined yet or created
that's going to change here in a second
bounce down here class birthday and then
inside of this guy we're going to create
an integer private month and a year save
ourselves some time to create those
getters and setters there they are and
then here on top of that we're also
going to create the constructor day
month in here and make sure that it
comes dead last set year it okay now we
have our constructor for the birthday
and this is going to provide us a ton of
different options now again instead of
using there's access or functions we
could do something like public string
get birth date and maybe we would
actually have the actual months come out
and all that but just to keep it simple
I'm just going to go return get day get
month each year of course and also once
again something that I used constantly
is to string which is going to do the
same thing in this situation and now
just like before we're going to be able
to jump up here and create birthday
birthday is equal to new and here since
everything's integers we're going to
define them as integers and then just
simply pass in Sally submits birthday
the way it should be done of course
we've changed this to birthday as well
inside of the constructor everything
else works and will seamlessly and then
once again you're going to be able to
say how easily we're going to be able to
go in here for Sally Smith and because
we have two strings set up we're going
to be able to execute this and it's
going to print out her name or address
and her birth date so there's a whole
bunch of ways to move fields and methods
and classes and convert simple valued
fields into objects and
and a whole bunch of different ways to
mess around and do things really really
quickly inside the clips and of course
we want to get rid of those two guys
everything from this day forward is
going to be much more complicated so be
prepared next time to bring your
thinking caps please leave any questions
or comments below otherwise till next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
