four of my wordpress News theme tutorial
where I will show you exactly how to
create this thing you see right here on
your screen the tutorial that preceded
this was the one where I created this
featured content slider that you see
right here on the screen and I provide a
link to that as well as part 3 of the
news theme and if this is a little bit
more and you want to take a bite out of
right now I also provide a link back to
a more basic theme tutorial that you
should definitely understand where you
try to make something this crazy first
thing you're going to want to do is I
always use what's called the blank
wordpress theme and you can find it
right here I provide a link underneath
of this video if you want to go get this
guy and you don't have it and it
literally is a blank thing if you
install it this is what it actually
looks like looks kind of messy basically
what it is is all the CSS everything is
stripped out of it's just the most basic
theme that you can possibly use after
you download the blank theme what I
always do is I come in here and I go
duplicate and then I'm going to give
this a brand new name I'm going to call
it n TT news theme to you can see that
it popped in right down here ok now i'm
going to start opening some of those
files up and jump into the code so what
we're going to do is open up some of the
files we're going to be playing with in
this part of the tutorial if you have
any questions or comments leave in the
comments section below alright so here's
themes and then I'm going to look for
ntt news theme two and then I'm going to
open up specifically functions dot PHP
header dot PHP and index dot PHP so
click open first place we're going to be
messing with is the header section and
in part three of this tutorial series we
actually created this straight HTML CSS
information that you see here and what I
got to do is actually transfer that
which is on the right side of the screen
over to the left side of the screen
sounds like a lot of work but it really
isn't so this is from a blank theme and
believe it or not you don't really have
to change that much up here even though
there's all this stuff we're going to
handle that later on we're going to
scroll down here until you see
stylesheet underscore URL with blog info
in front of it and if you can't see what
i'm typing here just watch this in high
def and full screen you'll be able to
see everything now blog info this guy
right here what this is going to do is
it's going to pull over the style sheet
for you why actually have to style
sheets
one being the regular style sheet and
then I have a second one called home dot
CSS well what I got to do instead I'm
still going to use all this information
here except inside of blog info what I'm
going to do is I'm going to type in
template underscore directory what
that's going to do is that's going to
say that I want blog info to return the
location for my template directory
inside of wordpress and then what I want
to do is just /c SS /home dot CSS and
that's the location for where that style
sheet is eventually going to go then
fluke over here under div ID page
wrapper well over here it says page a
wrap so what do I got to do I just have
to come in here and type in page wrapper
remember this is this straight HTML CSS
and writes on the screen this is the
theme we're working with on the left
side of the screen header over here is
an ID over here it's also a div with an
ID so I don't need to change any of that
here's an h1 tag with an idea of blog
title I'm just going to copy that from
on the right side of the screen paste
that inside of there I can leave
everything else the same and blog info
name what that's going to do is it's
actually going to return the name for my
websites over here do you think tank and
then this is the slogan part or the
description as WordPress calls it so
I've got to pull in those two different
things and also I have to pull in a
search tool that I want to use even
though it's not showing here it is
showing right here and if you want to
see what this theme looks like in real
life if you go to my investment services
com I have a dummy site set up there and
you can look at this it's all junk
articles and really nothing inside of it
but either way that's something you can
look at if you want to see what that
looks like alright so I got blog title
inside of here everything else is
exactly the same and we come over here
we see paragraph ID blog slogan over
here it's lifted listed as a class what
I want to change it to a paragraph
instead so again I'm just gonna copy
this over here and that's what a lot of
this is you put a lot of the work in the
HTML and the CSS and then everything
else goes nice and smooth I'm going to
close off this paragraph down inside of
here and then I want to pull in or
create that little search box that i
showed you before so i'm just going to
highlight this copy it this is going to
automatically pop in a dynamic search
form as you can see it's called get
search form and it's just going to stick
it right there on the screen and then
other thing I want to use is a menu
system at the top of the screen well
this is pretty much copy and paste every
single time it's going to be that pretty
much the same on all the time if you
want a standard WordPress menu to show
up on your screen just put in exactly
what i have here array tab and then i'm
going to type in theme location there's
a link to all this code in the underbar
and i always do this the same way just
type in theme location menu underscore
class drop-down comma container ID
navigation fall back CB this is
basically the function it's going to be
called if the menu fails and it's just
going to put up a junk sort of men you
like I said this is going to be copy and
paste code pretty much do the same thing
every time and we're going to close that
off jump down here and close off the ph
b section and headers done that's all
you need to do for the header section
all finish so we can actually file save
that and then let's jump over into index
i'm actually going to be trashing a vast
majority of this information and if you
don't know the index dot PHP file is
what is shown whenever somebody looks at
your blog okay so header is going to
stay exactly the same now here this is
called the loop and it basically loops
through all the posts and it prints out
information on those posts on the screen
well I decided I don't want any of this
stuff so I'm just going to select it all
and delete it all it's all gone the only
thing that's on here is good header and
what this get header do it gets whatever
is inside of hetero PHP which is what we
created previously so I'm going to go in
here again I'm going to scroll this guy
up to right where it says ntt featured
content because we have to print all
this stuff out dynamically okay and the
first thing that I'm gonna do here in
this part right here is actually pull
over the featured content plug-in that
we created in the previous tutorial all
the code that needs to show up for that
so I'm going to open this guy up the
index come in right here and I'm
actually going to copy all of that and
this is going to go inside of there and
this is never going to change it's
always going to be exactly the same and
then this guy right here what this is
going to do is it's going to pull in
information for my right sidebar now I
can get into actually creating all the
stuff that you see on the right side of
the screen as you can see here we're
talking about the first sidebar and this
is going to handle all that information
and upcoming tutorials I'm actually
going to get into exactly what
that is but if we scroll the whole way
down here this is where the actual
content is so I basically just have to
copy and paste what's on the left side
of the screen over the right side of the
screen so what do I got to do I got to
create a div I'm going to give it an ID
use IDs whenever you only plan on there
being one of these elements you use
classes when you expect there to be
multiple versions of those elements well
there's only going to be one main
content area so I'm positive of that so
I'm just going to use that then we come
in here and go div class is equal to
featured pose just like I have on the
right side of the screen that's all I'm
doing here often fancy and then i'm
going to create an unordered list and it
sounds classy quetta featured less and
then what I'm going to do instead of
using the normal loop system I'm going
to create a custom loop and give myself
some space here so you can see all this
in one place so we're just going to call
PHP then I'm going to hijack what's
called the WP query object and whatever
you hijack this guy you want to save its
original contents in a temporary file so
that you can copy it back later on
because if you don't do this your honor
not going to be able to issue more than
one query on a page and that's never
good if you almost always want it put a
lot more in than that then I have to
create a new WP query object and this
guy's going to allow me to query the
wordpress database and then I'm going to
actually call it issue a query to do
that you just type this in and then I'm
going to say posts per page it's going
to be equal to five let's jump over here
just you know what I'm doing okay post
per page is equal to five well these are
the posts that I want to print out here
right there on the screen and then the
next ones I print out I want to print
out four of them now what I'm going to
stay here again this is a query to
wordpress I'm going to say that I also
want the category name to be equal to
featured so anybody in the category
featured I want to print out the five
posts from there the most recent posts
on to the screen that's what that query
did well then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to use a while loop bleep you
Cory as long as I have posts i'm going
to call WP query i'm going to say give
me the post one of the five that are
most recent inside of the category named
feature so that's what that guy's going
to do for me then what I'm going to do
as you can see here there's a lie I'm
going to create all these guys let me go
Li exactly the same list item then I'm
going to go h3 class is equal to
featured title just like I have on the
right side of the screen just copy in
that code over there except here because
this is going to be dynamic I needed to
print out each of the information for
each of these posts as they come up so I
make a PHP call here and if I want a
link to the original post I call the
function called the permalink it's going
to output it on the screen then I close
off the PHP section just so I can put
that in there for the HTML and then I'm
going to reopen PHP and TT I'm going to
get the title for the post store it in a
variable how you get the title for a
post just go post dash and then that
bracket inside of there and call post
title that's going to shoot the post
title out on the screen what I want to
do is I want to echo I want to limit the
length of the title as if they give me a
great big giant long title it's not
going to show up right in the screen or
on the screen so i'm going to say i want
to take the post title that this
variable holds because it called this
guy right here and i want to output from
the zero index character to the 28th
character limiting the size of the title
that gets printed out the screen to keep
things from getting all botched up but
that closed off the a tag those off h3
alright so that's basically doing one
thing it's printing the title out the
screen it's making sure it's not more
than twenty eight characters in length
so we jump over here now I need to get
the featured excerpt which is over here
on the right side of the screen so it's
a paragraph and its class type i'm using
classes because there's going to be more
than one ntt i want to call the excerpt
this is a variable again what i'm doing
here is i'm going to shorten the length
of the excerpt so that it fits nicely in
my little box a lot of people do not
understand that to develop wordpress
themes you don't really have to have
great PHP skills but you do need great
HTML and CSS skills that's definitely
the most important thing and I know
everybody says they have great skills
with CSS but from what I've seen I don't
believe that's true actually I think you
could develop a wordpress theme without
having any understanding at all of PHP
by just copy and paste in the code that
i use over and over and over again and
then i want to close off that and we're
doing exactly the same thing we're just
shrinking down the excerpt that's going
to pop up on the screen aah reference is
equal to open PHP up again and I want to
get the permalink this is the link to
the actual post
I call that function to be able to get
it close off the PHP section a little
quote inside of their class is equal to
click for more close that off that's
just going to put the more tag there if
they click it it's going to take them to
the original post close off the
paragraph tag then what we got to do is
we got to pull over the first image that
they have inside of their post so what I
mean by that this is all dynamic all
this information is being pulled in so
if i go to foreclosures fall you can see
right here foreclosures fall will let
the code that i'm going to be messing
with here is it's going to take this guy
right here and it's going to shrink it
down and put it right inside of their
dynamic light which is kind of cool so
how am I going to do that type in echo
catch that image this is actually comes
from a piece of doctored code i got from
WP recipes except i changed it up quite
a bit actually but when to give them a
shot out and then i want to shoot the
title out here or assign that as an alt
tag so the title name is going to be the
alt tag for the image that's going to
pop up there again it helps with SEO
purposes because a lot of times people
input images inside a wordpress and
don't assign alt tags class is going to
be equal to featured image because
that's what i called it on the right
side of the screen and the basic HTML
CSS file okay so created that guy why
don't we go and create catch that image
and you do that over in functions so
functions.php i'm going to come way down
here to the bottom of the screen and i'm
just going to put a couple marks inside
there i'm for this moment i'm going to
put some white space in here so you can
see this better but you never want white
space after you close the page p that
drives wordpress absolutely nuts so i'm
going to type in function catch that
image get a hold of this pose i'm going
to be grabbing the first image that
shows up in the post first image equal
to its going to give it a value output
is equal to preg match it's going to
match for all image tags this is just
basic regular expressions again this is
copy and paste code you don't need to
memorize this or it confuses you in any
way don't worry about it basically this
is looking for any single or double
quotes that would follow image source so
that regular expression
there is going to grab the source for
the any of the images that show up in
the first post and you have to pass it
post dash post content and then the
results are going to go into this array
called matches first image is going to
be equal to remember matches is an array
if we get to dollar sign so I'm going to
say i want the first result that's going
to give me the first result the first
image that shows up in that post and I'm
going to say if empty which means that
they don't have any images inside of
their post well I got to protect against
that and i'm going to create a default
image how I'm going to dies and we call
blog info call the template directory
and then I'm going to go first image is
equal to let's say grab from the images
folder the image file called default
pink clothes off that if statement and
then I'm going to return first image and
then close off this function all
together and then remember to get rid of
all of that white space so let's jump
back over into index again so we got all
that saved got all that fixed so now my
clothes off this list item and then call
some more PHP i'm going to call end
while because my while loops come to an
end I've gotten all my posts that I need
scroll this up again so what do I want
to do when a reset WP query back to null
and then I'm going to take what I store
it into temporary file for WP query and
assign it back so that it'll be able to
perform additional queries and then
close my unordered list and then close
my dev in the next part of the tutorial
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
finish off index dot PHP and then I'm
going to finish off of the footer
section then we're going to move into
the sidebar and all that other wonderful
stuff leave any questions or comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
