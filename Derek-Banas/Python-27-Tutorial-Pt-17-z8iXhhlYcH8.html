17 of my programming with python 2.5
through 2.7 tutorial I've received a lot
of questions from you guys on how to run
your Python code on the Internet
seems like a lot of people are having
trouble with this and no you do not need
mod Python or mod WSGI
if you don't know that those are don't
worry about it in part 13 and 14 of this
tutorial I showed you how to perform web
scraping which is taking information
from a website and here you could see
the results of that here is the title
that I pulled from the Huffington Post
and I pull all this information from The
Huffington Post because it's the most
popular belong get out there and I also
pulled a link to the original article
along with a large amount of information
I pulled from the original article so
it's not just your simple little
description like you see if you pulled
this directly from an RSS feed and you
can see here yes I'm gonna show you how
to make this today if you click on
original article it takes you right to
the original article and it's always
considered a good idea if you do pull
information from a website that you
provide a link back to the original
article so now I'm gonna show you how to
do all of this on the internet and as
you can see here I'm doing this from my
local host which is right here directly
on my server and from the CGI bin folder
so I'm gonna jump over here to a program
called text Wrangler I'm going to create
the whole thing for you right now so we
start off by pointing towards our
interpreter and more than likely this is
gonna be the location for you meaning
the Python interpreter and what you need
to do is type in content
- typ e : to tell the browser what type
of content you're going to be passing
I'll buy another print command that's
empty and then print and of course we're
going to define our HTML tag and our
header tag and here you can see it's
just like regular Python there's nothing
weird about it a lot of you guys are
sort of hung up thinking that this is
more difficult than it really is it's
very easy and I'm just talking typing in
Huffington Post feed you could do this
with any feed if you didn't see that 13
or 14 tutorials take a look at i'ma show
you everything you need to know to be
able to perform website scraping or how
to automate a website because you could
easily just put this information
directly into a database
put it on any webpage or anything that
you want I'm sure you probably
understand what I'm doing here now to
take all of that code from that original
program that I wrote that performed the
website scraping I'm going to open up
the clips and I'm just gonna come in
here and I'm gonna select all of this
information except for this final tag
and I'm gonna paste it right in here all
I did paste it everything in here yeah
you don't have to do this but I'm gonna
do it anyway
just to keep everything nice and neat
and then you're really not gonna be
editing anything except for that
information
that is going to be printed on screen so
I just want to cycle through all this
code and find the parts where I'm
printing to screen so let's say for
example I want to make the title easier
to see and so I'm gonna put an h3 tag
around it and then close off that h3 tag
just like that and then let's say
instead of having a link printed on a
screen I actually want this to be like I
showed you in the example here where its
original article I'm just gonna put the
HTML directly right in here a H
reference is equal to you want to put a
single quote here remember and then a
double quote oh and that and then I'm
gonna come in here and I'm gonna
remember close that off with a single
quote I'm gonna close off that reference
there and type in original article then
close off the link tag with a closing
brace there and then a double quote and
then so this is gonna print the title
this is gonna print the link back to the
original article yeah I'm gonna scroll
down here this is the part of the code
that prints out line by line the
original article so I'm gonna make this
look a little bit nicer I'm gonna come
in here I'm sort of doing this right out
of my head let's say I want to do a line
break after each one of these just do
that it's all you got to do and then
after you get that done and you want to
close off your HTML right greet another
line break and then I'm actually gonna
close off the body that's pretty much
all you have to do but I'm guessing one
of the other things that you're probably
hung up on is you have to come into the
terminal and you have to give it proper
permissions this new code that you
created and of course you're gonna want
to first save this save and then jump
into the terminal area I'm gonna zoom in
here
and if you're on any type of a UNIX
system this is how you change it sudo
allows me to perform super user or root
commands change my seven five five and
then this is hu f F F EE T dot py anima
tape and my password and this would work
on any type of UNIX system and then
we're gonna close that off that's all
saved and if we jump over here to our
new created file and run it you can see
it pulled all of that additional
information in now the only reason why
this looks different than the other one
that I created is because I didn't put a
line break after original article so
let's say if I want to do that it's real
simple
just coming down here again remember I'm
just doing this we're right out of my
head as we're sort of going here like
that
file save don't have to go in and change
the permissions on it again jump back
out of here and reload it and there you
can see the final results if you have
any questions if you'd like the code
it's all freely available at new
think-tank TOCOM you could use it
however you want make money off of it do
whatever makes you happy if you have any
questions or comments leave them below
and in the next python tutorial i'm
gonna set up a simple chat system it's
gonna allow you to chat with people and
it's gonna go through some other
networking issues in relation to python
so next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
