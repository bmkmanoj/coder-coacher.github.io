2 of my blender video tutorial in this
tutorial I'm going to cover the rest of
the edit tools I'm gonna talk about
layers I'm also going to show you an
easy way to merge vertices as well as
cover the array wave bevel boolean build
decimate edge split mask and mirror
modifiers like always in the description
underneath the video is a link to a
cheat sheet that has everything I do
here in text format and I have a lot to
do so let's get into it
alright so if you didn't see the
previous part of my tutorial you should
probably watch that otherwise you might
be kind of confused alright so we got
our little cube here this is the way
everything always starts off and I'm
gonna switch over into object mode and
I'm going to delete it very first thing
I want to cover here is the screw tool
so what we're going to do first is we're
going to switch into front orthographic
view and you can see right here there
that is and you're gonna see here in the
bottom left hand corner everything that
I do with my mouse or any commands that
I type in but I'm gonna say them as I go
along so we are in front orthographic
view and I am also in object mode as you
can see right there and if you can't see
anything here just view it fullscreen
and everything will be good now what I
want to do here is cover the screw at a
tool so I'm going to first off create a
circle what it's going to allow me to do
is wrap a pipe around a line do really
cool things with it so I'm going to
create a circle object first so I'm just
going to go shift na and of course pick
circle now so I can better see it I'm
gonna rotate it so I'm going to go R and
X and 90 and then set that and there you
can see our circle now what I'm going to
do is go over into edit mode I'm gonna
hit tab to do that and I have my circle
selected and what I want to do now is
add a plane and that is what my circle
is going to rotate around so I'm just
shifting again and I'm gonna create a
plane once again let's rotate that so I
can see it
so rotate X plus 90 and there it is
and we can set that I can then go and
click on G
mmm let's go and move it into position
so G and X and then I'm gonna place it
by clicking with the left mouse button
I'm then going to click on a and then B
for box select and I'm just going to
grab these vertices if you can't grab
them just make sure down here you have
vertices selected as what you're going
to grab and we are going to delete those
I'll just go X and n vertices of course
then you only to right-click on the top
vertice and stretch it up here just a
little bit above my circle and then come
down here and click on this one and once
again just stretch it down here below
that circle I'm going to put my 3d
cursor right in the middle of the plane
that I have here this edge that I
created and then the circle is going to
wrap around it and then I can just
simply come in and go B and select that
with the left mouse button and then I
can come over here to screw and click on
screw and there you can see it wrapped
around it and I can go and change the
steps if I want to smooth that out you
can see it gets smoother and then I
could also change the number of turns
that I would like and then it would get
bigger and bigger and bigger so let's go
and you can see how cool that is
and as the tutorial continues we'll go
and I'll also show other different ways
that other different pipes we can make
and all sorts of other different cool
things but that's pretty cool now what I
want to do is take a look at the knife
tool and I just went and created another
cube and let's go and move this up above
that plane and the knife tool we have to
access it we're going to go into edit
mode it's a tab and then we can just
click on K when you can click on knife
or you can click on K and I have this
guy right here and I'm just gonna click
on K and then with my left mouse button
I'm just going to drag over it and as
you can see it made a point there made a
point right there made a point right
there and then I can hit enter and you
can see right there that it went and
created both vertices as well as edges
wherever I clicked and I can do a whole
bunch of these different guys let's come
in here like this and just let the
ducted uh doesn't matter what you do and
so forth and so on
enter once again and there they are and
then you can come in and do crazy things
let's go
and right click on this and shift and
right click on that and and that and
this and then we can come in and do
crazy things like use the extrude tool
to extrude these outs or whatever you
would like to do and less the tutorial
continues we're gonna do crazier little
design things and show you how to
actually use these in interesting and
useful ways but for now I'm just going
to give you a brief example of how to
use all the different tools and up next
we're going to look at the bisect tool
all right and the bisect tool is
basically gonna cut an object into
creating all the vertices as well as the
edges that we would need and the bisect
tool is right over here let's just click
on bisect and there you go we can just
click anywhere we want to go and you can
see that it cuts it in half for us and
we can come over here and do the same
thing well make sure you click on bisect
and select all again and click on bisect
and let's say we want to come this way
and we can cut again so just another way
of creating vertices as well as edges
alright so cool stuff I want to show you
something that's kind of useful based
off of a question I received and that is
how we're going to be able to easily
merge vertices all right so let's go and
let's just create some planes I'm an
object mode right now so shift a and
let's create so with shift a and plane
and there's plane right there and let's
go and rotate this guy to some odd
position doesn't really matter where it
is and then I'm going to go and create
another one another shift day and here's
another plane and there it is let's just
grab it putting it over here
let's rotate it like that alright so
this is totally abstract but that's
exactly what I'm looking for so how
exactly would I set it up so that I
could take this vertice here and connect
it to this vertice here and that one
there and that one there and they would
line up perfectly actually it is rather
easy to do that so what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to switch over into edit mode
and I'm gonna come down here and I'm
gonna click on this guy right here and
this is automatically merged vertices
moved to the same location so let's
click on that I'm gonna come over here
and click on snap during transform click
on that make sure that it's highlighted
anyway and then we're gonna click on
this guy right here type of element to
snap to and what we are doing is
connecting vertices so let's click on
that and then we can come up here and we
can select a vertices so let's just grab
that guy right there and with the right
mouse button start dragging it and I'm
gonna hold down this control key and as
I get close you can see it snapped and
then I'm gonna left click to set it you
know once again I can right-click here
and I'm coming over here hold down the
control key it snaps into place
left click to set it all right so very
quick and easy way to merge vertices and
have them line up perfectly with each
other and now I'm going to give you
another example of how we can use layers
all right so this guy down here is our
layer area and we are in the currently
we were in one layer and you use layers
a lot if you want to work on different
objects separate from each other which
is extremely useful and you can easily
merge the information on the different
layers let's just go and create one
let's create a cube there's a cube right
there isn't it wonderful and then I'm
gonna come down here and I'm just going
to click in the layer next to it so up
the cubes gone and now you can come in
and let's do something different let's
do a sphere all right so there is a
sphere and you can see that we can
switch back and forth between the two of
them but you can also show both of the
objects if you'd like by just coming in
let me zoom in here so I have this one
already selected I'm gonna hold down the
shift key and boom you could see them
both at the same time and you're also
going to be able to move objects to
other layers and how you would do that
well first off I'm just going to click
on this layer right here so the sphere
went away from it and I'm then going to
jump over into the sphere one it is
already selected what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna click on em and it's gonna say
move to layer and I'm gonna say that I
wanted to go to the first layer and now
I can come down here and you're gonna
say that both the cube and the sphere
are both in the same layer so pretty
really simple explanation of how we can
use layers and won't be getting more
into layers as a tutorial continues but
now what I want to do is show you a
whole bunch of different cool things you
can do with the modifier panel okay so
we're in object mode let's go and let's
create a cube and just drop it in there
that looks fun
all right so the modifiers are going to
be over here underneath this wrench so
we're gonna click and you can see right
there is an ADD modifier and just to do
something somewhat interesting what I'm
going to do is I want to subdivide this
so I'm gonna click on tab and I'm going
to come in and subdivide it so subdivide
subdivide and that looks kind of okay
and then I'm gonna come in and select my
faces here let's deselect that and let's
go and just holding down the shift key
and clicking with the right mouse button
X and let's get rid of those faces and
I'm gonna select all those X and faces
and remember we can also come in here
and we could use our circle tool if we
would prefer to use our circle tool and
that's just C and we come in and select
those faces and and then escape and then
X and faces and then I'll just
right-click again alright so just trying
to do something semi interesting Here I
am because I'm gonna talk about the
array modifier that's available to us so
look at the dough and X and faces
alright so there we got this sort of
lattice type thing on our screen hold
down the shift key so we can pan this
around and I can show you how the array
tool works okay so well basically the
modifiers as you add them I'm gonna come
in here well I'm gonna jump first off
I'm going to jump over into object mode
so I'm going to go tab and here we are
inside of object mode
and I'm going to come in and I'm gonna
add an array so there that is a Rachel
and you can see it automatically created
one basically what the array tool is
going to do for so there are a modifiers
it's going to duplicate whatever
selected objects that we have and
modifiers in general you're going to be
able to add multiple modifiers to each
other and you'll be able to sort of move
them up and down based off of cooking
these because whatever modifier is near
the top is what takes precedence over
all the other ones as we work more and
more with these modifiers you will
better understand them now basically the
relative offset right here is going to
define where the objects are going to
duplicate count of course is going to
create more and more so I created five
of them right there and there you can
say that there are five different
objects and whenever we have this set
for one that means that they are going
to be exactly one object that we
selected in distance from each other so
they're going to perfectly butt up
against each other now if I just move
this just a tiny little bit you're see
you're gonna see that they pull apart
from each other and there's a space well
sometimes you might want that sometimes
you might not want that but if you want
them to butt up perfectly with each
other you're gonna keep that at one all
right
the constant offset if we select this
guy right here is going to define how
they are spaced using blender units but
I'm not gonna use that you can play
around with that and of course you're
going to be able to change whatever a
blender unit is inside of blender
depending upon what your project is and
what your goals are and what's neat is
with this guy selected and we're still
in object mode we can also come in here
and we can add another one so let's say
add modifier and array and there we went
and created another one but in this
situation what we're gonna do is we're
gonna change this to zero and instead
come down here to the Y and change this
to one and there you can see now we're
building like a building with little
tiny rooms and crazy things inside of it
so that is going to create an array of
objects on both the X as well as the
y-axis and then we can come in and we
can add a No
so let's go add modifier and alright and
you can see it got bigger there but in
this situation
I'm gonna go zero and then I'm gonna
come in here and I'm gonna change this
to 1 and enter and now you can see we're
building apartment buildings so pretty
cool stuff and very very easy to come in
here and create rather complicated types
of objects and you can see how cool it
is and how they stack up on top of each
other now we could come in and we can
click on apply and apply and apply and
now they are going to all be merge
together and in fact if you tried to
select them individually you just
couldn't do that so say if you select
one you select all of them however if
you would like to break them up after
you created that you could jump into tab
and you would click on all of these
different objects select them all and
once again you can break them apart by
clicking on P and lose parts which means
the different objects themselves and you
could see if we jump back into object
mode we can select this and pull it
apart okay so pretty cool stuff we can
do with the array tool and as the
tutorial continues we will do even
cooler things with the array tool and
now I want to show you how to use the
wave modifier which is pretty cool okay
once again we're in object mode and I'm
gonna go shift and I'm gonna create a
cube and this saw the wave modifier is
going to be like an animation so let's
go and let's scale this and let's go on
the X plane and then we're going to
create a wave on this so once again
scale it and let's do it on the Y plane
so so we can have something that we can
mess around with creating waves on
alright now we'll go and go add modifier
and wave I just felt like doing this one
I'm gonna get more into these guys later
I'm mainly gonna focus on these
modifiers for this tutorial but just
want to do wave because guys it's kind
of cool alright so whenever we have the
motion that's I'm gonna show you an
example of it I just want to briefly go
over this okay so we're we have motion X
Y and cyclic if these are unchecked
waves will only move in whatever is
checked being at X or Y or will create
only one wave and that's what we mean by
cyclic offset is going to this
how many frames before our wave motion
actually begins I'm going to leave that
set for zero life is going to define the
number of frames before the wave stops
so let's go and set that I don't know
like 50 or something and damping is
going to define the number of frames
after the waves lifetime that motion
continues we can change this to like 20
so it's just like you know the
continuing wave as it sloughs itself
down into basically doing nothing
position X and Y is going to define the
center of our wave you know on our
object where that wave is going to take
off or where it's going to start fall
off is how far waves travel through the
object normals over here are going to
define if the object deforms and throbs
in different directions and of course
these would be the different directions
that they would throb inside of we're
also going to be able to come in here
and I'm actually going to do this we're
going to define a vertex group that is
going to define the effect on only one
part of our object so let's say we want
the bottom to be flat and not be
affected and we only want to affect the
top actually let's do that so I'm gonna
switch over into edit mode somebody go
to tab and I'm gonna come in here and
select this guy and I only want to work
with the top vertices so I'm going to
create a vertex group for that so if I
want to create a vertex group for just
the top so we only see motion on the top
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come over
here into data and that's this
weird-looking thing with the vertices
and the edges select that and then gonna
rotate this guy up so I can see the
bottom and you're gonna want to make
sure that you have vertices selected
down here so your are going to be
selecting the vertices I'm gonna go be
and box select and let's grab those
bottom vertices and you can see that we
grab them I'm then gonna go ctrl + I and
I'm gonna come over here to vertex
groups and click on plus and then I'm
gonna click on a sign I'm just gonna
leave the name be group like that and
now what I can do is jump back over and
for our object that we have here you
know object mode
and jump back into modifiers and then
for a vertex group just select this and
select group and then we'll only be
working with the top part of this we're
also gonna be able to define textures
that we would want to use if we decide
that we want to use textures narrowness
is what we're gonna be playing with here
and that's basically going to affect the
crest of our wave and what I want to do
here to have the best effect is I'm
going to switch over into edit mode and
I'm going to create some subsets and
this is very important so I'm gonna go
subdivide whole bunch times that's
probably pretty good yeah do it some
more
I could also define where the middle is
I can define the middle position here or
I can use an empty and find that with
the start position I haven't done that
before so let's do it that way well
actually it's do it this way and let's
just see what it does so I am going to
define you know what let's just have
this lifetime be 0 and then the damping
be 50 just to keep it nice and simple
positions perfectly fine the way that it
is and then let's have our speed let's
slow it down a little bit so that we can
see it a little bit better so I'm gonna
change at the point 1 leave my width it
1.5 that's fine height let's have it
let's increase the height to 1.7 or
something like that and then the
narrowness let's take this up to I don't
know if 4.6 or something like that and
then we can come down here and click on
play now let's go and create an empty as
well so that we can use that let's jump
over into this mode right here you can
see there is the guy object mode now we
can play it will show it without the
empty see there's the wave being created
and then we can also define an empty
inside of here so let's go shift an egg
mesh and let's create and empty and
let's have that be a sphere there it is
let's grab it and let's drop it inside
of here drag this around to make sure
that we actually have it inside of our
cube area there it is and then we can
jump back into the wave modifier just
select on it like this and start
position and we can do empty and if we
go and we're still in object mode and
now you can see that the wave is
actually taking effect where we have the
empty sphere
alright so pretty cool stuff and neat
ways to use way
we'll be using the more as the tutorial
continues but now I want to talk about
bevel now the bevel modifier is going to
do exactly what you would think it's
going to do it's going to create bevels
so let's go and let's create a shape and
just to keep it simple I'm gonna go mesh
and then let's create cube alright so
there's our cube I'm right-clicking it
right there and let's place it and zoom
in and if I want to put some bevels on
the edges of my cube quite easy to do
add modifier and I'm just working my way
down here
bouncing around a little bit and you
could say right there created the bevels
on the edges of our cube and of course
we're going to be able to define the
width of our bevel and you can see as
I'm doing that the width is getting
bigger and bigger and bigger you can
also define the number of segments say
to smooth out after we create our bevel
it's actually going to extrude out into
the original shape if we increase
profile right here and then we're also
going to be able to define different
limits on how the shape is gonna be
beveled based off of angles and weights
and vertex groups if we would decide to
define those and then we can also define
different ways of defining the width
based off of this and you can see little
descriptions in regards to that so you
can play around with that
so just wanting to talk about bevel it
just creates babbles I mean it's quite
simple so pretty simple stuff now I want
to get something a little bit more
complex I'm going to talk about bleh
boolean modifier all right so we are in
object mode and I'm gonna create two
shapes and let's go and create a cube
and let's drag it here because these
guys are going to overlap because that's
what boolean is going to do it's going
to have multiple objects affect each
other based off of how they overlap with
each other
let's go like this and shift an a and
let's create a sphere whoops get rid of
that and let's create a sphere there we
are and there is our sphere okay so
these guys are going to interact with
each other both the cube as well as our
sphere so I'm going to drag the sphere
into place and let's have them actually
roll into each other so I'm using the
left mouse button here and let's bring
it down okay so there they are they are
overlapping with each other
okay so let's say that I want to delete
the sphere from the cube I'm going to
first off make sure in object mode I'm
going to select the object that I want
to remain and then not have the object I
do not want to remain selected and I'm
gonna click on add modifier I'm gonna
come down here and click on boolean and
then I'm going to click on DIF there it
is and then I'm going to come in and
select object which is going to be the
sphere in this situation that's going to
be the guy that is going to be deleted
and then to delete it I can just click
on apply and then after you do that you
come in here and select the sphere and X
and delete and you can see that the
sphere ate a hole into the side of our
cube all right so that's difference now
what we can do is we can also combine
multiple different objects so let's go
and let's just select all this and lead
at all so that's all going what I want
to do now is I want to create a cube
that has a spike coming out of the top
of it so let's create a cube and then
let's go and let's create a spike for
it's a mesh and cone and let's move this
into position there's our cube and here
is our cone so I'll have the cone coming
up through the middle of our cube let's
rotate around here and let's scale it
down a little bit so scale just so that
it doesn't poke through our cube and
then we can go and G and move it right
around the middle of our cube and there
we are so there we got those two guys
right there now you can actually select
either object it doesn't matter I'm
gonna select the cube in this situation
then what I'm gonna do is come over here
and I'm gonna go boolean and I'm gonna
go Union and this is going to join them
both together and then I'm going to
select the other object which is going
to be cone of course and then I can
click on apply' and they were going to
be merged together then what I want to
do is I'm gonna go into edit mode and I
can come in here and I can chant click
on this is the Z key to go into
wireframe mode after that jump back over
into object mode come in here and select
the wireframe underneath of this guy go
X and delete and it's going
and then click on Z and you're gonna see
that the top of our spike is going to
show but the bottom has been deleted and
the two of those have been merged okay
so that's how we can merge them and now
what I want to do is set it up so that
only the overlapping area is going to be
showing through so once again let's just
delete all of this all gone and let's go
create let's just do the same thing will
go cube and then what we're gonna do is
I'm going to go and put the spike inside
of there once again so unselect that and
mesh and cone and we'll grab our cone
and what I want to do here is only have
the overlapping part showing inside of
it so let's go select it just like this
in this area and okay that looks about
good and then we can grab it and drop it
inside of there and this time what we're
gonna do is we are going to show only
the parts where the two of them
intersect with each other so here I'm
gonna select my cube and I'm gonna come
over here and add modifier and boolean
and intersect is already there and let's
come in here and select cone and you can
see that it automatically went and got
rid of that and then we can click on
apply and then we can click on this guy
up here and click on delete and you can
see only the parts where they
intersected is being shown on the screen
okay so all kinds of interesting things
we can do with the boolean modifier and
now I'm gonna quickly show you how the
build modifier works let's just do it
right on this guy all right so let's
select it this is going to be another
animation so I'm gonna go add modifier
and basically it's just going to take an
object and slowly put it together so I'm
gonna go build and then we can come down
here and basically you can find here at
what frame it starts and how long it is
going to be building the object come
down here click on plus and you can see
that it is going to slowly build that
shape for us and then put the top on it
so it's just a really simple animation
you could also do randomize you could do
really cool things like the lattice
thing that I showed you earlier where we
built those buildings we could select
that whole entire thing and then have
the animation build everything up or
whatever we'd like
make sure you come back to the beginning
frame and with randomized selected you
can see that it's just randomly building
everything all right so it's just a very
very quick and simple animation and now
I want to take a look at decimate let's
come in here and let's create something
a little bit complicated let's create a
sphere alright and then we're gonna come
over and we're gonna go decimate now
basically the decimate a modifier is
going to reduce the face count on an
object which is going to do things for
us such as increase our overall
performance now the ratio over here is
going to define the ratio of faces to
keep so for example if this is set for
0.5 that would be that would mean that
half the faces have been removed or that
half the faces remain however you prefer
to look at it if you're a cup half full
or half empty type of person and you can
see that I am going to limit that and
its overall keeping the general shape of
it not looking that bad but we have a
lot less faces which is going to be mean
a lot less calculations you're going to
be able to also define if you want to
triangulate because sometimes that's
gonna look better in this situation it
definitely does unsub divided is going
to get rid of vertices and it's pretty
much like the opposite of subdivide you
can see here we have 512 faces let's
change this to 1 and you can see it's
down to 240 so see a lot less faces and
and at the same time we're still keeping
our general shape that we have here that
we're looking for cleaner down here is
going to reduce details for objects that
are already mainly flat so there's no
reason for all of that extra work to be
done and with planar under the angle
limit you're gonna be able to remove
faces with angles that are lower than
whatever you define the degree to be
here and you're also going to be able to
check on all boundaries which is going
to remove faces along boundaries of the
faces and then you have all of these
different options under deed limit and
basically if you have normal selected
this is going to define that you don't
want to dissolve edges where faces are
reversed material means that you don't
want to dissolve where different
materials are assigned because if a
different material is defined then
chances are you want it to show and then
also have seams which means you don't
want to dissolve edges where you have
seams and sharp is going to say that we
don't want to dissolve along sharp edges
for logical reasons and if you v's is
selected that means we don't want to
dissolve if we would have 2d images
mapped on to our object which we're
gonna get into and later toward parts of
the tutorial okay so there is decimate
and now I want to talk about edge split
okay so edge split is basically going to
take a smooth object and at the same
time define and show the edges which is
going to be important with our objects
it's probably better to just show you an
example and it's a little bit confusing
because we have another tool that does
basically the same thing without the
need to use a modifier but what have you
so let's come in here he's good like
this and mash and let's create a cone
inside of here and then let's go and
create an edge for it so I'm gonna go
into edit mode that we are and let's go
and select the face for this guy down
here so it is and now let's do like an
extrusion on it so there we are we just
created ourself a little edge jump back
into object mode and let's move this up
here and we'll go and click on smooth
you can see it's smooth and it's sort of
lost the edge well what we're gonna be
able to do is go add modifier and edge
split and you can see here as I am
dragging the split angle it is going to
bring into focus that edge while keeping
everything else smooth okay well just
useful to know that you can do this with
another tool we're gonna go into data
once again so let's click on dad up here
and there that is we're also going to be
able to click on Auto smooth and then
change the angle on this to get exactly
the same result okay so that's what it's
doing it's taking an object that is
smoothed out and it's defining that edge
inside of there okay just one to quickly
cover that because it is there and I
want to talk about mask
now basically mask is going to allow
vertices of an object to be hidden using
a vertex group so let's go and just
create a sphere here just to keep it
simple and I'm going to click on the
data tab over here once again this guy
that upside down
triangle shape that we have there I'm
then going to go into edit mode and a to
deselect that and let's come in and
we'll select some of the vertices on
here and you can see that I can hide
them and bring them back or do whatever
I'd like depending upon the situation so
we'll just select that I'm then going to
go over into the data table vertex group
and plus to create a new vertex group
and it'll just leave it named group
that's perfectly a fun and we will name
it or we'll click on a sign to create it
now I can jump back over into object
mode and I have this selected of course
I'm gonna go into our modifiers area add
modifiers and masks and there's all
kinds of cool things you can do with
masks but it's better shown through
example but I just wanted to cover this
vertex group group and you can see that
it's showing just the part that where
the vertex group lies however you're
also going to be able to click on the
inverse and it's going to show you
everything except the vertex group okay
so very very simple example of how we
can use masks and then for our final
example I want to talk about the mirror
modifier so I'm gonna come in here and
I'm going to create a cube and there's
our cube it's wonderful and fantastic
basically the mirror modifier is going
to mirror the movements of different
parts of our object so I created our
cube here then what I want to do is I'm
going to jump back over into edit mode
and I want to select some vertices I
didn't want to go control or what I want
to do is mirror one side to the other so
I'm going to go ctrl R and I'm gonna
divide this down the middle okay so
that's what I'm looking for and I can
click with the left mouse button and
there it is set so now I have everything
completely split now what I want to do
is delete vertices on one side of our
object all right so a to deselect and
I'm gonna go like this hold down shift
key and right click on all these
different vertices okay that's what I
wanted to do the first time and X and
vertices and there you can see is half
of our box
now I'm gonna jump back over into object
mode that's already selected and go add
modifier I can then go mirror I can then
jump back over into edit mode and with
X&amp;amp;Y on the axes both selected that you
can see that went
created the other side of our cube and
now what you're gonna be able to see if
we go into edit mode is and make sure
you have vertices selected down here if
I select one of these vertices and move
it out you're going to see that they
mirror each other that they are actually
creating them I could shut off the X if
I just want the right side to be shown
and you can see the merge right there if
you have any issues in which you have
creases at any of the merge points which
you would have right here then you would
come over here what I like to do is set
this to point a1 that normally has a
tendency to get rid of any creases and
basically what merge does is merge one
object into another clipping if it is
clicked on is going to prevent objects
from moving through each other meaning
the mirrored object and the other
regular object that is not mirrored
vertex group is going to be checked if
you want to handle mirroring for vertex
groups and the mirror object can be be
defined if you want to merge around an
object like for example it's unselect
this and let's come in and let's create
another object so shift make sure whoops
make sure I'm in object mode so tab so
for example I created a sphere that it's
outside of our space right here what I
can do is actually have it have an
effect on the mirrored objects so let's
select that and click the mirror objects
and sphere and then as I move our sphere
it's going to directly affect our
mirrored object all right so there is a
rundown of a whole bunch of different
tools that are available to you inside
of blender hopefully you guys enjoyed
that and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
