tutorial on solving android sdk problems
in my last tutorial which if you haven't
seen it look in the upper right hand
corner definitely check that out I
showed you how to install the Android
developer tools now in this tutorial I'm
gonna show you how to solve all of the
android sdk problems that have recently
been sent to me we'll look at how to
speed up the emulator how to solve the
problem which the android sdk manager
can't find packages will solve the
android sdk parse error problems will
solve the issue in which the emulator
doesn't execute your program but just
simply opens up the emulator and a
couple other different issues and of
course if i don't bring your issue up
believe them in the comment section
below and i will be sure to help so we
have a lot to do so let's get into it
okay the first thing we're gonna cover
here because i've received this question
a whole bunch of times is how to locate
to the android sdk manager
well there's a couple different ways to
do this you could just go into eclipse
and click on window and come down and
actually open up the sdk manager and
you're gonna see a whole bunch of errors
here because i on purpose messed us up
oh maybe not okay so that's up there
they go i'm going to show you how to fix
that in a second to i on purpose cause
those errors if you want to know where
your sdk manager is and you are on a mac
i'm gonna show where to look if you're
on a pc in a second you just simply want
to search for adt - bundle - mac and
that is going to find it if however
you're on a PC you want to search for a
folder named Android - SDK S and if you
search for those both on a Mac and a PC
you will be able to locate your Android
SDK now to handle the issue which we saw
all of those different errors in
relation to peer not being able to be
authenticated well let's just go in here
inside of Eclipse and go window and go
Android SDK manager and it's going to
start up and show a whole bunch of
errors I will show you how to get rid of
them in a couple seconds and there are
all the errors as you can see if you're
not a fennec ated bla bla bla bla bla
well let's close that and all you need
to need to do is go into Android SDK
manager to get rid of that and this
problem also solves the situation in
which you don't
see all these different packages for
downloading just going to go into
Android SDK manager click on preferences
and then in this guy that opens up on
our screen we're just going to say force
HTTP sources to be fetched using HTTP
and then hit close now if we close that
and then once again go in and open up
the SDK manager you're going to see that
everything opens up just perfectly fine
without any errors and if you having a
hard time following all of this
different information I also provide
this all in text format there's a link
to all this stuff underneath the video
so now let's get back into our next
problem a lot of times whenever you are
trying to actually run a program
whenever you click on run and run a
program you click this guy up here well
what you're going to want to do instead
to make sure that your actual program
runs is come down to where it says run
configurations and click on that now
inside of this guy you want to make sure
that you have launched selected here
with this radio button and you also want
main activity for your program to be
selected right there and if you do that
whenever you hit run down here in the
bottom of the screen you can guarantee
that your emulator is going to actually
run your program and not just simply
open up the emulator and another thing
you're going to want to make sure that
you do right here whenever this is
selected this is going to allow you to
run this on your Android devices if you
want to instead run it on an emulator
you want to make sure that this radio
button right here is selected and then
we'll hit and-run and you're gonna see
down here it says launching a new
emulator with virtual device my emu El
which I'm going to show you what that is
in a second and with all of the trillion
in regards to running your emulator
you're actually going to see that the
emulator is going to open up now in
about 30 seconds sorry it was slow
before I normally check all my apps on
an Android device and I don't use the
emulator very often but as far as I know
what I'm going to show you here in a
minute is the quickest way to make your
emulator run really really fast and
there it is and yes that took about 30
seconds so there's our hello world
application running inside of that so
now I'm going to show you how to speed
up the emulator really dramatically what
you're going to want to do again inside
of Eclipse is go window
and come down here and go Android SDK
manager and this guy right here is going
to open up for you and the package you
specifically want to download is right
here where it says Intel x86 Atom system
image and you can see I already have
that installed you're also going to want
to come down and install this same exact
thing except it's under Android 2.3
point two and I left this uninstalled
just so I can show you how it's going to
work so we're going to select this guy
come down here and click on install one
package and then you're going to want to
come over here and select that come down
here and hit accept license come back up
again select this come back down again
and hit accept license then after you do
click install and there we go now it's
all installed and that's going to pretty
dramatically speed up everything now if
you're on a Mac or if you're on a PC
there's a couple other things you could
do you could go here to software dot
intel.com en-us articles intel hardware
acceleration excuse manager I have a
link of course available in the article
underneath the video and whenever you
come here what this is going to allow
you to do now this acceleration does not
seem to work for Windows 8 it's only
going to work for Windows 7 Windows
Vista and Windows XP this is just the
way it is it's not my fault if you want
to manually install the guy that I just
showed you how to install using Windows
you can click on this but that normally
is not needed however if you are on a
Mac you are definitely going to want to
go to this page and get this hotfix
and it's just a dmg file you're going to
download it and execute it and it's
going to fix everything and make your
emulator run super super fast and then
again if you're on a Mac you want to
make sure that everything was properly
installed you just want to go and
actually open up your terminal this is
the terminal down here this guy if you'd
have never seen that before and inside
of your terminal you're going to want to
type command ke X T sta T stat put a
little or symbol grep and Intel and hit
execute and whenever you do you're going
to see something to this effect where it
says calm Intel ke XT and that's going
to show you that that was all properly
installed and there you can see as well
that is the emulator that's going to
speed
everything quite dramatically so that's
how to speed up your emulators now how
exactly would we go about connecting an
Android device so that you can actually
run everything on your device really
really quick well if you're a Windows
user you're going to actually have to
install a USB driver for your specific
Android device and all of those are
available at developer.android.com tools
extras om - USB dot HTML again the link
is available in the article that's
underneath the video then after you do
that Mac users you don't have to install
any drivers now if you are running a
device that is using Android 3.2 you're
then going to be able to get into the
development part for your device by
going settings applications development
if you're on Android 4.0 and newer other
than 4.2 you're going to want to go to
settings developer options and if you're
on an Android device that's running 4.2
and newer things are a little bit
different because the developer options
are actually hidden for some odd reason
in that situation you're going to want
to go to settings like this and then
come down here and click on about tablet
the about tablet screen is going to open
you're going to want to go down to build
number and you're going to want to click
on this with your finger seven times and
whenever you do that this guy is going
to open up developer options all a bunch
of other things and from that moment on
once you have your device connected
using a USB plug in your computer to run
applications you just want to check USB
debugging just put a check inside of
there and of course connect your device
and automatically everything is going to
run on your device if you do what I'm
going to show you next now if you want
to run these devices here what you're
going to want to do one thing that I
forgot which I'm going to cover right
now is what exactly you'd want to do
with your emulator to make sure that it
runs really really fast I'm going to
show you that here just because I forgot
it and then I'll jump back and running
your advice either way it's very very
simple you're going to want to go in
here create a new device and this works
great for me using the Intel
acceleration software so I have it set
up as Nexus 7 Android 4.2.2 and this is
very very important the most important
thing actually on CPU want to make sure
that you have Intel Atom x86 selected
here and also kind of equally important
you're also going to have to have a
check down here inside of use hos GPU
that is going to make your emulator run
super super super fast so that is how to
create an emulator that runs really good
now I'll get back into how to actually
execute on your actual Android device
again you're going to come in here go
down to run configuration select it then
for this guy you're going to want to go
into target and then launch on all
compatible devices right there this is
the guy you want to use when you want to
launch on a device this is the guy you
want to use whenever you launch on an
emulator so just put a tick inside of
there and then hit run just like you did
before and of course I can't show you
actually running that onto my device so
you're just gonna have to trust that
that works or go and try it yourself so
as far as I know those are all of the
problems that all of you guys have had
out there of course if I missed any of
them leave them in a comment section
below I'll be very very happy to help
you along till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
