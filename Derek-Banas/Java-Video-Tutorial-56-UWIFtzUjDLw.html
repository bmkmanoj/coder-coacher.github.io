my java video tutorial series today I'm
going to continue making the game while
I explain object-oriented design
principles there's been a lot of
questions lately about what this
tutorial is really about most of all
it's about object-oriented design
principles yes I talk a lot about all of
the different algorithms you can use to
make a game collision detection and a
whole bunch of other things but my main
goal is to instead of using sloppy sort
of code like we did here with rock and
yes I did this on purpose I wanted to
show you sort of like a facade Oh sort
of a way of using object-oriented design
to accomplish things versus what we're
going to do today with a spaceship which
is going to really use encapsulation and
really explain just how easy it is to
design using object-oriented programming
and if you haven't watched part 55 you
definitely need to watch that because in
that part we created our spaceship UML
class diagram and you can see all that
over here and why that is so awesome is
basically we took a whole bunch of
different features that we wanted in our
program and we created this diagram over
here that we're going to use to create
our new spaceship and you're going to
see just how easy it is to design the
object-oriented program so let's get
into the code I'm just going to take my
ship that I designed previously and I'm
just going to delete everything that we
did here okay here we are bare-bones and
we're just going to jump right into this
guy we're still going to extend polygons
just like we did before however we're
going to use our UML diagram that we
after on the right side of the screen to
make things look nicer one thing we know
we have to monitor is the speed the ship
is going to move and we're going to
encapsulate all this information so I'm
going to start having everything be
private and just X velocity is equal to
zero because that's what we want to
start off with and there you go so we
have that defined and I'm just going to
pull stuff from the right side of the
screen and throw it over here onto the
left side of the screen I'm also going
to get my game board width because it
doesn't make sense to have it be locked
down inside of here I'm going to grab it
from the game board class that we've
defined before and I'm also going to
come in here and get my game board
height and all of this code is heavily
commented and available underneath of
the video and of course it is free so
get it if you really want to understand
this stuff then private double we're
going to find our center of our screen
and we're
going to use the game board again to
help us do this dynamically so the game
board size can change and our game here
or our spaceship is going to change
right along with it so everything is
only going to be reliant upon what it
should be relying upon there you go now
I got the center of my screen all
defined public static I'm going to
define my integer array that's going to
contain all of my polygons or ship
points and for now I'm going to leave
this public that may change later on as
the tutorial goes on because I don't
like to have anything be public but
sometimes it just makes sense to do that
at least temporarily in the beginning
make sure this is poly x-ray basically
just copying from what's on the right
side of the screen over to here that's
what we're doing and then of course
these numbers are going to change and
I'm just taking this from previous parts
of the tutorial and my goal here is to
really show you and sort of walk you
into the object-oriented design process
because you guys said you want to
understand design patterns and the only
way to do that is to understand
object-oriented design principles first
then we're going to go back to private
again we're going to define our ship
with and I'm going to lock this down
later on I might come in here and have
it be defined by the constructor but for
now this makes sense for me upper
left-hand corner like I said before I
don't think I'm going to need it but I
might some they'll throw it in there
and maybe at some point in the future I
might need it and to see I can just go
get center and then go this dot and get
my poly array throw that in there get my
zero point and there you go so that's my
upper left-hand corner and I'm going
define get center down below we're going
to be accessing all of these fields
using methods inside of here and put the
Y position inside of there and this is
just going to change the Y and this is
going to change the Y then I'm going to
define inside of here whether the ship
should rotate so remember we wanted a
rotation angle as well as a moving angle
and there is the moving angle and I'm
also going to have it be set to zero
because I want to start off with both of
those at the zero degrees and then we're
going to come in here and start creating
our spaceship constructor call for the
polygon parent class and it has five
points and there you go just created a
spaceship and that is all the
constructor is going to do and now what
I need to do is come in here and define
all of these different methods that I
decided that I
previously and I almost never do this
but sometimes it really makes sense to
just have everything that this method is
going to do be all on one line it just
makes for neater code overall so that's
why I'm doing it in this situation and
then we're just going to go get why
Centrepointe and this is going to return
the center why point now whenever we
have any get methods most of the time
you're also going to have set methods
whatever of course most of the time
those are going to be void not going to
return anything
however they are going to receive
something and I'm going to have these
names be different in this situation
where you know this because this is
going to be an object is going to be
equal to X Center right like that and we
can just come in here copy that
throw that there this is going to be Y
this is going to be Y and this is going
to be Y I'm also going to have to come
in here and create a way for to increase
my X positions so just going to use what
I have already defined previous in the
last tutorial increase exposition double
increment amount here I'm going to have
mostly everything current side here as
well grab that guy throw him in there
and then this is just going to
incremented the position this is just
going to be the center point for the
ship you see anybody that could read
this now of course I do heavily call man
all this stuff but anybody could kind of
like look at this and just see what's
going on because I'm using good names
that makes sense and pretty much
everything here is pretty simple and
that's the goal with object-oriented
programming
well now I'm also like I said before I'm
not pause them I need the upper left
hand corner but if I do I need to
provide a encapsulated way to edit it so
this is going to return that value for
me and then do the same thing here for
the Y position pretty simple stuff and
like I said we're going to get it
probably going to need a way to set it
so let's do that real simple and easy to
understand and there you go
so I got that all handled now and we
just continue and you'll see if you do
all their heavy lifting whenever you're
designing your class diagram it makes
everything else pretty easy so let's say
we want to get the ship with a problem
there we are there you go now I'm able
to get the width and the height no
reason in this situation however to set
the width and the height so I'm not
going to put that in there but for
another type of game that might make a
lot of sense
then I'm
get my velocity and there you go there's
mirror X velocity and popped up little
error here telling me that I didn't name
these properly up here so there we are
figured that out piece of cake and get
my Y velocity and then in most
situations again I'm going to need to be
able to set my velocity set set you can
see I'm pretty much doing the same thing
over and over again that's a good thing
I want to think too much
that means chances are I'm not going to
make any errors and I did exactly the
same thing for my Y velocity then I'm
also going to increment my velocity
slowly so like we did before increase X
velocity as you see right here on the
right side of the screen and there you
are incrementing it pretty much in the
same way I did before and there that is
and of course I increment my X velocity
I'm going to have to increment my Y
velocity and there it is pretty simple
stuff to do something really really
complicated like five spaceship around
dynamically the way that I showed you in
the previous tutorial decrease there's
also something I defined it over here
I'm not necessarily positive I'm going
to need to use it however what I'm going
to throw it in there just in case now of
course in a situation which you would do
something like that you would put in you
know like a note in comments that not
currently being used or whatever and
then decrement this guy anything I'm
doing doesn't make any sense just leave
a comment below and I'll be more than
happy to answer it if camp and then I
need to set my ship movement angle going
to receive a double of course and then
I'm also going to get my moving angle
and that's exactly what that'll do and
the last thing I need to do here before
we get into some stuff that's a little
bit more complicated is to increase my
moving angle and understand increment
that as well
piece of cake okay so now comes a little
bit more of a complicated thing now if I
want to calculate my moving angle I'm
going to need to figure out what the x
and y position is going to be I'm not
going to get into a lot of this trig but
basically that's what you're going to be
using here is trigonometry to be able to
figure these out so if this is the angle
of my ship and then I need
to figure out what X&amp;amp;Y positions I want
to change based off of that I just need
to use some simple trigonometry which
means basically if I want to get the
opposite value right here which is going
to give me Y positions I'm going to need
to use the sine function on this to
figure out what that Y position is and
alternatively if I want to be able to
get the adjacent or the x position or X
vector for this guy I need to do the
cosign for that guy so that's basically
what I got to do here I'm going to show
you the calculation so you can see it so
I'm going to go public double ship X
move angle and it's going to get a
double like that then it's just going to
return I'm going to cast this to double
and then I'm going to go math dot cosine
and I'm going to take my X moving angle
which is going to be in degrees and if I
want to convert that into radians which
I need for the cosine function to
properly work I need to add this two pi
divided by 180 in this situation and
there you go that's going to dynamically
calculate my moving angle for me and
spit back my X vector for that guy and
then if I want to get the Y vector I'm
going to do pretty much the same sort of
thing except in this situation of course
this is going to be ship Y and this is
going to be Y as well and then I'm going
to use sine instead of cosine like I
showed you in this little guy right here
so if you want to get the opposite value
or this why you use sine of that angle
which is this angle right here and if
you want to get the X vector then you
use cosine and then of course this is Y
as well all right next thing I'm going
to want to do based off of all this
stuff on the right side of the screen is
go public
double get rotation angle it's just
going to return the rotation angle for
me then I need to also provide a way to
increase my rotation angle I like that
and just go if get rotation angle
because I want to make sure that this
rotation angle stays in between 0 and
360 degrees so in this situation since
I'm going to be moving it by 5 degrees
at a time because we wanted to provide a
almost unlimited way of rotating and in
the situation which it goes above
3:55 that means I want to set it to zero
there we are then we're going to go else
rotation angle is just going to be
incremented by five degrees and that's
what that got us and then if we increase
what do we need to do then decrease some
copy this not many things change this is
why once you get used to programming you
can pretty much do it out of your head
with music blaring except in this
situation it's going to be if this is
less than zero we're going to make the
rotation angle 355Â° else if it's not
we're going to decrement it just like it
needs to be decremented and then we need
to handle get bounds which is right here
there's get bounds right down there so
it's going to return a rectangle if you
don't understand anything I'm doing here
chances are you've already left but if
you don't understand it's probably
because you haven't watched the previous
tutorials so watch those two do
something really cool like this it takes
more than one tutorial then get bounds
it's just going to return new rectangle
now we can do the cool stuff like this
get ship whit call that method that we
created previously minus 14 which is
half of the size of the ship the only
reason I made that a locked-down thing
is kind of to shorten it more than
anything else I could have did this in a
whole bunch of different ways but since
I decided to lock down my height and
width of my ship I'm just gonna leave it
this way feel free to change it and then
get ship with and get ship I semicolon
there you go it's almost like writing
sentences that's what's so cool about
object-oriented programming and I think
that's where I'm going to leave it off
because it's tutorials getting a little
bit long I don't want to overwhelm you
however if you want to see all the
finished code all you need to do is
click the link underneath this video you
can go get the whole entire thing and
then in the next part of the tutorial
I'm going to explain and show you how to
fly the ship around it in a limitless
number of different angles and a whole
bunch of other things like you saw in
part 55 of this tutorial leave any
questions or comments below otherwise
