explain exactly what a swap and a
derivative is an easy to understand way
so why did I decide to do this
presentation well there's been a nearly
constant conversation this matter for
the past year and a half here I'm gonna
explain derivatives futures options in
an understandable way derivatives first
off were created to help banks investors
and corporations to manage risk a
derivative is a financial arrangement
between two groups and the payments one
of these parties is made based off the
performance of an agreed upon price move
of said item these items can include
commodities corporate bonds currency
government that interest rates mortgages
stocks etc you get the point so here's a
simple example let's say we go out and I
buy you a cup of coffee for $1 we agree
that the next time we meet you will
return the favor
we signed contracts and everything real
serious situation so what I did was I
bought a future cup of coffee today for
$1 and you agreed to give it to me at
any time in the future if we don't see
each other for five years or the price
of coffee skyrockets I will make out
quite well
if however coffee is available out of
the tap for next and I think I've just
essentially lost my dollar derivatives
are just a bet that something will be
worth more or less at some point in the
future the only difference between my
coffee example and real derivatives is
complexity and also time limits options
and derivatives and swaps normally have
a limited time limit in my coffee
example I said anytime in the future
there are thousands of different kinds
of derivatives that are managed for the
most part by computers because of their
overall complexity there are basically
two types of derivatives options
contracts and forward contracts these
can either be traded on an exchange or
privately the private ones are the ones
that currently have everyone upset an
option gives the buyer the right but not
the obligation to buy or sell something
at a predefined price until a specific
date this option normally costs a
fraction of the cost of the asset
obviously a forward contract or a future
swap forces the buyer and seller to make
a trade on a specific date in the future
and at a set price so why are
derivatives needed they take a lot of
risk out of doing business by spreading
that risk
many other people for a fee businesses
in this country would be very unstable
if they weren't allowed to stabilize
their raw material and currency risks
with derivatives let's look at Southwest
Airlines as an example Southwest during
the period when gas costs skyrocketed to
$4 a gallon saw their profits soar
because they had established derivatives
that allowed them to buy fuel for $50 a
barrel roughly without those derivatives
they would have been in the same shape
as many other airlines that definitely
would have cost them a loss in profits
but also a loss in jobs derivatives
exist for one reason they are the
cheapest way for a company to protect
themselves from normally unforeseen risk
so why are derivatives potentially
dangerous well you may have heard of a
word called leverage leverage can
multiply losses or gains quite
substantially remember when you enter
into a derivative agreement you pay a
fraction of what the asset costs also
the asset is normally purchased and then
sold to the counterparty at nearly the
exact same time so let's use Southwest
as an example again they bought the
option to purchase barrels of fuel at
$50 a barrel when those same barrels
were worse about $35 sounds stupid right
wrong they paid a fee per barrel for
that option the counterparty didn't buy
the barrels and store them at $35 a
piece the reason why is oil rots On June
2008 oil now cost $125 a barrel
Southwest counterparty is now on the
hook for buying those barrels of oil for
$125 and then selling them for only $50
that's a $75 loss per barrel for a
measly couple of bucks that the option
cost Southwest's got a return of 37
point 5 times roughly that's thirty
seven point five times not percent their
counterparty lost 37 point five times
this is why options are potentially
extremely dangerous
that's leverage the chance that you can
lose considerably more than you ever
invested or made from the original
investment now when you combine options
with margin this is when we're talking
about extreme danger
what makes derivatives even more
dangerous is when those contracts are
purchased on margin when you purchase
something on margin you are buying it
with loaned money because currency
movements are so slight being fractions
of a penny to increase the return on
those pennies traders might put up
$10,000 as collateral in exchange for a
hundred thousand won best clip this is
called buying on margin now if the
currency increases by a penny they made
a dime instead the problem lies and what
happens when prices unexpectedly dropped
dramatically then the guy comes back
looking for a repayment on the loan
being a margin call now instead of
losing ten thousand you lost a hundred
thousand plus interest this actually
happened with a company called long-term
capital management back in the 80s and
nearly caused a global collapse of the
financial system and most people don't
even know that existed if you leave a
comment below I would do a presentation
on long-term capital management very
exciting so what are investment firms
being accused of currently in 2010 well
major investment firms are accused of
selling derivative contracts that they
knew would fail kind of like taking out
an insurance policy right before you
kill somebody they supposedly created
mortgage-backed security pools that they
designed to fail and then bought
insurance that would pay out if the
mortgages fail well they did and the
insurance contract paid out that's why a
IG collapsed they were the biggest
seller of these insurance products firms
have also been accused of what's called
front-running
this is when you know a big investment
is going to be made in a security that
will drive up the value of said security
so you buy that security before you put
through the large investment in said
security you then sell the security and
make a nice profit if you have any
further questions on investing I was
employed by one of the major brokerage
houses I can talk about pretty much
anything and if you'd like the advice of
a former stockbroker there's nothing to
gain by providing you with that advice
