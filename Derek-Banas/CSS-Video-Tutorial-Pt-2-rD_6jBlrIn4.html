2 of my cascading stylesheets tutorial
today I'm going to show you absolutely
every single way you can style fonts
using cascading style sheets first for I
continue when to bring something up
Tasmin khatma an error that I made
whenever I listed all of the different
block elements in HTML or XHTML I forgot
to include list items so that's from the
previous tutorial if you didn't watch
that most definitely check that out and
two other things brought up by you guys
is that I did not go over the pre tag in
my HTML tutorial in the pre tag what it
allows you to do is to display text that
needs specific numbers of spaces and
also I'm going to show you how to do
inline style statements like this and at
the same time whenever you're using the
font family styling if you have any
spaces you want to make sure that you
surround those with single quotes as I'm
doing right here and I'm going to be
doing a lot of inline styling again you
can always defines for example a
paragraph tag just as we did in the
previous tutorial right like this but
I'm going to do all this in line so that
it my job is a little bit easier just
understand that you would normally do
this inside of an external CSS file and
now I'll demonstrate exactly how the pre
tag works spaces or import and then
we'll close that off and please save
that and jump over here you can see that
the spacing that I used in between these
words is kept exactly as I defined it so
that's the pre tag and also that is how
to properly use the font-family tag
remember always put single quotes around
any fonts that have any spaces inside
okay so now on to every single way of
styling fonts in cascading style sheets
here again I'm going to use the pre tag
to define this guy and the font tag is
the shorthand way to define a font in
just one line and the different things
that you would style would be font style
font variant and I'm going to go over
all of these individually font weight
font size line height
yes there really are this many different
ways of styling these guys and then
finally font family okay so those are
all the different things that you style
all inside of just the font style so you
can do that all in one tag and here I'll
give you a demonstration exactly how to
do that so I'll just have font style and
then I'll follow that with a font tag
and then I could say italic bold 1.5 am
Ariel vatika sans serif all inside of
one guy and if we jump over here you can
see that it's styled all that is both
italic as well as it is bold and we're
using burial as our default font and the
different sizing that we use inside of
there so that is the font tag now I'm
going to show you some other ones that
are a little bit more interesting and
here I'm actually going to use a list of
course I got to put the UL tags here and
that UL tag there and here I'm going to
specifically cover font family and you
would describe that would be very
similar to the previous two tour except
I'm going to show you every single one
of these guys and you can see right
there there's an del mono I define that
commonly there are twelve different
fonts that are available on max PCs and
UNIX systems I'm going to show you all
of them right like this so we have
Andale mono and then we have Arial Arial
black Comic Sans which a lot of people
hate for some reason courier courier new
Georgia impact sans serif which is on
every browser serif of course trebuchet
ms' and ver Danya save that jump over
here you can see all the different fonts
that are available inside of almost
every single browser right here on your
screen and here I'm going to get rid of
these first six and I'm going to show
you all the different ways to style
using the font size tag I'm just going
to quickly grab this put font size in
there and you can style on a percentage
basis and there's the smaller tag extra
small medium which is also the default
extra large and extra extra large and
then to actually these guys to work just
going to come in here and type in 150%
they've been smaller extra small again
medium is the default
if you wanted to define it that's how
you do that and you could see all the
different ways of using the font size
tag with cascading style sheets and you
have font weight again I'm just going to
make my life a little bit easier
replacing size with white and there's
actually 13 of these guys here you have
normal bold bolder lighter and then you
have 100 through 900 so I edited
everything there and then if we reload
you can see all the different ways of
changing font weights inside of
cascading style sheets font style is a
very strange guy basically you have
normal which means that there's nothing
and then you have italic if you wanted
it to be normal you wouldn't do anything
if you wanted it to be italic you would
put a talaq inside of there so rather
than change everything just look up here
and you can see that that is now italic
now you know every single way to use the
font style tech font variant also only
has one option and that option is small
caps and if I put small caps in there
and spell variant properly you can now
see that small caps small capital
letters are being used inside of there
now you know every single font variant
tool available and now to demonstrate
line height so I'm just going to come in
here I've been in height and for height
you define percentages so I'm just going
to do a couple random percentages I'm
going to do 20 percent I'm going to do
50 percent 100 percent 140 180 and 220
and then I'm gonna have to also change
this to line not font height line height
point and you can see how they moved
around on the different lines and you
can also mess around with a letter
spacing so I'm just going to come in
here and replace a line height with
letter spacing and yes is just used to
define the distance between all of the
different letters and you can see all
the different ways that we're editing
the distance between text that actually
stretches off to that it's other side of
the screen that's why they bounced down
to here you can also change the distance
between words using exactly the same
stuff here so let's just save it jump
over here and you can see the distance
between the words is slowly increasing
as I increase this number right here
then you have text a line and you've no
doubt seen this before
line left center right or justify and
you can see that it did just that left
center right and justified then you have
text decoration just kind of neat and
here we can decide that we want this
underlined over lined put a line through
it or make it blink and blink works on
some browsers and obviously it doesn't
work on the Chrome browser that we have
here on the screen then we have text
indent of course it defines the distance
that you indent the line right like that
then you have text transform there's
actually not many more of these guys and
with transform you actually only have
three options force a capitalization
force uppercase or lowercase link and
you can see that it did that just like
that and then you have vertical line and
to show you exactly how this works I'm
actually going to style a Tallaght AG
here because if I put these on separate
lines it wouldn't make any sense there's
actually eight of these guys and I'm
just gonna put the word random inside of
here close off that tag copy all right
so we got baseline we get sub we got
super top text top bottom text bottom
and middle like that you can see how
they randomly move around vertically on
the line based off of what you defined
inside here yes I am covering every
single one of these guys but there's
only two left if you can believe that
and they are color and background color
and here I'm going to jump back to
actually using lists here to make this
nice and simple and there's mainly 16
color attributes that you can assign to
text actually there's an infinite of a
variety of them and if you want to see
Pleet list of how to use these in
regards to hexadecimal codes you go to
en dot wikipedia.org forward slash wiki
word slash web colors if you go there
you're going to see countless numbers of
different colors that are available to
you okay so we're going to come in here
and we are going to make ourselves some
color changes and the colors available
to you are aqua black obviously which is
the default blue fuchsia grey green lime
rune navy olive purple red silver teal
white which we're obviously not going to
be
say a yellow light no orange let's just
put orange in there see what happens
boink and there is an orange of course
and you can see here that you do not see
white and you can also see here you're
of course styling the bulleted item and
not just the text and for the final guy
that we're going to put inside here it
is background color and just so you know
if you also wanted a style using
hexadecimal codes this is what they
would look like like this is a
hexadecimal code for a color of red just
put the hash symbol and because I looked
up on Wikipedia what this is that's what
a hexadecimal code looks like and you
can see that there is a version of red
that shows up I think this is actually
pink so you can see that there's an
infinite variety of different colors
that are available to you and if I want
to change the background color I'm going
to use all of these sames colors right
here on the screen except what I'm going
to do is replace color background color
boink so there is a whole different
number of different ways you can style
text that's pretty much every single way
you can style text using cascading style
sheets up next I'm going to get into
positioning and how to move things
around in the background and then you
will know everything there is to know
about cascading style sheets have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below otherwise till
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
