four of my tutorial on how you can
create a featured content slider gallery
whatever for any website including
WordPress if you haven't watched the
previous parts this tutorial I guarantee
you will be confused so definitely go
and check those out prior to watching
this and also if you want to
dramatically increase the ability for
you to actually understand what I'm
doing here you definitely also want to
check out the code that is in the
underbar what i did today is I created
these nice little arrow tools that are
going to allow us to flip through all of
the different content this also is going
to work with just one featured slider
group here of five pictures and it also
will work with 30 and I actually could
set it up so that would work with an
infinite variety of these but I figured
no one would ever want more than 15
different featured articles so that's
why I kept it where it is so in this
tutorial going to learn how to do all of
that so let's get into the code all
right there's very few changes i need to
make and to get all this to work but
some of the stuff I'm doing is a little
bit complicated I'm in featured content
PHP if you saw the previous tutorials
you remember that of course I don't want
that to be there someone to delete it
but pretty much all I have to do here is
come in before ntt featured content the
div is closed out and I need to add my
thumbnails that's it that's the only
thing I have to do this I'm just going
to go div and then i'm going to say
class we actually created this in a
previous part of the tutorial and i can
just copy and paste but i'm just going
to put it in here in this tutorial to a
certain extent is a response to the
comments that i get all the time why
don't you do more complicated tutorials
the reason why is complicated things are
very hard for me to teach you and I
would greatly appreciate it if you'd
leave a comment below if you did like
this tutorial and I'm not saying that
just to get tons of comments right so
I'm going to create my left arrow tool
or my back button and I'm going to close
that div and then to save myself some
time I'm gonna copy this paste it in
there and then i'm going to put right
because that's the only thing that
changed there and then i'm going to put
right here also and there you go now i
have both my left button and my right
button that it will show up on the
screen and i'm just linking out to the
images of them so after i file save that
I'm then
going to go into my style dot CSS file
again all the codes in the underbar and
i'm going to put some styling in here
for those two specific guys so ntt i'm
going to say left button and i'm going
to do some CSS styling on all this and
I'm gonna put some space in here so you
can see all this all at one time all
right so I'm going to position these
buttons absolutely which just simply
means I'm going to tell them at
precisely where to appear inside of this
div and i'm going to say from the top of
the div i wanted to go down 267 pixels
and left 392 pixels and there you go
there's that old thing now i'm going to
copy this paste it in here i'm going to
define the right button again position
is going to be absolute 267 pixels from
the top that also makes sense and then i
went ahead and from the left side it's
going to be 925 pixels 925 okay great so
I got that now the only other thing I'm
going to need to do is to handle some
styling in regards to what happens if
someone hovers over these images so I'm
just going to go image and I'm going to
go hover and i'm going to change the
opacity based off of that i'm also going
to do a couple other things as this
tutorial progresses so if they hover
over it's going to have an opacity of
sixty percent that's what that means
right there and then i'm going to do
precisely the same exact thing with the
right button and there you go if i'll
save that and i'm all done with
everything in the style dot CSS file now
i have to go on to the javascript file
and fix everything there alright so this
guy is going to change pretty
dramatically mainly because a lot of
this information right here is all going
to be put into a function so that I'm
able to automatically not only update
the information let me show you what I
mean see all of this every single thing
in here is going to have to be updated
whenever I click on these arrows so I
need to be able to delete everything
that's currently here and then put
everything back in again and then right
set everything to the defaults so
there's a lot of work that needs to be
done to get all that to work so one
thing I decided to do is to take out
this div area right here entity text
underscore div and all of this
information that pertains to the
different types of featured content
including the excerpts which is right
here and the images meaning the featured
which are right here and in the
thumbnail images so I took all of those
guys out and I put them in separate
files so there's a lot of information
here then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to dynamically grab all this
information only one time to save on
memory and resources and so forth and
I'm going to save it to variables and
then I'm going to go in and fix
everything as different changes occur so
what I'm going to do now is to define
the number of featured content pages
that are totally going to show up so I'm
going to do this by creating a variable
and it's going to be called num featured
pages and by default I'm setting this up
to three but like I said before you can
have anywhere from one to three with my
very specific tool and technically you
could have this set up to work with an
unlimited number of posts but like I
said I never thought anyone would ever
want to focus on more than 15 different
articles kind of insane so that's why I
kept it where it is so that means
there's going to be three potential
groupings of five images and five
groupings of featured content so this is
what that means okay well then what I
got to do is I'm going to create the
variables that are going to hold all of
the content in these files all of this
information is going to be dynamically
grabbed from these files and it's going
to be saved in these variables right
here so I'm defining them and I'm giving
them no value to start out so that's
what those are for since i have three
pages i need to define three of these
guys and it's just that easy i just
defined three of them now all of this
information right here is going to be
sent over into a setup function that's
going to run every single time this guy
starts I'm going to create that in a
minute this right here is going to
remain because it makes sense for this
to stay out of that setup function
because it mainly on has to run one time
and then all of this information is
going to be sent to that setup function
as well but there's a couple other
things I need to define inside of here
so I'm going to put in comment just so
you can see where the new stuff is what
I'm going to do first is I'm going to
define a variable ntt set interval ID
and what i'm doing here is i'm going to
create and store the ID each time set
interval is called what we did in the
previous tutorial is we were calling
rotate images repetitively over
over down here what happens is I'm
actually going to have to create two of
these guys and to get them to work I'm
going to have to delete the previous set
interval that was set I hope that makes
sense so what I did previously was I
created this set interval function that
continually calls the rotate images
function so what I'm doing up here is
I'm storing the ID that is associated
with set interval and I'm actually going
to come in here and i'm just going to
change it right now so i'm going to copy
this guy right here and then down here
i'm going to store that ID in here later
on I'm going to destroy this function
whenever I recreate it you're going to
see how things progress then I'm also
and this is another new thing I'm also
going to have to track what featured
content page is being shown remember
there are three pages and the first one
that's going to be shown is going to be
the first one so that is what that is
and this is going to change also and
then I'm going to call the function
that's going to set up all of the
defaults whenever I put new featured
content on this page and that is pretty
much it that's what i have here in
regards to the new stuff so now what I
got to do is create this function right
here that sets up all our defaults and
we're going to be doing a lot of copy
and paste them so after we get out of
here i'm going to call function and it's
going to be called ntt set up featured
content i'm going to do a lot of copied
and pasted and i'm going to jump up here
where we were before and i'm going to
copy this guy and this guy right here
first and then i'm going to jump down
into my new function i just created and
paste that information in there and then
i'm going to jump back up here again and
jump from there the whole way down to
here and i'm going to cut that out of
there as well and paste that into there
so really nothing has changed I just
copied and pasted information that i
previously had used in the top of this
function now i need to bind the new
arrows that i put on the screen to a
function that is going to execute
different types of code based off of
whether the left arrow key is clicked on
or the right arrow key is clicked on so
this is new and simply with jquery all i
do is go dot ntt underscore right button
and then image and to bind the clicks on
these images to a function let's type in
that and then grab next
featured content all right well I need a
click event to be bound to the left
button also just going to copy and paste
that le ft another thing I'm going to
have to do is if there is only one
featured content grouping of 5 on the
screen there's no reason for the arrows
to show up so I'm going to go if and TT
num featured pages is equal to 1 then I
once certain i want to make certain that
those guys do not show up on the screen
and to save themselves some time I'm
just going to copy this paste that in
there and here when it goes CSS I'm
going to change the opacity 20 and I'm
going to do exactly the same thing to
the left button so that should make
sense to you and then on top of that
what I also wanted to be able to do is
unbind the click that I just set up
because just because the thing has no
pass T is 0 doesn't mean that the bind
event doesn't still exist but what I'm
accidentally clicking on something they
can't even see so I'm going to take that
event off that I created right here I'm
taking it off if there is only one
featured content page and that's all I
need to set up in the setup function
that you see right here basically a lot
of copy and pasting so what do I have to
do I have to grab next featured content
which is right and good thing I looked
at this I'm also going to have to create
this function so I'm going to have to
create the grab next featured content
copy that and I'm actually going to put
it up here right like this so now i'm
going to go function grab next featured
content it is not passed any attributes
and then i'm going to say if patron
content being shown and remember by
default that starts off at one so if the
featured content being shown whenever
the next button is clicked on the screen
i'm going to take all the information
that was copied from these files over
here in this situation next I'm going to
take all this information and i'm going
to copy it to the main featured content
div and you do that using the HTML
function and post content underscore
HTML to I like that if you don't
remember where this comes from it comes
from right here ntt post content that
was taken from those files that i set up
previously so that's what i'm accessing
and I'm saying that I want it to be put
in the div called ntt featured content
which is the div that surrounds the
entire featured content area
I'm just going to copy this then I'm
going to change the value of featured
content being shown to be equal to 2 and
then we get to do a lot of coffee and
pasting here I'm going to put the else
statement on a different line keep this
from getting horribly confusing in this
situation i'm going to say if it's too
and i'm going to copy this and then
provide the proper actions to make sure
that the featured content for 3 is set
up and then i'm just going to copy this
else if it's equal to three and yes I
could have did this with a switch
statement but I didn't if it's three
that means start over from the beginning
and then that's all set up properly and
now that I have new featured content
inside of here I need to call the
function that is going to clear my
previously set interval function which
is this guy down here I need to clear
this ID so that I don't have multiple
these guys floating around so I'm just
going to say NTT set interval ID and
that's going to eliminate the previously
set up set interval function I'm then
going to call rotator index and set this
the first child thumb and this sounds
really complicated but in essence what
i'm doing here is i'm saying whenever it
is flipped over that it should be set to
the last featured content on each one of
these pages so it's jumping the beaver
jump in the shark that's all that that's
doing because rotator index allows me to
track which featured content is being
shown out of those four hives and then
i'm going to call ntt there's not much
code left by the way ntp setup featured
content which is the guy that i had
previously that i had created right here
in TT setup featured content see so i'm
calling this and I'm saying fix
everything up that I just put on the
screen in essence that's what I'm doing
and what's really cool is now I'm going
to be able to select this and copy it
and paste it in because not many things
have changed so instead of next this is
going to be last and again this is the
function it's gonna be called whenever
the left button is clicked on so if one
is being shown currently I want to go to
the previous and that happens to be
three if two is currently being shown I
want to go to the previous which is one
and of course I need to change this and
also change this which is the
information that's being saved inside of
there and it
three is currently being shown well if i
want to go to the previous that would be
too so i have to change those two two
and nothing else needs to be changed for
this entire thing that is it I
technically could have created one
function that does all this but hey I'm
not perfect and then the last thing I
have to create is the function that's
actually going to go into feature data
one these different text files in which
I have all the information in regards to
different types of featured content it's
going to grab it it's going to save it
to a variable to be used later on and
the name of this function is get
featured content and TT it's going to be
passed an attribute that is going to
tell it how many of these pages actually
exist meaning these pages that have all
this data on it and I'm going to say if
i'm going to copy this just so i have to
type it in over and over again this guy
right here meaning that there are two
pages set up to pull information from if
that is true dynamically i'm going to go
and grab this information and to a
certain extent i'm doing this just to
show you how to grab information
dynamically using jquery text function
then i'm going to define a function
where the data that is gathered from
this file is going to be saved i'm going
to skip to the next line to keep this
understandable and then i'm going to
save to a variable which again let's
just jump up here and grab this this is
where it's going to be saved just see
you now scroll back down paste is equal
to data and then fun fun i get the copy
and paste some more right after i close
off this function that I defined rights
inside of here copy and paste and then
if there's remember two of them well
that means that data to exists and I'm
going to save it inside of this guy
right here then I'm going to go else if
there are three of these featured
content pages now I just got to put
these get statements in here more than
once so I'm going to copy and I could
have really saved time with it switch
statement this time but either way and
then i'm going to copy this because i
need to get the third one and to get the
third one i just type that in there and
that in there and close that off we're
almost done else i'm going to just
assume that there's always going to be
at least one grouping of featured
content to grab i'm actually going to
build it in just to make sure that it
does
stay that way and I'm going to set this
to one is that that's the one and I'm
going to have to take this guy right
here and close off all these functions
of course and then closing off the else
statement and I already have it set up
so that the function is already closed
so that is what we need to do to be able
to create this beautiful little guy
right here give any questions or
comments leave them in the comment
section below but please be nice
otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
