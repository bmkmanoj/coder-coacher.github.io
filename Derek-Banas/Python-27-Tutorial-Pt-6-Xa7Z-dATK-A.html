6 of my programming with Python 2.7
tutorial where I'm going to eventually
cover pretty much anything you'd want to
know in regards to how to use the Python
programming language today I'm going to
go over functions and specifically to
start off this line of code here is used
to define what function to call when the
program starts and the function is
telling the Python interpreter call
specifically is the function called main
this doesn't have to be main but you
probably always want to use main because
that's pretty consistently used but I
could just as easily call this turnip
and how you create a function inside of
Python is to use the three letters D
followed by the name of the function
followed by some braces and then
followed by a colon now if you want to
create a function inside of your program
and you don't know necessarily what's
going to go in there currently and you
want to jump around to some other code
but not trigger a whole bunch errors you
can just simply type in the word pass
and it won't trigger any errors so what
I'm going to do now is I'm actually
going to create a function that actually
is going to do something in this
function is going to add a couple
numbers that are sent to it again D D F
and here I'm going to define then I plan
on receiving two numbers the person's
called num 1 and I'm going to give it a
default value of 1 so if they don't send
anything it's still going to complete a
calculation and I'm going to show you a
more intricate way of doing this after I
do this simple demonstration and I'm
going to use the return command to
return the addition of num1 and num2
so basically pass is then going to call
the function add numbers and it's going
to return the addition of those numbers
and let's just say that I don't provide
any numbers what's going to happen no
problem it's going to just use the
default values 1 and 1 let's say I then
change my mind and decide to send some
numbers you can see now it use these
numbers instead of the default but what
happens if I send three numbers I think
you can guess I get an error so how do I
get around this how can I create a
function that will accept an unlimited
number of different arguments that are
sent to it and just simply work no
problem just tell python that you want
to
except an unlimited number of arguments
and this is a RGS but this again can be
anything just make sure you have the
store in here and what this is basically
saying the Python is you will accept an
unlimited number of arguments and you
want to come down in here and I'm going
to create a variable called final value
and assign it the value of zero and then
basically what I'm saying with this is
if statement is if arguments were passed
to this function meaning args has a
value what I'm going to do I'm gonna
call my for statement and again if you
didn't see the other tutorials I'm sure
this is extremely confusing you should
go watch them and it will all be cleared
up and with the for statement I'm gonna
cycle through all the values that are
sent and I'm going to use my shorthand
Edition notation here take the value of
I and assign it to final value and then
after that's done I'm going to return
final value back to the calling function
in main and if they didn't send anything
meaning args didn't have a value I'm
still going to return a string that says
please provide numbers and can see just
like that it went and added everything
up and this will work no matter how many
numbers I add just continues working
that's a real shorthand way of passing
an unlimited number of arguments and
then just working through it now I'd
like to talk about what they call
namespacing or global or local variables
inside of Python in any programming
language now you see I created this
function up here called final value well
it's been created so I should be able to
print it out right nope this variable is
only available inside of the function
that created it so this is known as a
local variable or a local name space and
that name space will be called add
numbers I don't really like the word
namespace just think of this as any
variable that is created inside of a
function exists there and nowhere else
now of course you have your global
namespace or your global area and any
variables that are created outside of
all the other functions that exist are
available inside of these said functions
they are global that are available to
everybody and in fact now you can see
level 10 was here and I printed global
10 and it showed up right here a
one thing that is a little odd is let's
say global 10 is equal to 15 okay why
changed it and it's available in here so
now Global 10 should be equal to 15
everywhere right nope it is only
available inside of the area while you
can print and access global variables
you are not allowed to change global
variables inside of functions except
under certain circumstances which I'm
going to demonstrate to you now there
are ways around this but this is
probably not best practice but since
this is an all-encompassing tutorial I'm
going to go over it if you want to
change global variables being global 10
I'm going to create a function called
change global now I can either change
this global variable in one or another
different ways I can do it by defining
that I want to access that global with
the keyword global and then you can see
if I come down here and then call change
global and run it that it worked I
printed out the original value of global
10 then I called here changed it and
then print it out the new version that
is one way of changing global variables
from inside of functions another way to
do it is using this Global's function
here and you can see that I was able to
change the global variable that way and
you can access all your global variables
with this function as well so there's a
couple different ways or two different
ways to change global variables inside
of functions but by default you're not
supposed to do that and by default
python doesn't allow you to do that so
either way it's up to you if you want to
do it I just want to make sure you knew
that it was indeed possible now let's
say I wanted to pass an unlimited number
of key value pairs for processing inside
of a function how would I do that I'm
going to show you how to create a
function that accepts an unlimited
number of key value pairs and here
you're going to do two stores instead of
just one and I use kV arguments
sometimes people use kW but I like V
better because key value arguments and
then I'm just going to simply cycle
through these key values with a for
statement and I'm going to print them
the screen and then return then I'm
going to jump down to main and I'm going
to call my phone
create dictionary that's really what
this is doing it's created that's what
this ultimately becomes as a dictionary
full of what are called tuples which I
explained in a previous tutorial so it's
going to create for me a dictionary full
of tuples you could use this for
customer database type things or
whatever you want to do and I have to
put the operator in in here to make this
work if I execute it you can see it
prints out to the screen the information
that I placed into it but I could also
come in here and pass multiple tuples so
let's say I create a customer one is
equal to right like that and execute it
and you can see that it printed out all
of those different tuples inside of
there and just so you completely
understand it I'm going to use the type
command here to show you exactly what
Kay Borges is it's a dictionary so
that's a real simple way to create an
infinite I mean you can put as many of
these tuples as you want create a
dictionary that has an infinite number
of tuples that can contain any type of
information that you would want and as
the final demonstration I'm going to go
through what is one of the most
confusing things in programming period
for a lot of people and that is
something that's called recursion with
recursion basically what you're doing is
calling for a function inside of itself
so let's say I want to figure out how to
calculate a factorial and accepts a
single number and a factorial is just
simply like the factorial of 3 would be
3 times 2 times 1 so it's the number
itself times all those other numbers
that lie under it until it gets to the
value of 1 so for example the factorial
4 would be this this is just a common
mathematical tool that's created
whenever you're trying to explain
recursion to people it's basically what
I'm going to do I'm going to check that
the number that was passed is not equal
to 1 because if it's equal to 1 the
factorial of 1 is equal to 1 so there's
no point in me doing any calculations
here so I'm just going to return the
value of the factorial which would be 1
however if they send me any other number
I want to return that number times
and here's where you get into recursion
I'm actually calling the same function
from inside of the function that I am
using and this is why people get
confused to make this simple I'm going
to first show you here how this guy
works jumping down into main and just
calling factorial and sending forward
for example okay you can see and as you
know 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 is equal
to 24 so this worked what exactly went
on here and to make this simple I'm
going to make it 3 basically what you
have to look at this as as not one
function but as 3 functions like I have
here on the screen
so whenever the factorial function is
run the first time the value of 3 is
passed to it and this value of 3 is not
equal to 1 so we're going to skip out of
that then we're going to multiply 3
times whatever the factorial of 2 is so
this don't think of this is the same
function think of this as a new function
a different function that multiplies 2
times whatever the value under 2 is less
than so in this circumstance here's your
new function this is this function call
right here and I'm saying is 2 equal to
1 no of course not then I want to
multiply 2 times whatever the factorial
of 1 is what we already know that is 1
so here what we got to do is we'll have
1 times 2 and then this result is passed
up to here the value of 2 lies right
here so this could actually look that is
2 instead of that factorial and we
multiply 3 times 2 and you get your
final answer which is 6 so that is
recursion recursion is just a big word
for calling a function from inside of
itself so hopefully that was
understandable if it wasn't leave a
question or comment below and I'll be
more than happy to put out another
tutorial that it will explain any
questions you guys have course any other
questions or comments leave them below
up next object-oriented programming till
