my wordpress theme tutorial today I'm
gonna show you numerous ways to
manipulate post and page data using the
tools provided through the WordPress
framework many of you have sent me notes
asking me why these tutorials always
start out kind of boring and the reason
why is I truly believe it's only by
mastering the boring aspects of a tool
that you truly master that tool and
that's my quote I don't believe I
borrowed that from anybody and also I
also make these tutorials a bit boring
at first just to weed out those people
who are just looking for quick fixes
what I have here on the screen on the
left side is index.php and over here on
the right side I dumped in some recipes
into my wordpress blog that i have
posted on my localhost and definitely if
you haven't watched part 1 of this
tutorial series you should check that
out first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you how you can specify
specific attributes that will affect the
query results with a function called
quarry hosts and here I'm going to use
the same exact sort of layout that is
used inside of WordPress by putting all
my PHP calls all on separate lines and
here is the query post function all this
code is available in a link in the
underbar if you want it whether you want
to use this as a cheat sheet so if I
want to just put out say two posts on
the screen this is exactly what I do I
file save that jump over here you're
gonna see that only two posts showed up
so that's a nice little way to play
around with this and I'm gonna leave
everything here exactly the same and I'm
only gonna change what is inside of this
area so you can also specifically target
IDs and only show those posts that fit
certain IDs by using P is equal to 46
for example and if we reload that you
can see that it just showed the one
jalapeno red bean burger on the screen
over here on the right side of the
screen so that's how you target those
guys and another way you can do that is
through what's called page underscore ID
so I'm just setting different variables
and it is performing those actions for
me there's no reason to run that though
because it's gonna give me exactly the
same results I could also say that I
just want to show pages I would do that
is by setting post type equal to page
and in this situation it's only going to
pop up those things
our pages on the right side of the
screen here and I could also come in
here and target very specific page names
in here I'm going to target sample page
and if you know PHP you can start to see
how this becomes extremely powerful in
being able to MIT unity to multiple
different pieces of data inside of here
in WordPress and I could also say for
example that I'll only want to see all
of those posts that lie after the fifth
post and you can also manipulate these
guys and have multiple options I'll show
up at the same time but I would just
want to show you pretty much every
single way you can pull different types
of information and here I'm gonna pull
just everything that shows up in the
category named recipes and it will do
that for me see that's a big long list
since I have a couple recipes inside of
this WordPress site that I have here on
my local computer you can also target
very specific tags so if I only want
recipes that contain eggplant it will
give me just those recipes that contain
pick plant and as you can see if we zoom
in here eggplant right here and I could
also come in here and define that I want
anything that contains eggplant or
onions for example this call me here
represents four and I can reload it and
it's going to show me everything that
contains eggplants or onions and if I
wanted to return things that contain
eggplant
and onions I would put a plus sign aside
of that and I could also bring back
everything that was of an author named
admin that's the only thing I got here
so I can't really do anything else and
that's gonna bring back every single one
of these posts since I made every single
one of them and I can also bring in here
everything that was made in a specific
month so since I just started this guy
I'm just gonna start here with April and
that's gonna show me nothing because
it's not a third it's the fourth month
sorry about that
and now you can see that every single
one of them popped up and I could also
pull up every single post that was
created in specific years and I could
also show every post that was made on a
specific day right like that I could
also define that I want all of these
guys to show up in a very specific order
by typing in order by equal to title and
by default it actually shows these
in descending order which is kind of
weird but if you'd like to be able to
show them in ascending order which makes
a little bit more sense just come in
here and define by putting and inside of
here and that's how you would look for
more than one of these guys at the same
time so here I'm gonna say order by
title but I want these to go in
ascending order if we do that you can
see that they are now alphabetized and
come in the proper order that we're
looking for and you could also come in
here and instead change this to DSC and
that would show them all in the sending
order and here I'll show you another way
to say for example show posts per page
you can define how many posts you want
to show up per page I'm gonna put a 5
inside of there and then put in the
inside then I'm gonna leave everything
else exactly the same and if I save that
you can see that it put them in
descending order and it's only going to
show five per page which is all kind of
neat well you can also retrieve data
from the database using a function
called get posts and what this will do
is issue a query for a very very custom
list so let's say for example when just
get this right out of here altogether
I wanted to list say 10 posts and I want
to order them alphabetically before I
start listing all of the other posts on
my screen how exactly what I do that so
I'm going to come in here and type PHP
and I'm gonna call this post titles is
equal to get posts there's the function
that I was talking about before and I'm
gonna say posts for age is equal to 10
and on off order by title and I want to
set my order equal to ascending order so
that it makes more sense to me and don't
forget to close off the end of that PHP
tag right there and just to reiterate
what this is gonna do is it's gonna list
ten titles that link to posts that fit
all of these requirements you're gonna
see it here on the screen for just a
second and then what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna cycle through all the
qualifying results based off of that
query right there with a for each loop
and I make another PHP call but for each
inside of here and post titles as I'm
just gonna put post inside of here call
one and just to keep this neat I'm gonna
say set
host data and the reason why you have to
use this is some post related data isn't
available whenever you use the get post
method so you have to make a call to
this setup post data function to resolve
that issue and at this point in time
there's really no reason to go more into
that it just sort of provides you access
that you previously wouldn't have and
then when I do a little bit HTML inside
here and then yes you can make PHP calls
inside of here and then I'm going to
make a call to the URL for each one of
these posts close that off and then make
another PHP call and associate that
reference to each one of those posts
with a title and after you get really
good at doing this sort of stuff you can
pretty much do anything you could ever
imagine with WordPress and I need to end
my for each loop and just with that
little bit of code I'm gonna save it and
reload it and you could say that it went
and printed the top 10 titles that link
to posts right there on the screen you
can also make multiple different calls
using the WordPress loop so these could
actually show up in your sidebar they
could show up in little divs inside your
main window area that's why people are
able to pull in all this different
information and have it all over the
screen and multiple different orders it
really helps you organize your site all
together but of course if you didn't
like that you could of course come in
here and maybe put in h3 tag around this
guy or whatever you'd like to do or use
CSS to make those guys bigger and there
you can see that they came in there much
larger if you'd want to do that which
kind of looks god-awful ugly now that I
think about it but either way actually
gonna delete out almost all of this
information meaning the whole entire
loop and everything else and I'm gonna
show you exactly how to actually make
your own WP query object which is the
guy that rolls over everything inside of
the loop well now you're gonna make your
own custom one and do really cool things
with it well the first thing that I want
to be able to do here is create a
temporary file and store the current WP
query inside of that because we might
need that in some other part of the web
page so if we want to reset it but we
want to be able to do what I want to do
here I need to master it and act as if I
am WP query in there
to nullify it now and then I'm gonna
create a new of you P query object and
yes it's normally frowned upon to come
in and change global objects or
variables of any type but this is
considered pretty common practice inside
of WordPress this isn't something that I
invented this is something that's used a
lot and then here this is going to allow
me to create custom queries using the
query function that's inside of WP query
how I do that is going WP query - and
then that bracket followed by query the
name of this guy and let's say I wanted
to find posts per page equal to five
again and order by title and set the
order again equal to sending and you
have to tack on the page variable and
what this value is equal to is whatever
the value of the current page is and you
put this on here so that whenever you
come in here later on like down here at
the very bottom of the screen it says
older entries and newer will say newer
entries if you would click on this but
whenever you do that it needs to know
what page you came from and what page
you're currently are on to be able to
tell what's new or what's old so that's
what's stored in that variable called
paged and close that guy off and here
I'm going to create a while loop WP
query and I'm gonna call 1/2 posts just
like before kind of cool the reason why
this is still all pink because I didn't
put a closing quote inside of there and
here kind of like before I'm gonna go
aah reference is equal to from the link
and make another PHP call and don't
forget close off that tag right there
and then spit out the title using the
title function and then make another PHP
call and this time I want to get the
content from the post and then call end
while so it cycles through all of the
posts that match my query that I created
here and then I'm gonna come in here
create a div actually I should have just
not deleted the previous version of this
guy and this guy is exactly the same as
the one that comes in WordPress so I'm
gonna jump over and actually grab that
got it cut and pasted that in there like
I said that's in the regular version of
WordPress inside of index dot PHP
and then after I'm done borrowing the WP
quarry object I want to make any type of
calls or queries to the database I'm
gonna reset this guy and eventually I'm
gonna start making pages that make
multiple calls to the loop and I just do
and say hey Tim I need all them values
back it gives them back to me if I fast
save that and reload it you can see that
it jumped in there and it's going to
give me exactly what I asked for five
per page all titled alphabetically right
there on the screen and you can see here
are older entries and then if I scroll
down it's going to show newer entries
and that is all for today if you have
any questions or comments leave them in
the comment section below otherwise
