8 of my blender video tutorial and this
part of the tutorial I'm going to cover
how we can cut holes as well as edges
into both flat as well as curved meshes
using both knife project and the shrink
wrap modifier and a couple other little
tricks like always in the description
underneath the video is a link to a text
format of all the different things I
click on so that it is very easy to
follow and I have a lot to do so let's
get into it
all right yeehaw so here is blender and
we are going to very first get rid of
this square and what I'm gonna do first
is I'm going to show you how to cut a
hole in a plane so I'll just go and mesh
and plane and there it is and down on
the left hand corner you'll see
everything I do but I'm also going to
say it ok and then I'm gonna go click on
7 so that I can see a top view of this
and then I'm going to create a well what
I'm gonna do first as I want to
subdivide this so I'm gonna come over
here and do subdivide subdivide and
subdivide that looks pretty good
ok and I'm zooming in with my middle
mouse button and I'm going to deselect
everything here and then after I create
all of those subdivided faces inside of
there I am then going to create a circle
and I can just go right here to a circle
and I'm going to scale this down so I'm
gonna press on s and then what I want to
do is I want to well
first off what I want to do is let's
escape from that what I want is our
circle to have the same number of
vertices as our edges as we have inside
of the shape where we're going to be
drawing so that we can guarantee that
we're gonna have shapes that are going
to either have 4 vertices or 3 vertices
so what I want to do is I'm going to
take this down to 16 all right so now I
know that's 16 and then I'm gonna scale
this down until I have 16 outer shapes
for our plane that surround it so that
it will be easy for these to join okay
so you can see right there we have 16
and then we are going to have 8 boxes
around this 4 here 4 here 4 here 4 here
and that is going to work out so that we
will
to create really nice polygons inside
here and have smooth shapes okay so I
got that all set up then what I want to
do is I want to come in here and delete
out all of these faces so that I'll be
able to draw inside here some come down
here and do face select then we go see
and I'm just gonna highlight every
single thing inside of here what I want
to do is have a big circle in the middle
big circle hole all right and then we
can go and click on X and delete faces
okay so we still have our circle in the
middle and we have our outside edges for
our square now what I want to do is join
the two of them so I'm going to hold
down the Alt key and right click whoops
first off go so edge select Alt key
right-click and then Alt key and shift
and right click on the outside of this
square
I'm gonna go W and I'm gonna go Bridge
edge loops and there you can see really
nice matching up between all of our
different shapes so good stuff and if we
would go back into regular edit mode and
let's say that I want to do come over
here and modifier and subdivision
surface you're going to see that it went
and smoothed out that inner part right
there where the circle is and there is
nothing wrong with the mesh okay all
right so that is how we cut into cut
holes into flat shapes now I'm gonna do
something a little bit more complicated
where I'm going to cut a hole into a
sphere or a curved shape alright so once
again we got a new file here and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to create a
sphere so shift and a and here is a UV
sphere and then I'm going to deselect
that and then what I'm going to do is
once again I want to cut a hole inside
of it so I'm going to come in and create
a circle and there's the circle and then
I'm going to come over here and change
this down to 16 just like I did before
so we will easily be able to match up
and then I'm going to want to rotate
this guy something one on this I'm going
to go our X and 90 to get my circle into
position and I'm gonna hit enter to set
it and then I'm gonna cover folks inside
here and grab the green a little guy
there
move this out press one once again and
scale it down until it fits exactly
in the middle of our sphere say we got
four spaces four spaces four spaces make
sure it's set up that way scale it once
again and everything looks good all
right so now we know that those vertices
are going to match up whenever we delete
different parts of them now with the
circles still selected I'm going to come
over here and go to the modifier panel
I'm gonna go add modifier and I'm gonna
go a shrink wrap modifier is what I want
to add and I'm still in object mode it's
very important I'm gonna come over here
to the eyedropper and I'm gonna click on
the sphere which is where I'm going to
apply this near surface is selected
nothing else offset zero I didn't do
anything else with vertex groups or
anything like that
let's bring this down inside of here now
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna move this
guy until this looks alike a circle so
let's just move this in here and there
we go that's right about what we're
shooting for so there is our circle
inside of it and then also make sure
there's four on top four on the side if
you're doing a sixteen sided circle that
is and then I'm going to apply the
shrink wrap modifier to this and then
I'm gonna go and select both of them and
join them cuz I'll control J now what
I'm going to do is jump over into edit
mode so tab press one and then I want to
a unselect everything and then I'm going
to come in here and select the different
faces and once again delete them zooming
down here to face select hold down or
I'm just gonna click see I'm gonna
select all of these different faces
inside over here and then X whoops I'm
gonna right click to set and an X and
delete faces now you can still see these
circles inside of there and the edges
are still there so that all looks good
now what I want to do is hold down my
Alt key and once again I'm going to
whoops come down here to edge select Alt
key select that guy and select that
holding down the shift key of course and
there we go we got all those selected
I'm gonna get W and bridge edge loops
and you can see once again we have a
very nice clean hole inside of there we
can jump over to our regular object mode
and we can smooth this if we'd like and
you can see it looks very smooth and
even if we came down here and did add
modifier subdivision surface you're
going to see that it is also very very
move so really nice cut directly inside
of our sphere okay so that looks good I
just want to show one other different
way of doing a cut into a curved surface
like a sphere all right so once again
we're going to click on X to delete this
we're going to come in and create
another sphere so here is our sphere and
a to deselect that and then I'm going to
do another shift a and I'm going to add
a circle and I'm going to show you how
to use knife project to cut a hole and
then on top of that I'm going to show
you how we can go and create cuts with
bevels and edges and things like that
all right so we got that one is going to
show me my front perspective so I'll be
able to play around with this and then
I'm going to want to rotate my circle so
I'm gonna go our X 90 and enter to set
that and let's come out of here and grab
just the green axis right here let's
move that guy out and one again to see
the front view scale and I'm gonna scale
it down once again so that it's going to
fit in between those four say 1 2 3 4
spaces 1 2 3 4 spaces like this so I
know I need to scale down a little tiny
bit more okay so we got that right there
and that's looking good whoops one thing
I forgot to do though let's I don't
delete that this is very good I'm gonna
come in here and create a circle again
remember I want it to be 16 vertices and
forgot that save it since I forgot that
you never will alright so got that all
set now I'm gonna rotate it so I'm gonna
get our X 90 good and then let's go like
this grab the green vertice which is the
Y and back to one for a front face scale
it just Galle it way down inside of here
let's zoom in make sure that it stays in
that area scale it just a little bit
more okay looks good now I got the
circle selected I'm gonna hold down the
shift key and we're in object mode right
now and I'm gonna right click on the
sphere we're gonna cut into then we
click on tab to go into edit mode then
on what I want to do is go a knife
project and you can see they project
directly on there now what I want to do
is go in and delete the faces inside of
our circle see if we can go X and face
us and you can see that it deleted that
right there and then I can jump back
over here to object mode and unselect
everything and I could select this
outside circle click on X and delete and
it is gone I can also come in and render
it it's not rendering very well only
because the light source will go 7 to go
to get the top and then we'll right
click on this guy right here bring it in
a little bit let's just grab the axe
it's probably easier and drag it down
inside here so now the light source is
in the front well go to the front right
now and also just to prove that we'll be
able to use subdivision surface
modifiers without any issues let's go
and select this right here go down the
modifier subdivision surface boom you
can see it's really nice and smooth it's
not all mangled
we can go smooth and it's gonna get rid
of that for us so that's looking good
and there is yet another way to cut a
hole into a curved surface so now what I
want to do is I want to go into edit
mode and I'm going to show you how to we
can cut bevel or whatever edges into the
outside shell of this so what I want to
do is I'm gonna select all these guys
I'm gonna hold down the Alt key I'm
gonna go and select all of the different
parts while holding down Shift key and
we'll select the whole way around our
sphere and this is what we're gonna do a
lot whenever we are modeling and blender
in generals doing lots of loop cuts and
lots of bevels and things like that
so shift and alt right click and
continue doing that and then what I'm
gonna do is I am going to apply bevels
to all this I'm gonna go one just to get
a front view of this and now to put the
bevels inside about what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go ctrl + B and now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to move open
will move my mouse just out slightly and
I can move my middle mouse button if I
want to add more edges around there but
what I'm gonna do is just simply just
get it just have one inside of there
we got this like that and then once I'm
happy with it I can go like this and
then I can go a to deselect everything
and now what I'll be able to do is I
wish it was a shortcut to this but I
really don't believe there ever will be
I'm gonna hold down alt I'm gonna get
all these guys and hold down alt shift
select just the middle parts of it for
where we want our edges to loop the
whole way around here so it looks a
little death story and shift and alt and
get all of these pieces and then we can
also scale them all at once so that they
are all exactly the same that's and that
and that get back to our beginning and
then I can scale them just by going s
and X and moving the mouse and I can
actually have them go out like this if I
would like but what I was originally
aiming to do was having them go inside
and not outside okay and there you go
there is an interesting way to add a
edge cut the whole way around our sphere
okay so hopefully you guys found that
useful just some extra little tricks to
help you model cool things in blender
and like always please leave your
questions and comments below
a Bligh's til next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
