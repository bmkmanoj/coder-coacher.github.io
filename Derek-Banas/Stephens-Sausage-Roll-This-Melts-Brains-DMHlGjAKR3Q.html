insanity
I have Stephen sausage roll today
because why not
and let's see if I can switch over to
this alright hello everybody
is the audio all right I am playing a
steam game here and like always I have
never played this game I have no idea
what's going on and all that I have
heard about this is that yet again this
is the hardest game period
hello Istanbul audios fine awesome
alright you guys told me to play this
game I got a lot of requests I play
really strange puzzle games and when I
saw it this game looked like I was like
done deal this is the game so like I
said it might be absolutely horrible
maybe it looks different but here we go
zero experience have no idea what to
what to expect with this and I can see
your ear chat why isn't it fullscreen
because for some reason this game
doesn't have full screen and it's very
advanced all right and here it is okay
so I don't even understand the controls
alright so I'm just using the keyboard
there's a mouse do anything no and as
far as I can tell if I click with the
mouse does it do anything no all right
so welcome to the island of wisdom all
right so these are supposed to be
tablets I guess no do I have to how do I
read it Omega arrow keys to move Z to
undo our two restarts alright let's do
it
I'm just
I don't know what am I supposed to do
here it's like a broken ship over here I
guess that's my ship there's some sort
of looks like a holographic cactus and
oh okay a lot for a moose head I don't
know anything about sausages what's the
last time I ate a sausage Wow
decades many a decade so yeah so okay so
whoa okay well I just burnt myself all
right
somebody's talking about Dutch toilets
and the thing okay so I guess I well so
this is some sort of a girl and I'm
supposed to push these sausages around
on a grill how do I move oops
that's not good all right we'll get it
I'll get it and I'll figure it out how
do I move without maybe if I do this can
I do this okay all right so I can move
backwards see I can I can move this way
and and I can move down the control
scheme on this is really insane and I
can move that way and I can move
backwards like this without poking with
my poker here all right so let's see
here so what am I supposed to do with
these sausages
whoa okay I burnt myself I don't know
why that makes me jump okay so I can go
backwards like this all right so let's
say I want to do something like this and
then like this and then like okay I
don't even get the idea of what this is
this is insane this game I'm trying to
figure out
well I don't know if I was supposed to
do that or not hmm wow this is
ridiculous restart the game he's 19
years old too old to become a programmer
no I'm answering chats if this doesn't
make any sense put the sausage on the
fire all right I got that okay so let's
try going back like this and something
like that
okay so boys just weird and then can I
move up here no all right how do I know
the sausage has been cooked
that's the question here am I supposed
to cook both sides of it I'm guessing
all right
okay boys this game weird what happens
if I okay let's figure this out okay so
I have to roll the sausage and cook on
both sides of it and the top and the
bottom of it and if I hit any of the
burners more than once it burns and game
over boy this is ridiculous
alright so let's see here what are my
next gaming videos umm I have one more
well I think two more pac-man and after
that I have I've really decided it I'm
think I'm gonna do like Zelda but I
haven't decided a hundred percent what
I'm gonna do there yet I think Zelda's
after pac-man so hmm
Dwight vest in crypto I don't know what
you mean Oh currency no I don't really
play around with with Bitcoin okay
alright so I'm trying to mentally figure
out how to cook these sausages without
burning them I can't believe this is the
first one yeah this is a hard game holy
cow um-hmm yeah as Elvis next I'm pretty
positive about Saul to be next alright
so I've cooked that one side Wow is this
game ridiculous don't expect a long I
think this is gonna be like a one-shot
tutorial or video I'm not gonna play
through the entire sausage party let's
try cooking that like that it's hard to
keep straight in my head exactly what
I've cooked and what I haven't cooked
well I can cook this I think okay I got
that cooked sorry for whistling it's
just the game's driving me insane here a
little bit anybody played this game
before what will I do after the gaming
series I have no idea I just if I I
messed up wow this game is ridiculous
okay I think I'm getting it sorta I have
no idea what's coming after the gaming
videos no I don't hack nothing I don't
do anything illegal and I definitely
wouldn't say on YouTube if I did okay so
hmm this is a steam game by the way it's
called Steven sausage party for just
joining me and it's completely insane do
this every time i hit the button it's
like freaking me out a little bit all
right so do this do this - Wow let's
cook that and then let's go up here and
let's cook the other side this is about
the most nerve-wracking game I think
I've ever played okay so I got one
sausage cook now what do I want to do
hmm
yeah it's machine learning is not
anything that's really on my radar right
now sorry about that but I'm doing games
right now because I promised I was
always going to do that and I never did
it so that's what I'm sort of focusing
on a little bit hmm
yeah this is just a ridiculous sort of
puzzle game it's not very easy
anyway while I think about this thought
guys are I thought I'd tell you about
the worst mistake I've ever made in my
life and the end of it actually happened
this week sold my house after one and a
half year you can learn a lot from this
I bought my house whenever I was 20-some
years old and so I didn't you know what
I was doing I'm gonna restart this um
basically if you buy a house a number
one most important thing is school
district this is in the United States I
would assume it's probably pretty
important anywhere the school district
is ridiculously important though and I
didn't pay attention that whenever I got
my house like I saw I was 20 years old
and the only thing I was I was concerned
about was I traveled a lot and that
point in my life and so I wanted easy
access to roadways and that was very bad
reason to buy the house school district
is really ultimately only thing that
matters another thing that I learned is
that if you are going to buy a house do
not buy a house in a neighborhood full
of a bunch of old people and the reason
why is chances are if you're 20 years
old you're living with a bunch of people
that are 60 70 and 80 if they are
maximum house that they could afford in
their entire life was where you what you
can afford at the age of 20 chances are
they didn't do too well in life I'm not
judging them they oh but just I'm just
passing things on here and the real
problem with that is if they pass away
that kids are gonna take over the
neighborhood and the kids probably are
pretty major screw-ups and that was
definitely true
and what started off is a really nice
neighborhood turned into a very very bad
neighborhood because we had a whole
bunch of mess up like kind of goofball
people in our our neighborhood
so bad I'll give you an example one of
the houses was actually rented to one of
the children and then that house was
turned into a house that was housing
oops somebody that was on probation now
this student was on probation for
helping his buddy
cut up a human body that's who ended up
living across the street for me that
wasn't fun if you think stuff like
that's fun it is just like Ian on that
and so yeah that was a problem and then
we tried to get rid of the house and it
was just not selling it was a nightmare
and we had up the street from us we had
a another person who like their child
was addicted to drugs and she was really
messed up and she ended up getting
pregnant from a guy that was down the
street I mean all this was going on when
I was alone there it was just
unbelievable how bad it was all right so
sausage party oh it was a fun
neighborhood let me tell you and then
the guy that was on house arrest
he decided that he was gonna start
selling drugs and so he was selling
drugs across the street from us and the
police wouldn't do anything about it
they basically said that I'd have to
like catch him selling drugs or
something you know I'm not Columbo I
don't know if you'd be people even know
what Columbo it's a very old TV show but
I'd have to catch him selling drugs for
them to do anything and I was so
horrible but whatever I survived I guess
so
a lot of fun I'm trying to figure out
what to do is this snow I think I need
to get rid of this let's try moving this
hmm okay ah I think I know what to do
wow this game is ridiculous like when
you guys told me this was a hard puzzle
game yeah this is a little hard
let's try gone on this way and this way
and done like this and then let's move
my sausage off of here
and over here and up here and oh it was
horrible my neighborhood something else
you you want to buy not the not the
nicest house in your neighborhood you
want to buy like the worst house in a in
a good neighborhood I did the opposite I
bought a nice house in huh well it
wasn't a bad neighborhood whenever we
moved in but it definitely was after a
while not a good scene what else did I
learn I'm looking over here because I
wrote down things Oh
whenever you're selling your house make
sure there's almost always a best real
estate agent the only problem is because
they are the best real estate agent
chances are they are extremely busy so
wait for them don't just take anybody
because what a lot of real estate agents
do is they just sign up as much people
as humanly possible and then they they
just wait for the house to sell the
doing nothing and they figure well it'll
sell eventually and you know that's
another bad thing so wait for the best
real estate agent another thing I
learned what else did I learn oh never
with the real estate agent never sign
anything over a six-month contract if
they want to say I'm in a one-year
contract and don't sign it so that's
another thing that I learned okay so
I think now this game is ridiculous
let's turn this up here and then I think
I'll get em no I think this is the last
thing I'm gonna do let's try moving just
I didn't cook the other side of that
sausage whew so all the people that
recommended this game it's a pretty good
game I have to say I don't know if I'm
ever gonna solve it I can't believe this
is the easiest level this is ridiculous
yeah I think I messed up I think I
should have went up see because no no no
I maybe I didn't move this down here and
I move this Oh Oh burning myself it's
not a big deal and then get like this
like this no no I'm married I have kids
which is another thing you don't want to
have you know you don't want to be
living in the middle of Breaking Bad
like the like one of you guys said
whenever you have kids it's like the
worst do it oh maybe I have to like walk
over here or something wow this is a
ridiculous game I wouldn't say it's a
bad game I would just say it's oh I have
to put this back
wow that was level one yeah this is a
ridiculously hard game I can't imagine
how hard it gets holy cow Wow why is the
school district important because
everybody wants to sit whether you are
there's numerous reasons okay the reason
why the school district is important is
it is numerous different things first
off if you're in a bad neighborhood
you're almost guaranteeing somebody that
wanted see when I was in my twenties me
and my wife weren't thinking about
having kids so that wasn't something
that we thought about but that doesn't
really matter what matters is if you
just go into a bad neighborhood
that cuts down on your ability to sell
- literally anybody that wants to have
kids you know jeez and which is
obviously a bad thing well this looks
easier so you know by being in us in a
neighborhood with a bad school district
you're pretty much guaranteeing that
you've cutting out anybody that has kids
wants to have kids or anything okay so
that's first bad thing number two is
your let me see here I have to focus a
minute hmm okay so on top of that if you
are in a bad school district well
there's a reason why you're in a bad
school district it's because the home
values are low and chances are they're
going to they're gonna get worse
oh I think I'm gonna roll this whole
whole way over yeah so um move this down
okay oops I messed up yeah I messed up
oh my that was a mess up obviously but
so yeah you definitely want to be in a
good school district if you can be in a
good school district hmm okay well first
off this look good
hmm well thank you guys I'm glad you'll
enjoy the videos every once in a while
on Fridays I play a ridiculously
complicated puzzle game that's what this
is if you're if anybody out there is
wondering about it and this is called
Steven sausage party and yes it's
completely ridiculous so what I'm gonna
try to do here is oh I know what I want
to do I think let's go down here and
over here the movement on this game is
ridiculous just about everything about
this game is ridiculous okay so let's
move this over here
okay so that sausage is cooked I can't
believe I'm playing this game all right
let's come down here and can I move this
sausage Wow oh I can do it backwards
like this that's the sort have I thought
about playing Polly bridge I don't know
what that is what else all repairs
whenever you're planning on selling your
house
there are basically let your real estate
agent tell you what to repair don't go
in and try to think cuz I wasted so much
money thinking that I wanted that make
the house as nice as possible and it was
a complete waste I should have just
waited for the real estate agent to tell
me what to change and done nothing else
but like I said I made just about every
mistake trying to sell this house what
can you do and that'll work
ah I was done with me I messed up
look see it's gonna burn you can only
elect it to the sides of the sausage
touch once and if you let in touch more
Annette and me burn so let's restart
well the people that asked me to play
this game
okay so it's kind of fun I mean it's
definitely a mind-bending game jeez it's
just almost a little bit too much you
somebody to ask what the game is about
it's you have to cook these sausages
without having any of the sides touch
more than once it's a puzzle game it's
just I guess I was told it's widely
considered to be one of the most
complicated puzzle games there is and
somehow that became my thing that I try
to solve these extremely complicated
puzzle games so so that's what's going
on here there's some like this like that
Sam like this cheese
the movement is what really makes this
game hard hopefully it moves down when I
do this it did and then down like that
then you have to go backwards because
unless you want to mess up the thing Wow
oh another thing mm-hmm something I
didn't realize about buying a house is
how important sidewalks are people
really like sidewalks and access the
stores so those are some things that I
learned by buying a bad house in a bad
neighborhood I can't believe I solved
that Wow
I did it all right on to the next one if
you checked out Samorost 3 it's a sequel
by Machine yeah I think that's on the
list I'll have to check it out can I go
here how well known as this game is
anybody ever heard of this game I never
heard of this game until somebody told
me about it
Jesus camp it seems like there's a
extreme ways they even access the levels
it's kind of ridiculous I just don't
even understand how a game like this is
made
mm-hmm okay one of you guys said you
played at the level four Wow does it get
ridiculous I can't imagine how much
harder it gets I guess if you get a lot
more sausages
it would make it really really really
really hard okay so I'm just trying to
figure out how to do this without
burning my sausage Oh bad joke Oona
let's try getting the two mmm okay let's
move that up there Wow
next time place suicide never heard of
that either sorry if this is taking
longer but I'm trying to wrap my head
around how to move these sausages around
and it is not something that's coming to
me very easily in the control scheme is
very very strange I wouldn't say it's a
bad game I just say it's it's kind of
ridiculous how hard it is glad you're
enjoying it Matt now do I want to rules
well
sorry I didn't like the game you guys
recommend it it's on my fault people
like that torture me and try to get me
to play games that are ridiculously hard
so I don't know that's the the thing
okay I think I'm starting to get it
alright so like this whoops
and like that and like that and like
that okay so I got that sausage cooked
whoops
burn myself and now I want to get this
up here and move it down
okay
I'm right there with you Joseph this
game is not my favorite like I said I
wouldn't say it's the worst game I solve
it wow this person is gonna love a
menthol I don't understand how you make
a game like this I don't understand how
you sit down I mean everything about
it's just ridiculous um the control
scheme is insane the puzzles are I mean
they're meant to be ridiculously hard I
mean I guess they just went out of their
way to try to make a game that is just
purely ridiculously hard
the graphics are insane I'm I mean this
is my dude um nothing about it really
makes sense I mean the whole entire game
is insane I'm not complaining
um it's it does what I guess it's meant
to do which is it's meant to be I mean
like everything about this like okay
this is the next level I want to take on
now you would think oh I can just move
in there no I can't I have to on purpose
back around oops I did it wrong I have
to on purpose back around and go down
here and then go like that yeah I have a
sass tutorial
this what is this thing I don't know if
the title it like gives me any idea
about how to solve the problem Harman
Train hmm this one's got me really
perplexed um okay so
[Laughter]
so I have to separate these somehow
oh I so I I think I know how to do this
if I go like this and like this but how
do I get the other one that's gonna burn
it
it's just
oh wait a minute
I can I do this okay so and then like
that holy cow
I can't back down I can't believe this
mmm I messed up yes I need to separate
the sausages are to restart
oh that's whoops I hit the wrong button
okay so fiery gut mmm okay so let's try
doing this whoops get down here and then
like that I think the hardest part of
this game is the controls which I think
they're made to be hard on purpose
oh okay except to figure out how to
separate these guys and now okay Wow
did it alright did it Wow yeah this
isn't gonna be a multi video thing this
is just purely what I'm gonna try I'll
play it for a little bit longer what do
I got
I'll play for a couple more minutes yeah
if I solved it all right I really wish I
could jump to the end levels just to see
how ridiculous this game actually gets
I'd love to interview the guy that
invented this game I mean this game is
so crazy
hmm
yeah this is uh I would love to talk to
the developer of this game I can't even
imagine I would help him out well this
game is sold it's just one of you guys
told me to try to play it and it's the
only reason why I'm playing it I never
heard of this I never saw this in my
entire life
I don't know anything about this game
except that you guys told me that it was
a ridiculously complicated puzzle game
which it is it definitely is that okay
so let's just get this sausage out of
the way but then I have to memorize
exactly where it is
okay
and down here hmm what a hard
complicated game let's just move this
out of the way hmm I don't know if I
want that or not yeah you and I
interview the graphics designer
let's try Wow
that yeah am I gonna be able okay so I
just need to get that one part
hello mika in finland still can't black
people on all over the world are
watching these videos especially i'm
sitting here playing this kick this is
definitely the strangest game i think
i've ever played in my life i got a
switch i bought my wife won it was very
hard to get but I was persistent I got
one and I loved it I actually think it's
fantastic it's way better than this this
is I think borderline insanity okay so I
just need
let's move this sausage down here and
then like yes hello Steve
okay so I'm gonna do the same thing with
this sausage that I did previously with
the last sausage because I only need
this sausage cooked on one side so try
moving it down wow how many people are
gonna buy this game after seeing it
I I assume there's gonna be more
sausages at at some point maybe I don't
know I have absolutely no idea what to
expect or think of this game or or
anything let's try going over here and
cooking this okay so that's cooked so
now I need to get back like this and get
it out of the way can I move it now I
don't even know that I can I mean I wish
I could stick up the fork or whatever
into it oh well I can do this
wow the controls on this are ridiculous
let's move I can't do that
and that will allow me to do this oops
aah Oh guys I I would think if anybody
was inebriated in absolutely any way
that there's no way they're gonna solve
this this game I'm gonna try this one
more time and I think I'm gonna give
this uh I'm gonna say this is it
what's my Steam username I don't even
know what is it oh it's real weird it is
well wait a minute is this it I'm
looking at I just open it up I don't
really use steam very much
I think it's Gans Seki which I don't
even know if that means um it is here
I'll put it in a chat cans there that's
what it is
whenever I first up in my Steam account
I was learning Mandarin and that was a
for some reason that was the name I
chose I forget what it even stands for
at this point but yeah that was my old
that's my that's my steam name it's
ridiculous so all right I'm gonna try
this one more time I'm gonna hardcore
boil through this and try to solve it do
some tutorials yeah yeah react I'm
working on react tutorial it's gonna
take a while cuz I'm I'm making games
right now and it's sort of taking up my
time it's it's hard it's hard to to do
to big tutorials at once and my game
tutorial is is really taking over my
life right now so you know that is why I
am struggling with it let's see here
I forget what game sucky means so you
guys might know I was learning how to
read Mandarin not to speak it so I don't
even know if I'm pronouncing it right
that is my life quite weird okay I think
I was onto the right sort of thing here
so let's just I got that cooked because
I did previously get that cooked so
let's get that out of the way like this
I do really want to beat this puzzle
just so I can do it ah okay I see people
are popping up now in my I don't know if
you guys can see that her time but yeah
I see people are popping up so I guess I
gave you the right steam name a um I see
a Gert and I will respond to you as soon
as I'm done of this alright
let's go down here and down like this
M's
hmm let's move out
yeah I think this might officially be
the hardest puzzle game I've played but
I think it's just going out of its way
to be as hard as possible I don't know
that it's anything other than that
[Laughter]
okay again sucky means rock in Japanese
somebody said I don't know I'll just
trust you I assume that is correct I
don't know why I picked that that was
literally back when steam her started so
you know I picked that well over 10
years ago so it was just whatever was
going through my mind at that point in
time I guess okay so let's get this up
here
let's move my man over here oh the new
pac-man video will be out tomorrow if
any I'm sure there's probably some
people if somebody's watching me do this
right now they're probably chances are
they actually watch my videos
and I'm gonna solve this one puzzle I
don't care how long it takes me and then
I'm calling it quits because I've had my
fill
just move this completely out of the way
see another thing about this game is you
have to you have to think about where
the sausage has been cooked and things
not easy let's try something like this
I can't remember why my steam name is
what it is I have no idea but there was
some stupid reason why I chose that name
at the time it seemed to make sense
that's all that I can tell you okay
let's move this sausage completely out
of the way hopefully it doesn't fall in
the water no it didn't look it good and
then let's go up here and I don't think
it's just me as I everybody else think
this game looks ridiculous III I might
not be really explaining the controls
the controls are what really make this
game ridiculously hard I mean the game's
hard but the controls make it even more
so okay and in back this up and down and
up and up so crazy geez I can't do that
I don't want to accidentally lock that
sausage over I think I'd lose my mind
let's go like this let's go like this
yeah like that okay oh jeez now I have
to turn myself around in a way so I
don't cuz I oh can I not do that
jeez ah that's it that is completely in
Seoul well there it is there's Steven
sausage party you guys dared me to play
it I think I did kind of okay I mean I
don't know how you get good at this game
I mean I can't imagine somebody just
doing it but either way yeah
I think this would play on just about
anything so yeah I don't know I think
you know if you want to play this game
and if you don't want to play this game
and and I've pretty much had my fill of
this game so I gave it a go but this is
just on my diaper game and lost anybody
that can actually complete this your
brain works in a different way than mine
and I think I might be willing to say
that yes this officially is the hardest
puzzle game I've ever seen in my entire
life and I've seen a lot of them and
this one is ridiculous so I don't know
anyway guys if you want to see me play
some other game please give me something
that does not look or resemble anything
like what you just saw right here and
