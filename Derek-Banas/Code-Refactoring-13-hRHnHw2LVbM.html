13 of my code refactoring tutorial today
I'm going to cover a ton of topics based
off of requests that have been sent to
me recently but the main focus is gonna
be how to replace conditionals with the
command pattern I however I'm also going
to review the command pattern because
it's a great design pattern I'm gonna
show you when to use the command pattern
I'm gonna show you all the flexibility
that the command pattern provides I'm
gonna show you how to replace
conditionals using the command pattern
and show you how to store commands in an
ArrayList so that I can answer all the
questions that I've received in regards
to the book refactoring the patterns and
I'll specifically answer the questions
in regards to the chapter on how to
replace conditional dispatchers with the
command pattern so let's get into it
okay so this is the basics of a command
pattern and some people like to look at
these class diagrams understand things
and other people just like looking at
the code so I'm just gonna go through
both of them basically what we're gonna
do here is we're gonna calculate a
customer's bill utilizing discounts that
are based on sex and age sex meaning
male and female I'm not getting into
anything funky here so what we got here
we're gonna design an interface and this
is going to represent all the different
types of bill payers and the methods
used by them or method in this situation
which is going to be calculate bill now
based off of their sex am their age the
way we calculate their bill is gonna be
different then we have another interface
here and this is going to be the command
part and this is gonna represent the
methods that will change based off of
the different bill payers these guys up
here and again only one method in this
situation executes calculate bill and
it's very common to have execute inside
of a command interface then over here
where we have woman over 60 this is
gonna represent just one of the possible
bill payers and you can see here it has
calculate bill inside of it just like we
have in this interface up here then we
have a waiter and it's going to
implement command and it's going to call
the write execute calculate bill method
this guy right here based on the bill
payer type which is going to be stored
right here so basically what's gonna
happen is the bill pair type is going to
be stored so we have woman over sixty in
this part right here that is going to be
passed in calling the waiters
constructor and then whenever execute
calculate bill is called which is right
here
remember waiter implements command when
this is called it's going to call
calculate bill for woman over 60 that's
what's going on there if this doesn't
help you don't worry I'm gonna get into
the code in a second then we have the
cash register over here this is known as
the invoker for the command pattern and
whenever returned final bill this guy
right here you can see it stores the
waiter inside of it it's going to
execute the write execute calculate bill
based on the object type that is stored
in the commander and this is the
commander over here and what's cool
about this invoker is it can accept
numerous command types such as waiter
being just one of them and then execute
different methods based off of the
command type but in this example we're
just going to limit it to one which is
gonna be the waiter and then we're gonna
have finally customer type picker and
this is going to return the right bill
payer object based on the method that is
called which is gonna be one of these
three methods and what's great about
using the command pattern in this
situation is if I want to add another
bill payer type I just update this right
here and then create a new bill pareo
tight and everything automatically works
so that is just a quick look at a class
diagram let's jump into the code okay to
start this off I'm gonna show you the
wrong way or the common way to implement
something like this so we're gonna
create a customer and we're gonna go int
age and this is going to show you an
example of whenever you should use the
command pattern and then we're gonna
throw in say man for a boolean and then
private this is gonna be double and then
this will be the bill okay so this would
be a way in which we would want to
create this and I'm gonna have Eclipse
to generate all this for me go into
source generate getters and setters and
I'm gonna generate a getter and setter
for aged bill and man and insertion
point is gonna be after Bill and hit
okay so there we go and immediately
because we're encapsulating all this
things starting to get dirty but word
you're gonna continue and I'm gonna show
you how cool this can be and we're gonna
go into customer again go down to source
and then we're going to come down here
to generate constructor using fields
your age man and bill is already set and
we're gonna hit okay so there is our
constructor and let's go and cut that
out of there and throw it down at the
bottom now based off of this guy right
here we are now going to create a method
that is going to calculate bill so let's
just call it return final bill and then
we're gonna have to calculate percentage
off the bill that is going to be applied
based off of age and sex like I said
before so then we're gonna have to throw
conditionals inside of here
so let's say that we take five percent
off if they're over 60 and then we're
going to take an additional five percent
off if they are a female and now we can
print out the bill amount based off of
that and as we're doing this it might
look okay but as you can see here we are
making gigantic methods and gigantic
classes that are not going to be easy to
change and that is always a bad thing
you always want to plan for the future
and the future always means additional
changes but as it is this will work so
if we want to create a new customer Bill
Smith is equal to new customer and let's
say Bill Smith is 62 he's a male and $12
is his bill we could then go bill Smith
dot and it's gonna be returned final
bill like that and if we execute this
guy you can see bill amount is 1140 so
it does work however what is bad about
it is to add a new customer type I'm
gonna have to change the customer logic
for return bill for each one of these
return types even if I create subclasses
I'm gonna have to create new subclasses
and so forth and so on adding a new
discount is gonna require maybe editing
all of the other classes and if I want
to implement a new way or a new
calculation device a numerous pretty
much anything that is new I can just
throw that whole idea out I'm gonna have
to dig into these classes and change all
kinds of things so this is an example
where the command pattern is going to
help a lot so let's see what it can do
now like I showed you before I'm going
to go public I'm going to create an
interface and it is going to be bill
payer and it is going to represent all
possible bill payers and get rid of that
public part all together and inside of
it I'm just going to define how all
these bill payers are going to be
different from each other they're gonna
get an amount due and they are going to
make a calculation spill calculate right
okay so now we got all that set up now
of course it's gonna be very easy to
create different types of bill payers
just because I'm using this interface I
can come in here add different methods
and so forth and so on
then what I want to do is inside of the
command interface I want to represent
the methods that will change based off
of the different bill payers so and
interface and I'm gonna go public void
execute calculation and I'm gonna show
you a way to do this using absolute
flexibility and then like I said before
I'm gonna refer to the book that you
guys keep asking me about refactoring
the patterns and how they did it okay so
now I got that all set up now I need to
define my different bill payers piece of
cake so I'm just gonna come in here
class and let's say I want to go a woman
over 60 implements bill payer and it's
gonna say hey you need to implement some
classes great I will do that or
implement some methods in that situation
and this is using people like they're
real people that's what's great about
this everything here can easily be
looked upon as if it is a real object in
the real world so then we're gonna go
system.out.print line and i could do
something like bill amount for woman
over 60 so this is something I would
have had to add all kinds of code before
to be able to print out and I can go
mount do - amount do times and here I
could throw a discount amount inside of
there and boom so there we are there I
have just implemented a very specific
type of bill payer so let's say that I
want to create another type of bill pair
and I could create as many as I want
without affecting anything so that's
great so if i wanted to implement man
over 60 no problem bill amount for and
this is gonna be man over 60 and then i
just come in here and instead change
this amount right here
2.05 I know I could add more flexibility
but at this point I'm not gonna do that
and I could continue doing this for
forever so let's say I wanted to do man
under 60 no problem bill them out for
man and in here I'm just gonna change
this to under 60 and all the codes
available in a link underneath the video
and in this situation let's just say I
mark this as zero or I could just do a
mount do whatever turns you on that
person gets no discount at all there you
are just created three of those classes
and I can create a never-ending supply
of them if I wanted to now I need to
create the actual command part of this
guy the guy that's going to implement
the command interface and I'm gonna say
this guy's name later it implements
commands and it's gonna call the right
execute calculate Bill method based off
of the bill payer type that it's going
to be assigned so bill payer is going to
be passed to it in a constructor
whenever this waiter is defined so it'd
just be like assigning a customer to a
waiter in the real world so great add
unimplemented methods great saves me
time and then I just need to create my
constructor for my waiter so I'll just
be like saying to the waiter hey you
have this list of customers you got to
deal with now and I'll show you in a
second how to actually refer to them as
if they were a list of customers okay
all set up and then for this guy
whenever execute calculation bill for
the very specific type of bill payer I'm
just gonna go well the payer that is
assigned to this guy calculate ill call
the right method for it and pass amount
do whenever you do also methods very
tight you can see right there calculate
bill so if the waiter is assigned a man
that's under 60 this is going to be the
method it's gonna call so you calculate
bill amount do say calculate bill amount
do so inside of Bill pair that is where
man oh under 60 is going to be stored
and it's gonna call his very specific
method so that's very very very good now
let's get into the invoker and this adds
a ton of flexibility normally but in
this situation we don't really need that
level of flexibility but I'm gonna put
it in here just in case so that you may
want to use it in the future let's say I
wanted to have multiple different types
of waiters now
for example maybe there's a very special
waiter that everybody wants and he gets
an additional higher tip than a normal
waiter or something like that let's just
say you wanted multiple different
waiters maybe you're going to get your
haircut and some people charge more than
other people that cut hair whatever this
is flexibility you can add so in this
situation you're gonna do pretty much
the same thing except this time you're
gonna be storing commands command waiter
is a command so we're gonna store
different types of classes that
implement the command pattern so many
things to really think about learn just
in this one little guy here I'm gonna go
cash register go into source and I'm
going to generate my constructor using
fields and I want command to be passed
over and there it is
I don't need super in this situation and
there we are then I'm gonna go public
and define the method that is stored
inside of this look at that execute
calculation bill see there it is so
inside of return final bill which is
going to be passed the amount due inside
of it I'm gonna call the off command in
that situation I can come in here and go
execute calculation bill due amount or
amount due and there we are so I just
added an insane amount of flexibility
into using these classes where
previously any other example I had no
flexibility okay so now that I have
those all set up I need a way to return
the right bill payer object based on the
method that is going to be called well
how am I gonna pick bill payers
I'm gonna create a class called customer
type picker inside of it and I'm just
gonna create a bunch of statics inside
of here and this is gonna be the only
thing you're ever gonna need to change
if you want to add additional bill
payers you're just gonna have to update
this one thing and then create a new
bill per class that's it it's gonna work
so that's awesome so we're gonna go bill
payer get woman over 60 and there we are
and if we want to return that we're just
gonna get a new woman over 60 and there
we go
and then we want to do that for all our
other different bill payer types well we
have three of them so far so this is how
gonna be how easy it is oh man you want
a man over 60 there you go and here we
go all done you want to do the same
thing for a man who is under 60 no
problem get man under 60 that's all you
need to do and then just change this to
man under 60 boom it's gonna return the
right type of object based off of
customer type picker so just like
hitting a button on the cash register
say you cash register by the waiter
which is right there and it's
automatically going to calculate the
discount so you can think of customer
type picker as a button so pretty cool
just like the real world now let's test
it
use cash register is what I'm gonna use
for this right now just to test
everything and we're gonna go public
static void main string of course like
always I don't know I always say that
then I'm gonna get the customer to use
for my bill calculation how am I gonna
do that well I'm trying to figure out
what bill payer to use and let's say I
ask the customer and she says her name
is Sally Mae well I'm gonna hit the
customer type picker on my cash register
that equals to get woman over 60 boom
just like hitting a button then after I
do that I need to get my waiter the
waiter new waiter and I need to assign
to this waiter that they are going to be
calling methods for Sally Mae who is a
woman over 60 from now on maybe we'd
like to add specials for women over 60
or something anything
flexibility is nearly unlimited then
we're gonna need our invoker which is
gonna make sure that the right method is
called and stores the waiter so bill
pairs assigned a waiter are gonna be
available how we gonna do that
cash register calculate
bill write that so it's telling the cash
register that it is going to be
calculating a bill and the waiter in
this situation there's only gonna be one
way to calculate bills the waiter is
gonna be that one way remember I said
cash register is going to be used in
this situation as the invoker and like I
said before there may be multiple
different people that could use it and
we might have special methods for those
people but either way I'm just adding in
same level of flexibility here calculate
bill and then
go return just click on this and let's
say that Sallie Mae's final bill is $12
there we are Sallie Mae and file save it
use cash register ever want to actually
execute a different part that is stored
inside of this class you're just gonna
come in here and you need to go use cash
register come down here and go run as an
occasion is what I clicked on there you
go
bill amount for woman over 60 is 10
dollars and 80 cents so there it is it
worked but I'm not done I'm gonna show
you more cool things just to prove to
you that this can work for multiple
different other types of people
let's just go bill payer Paul thumb is
equal to and then this is gonna be
actually let's just copy this whole
thing because it's the same customer
type get this situation I click the
button that says get man over sixty this
I'm just going to have it be the waiter
this situation Paul thumb's gonna be
passed inside of it calculate bills
gonna be exactly the same
the waiter can stay the same and
calculate return final bill twelve
dollars as well
file save come over here dotted out it
uh run ass and boom bill amount for man
over sixty is gonna be eleven forty okay
I'm not done yet now I'm gonna show you
how to group bill pairs into array list
so that now you're gonna be able to use
these bill pairs as simple commands
sounds like a lot of work it's not so
let's just come up here what I'm gonna
do is create another class and this is
in reference to the refactoring to
patterns book that can seem to be
confusing everybody so let's say that I
want to create a customer group there we
go
created it and I want to store different
types of commands inside of an ArrayList
I'm just gonna go customers like that
and this is even easier than what I just
showed you so here I'm gonna go customer
group and this is also whenever you
don't need as much flexibility and here
I'm just gonna go customers is equal to
new array list and it's gonna still bill
payer inside of it like that if we
wanted to have multiple different types
of customer groupings and I don't have a
Rea list inside of here so let's go
import ArrayList got that inside of
there good now if I want to add a new
type to my ArrayList I'm just gonna go
add bill payer new payer inside of there
and then I'm gonna go custom
da-ad new payer like that and and in
this situation just to keep this simple
I'm gonna go and just do a simple get
message that is going to get sent a
customer index you could use an
enumeration for this if you'd want just
to have everything look a little bit
cleaner but because I'm limited time
wise I'm gonna do it this way boom boom
there we are
looks like a lot of work it isn't now
inside of Maine I'm gonna show you how
easy it is now to use these commands
just like executable things so I can go
customer group and let's just call it
customer group I'm inside of Maine again
if you didn't see where I flipped to new
customer group and guess what I'm trying
the amount of space I'm it's gonna take
me to add this stuff I can go customer
group add if I want to add a new
customer type to this I just go customer
type picker just like I did before and
get man under 61 to the ones I haven't
called yet change this to customer group
like that and now look how easy it is to
use it from the ArrayList I just go get
and I could do customer index there's
only one in there so I know this is the
right one and if I want to calculate the
bill I just go like that and then I
change the amount for this guy and file
save it and this time gonna jump over
here again use cash register just like
before click on that go down to run as
java application and bow so there you
are a ton of different ways to use the
command pattern and I think I answered
almost every question that I've received
lately on the command pattern please
leave any questions or comments below of
the last till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
