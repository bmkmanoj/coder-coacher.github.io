4 of my C++ tutorial in this part of the
tutorial we're gonna cover while break
continued do-while exception handling
and we will be introducing more complex
problems for you to solve
like always all of the code as well as a
transcript of this video is available in
the description underneath this video
and if you haven't watched any of the
other previous parts you pretty much
have to otherwise you might be confused
and I have a lot to do so let's get into
it
ok so here we are again we are in
NetBeans and that means is exactly the
same whether you're on Windows Mac or
Linux ok so we're gonna use our range
function like we used in our previous
part of the tutorial and you can see all
that information here like I said in the
description underneath the video you
will see that very first thing I want to
talk about here is wild break and
continue now we've talked about while
briefly previously basically a while
loop is going to continue to run as long
as a condition is true however whenever
you create a while loop you're also
going to have to first create a variable
that is going to be used in the while
condition before you create the while
loop ok so we created that and what
we're gonna do here is I'm going to
create a while loop and I'm gonna say
we're gonna continue to loop as long as
the value for I is going to be less than
or equal to 20 of course we're going to
use our curly brackets and of course we
are going to have to increment the value
of I and I'm gonna use the shortcut this
guy right here and this is exactly the
same as whoops as I plus 1 okay those
are exactly the same thing just a
shortcut okay so what I want to do here
is I want to command and check if a
value is an even value and if it is I
want to skip it I don't want to print it
out on the screen so how can I do that
well I can go if and I can go I and
modulus 2 is equal to 0 that means there
is no remainder after a division by 2
well in that situation I'm going to
increment the value of I and then I want
to jump back up here and start going
through the loop again how do I do that
well I just
you continue that is exactly what
continue does alright so continue is
going to skip everything that comes
after here we don't need to worry about
this incrementing because we already
incremented it here jump back up here
and then check to see if the value is
even again all right so that's good so
what are we gonna do otherwise
well we let's say we want to
artificially break and jump completely
out of the loop and jump down to this
area down here or let's just end our
program with return how can we jump
completely out of the loop well we're
gonna use another function called break
so what I'm gonna do here is I'm going
to say if I ever has a value that is
equal to 15 in that situation I decided
I don't want to check up to the value of
20 I just want to break out of the
program well that's exactly our break
out of the loop and that's exactly what
break does otherwise I want to come in
here and I want to print out all of the
odd values so I can do that easy enough
and there we go and of course we need to
increment the value of I so that we can
continue and so eventually the while
loop will ends and if we run that you're
gonna see over here it prints all the
values all the odd values up until 13
and why doesn't it print more well
because we broke out of the loop
whenever we had 15 okay so quick example
of how to use a while and continue and
now we're going to get to our first
problem okay so this is probably gonna
be one of the first somewhat complete
complex problems you're gonna have what
I want you to do is I want you to create
a program that is going to draw pine
trees on the screen after asking the
user how many rows they want and sample
output for our program is going to go
along these lines we're going to ask the
user how tall is a tree
they're gonna say five rows and then we
are going to print out five rows along
with the stump of the tree okay so that
is our goal so you could pause the video
right now and try to create it otherwise
I'm gonna give you a couple hints in
regards to how we might go about solving
this and then after that what I'm going
to do is
I am going to actually write the program
so you can stick around for the hints if
you'd like alright so first let's
analyze exactly what's going on here so
we have one two three four and that's it
so we have four spaces and a then we
have a hash symbol okay so what do we
have here so this is the next row we
have one two and three so we go from
four spaces to three and then down here
one and two then we have two and then we
have one and then you could also see
that the number of hashes goes from one
two three to five to seven and so forth
and so on
so as we analyze how to create this what
we want to do is we want to come in here
and think about what we got
so um what I need to do is to make this
program work is one I'm going to need to
decrement spaces by 1 each time through
the loop ok so I know I need to do that
and what else am I going to need to do
oops I am also going to have to
increment the hashes by two each time
through the loop and I'm going to have
to save spaces to the stump because I
have to do a stump each time by
calculating tree height minus one I'm
also going to have to decrement from
tree height until it equals zero another
thing I'm gonna have to do is print
spaces and then hashes for each row it's
always a good idea to list out what we
need to do with our program and the last
thing is print stomp spaces and then one
hash ok so that is the goal of this is
called a use case what I did was I
basically just looked at what we need to
do here with our program and list it out
all of the things that I need to do to
accomplish what I'm trying to do so
let's go and just mark that off right
there and then knowing all this stuff
let's go and create our program and you
could of course pause the video
here and go and do it otherwise I'm
gonna solve it so the very first thing
you need to do is I need to ask the user
how tall is the tree just like we were
told to do then I am going to store that
value but first I'm gonna have to
actually create a whole bunch of
variables here so I'm going to create an
integer and what sorts of things are we
gonna have to store we're going to have
to store the tree height which I'm going
to set for zero we are going to have
another thing that's going to be the
spaces before the hash we are going to
have to calculate how many hashes we are
going to start with we're all always
gonna start with one so I'm gonna set
that to one and then we're also going to
have to calculate the number of stumps
spaces before we create our stump all
right so we know those are the things
we're gonna need to get so I know that I
want to get the tree height from the
user
that's something the user provides it's
the only thing the user provides and I
am going to then have to figure out how
many starting spaces well the number of
starting spaces is going to be equal to
the tree height minus one we know that
because we counted them say this was
four spaces three spaces two spaces one
space so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna say our starting number of spaces
is gonna be equal to whatever the tree
height is minus one because that's what
it is and then we will decrement it from
there forward we're then gonna have to
figure out the number of spaces before
the stump well you could see that this
is exactly the same as this that hash so
there we know that we can get our stomp
spaces directly from our tree height so
let's just go and put tree height minus
one rather than copying from spaces to
there which we could do also and then we
need to go and create our while loop
that is going to allow us to have all of
this stuff work so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna say wow our tree height
is not equal to zero and of course we're
going to be decrementing the tree height
as we can create our tree we then inside
of here one
print the number of spaces we have and
thankfully we have our nice little handy
dandy range function we created easy
previously let's just go Auto and X and
it will call range to automatically
generate this vector for us we're gonna
say we want one two
whatever the number of spaces is gonna
be equal to which we know it's gonna be
tree height minus one trace and then we
want to increment that by one each time
through and then we want to print our
spaces so we'll go see out and the
number of spaces and if you're not
getting this don't worry about it the
whole idea here is just to get your
brain to think in new ways and to
explore ways of using C++ it's not you
know you're not failing if you're not
getting all of these right okay so then
I need to print my number of hashes so
this is going to be basically the same
type of thing we're gonna say range one
and how many hashes we need to print and
then one and then we just need to print
out those hashes so we'll go see Oh once
again and then we'll put hashes inside
of there instead so there we go we're
printing our spaces and we printed our
hashes
well after we do each one of those rows
well then we're gonna have to go and
create a new line so we'll just create a
new one to jump down to the next space
we don't have to concern ourselves with
what goes on with our tree or you know
after the hash is a printed because you
know that doesn't matter so we'll throw
in a new line here then we're gonna have
to decrement both our spaces as well as
our hashes so we're going to say spaces
is going to be one less than what it
previously was and our hashes are going
to be equal to they're going to increase
so we're going to say they increase by
two just as we see with our tree and
just as we wrote here see you increment
the hashes by two decrement the spaces
each time say that's all I'm doing it's
just going and taking this and
converting it into code that's why it's
always good to you know print it out and
then finally or list it out we're going
to decrement our tree height because it
needs to be decremented okay that's all
I did
I went listed what we needed to do and
that's it in our while loops going to
continue until there's
or tree that needs to be printed then
after that what we need to do is print
our stump so I'm gonna say for and Auto
X and call our range function once again
and we were going to say I want to go
from 1 to whatever the number of stump
spaces are we're gonna increment by 1
and then we are going to print out a
whole bunch of spaces for our little
stump here and then we don't need to do
any type of looping for printing out the
final stump we're just going to go
because it's always just gonna be 1
we're going to just print out the one
singular stump and that's it we did it I
think let's run it how tall is a tree
let's say 5 and there you can see works
perfectly and how big is the tree let's
go 6 and you can see it prints that once
again perfectly and we can go again what
happens if we do to see it looks a
little bit weird but it didn't
indeed print two spaces alright so
hopefully you guys got that if you
didn't that's ok whole whole goal here
is just to understand the code that I
wrote and now what we're gonna talk
about is exception handling now I'm
gonna start off with the basics of
exception handling then after I cover
classes in a later tutorial I'll then
come back and show you how to create
custom exceptions for this stuff so
useful also it's very useful alright so
exceptions are basically just errors
that occur when things don't go as
expected so for example you might have a
program in which you expect the user to
always enter integers and they go and
they enter a string or you expect a file
to be available and it isn't or you
expect the user to not enter 0 and they
do this that's basically it it's
exceptions to what you expect when in
what you're gonna do in those situations
is handle those situations so what we're
gonna do here is I'm going to cover a
potential division by zero error so the
user is gonna enter in two numbers and
one of them could potentially be a zero
and we're going to handle that situation
so we're gonna say that we want the user
to enter in two values so enter number
one
and then we're going to go and get that
value and store it in number one and
then we're gonna do the same for number
two of course so just go enter number
two and this is number two now to handle
the potential problem we're going to try
to do something that could potentially
cause an error so we're gonna say if
number two is equal to zero well in that
situation we know that we can't do that
division so we are going to throw an
error and we're going to describe what
that air is we're gonna say division by
zero is not possible okay so we got that
set and if the user doesn't and our zero
well then we are just going to print out
these solution as if nothing went wrong
because nothing did go wrong so we're
just gonna say something like here's a
float divisible by and here's another
float with one decimal place which is
going to be equal to and let's say we
want to accept two for our final answer
and num1 num2 and then underneath here
we will say num 1 divided by num2 and
there we go but we threw this error what
does that mean did we just throw it off
into nowhere no we have to catch and
solve or handle the error and how you do
that is you call catch and then you're
going to receive a message in this
situation and this is going to be the
exception and then what I'm gonna do is
get that message that was sent out and
I'm going to handle it so I'm going to
say something like error and this keeps
our program from completely collapsing
and crashing and throwing errors all
over the place since then we just send a
nice happy message and and our program
gracefully rather than allowing it to
collapse so let's run it and what did I
do
oops okay see you in of course and see
in alright now we got that set and let's
run it there it is number one and let's
just do four and
everything works fine everybody loves
everybody else all right so let's try
this 5 and 0 and you can see it just
prints out the little error message that
I have here and it doesn't crash it
doesn't throw all kinds of nasty things
all over this screen just prints a
little nice little message it could go
back and continue maybe asks for numbers
again do whatever it likes but you can
see it gracefully ended ok so there is
one example of how we can handle
exceptions and now I'm gonna show you
another all right this time I'm just
going to go and throw an exception
without really any meaning just so I can
demonstrate a couple other things so
we're gonna go standard see out and just
throw a message on the screen here so we
can see what's going on so I'm gonna say
throwing exception and then we'll be
able to see what's going on then I'm
gonna go throw and rather than just
throwing a string I'm actually going to
go and throw an actual error so we'll go
call this a runtime error and error
occurred will be the message that we
send along with what we are sending and
then just for the heck of it let's see
if we're able to get here after we throw
our error message I'll say something
like can you print me and we will find
out if you know we lose all the code
that comes after throwing the error or
not and then we can come down here and
we can catch our exception so I'm going
to say catch and we can specifically say
the type of exception we want and in
this situation we're going to use the
standard exception which is the
exception from which all other
exceptions are built and like I said I'm
going to show you an example of that
later and then if I want to get the
message that was actually attached to
this exception I can do that I'm gonna
say handled exception and we can go and
print out our message and how we do do
that is we just reference our exception
and we call a function called what and
that's going to print out this rare
occurred this guy right here ok that's
what we attach to the exception so we'll
say what and then
go and print a new line and what else do
we want to do in here I think that's all
we want to do another thing that's nice
to know is you can always put a
catch-all if you're thinking that there
is a potential that an exception could
happen youma you really don't want to do
this but if you can't find any other way
out of it this is a catch-all this will
catch every single exception and this
will be our default default exception
and throw any line in there even though
we're not gonna get there because our
other parts gonna handle it all right
let's run it and you can see right here
throwing exception is triggered you
could also say handled exception is then
called an error occurred which is what
we printed right here was sent over to
it Aaron curd that's where that came
from and then you can see that nothing
else happens that means that if you
throw an error an exception that all of
the other code inside of the try block
is gonna be skipped okay so real quick
two examples of exceptions like I said
more advanced information on exceptions
is coming soon but now I want to talk
about do-while loops and then I want you
to create one alright so I'm gonna be
using random function generation random
number generation in this tutorial so
far in this code so what I'm going to
need to do is I'm gonna use something
called C time and that's just going to
give me the number of seconds that have
passed since January 1st 1970 and I'm
going to use that too as a way of
generating random number so what we're
doing here though also is we're going to
be covering do-while loops and basically
the difference between a duo and a while
loop is do-while loops are guaranteed to
execute at least once so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna create a secret
number guessing game so we're gonna
first we're gonna generate a random
number from 0 through 10 but to do so
we're going to need what's called a seed
and that is just going to be a number
that is going to help us create
different numbers so as seconds change
as our program runs the random number is
going to be based off of those changing
seconds and how you create a seed as you
go SRAM's and then you give it something
that's going to constantly change like
the number of seconds and there
go you just created your seed all right
and now what we're going to do is we're
going to go and create our secret number
so I'm going to go secrets num is gonna
be equal to standard random number
generation and what we want to do is if
we want to create a value from 0 to 10
for example well what we're gonna do is
we are going to say modulus 11 and
you're basically never going to get a
m-- it's basically going to be
impossible no matter what number you you
would divide by for you to get a
remainder bigger than 11 if you use
modulus okay because that's how
remainders work so if we want to go from
0 to 10 with our result we're just gonna
go random number modulus 11 and that's
going to give that the user is then also
going to guess what our random number is
going to be equal to and I'm gonna give
that a default value of 0 and then we're
gonna use our do-while loop so I'm gonna
say do it's gonna continue doing
everything what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna say standard out guess the number
the user is then going to plug in some
number we are going to store it in the
variable guess then I'm gonna say if
guess is greater than secret num well in
that situation I'm going to print out a
message and it's gonna be that they
entered a value that is too big and then
likewise if they entered a guess that is
less than I'm gonna say too small so I'm
gonna help the user or basically figure
out what the value is so I'm gonna say
too small in this situation and there
that is and then what can we do after
that well not really anything except go
wow we're going to define how long this
is going to run so we're gonna say that
this is going to continue to run as long
as the secret number is not equal to
whatever the guess is and don't forget
that semicolon if you have any problems
with do-while loops it's probably
because you forgot that semicolon right
there so make sure you include it and if
we ever get outside of the do
Loup what does that mean well that means
that we or the user guessed the number
you guessed it all right and then we can
go and test our program see if it worked
there we are
guess a number and I probably should
have said from zero to ten but I didn't
so I'm gonna say five to small so then
I'm gonna say 7 and to small also in
which I'm gonna say 9 and that's too
small and then I'm gonna guess 10 you
guessed it all right good let's run it
again guess the number 5 too big I'm
gonna say 3 you guessed it ok so we can
see that our program is working and you
see an example of a do-while loop now a
lot of programs don't have our
programming languages do not have
do-while loops and what I want you to do
for our final problem today is to use a
while loop to create a do-while loop so
basically what I want you to do is to
take what we previously did and have it
work with just a while loop but have it
work in pretty much exactly the same way
so what we're gonna do is I'm actually
just gonna leave this here I'm going to
bring back what I previously deleted
there's all this stuff and you can of
course pause your screen if you want to
go and try to create this on your own
and I have to think about what sort of
things am I going to need to work here I
and what sort of things do we learn
about in this tutorial that we can use
to create a do-while loop well I want
this to continue to execute over and
over again until a condition is reached
ok and that's what we have down here so
how can I do that well one thing I can
do is I can go and create an infinite
loop with Wow
and true and then what I can do is I can
break out of the actual loop when a
situation occurs which is going to be
this situation right here so instead of
using the while loop down here I can
just copy this paste this inside of here
and instead go if and secret number is
but I'm gonna say equal to guess instead
of not equal well in that situation
I'm gonna call break and that provides
me with a way to jump out of my program
then what am I going to Nate
well I'm going to need to come in here
and I'm going to need to of course ask
the user for an a number so I'm gonna
take that and paste that and so out of
there I'm also going to have to store
the gas and I'm also going to need to
tell the user if it's too big or too
small let's go and steal all that
information also and paste that in there
and now you can see here is basically
something that is kind of worthless so
let's get rid of that you can see here
our ready-made do-while loop is actually
less lines of code and a little bit more
understandable than our do-while loop
and this is one of the reasons why a lot
of programming languages do not have
do-while loops so we can go and save
this and we can run it and we can see
guess a number I'm gonna say 5 to big I
can say 3 to big I can say 2 to big one
and I guessed it and then we can run it
again just to verify that it's working 5
too big and we go 3 too big and one you
guessed it make sure let's see if I got
something the same two times too big is
it 1 again up to small ok so it is
working properly just gave me one two
times in a row and it sort of made me
nervous
there you go guys there is working code
for a do-while loop and some more
complicated problems of course as the
tutorial continues the problems are
going to continue to get more complex
hopefully you enjoyed that and like
always please leave your questions and
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
