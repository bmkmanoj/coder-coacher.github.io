second video in my search for the
perfect meal what I'm gonna do here is
try and find one meal that's going to
contain a total of all the nutrients and
minerals that a person requires in a
single day based off of USDA data
basically what this is is a giant
database that spits out exactly what I
should eat in a day maximizing nutrients
while minimizing calories and fat and
all the other bad stuff and this time I
think I have a real winner cuz it tastes
absolutely amazing and there's no
sun-dried tomatoes which some of you
guys don't like this time we're gonna
make a lentil yam and collard green
curry stew that is absolutely amazing
first thing we're gonna do is take a
look at all the nutrients in this food
and then I'm gonna make everything so
let's get into it okay so you can see
the breakdown here of pretty much
everything that we are going to be
eating so I'm going to have one cup of
onion three cloves of garlic the lentils
carrots yams tomato paste portobello
mushrooms collard greens and spinach you
see down here the negative numbers are
good that means that I hit all of my
maximums for all of these different
nutrients the only one I didn't hit a
maximum for is my vitamin E but if you
really want to hit that just come in
here to this column right here you can
see his frozen spinach and increase that
a little bit and you will hit your
maximum for vitamin E one thing that
came up after the first video that I
posted in which I was searching for the
perfect meal is the problem with
overdosing on vitamin A this is referred
to as hypervitaminosis a and it refers
to the toxic effects of ingesting too
much vitamin A well I did some research
and toxicity results from ingesting too
much vitamin A come from meat and/or
supplements there has never been a study
that has found any ill effects of eating
too much of vitamin A from fruit or
vegetables there's scientific reasons
why that is true then I'm not gonna get
into but just know that based off of my
research anyway there is no way you're
going to overdose on vitamin A if you're
just eating a lot of fruit and
vegetables the only other thing that
came up was the possibility of getting
toxic levels of selenium here you can
see that's not going to be
an issue because we are well within the
guidelines of daily recommended amounts
of selenium just want everybody to know
that from what I looked at studies in
the US and China have shown that intakes
of 800 micrograms here we're only eating
55 which is the recommended amount
that's how much you are supposed to eat
but either way intakes of 800 micrograms
of selenium per day showed no signs of
toxicity however it is recommended still
to keep the number below 400 micrograms
and just so you know foods highest in
selenium include Brazil nuts soy sauce
octopus lobster clams squid tuna
swordfish pork beef chicken and turkey
so if you totally want to disregard any
issues with selenium just don't eat
Brazil nuts and as you can see here is
pretty much everything we're going to be
ingesting and everything meets our
guidelines and no this is not an issue
this vitamin A here this is beautiful
and wonderful fruits and vegetables are
wonderful for you I've never found
anything that says otherwise and now
let's jump over and let's cook
everything and the very first thing I'm
going to do is make some vegetable broth
I'm gonna start off with three onions
two tablespoons of garlic one cup of
diced carrots and one cup of diced
celery and two cups of mushrooms going
to first put an infinitesimal amount of
olive on the pan and then I'm going to
add two tablespoons of minced garlic and
I'm gonna stir that up then I'm gonna
get all the vegetables except for the
mushrooms pick those up throw those in
the pan as well and then I'm going to
stir all this for about five minutes and
after five minutes all of your
vegetables are pretty much gonna look
like this and then to help caramelize
ation I like to go and get a little bit
of sugar here I'm using coconut palm
sugar you can use anything I just get a
pinch of that throw it in the pan and
then I'm gonna add in my mushrooms and
stir that up for about five minutes and
it's going to look like that you can add
a little pinch of salt to help
everything along then I'm gonna add some
diced tomatoes just one can and one
tablespoon of oregano and then to finish
everything off I have some minced basil
or you could use fresh basil one
tablespoon throw that in the pan and
then we're going to stir that up until
everything is combined and then finally
we're going to add eight cups of water
that we're
going to then bring this to a boil and
then turn it down to 20% and let it
simmer for one hour and then your
vegetable broth will be ready and here
you can see after it's all finished I'm
going to dump out all the vegetables a
strain out all the vegetables get all
that broth out of there and now we're
ready to make our stew I'm gonna start
off by boiling my collard greens I just
cut off the very ends of them and this
is a 1 bunch or approximately 2 cups of
collard greens and I'm gonna boil those
for five minutes and whenever they're
done I'm gonna dice those up to start
off I'm going to add 1 TSP of olive oil
and then one cup of onions diced and
then three cloves of garlic or one
heaping tablespoon of garlic and one cup
of chopped portobello mushrooms and 1
teaspoon of salt that is all the salt
we're going to be adding and then I'm
going to stir that up for approximately
2 minutes and after stirring that for 2
to 3 minutes is going to look pretty
much like this then we're gonna get some
tomato paste I've got 2 tablespoons of
tomato paste doesn't matter what brand
and then 2 tablespoons of curry powder
and 1 teaspoon of minced ginger add all
of that to the pan started up a little
bit to combine all this is on high right
now you can have it on medium high
whatever you're comfortable with doesn't
matter then we're going to add 4 cups of
our vegetable broth to the pan and then
stir all that together then to finish it
off we're going to add one cup of
lentils we're going to bring this to a
boil and then simmer for approximately
15 minutes and after that 15 minutes is
what it's going to look like we're then
going to add in 2 cups of carrots and 4
cups of cubed yams and we're gonna add
some additional vegetable broth to
completely cover this we're then going
to continue to simmer at 20% for 20
minutes until all of this is done and
now all that is left to be done is we're
going to be adding our 2 cups of boiled
diced collard greens and 1 cup of frozen
diced spinach to our pan you know you
can use regular spinach I actually use
regular spinach here and we're gonna
toss that together and allow that to
simmer at 20% for 10 additional minutes
and here it is here is your stew it is
absolutely amazing I hope you guys enjoy
this and please leave your questions and
comments below
