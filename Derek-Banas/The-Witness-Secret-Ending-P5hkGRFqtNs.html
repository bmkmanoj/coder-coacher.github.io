witness secret ending and kind of secret
show because last night I said I wasn't
gonna do this and then you guys told me
that I should do it because the secret
ending is really cool hello Exodus I'm
doing awesome how you doing hello PC
master-race that's an interesting all
right so I explored the entire you guys
told me that the secret ending is in the
hotel so I walked through the whole
entire hotel and I clicked on all those
audio things and all of them were
credits
yeah okay I thought that was something I
miss and then I got to this part and I
think this is the secret ending so yes
I'm live I'm live live can't prove it
really I guess well I'm live for the
people that are here I saw this so I
immediately stopped and thought this
looks like something weird so we're
gonna go find the secret ending I don't
know much about it I just know that it's
weird it's really weird supposedly mmm
that's what I know about it there's a
broken thing
I've used pretty much every programming
language and here's a panel oh wow how
do we solve this this is a very hard one
whoops I've messed it up okay well that
was easy
I'm looking at an office can I walk into
it no I can't walk into it
Oh what happened
I have no idea what happened
I'll look around me what oh okay oh okay
I mean is there like a puzzle I have to
solve here oh there's like a dead dude
or something that's a little weird okay
am i a witness to a murder if I move too
far it goes away and I can't go in there
it won't let me in there's like a guy
that looks like he's dead he looks like
he's connected to some type of medical
device and there's a computer terminal
that I cannot read is there another
puzzle I have to solve I guess that's
all I was supposed to do I'm sure
there's more to it than that
is there another puzzle
there's what are those uh what is our
weird-looking flowers just strange
looking okay
and everybody says I don't look around
enough so I'm going to look around this
is a Bowie there's a person falling with
a telephone
he's definitely a smart dude Jonathan
below is that we're talking about this
is a door I guess and I have no idea
what's going on I can't do anything
okay I'm in a room with puzzles on it
but I can't move
nope can't move no I guess that guy
wasn't dead order he will be dead at
some point in the future no I don't
think it was dead oh I guess he was
playing the game over there
he's a catheter that's not fun
I've no idea I guessing this is me
waking out of my witness game that I was
playing this is the secret ending to the
witness people keep asking to explain
what's going on
there's the nice urine bottle every home
should have one very interesting it's
not crippled so I guess he just straps
into that thing for a long time
project er I can't read anything on it
this is a weird ending
I can't read that
nope
I can't move him I'm trying to move him
there's no way to move no button moves
mechanical universe and beyond is what
that's us
Christmas tree
missiles everywhere who has a men's room
in their house I guess this is an office
this Jonathan blows house I guess he's a
cat
I don't know I'm gonna look up after
this if this is his house office guys
gonna read anything good
I still can't do anything I keep working
the controls to see if I'll eventually
get control but now
nice backyard
yeah I guess that's the idea that he's
showing that he was looking at the
regular world and trying to put mazes
and puzzles into it and that's sort of
the idea I guess is that you're
witnessing I don't know I'm totally
guessing you're witnessing his eye where
he got the idea for making this Dame
sorta maybe
I don't know
all right there it is yeah I guess
that's that's definitely a better ending
than the the other thing that basically
you just flew around I mean I don't know
what your guys idea is so it's basically
he you know the whole point of the game
sort of maybe sort of has the feeling
that he came up with the ending for the
game after the game was already created
but basically he's just showing that
there's puzzles everywhere in the world
if that was his real house I don't I
don't know and based off of seeing all
these weird things everywhere okay
somebody says here it was recorded at
his office it was quoted only five days
before release you know only three takes
oh that wasn't a movie that would I
don't know hmm well whatever so there it
is that's the secret ending to the
witness and you guys told me you want to
see the Talos the Talos principle I
don't know I just got it today got it
from GameSpot today and I think it's
about robots that like the cats or
something like that so it's a puzzle
game again so and ready to rock and roll
so hopefully you guys enjoyed that I
thought was actually kind of cool he's
definitely way better than the original
ending so oh no what are you going here
secret ending the witness Jonathan below
testing of your head said yes I've never
played this so I have no idea I know
nothing about it
except what it says on the back it's
basically a hundred fifty puzzles and
you just walk around and explore the
story it says explore the story about
humanity technology and civilization and
a whole bunch of other things so
will I continue streaming yes I enjoy
doing this it's fun I'm entertaining
maybe mixing these streams up and doing
you know maybe playing a game sometime
or maybe doing something completely
different I don't know I mean it's my
channel and anyone who anybody that's
really stuck around my channel for a
long time but I've always considered it
to just be like me so if I'm interested
in something I just do videos about it
and the only thing that'll never change
is there will always be programming
videos and you know aside from that I
just mix it up and do whatever I want to
do because I don't know if anybody else
does channels like this everybody else
you know does the same thing which is
cool which is you know the smart way of
running a youtube channel if you're if
you're into this to make money
don't do what I did running a channel
that is just so random like my channel
is is definitely not a good idea
so either way a Pascal tutorial again
tomorrow I will upload learn Erlang in
one video tomorrow morning and I don't
know if I'm gonna have a Wednesday video
this week because that Erlang video if I
do a learn in one those normally are
like to our videos and that's before
editing and then I edited them down to
like 40 minutes which is it takes me
almost like 12 hours to make a learning
one so I don't know I'll try to make a
Wednesday video but I'm definitely not
promising it so either way thank you
guys for joining me thank you for
joining the witness thank you for I
already did a little Lu out tutorial
it's on my channel and if you have any
other questions I'll be in the chat
after the stream ends and like always
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
