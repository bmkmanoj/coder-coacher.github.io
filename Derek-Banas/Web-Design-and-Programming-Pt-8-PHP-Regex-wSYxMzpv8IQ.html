8 of my web design and programming
tutorial today I'm going to continue to
focus on regular expressions using PHP
if you did not watch part seven of this
tutorial you have to watch it otherwise
this will completely confuse you what
I'm doing here is simply taking you
through step-by-step how to find things
that people commonly search for inside
of text here first off I'm going to show
you how to locate an email address using
regular expressions okay so continuing
from what we did before let's say we are
demanding that there is either going to
be one or more uppercase letters through
a through Z lowercase letters A through
Z numbers 0 through 9 periods
underscores percent signs and because
I'm using the percent delimiter which
surrounds the regular expression I have
to back slash that or we're going to
allow them to have dashes okay so we're
gonna box that in and then put a plus
sign afterwards that means that we're
requiring them to have at least one of
those things that we have defined inside
of this box then every email address has
an @ symbol so we're gonna put that at
symbol in there and then we're going to
demand that after the @ symbol again
that they have either uppercase or
lowercase letters or numbers 0 through 9
periods or dashes and we're demanding
that there's one or more of those then
every you email address is then followed
by a period but remember we have two
backslash periods because that is used
in regular expressions to define any
character except for new lines and then
we're going to define again that they
are going to have a.com or a.org
or whatever and we're gonna put capital
letters inside of there not allow them
to put numbers because that's not
possible
now we're gonna demand that those
numbers that precede that period be a
minimum of two characters in length and
a maximum of four characters in length
and that is how you would define step by
step that you want to locate a email
file and I have this email file here in
this array and if I file save it of
course this isn't gonna change but it
was able to go through this array and
locate the one thing that met all the
rules that define this as an email and
there you see it is on
now let's say I want to locate a
telephone number and I'm choosing to do
this through examples I did a previous
tutorial on regular expressions and I
didn't really focus totally in on
example so that's what I'm doing here
seemi no real point in doing this again
and again and again unless I change it
up okay so let's say our telephone
number can have a parenthesis in it
however it might not so what are we
doing that case we put down a question
more we then know that the person is
going to be entering numbers 0 through 9
so put a dash inside of there inside of
those brackets and in the United States
anyway this should be three digits in
length and then we want to escape out
the parentheses that might be there or
might not so we're gonna put a question
mark in again then we could potentially
have a dash but we don't know for
certain someone's going to enter a dash
so put in another question mark then we
know that they're going to be entering
more numbers between 0 &amp;amp; 9 and we can
expect that there's gonna be three of
them so we'll do that
then we're gonna put additional brackets
square it off brackets in here and we
know they're gonna add a dash a period
or potentially a space between those
numbers but guess what we don't know
that for a fact so we're gonna put a
question mark in there again and we know
they're gonna enter additional numbers
inside of here and they should be four
in length and that is how you
specifically would look for a telephone
number if I file save that you can see
it was able to find the only thing that
met all the rules for a telephone number
even though social security number was
very similar guess what it would have
actually came up if there would have
been an additional digit inside here but
there wasn't and hence it's not so let's
look up some more things that we'd like
to be able to find let's say we want to
be able to accept any type of date this
is gonna get a little bit more
complicated so let's say we're going to
allow them to enter dates and let me
just check here for a second either like
for example 31 - a 1 - 10 or we could
also allow them to put 20 10 or we also
let's say we want them to be able to
enter 11 - 31 - 2010 or whatever and
also allow for the fact that they enter
our 19 like let's say we're basically
asking them for their birth
so we know it's gonna fit all those
different requirements we don't know if
days gonna come first four days are
gonna come second and months first or
what have you or if they're gonna enter
in one digit or two digits they could
enter a zero or a one or they could just
simply enter a one but we want to
basically make sure that we can find it
pretty much any result so we're gonna
come in here and we're gonna say that we
are going to expect a zero but not
demand that it is entered then we are
going to expect that they enter digits
one through nine now this might just
focus in on this so we're gonna accept
one through nine that potentially could
be followed by zero or I put the pipe
symbol in there we're gonna accept
either a1 or a2
close that bracket off that is then
followed either by a zero
or any digit that lies between zero and
nine or we're going to allow them to
enter a three that is then followed
either by a zero or a one remember it's
only gonna pick anything in these
brackets it's only going to pick one of
them unless for example I would put in
the curly brace and say two then it
could but in that case I don't want it
to do that because I wouldn't make sense
if I'm looking for a date that's only
gonna be two digits so that's
specifically how you would do that
hopefully this isn't confusing going as
slow as I think you guys want me to go
then we are going to expect they might
put a dash in or they might put a period
in again we got a backslash that period
so that would hold if they put a dash or
a period in in there between their dates
and we could also put a question mark in
there not guaranteeing that but I'm just
gonna leave it in this format and then
basically we're just gonna copy exactly
what we did before because we're gonna
allow them to enter in the order of
month than day or day than month so this
is exactly the same we're gonna allow
the matter a 0 followed by an individual
number or a 1 or a 2 followed by any
digits that's 0 through 9 or we're gonna
allow them to enter a 3 that is then
followed by either a 0 or a 1 I know
this isn't going to catch if they type
in like February 31st is a date that
doesn't exist but there's limits to this
and in programming there's always limits
and again we're gonna type in a dash and
a backslash and a period and
we're going to demand that they either
put in a 19 or 20 because we don't
expect anybody to be born any date other
than that but we're not guaranteeing
that we're not going to say we have to
have it then we expect a number between
0 and 9 and we expect that number to be
2 in the length am if I file save it and
come over here
and reload it you can see it was able to
find inside of this giant array those
things that fit specifically fit the
date and if I change this in any way
it's still going to continue to work so
if I type in 31st file save jump over
here hit reload it's gonna still locate
that date so that's how you would
specifically do that now I'm gonna show
you something that's a little more
complicated if you get this you can pat
yourself on the back if you don't this
is about almost about as complicated as
a regular expression whatever get what
I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna show you
how to guarantee that a password that a
user would enter is guaranteed to have
at least one uppercase letter one lower
case letter one number have no spaces
can contain either dashes or underscores
and also is at least six characters in
length here I'm going to show you
another way to define a beginning of a
string which is a backslash a remember
it's the same as a caret but I'm just
showing you a couple other different
ways of doing things because I really
like regular expressions if you haven't
caught on now you're gonna see a new
code here question mark followed by
equals what this is saying is we will
consider that this is a valid match for
the string we are looking for as long as
what precedes it is also valid for the
string so what this guy's saying is I'm
well I'm gonna type in here exactly what
I'm looking for I'm expecting a dash or
an underscore than an A then followed by
a Z and an uppercase a through z and
then a 0 through knowing I'll close that
off then say I expect 0 two more of
those but I'm not guaranteeing that but
I am saying that I absolutely demand
that this string must have at least one
uppercase letter okay so what this
little code right here says is we will
consider this a valid string if after
the beginning
the string there is at least one
uppercase letter but it can also contain
any of these other letters that's all
that means this says this will be a
valid string if this is true as well as
this is true okay hopefully that makes
sense otherwise you can just go and copy
this code and be able to validate
passwords based off it just tweak in the
regular expression but remember I also
want to make sure that there's at least
one lowercase letter so I can
technically just come in here grab this
code right here come in here and paste
it and then come in here and change
these two lowercase letters there's a
shortcut way of doing that and that's
gonna continue to work and remember I
also said that I want a guarantee that
there's gonna be at least one number
inside of here so did that right there
and then I also wanted to guarantee that
you're going to be at least six digits
in length but it could be numerous
different digits so I'm gonna use the
backslash uppercase S which is going to
match anything that is not a space which
would include characters and any
different types of character codes and
so forth and so on gonna say it has to
be at least six characters in length and
let's say a maximum of ten like that and
then I'm gonna show you another one this
is backslash Z that is going to define
the end of the string just like the
dollar sign would but just thought I'd
slip something else new in there for you
I actually made my password 11 in length
so let's just change it as well go file
say and you can see that it found a
password I know this is not a password
that I ever use anywhere so don't waste
your time if you think this is a
password heck use so what does this it
fits all the rules it has one uppercase
letter it has one lowercase letter and
it has a digit in it and it is in length
between six to twelve digits in length
it's actually 11 so this is a way to
verify or find what would be a valid
password if you wanted to do something
like that okay so if you now understand
that you really really really understand
in regular expressions like you're a pro
let's go and add to your knowledge base
though let's say I want to match all all
strings that begin with the word mail
however I do not want to match if mail
is then followed by the word woman how
would I do that with regular expressions
okay so specific
Klee I'm basically looking for mail me
and up here but I do not want returned
mail woman how do I do it well I come in
here I'm gonna define that I want my
string to begin and then immediately be
followed by the word mail I'm gonna put
a lowercase male in there but I'm gonna
fix that in a second then I'm going to
say specifically here I will match for
any string that begins with male but
isn't followed by the word woman and how
you do that is a question mark followed
by an exclamation mark and the thing you
do not want to match for or the
characters or strings or whatever and
then close that off and then after my %
or my delimiter I'm gonna put I in there
that's gonna allow this to be
case-insensitive so that's how I'm able
to have the lowercase M in there my file
save it jump over here you can see that
it found male man but did not find male
woman however if I jumped in here and
just typed in man again and if I saved
it you would see now that it found male
woman let's say you want to match any
string that starts with male as long as
it is followed by woman how would you do
that well come in here just delete this
whole thing and I say I want to match
for male only if it's then followed by
woman so this is kind of like the total
opposite of what I just showed you and
then we're gonna leave the eye in there
and keep everything case-sensitive I'll
say for case-insensitive
and reload it and you see male woman
shows up but if I come in here change
that file save you see male man pops up
so those are some really complicated
ways to use regular expressions I hope
you understood it if you do understand
it absolutely fabulous if you don't
quite get it just go download the code
it's all free and you think tank go and
play with it you'll totally get it then
you'll be a regular expressions pro be
able to parse anything you'd ever want
to do in the next tutorial I'm gonna
show you all the other things you can do
with strings and then after that we're
gonna move on to file IO manipulating
file systems the para framework file
uploads networking database security and
all the other things you guys bass
