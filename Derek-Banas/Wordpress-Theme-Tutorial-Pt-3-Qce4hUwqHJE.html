of my wordpress theme tutorial today I'm
going to show you how to access
information in the WordPress database
both inside the loop and outside of the
loop really quick ways to grab
information than distorting your user
author or post tables inside of the
WordPress database and numerous
different ways to list out information
in regards to your site now first thing
when to do is show you the tables that
are inside of the WordPress database you
can see everything right here it's all
pretty much self-explanatory exactly
what we got here and then let's more
specifically look at what's contained
inside of the post area and you'll be
able to access any of this information
in any way you would like to after
you'll see exactly what functions and
objects are used to access this
information and of course you can also
do the same thing with comments and you
can see right here that is all described
if you don't know how to use MySQL
provide a link so that you can learn it
so let's just jump right inside of here
and for the most part everything I'm
going to show you today is based off of
questions that you guys have sent to me
so for example I received a question in
regards to how you can access
information based off of who is
currently logged into your website I'm
real simple just again designate a PHP
block and let's say you want to say hi
to whoever is currently logged into your
site all you do is type in current
underscore user - I don't like an arrow
right like that and you type in
first-name and let's say for the heck of
it you just also want to type in
lastname for the person I'm just gonna
come in here and grab this guy right
here copy that paste it and I'm gonna
type in lastname right like that and
then close it off close the PHP block
yeah throw a break statement in there
for the heck of it I'll say and you can
see that it's now displaying my name now
let's make this look a little bit nicer
notice both in each three tag around it
and let's close off the h3 tag right
here reload and there you can see that
it's displaying the name so that's one
way to access any information in regards
to users on your site and the rest of
this guy is just index.php file that we
had from the previous tutorial if you
haven't seen that definitely check that
out and what we're gonna do here is I'm
in the loop section which I talked a lot
about in previous tutorials so I'm not
going to get much into it now but
another question I receive these
questions in regards to how to create
both lists
suppose as well as links to the actual
post itself so what I'm going to do is
just go here create an a tag I'm gonna
jump in to PHP in line right here say an
echo and if I want to reference
something that is inside of the database
in the post part I type in post like I
said the force is a global variable and
a fun one access to the URL for the guy
just type in GUI D and then close off
the PHP section and then close off the a
tag right there and then I'm gonna
reopen PHP again and let's say that I
want to label this with title just so
that I know what exactly it's showing on
the screen of course you would never do
this in the real world don't you could I
guess I mean if I want to reference the
actual title again I just type in dollar
sign posts and then I said I want the
post title hey like that close that off
like that close off the a tag like that
and close off the h3 tag just like that
and if I file saved that you'll now see
a list of the different posts and pages
that we have on this guy and if you
click on it you actually go to the real
article okay so I'm going to show you
how to grab additional content from the
post table inside of the database so for
example let's say you would want to get
ahold of the name of the author on a
problem I'm just going to put those
little notes there so I know what I'm
grabbing and how you would do that is
type in author data and then we're going
to say then first name dot and again
author data and there's gonna copy this
ace and then put in last name and then
close this guy off and then close this
off and then throw a break statement and
there just to keep it nice and organized
and if you gotta save it you'll now see
that there's an author underneath there
as well now I'm just gonna come in here
and just start dumping information out
like crazy I hope you base this in here
and instead of the author I'm gonna put
the date that this thing was published
so I need to get that out of post and
I'm gonna say that I want the post
underscore date like that close this off
and that'll get me the post date and if
I also want to come in here and get the
content of the article I'd be kind of
useful wouldn't it content I'm gonna
jump up here and grab this just save
some time again and if I want the
content well I gotta type in content
post in front of it then I'm actually
gonna grab this and paste it a couple
more times all right so we got the post
content how about we get the post
excerpt I don't think I have them set up
for this currently but
whatever that's how you get the excerpt
from the guy and I got a question in
regards to how to get the number of
comments no you just type in all men
count that's how you get the number of
comments on that article and just for
the heck of it if we want the ID that is
being used to represent that post I got
that guy right there and just to show
you one of the only other things that
you might some time want is the post
author which would be like the user ID
for the author of the post
I'll save reload and you can see there
it is I got my title I got my author I
got my date I got the actual content of
the article which is being shown right
here and you could slice and dice this
as much as you want and I should come in
here actually put things in here to line
these up comments ID in here and you'll
see the content just like we had before
excerpt remember I said that was none
there are no comments there's the ID for
the actual post and there's the user ID
right there that's a whole bunch of
information you can pull real nice and
easy now I'm gonna jump back over here
into index and for this I'm going to
show you how to grab a bulleted list of
all the pages that are currently on your
blog and this is outside of the loop I'm
gonna say pages h3 PHP what you do is
you call a function called WP page menu
here if you want to show home as one of
the pages you have to give it a value of
one and then if they define how to sort
them by typing in sort column and all
these codes available in a link in the
underbar and I'm just gonna say that I
want them to be sorted they saw though
the order that they were entered and
named lose that off reload and you'll
see now it's showing a list bulleted
list of every single page that we have
on this guy and of course I would
normally comment all this stuff but just
to keep this short
I'm not another way to do this is by
using something called WP list
pages their score pages and with this
guy you have to define that you want Li
tags to surround it I just put that
inside of there and then I'm also going
to have to put ul tags around it
unordered list that's what that means I
suppose if you're watching this you
probably know that and you can see it
did exactly the same thing this guy's
normally used for menus this guy's
normally used for exactly what I just
did with it now of course you could also
convert that into a menu if you'd like
but
that's why they're used and if you'd
like to have like a drop-down box you
call the WP drop-down pages function
also and you can see now I can also
access the page is that way and as you
can see these can be put anywhere I can
put them in divs I could float them
right I could do anything I want with
them they're just there I say that
because there's a little bit of
confusion in regards to how these things
actually work and I could also list all
the categories on the blog and to do
this I'm actually gonna come up here and
copy this guy because there's not going
to be much difference between that and
what I want to do with category and I'm
gonna type in categories like that and
then type in categories right like that
and then everything else is gonna stay
the same and you can see now all my
categories are listed over here and
guess what there's also a drop-down
that's available for categories and the
code that I have in the underbar could
be used as a cheat sheet or something
like that that's what I still use it to
this day I don't have all these
memorized most of them like that and you
can see now the categories are in a
drop-down box any I could also do
similar thing with all the links that I
have like in my blogger role so let's
just come in here and do that and I
don't need blogroll is going to show up
and I'm gonna type in WP list and
instead I'm gonna type in bookmarks
close and I'm gonna leave everything
else exactly the same and you can see
it's gonna list my blog role raw inside
of here which is me and this actually
looks kind of cool so I'm gonna do it
I'm gonna create a tag cloud and if I
want my tag cloud to show up inside of
here I'm gonna call PHP and I call a
function called WP tag loud and I'm just
gonna put nothing inside of there and
you can see that there's a tag cloud
that just pops up there and it has of
course whenever I talk about things a
lot it's bigger and when I talk about
things just once or twice it's real tiny
so you can see this is all about garlic
onions tomatoes and all that stuff now
if you want to access the database
directly inside of WordPress it's
actually pretty easy a very first thing
that you have to do is to declare a
variable called WP DB as a global
variable it's already set up but you
have to actually come in here and
declare this guy that you want to use it
so it's real simple just type in global
WP d of a wordpress database easy to
remember now you can use it you can use
all these different functions that are
available now probably the most common
function you're going to use if you're
going to be getting rows of data is a
function called get results and what it
simply does is it rich
earns multiple rows of data all stored
inside of an array and there's a couple
other functions you got a call along the
way and like I said this is gonna allow
you to issue queries directly to the
database so I'm just gonna type in all
post titles is equal to and then I go WP
DV or Trust database and I call to get
results function again gonna return an
array of my results DB and then I'm
gonna scrub all my dad I to make sure
that I don't get any SQL code injection
with a function called prepare and then
you issue queries just like you always
do inside a WordPress I want to put
distinct inside of here because what you
have to understand is every single time
you change a post it actually keeps a
copy of that post in the database so
there's gonna be a lot of duplication
here sometimes might be a lot of
duplication and if you want to access
the post you have to go WPD be posts
you're not actually going to use the
name of the post title that is inside of
the database you use posts instead all
right so it's inside I'm gonna write how
do I get access to that or a lazy just
use a for each loop so it's gonna loop
through all the results and then for
each of the results don't give me
different information and just so you
know this is my variable this is my
variable this is my variable these are
not WordPress exclusive things you can
use different names if you want to and
to keep it simple let's say I want to
just go echo post I don't know this is
how you access post title right like
that and then let's say when I and it
was a very statement and if I save it
and you can see it did indeed list all
of the titles for every page and post
that I currently have on my site as a
final thing I'm gonna show you something
else kind of neat I'm gonna show you how
to get the comments to all lists cuz
again I got a lot of questions about how
to use comments inside of WordPress for
some reason I never know what you guys
are gonna ask for but I do my best to
try to answer the questions all right so
I'm just gonna change the name of this
I'm going to change it to all comments
and leave everything else the same
except whenever we come in here and I'm
getting rid of distinct because comments
don't work the same way as posts comment
unless they've been off there so I want
the comment author and I want the
comment underscore content and if you're
wondering where I'm getting this from
getting it from this a comment author
comment
content that's it I know what these are
and I'm just asking for that the very
specific things and then come down here
change this into fall mints and then I'm
gonna copy this my Rea with all that
information inside of it and I'm gonna
call this comment walk just to give it a
name and I'm gonna copy that and put in
comment block instead of what it has
there now I'll copy this paste this
inside here drop this off the end now
everything is all nice and neat and I'm
gonna print out the comment author and
let's say we want to say so comment
block comment or intent
I'd say once you break statements divide
everything up a little bit nicer that's
what we got to do if I go file save you
can see right here admin said just a
random comment
da da da da here's the very first
comment that always shows up inside of
WordPress here's the 2nd 3rd 4th and
it's gonna list every single comment
that has ever been made on my blog so
there are numerous different ways to
access information inside of the
WordPress database and pull it out in
numerous different ways you have any
questions or comments leave them in the
comment section below otherwise until
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
