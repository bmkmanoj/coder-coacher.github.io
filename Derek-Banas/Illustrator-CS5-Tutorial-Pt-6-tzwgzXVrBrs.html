illustrator cs5 tutorial this tutorial
ought to you because anna asked me to
show some different ways of drawing in
adobe illustrator today I'm going to
show you my absolute favorite what's on
the screen right now probably looks like
a photograph to you but it is not I
promise you as we zoom in you can see
exactly what we got here and this was
actually created in a version of
illustrator I have no idea which version
but it was back around 1998 this is one
of the first times I really took this
way of drawing an illustrator to the max
you can see it's just a bunch of
different squiggles you can also I
showed this illustration before I did
this in much the same style as before
and as you can see it is a whole bunch
of different squiggles on the screen
however as you zoom away from it it
starts to look more and more realistic I
was completely obsessed in college of
coming up with an original art style and
while this might not be original at this
point in time believe me it was
considered a kind of strange whenever I
was doing it and you can see here this
is a very bizarre-looking man that I
created first in Photoshop and then
completely redrew an illustrator and
again whole bunch of squiggles well
today I'm going to show you exactly how
i did that and here is a piece that I've
been working on for just about an hour
and a half total and it's picture of my
cat and i'm going to show you exactly
how i do it first what you have to
understand really there's only a couple
rules to drawing this way and i think
anybody can draw this way and do really
really interesting art and like I said
you don't see this very often so I think
it's both interesting and at the same
time very easy to grasp however a little
bit time-consuming it's not going to be
something you to sit down and do but I
think it's well worth the time basically
what you have to understand and i'm just
using a mouse to do all this so you do
not need any type of special equipment
but basically just need to know that the
shortcut for pencil is n and the
shortcut for the eyedropper is I and i'm
going to show you exactly what i do i
just basically just go by I so I'll look
at a piece of art and i'm going to show
you this in sped up time i'm going to
show you about a half an hour of drawing
in about five minutes after i do this
but basically i just come in here and i
draw with this guy right like that
little squiggle patterns and then I
switch over to the eyedropper change it
back I copy the color that lies behind a
little squiggle and I don't obsess about
what color it picks and I send it to
back and I have the original artwork on
a different layer than I have with this
and then I just rinse and repeat so if i
zoom in here a little bit again you can
see the pencil tool that I have here on
the screen and I just sort of eyeball it
and just go yeah that's kind of about
what it is right like that and I switch
over the eyedropper and then I throw it
the back holding down the shift command
and the bracket symbol the opening
bracket symbol or if you're on a PC it
would be shift control in the opening
bracket symbol and then I switch back
and it's I'm doing this a lot slower
than I normally do it but you can see
that it just basically gives you kind of
like this wild and crazy sort of look
and this what you see here on the screen
took me about I would say an hour and a
half and all together it's not only
going to take about two and a half hours
to do this whole entire drawing but
there's the basic drawing and up next
I'm going to show you exactly what it
looks like in the process from beginning
to about where we are right now
