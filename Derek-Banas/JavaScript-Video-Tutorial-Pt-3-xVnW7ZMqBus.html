3 of my JavaScript programming tutorial
today I'm going to cover JavaScript
object oriented programming so prepare
for a little bit of an insanity here
because javascript handles
object-oriented programming in a way
that is completely different than pretty
much any other language okay so
basically what I got here on the screen
is the basic HTML and where I'm going to
put my JavaScript code now I'm going to
get into the basics of all the
nomenclature that goes behind
object-oriented programming an object
just stores variables and the functions
needed to manipulate those variables all
in one place a class defines what
variables and functions each object will
have technically JavaScript really
doesn't have classes though but we'll
get into that if you have a background
in object-oriented programming in other
languages properties are the names given
to variables that are stored inside of
objects and methods are the name that is
provided to functions that are part of
an object so a variable in if it is
stored in an object is called a property
you can call it a variable I don't
really particularly care but just so you
understand that you're supposed to call
variables properties if they put are
part of an object and you're supposed to
call functions methods if they are part
of an object and to create an object you
create a function with the object's name
and I'm going to show it to you here
right now basically if you want to
create an object you come in you type in
function and let's say I'm going to
create a definition for an object called
an animal then I just follow that up
with the parentheses that would accept
any properties that are being sent to
this guy and then what I do is I define
all of the properties that I want all of
my animal objects to contain and this is
a reference to an object that you create
doesn't quite make sense it will here in
a second so what I'm going to say is
every animal object that I create has to
have a name and by default it's going to
have no name and I'm also going to say
that every animal has to make a sound of
some sort and by default it's going to
go and also an owner know owner okay so
that's what I'm saying
every animal object should contain well
that's it right there I just
find that guy and this is what we call a
constructor and a constructor function
is called every single time a new animal
object is created again if you're not
quite getting it don't worry we're going
to go over this a bunch of times three
times actually now what you want to do
is you want to add the methods or
functions needed for the class and how
you do that in JavaScript is through the
use of what is called the prototype so
if I want to create a method that every
single animal object is going to have I
have to - exactly this the name of the
object followed by the word prototype
followed by set owner and what this
function simply going to do is it is
going to set the value for this variable
right here then you call function and
then a property that this function is
going to accept this is how you create
methods in JavaScript kind of weird I
know now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you how to check to make
sure that had a new owner value has
actually been passed and yes I know
there's countless different ways to do
this I'm just choosing this way because
that's what I feel like doing at this
point in time what I'm doing here is I
am checking to make sure that this guy
has really been passed that's what it's
doing sort of an error protection if it
has what I'm going to say is that I want
the value of owner for this specific new
animal object that's created to be set
to the value that's been passed over
right like that otherwise I want to warn
the person and say to them please enter
a valid owner so this is how you create
your first method using javascript and
the name of this method is going to be
set owner and what it simply does it's
kind of silly how they force you to call
it a method even though they refer to it
as a function but either way this method
here will accept a property that is sent
to it called new owner and if it is
actually passed and defined it will then
set the owner for this specific object
that was created all right so what we're
going to do is I'm going to show you a
model different times and this is also a
reference to what they call
encapsulation which basically means
whenever you create functions such as
set and I'm going to actually create
another one here so I can refer to them
both at the same time animal prototype
followed by the name of the new method
one and this method isn't going to have
any properties so fine we'll just leave
that closed just like that and what it's
going to do is return whatever the
current owner's name is and I know I
don't have to error check this because
what did I do I put an owner in there by
default so that's fine and that's it
that's how you create this now in
regards to encapsulation encapsulation
is and you can kind of knock it off in
JavaScript but basically what it's doing
is it's saying that if you want to
change the value of any of these
properties inside of this object you're
going to have to do it through one of
these functions so if you want to set
the name for the owner you're going to
have to call a function called set owner
to do so I'm going to show you how to
create one of these guys actually come
in here just to save time I'm going to
create methods to set all of these
different values inside of here
boink so I need to set also the name for
the animal and this is going to be
called new name have to change this to
name in this to name and this to name
please enter a valid name you could say
this is going to change this property up
here that's what these functions doing
then what we're going to do is provide
them away to get the new name do that
and then return name right like that
then we're going to come down we have
owner and we have name so that leaves
only one other thing which is going to
be sound so I'm just going to come in
here and I'm going to say set sound new
sound sound this is the sound the animal
is going to make please enter a valid
sound there we go we created all of the
methods needed for this object called
animal and this is a definition now I'm
going to show you how to actually come
in here and create additional animals so
let's say we want to create an object
called dog which is going to be of type
animal well I just come in here type in
dog equals two and new you have to type
that in and then follow that up with
animal which is the name of this
function you defined up here and then
these methods what you're doing is
you're assigning them to this guy
alright so the new dog object that you
just created it's going to automatically
have a name a sound and an owner and
also have access to all of these
different functions to both set as well
as get access to all of these different
properties inside here and then one
do since the objects been created is I'm
going to call the method set name and
I'm going to pass it some attributes
that I want set for this specific dog
object so I'm just passing these guys
over here and I'm gonna leave this empty
on purpose and then I'm going to write
out to screen by accessing the get
versions of these methods right here and
print that information out to screen and
you can see that it printed out the
error message here because I didn't
enter a value for sound which is what I
wanted to do and then it printed out
spot you can see here let me come over
here it's printed out spot because that
seems the value that I entered then it
printed out Paul which is the owner and
then print it out ger which is the
default value for sound since I didn't
define sound whenever I entered this in
here and just to say let's just go whoa
see I defined spot spot print it out
because I called get name i defined paul
that printed out and wolf because i
defined all of three of those different
things so that's how you create an
object and this is your object right
here which is dog and it's of type
animal now I'm going to go through
exactly what inheritance is and just to
divide these guys with this anair don't
link okay great inheritance is whenever
you create a new object that inherits
all the properties and methods that you
defined in another object it just
borrows them and how you do it is you
just use the function keyword again and
let's say I want to make a cat this time
and I just want to create one additional
property called mood I'm just gonna say
happy because all cats are always happy
and if you guys out there know anything
about JavaScript in regards to object
oriented programming you're saying right
now haha he just messed up and I didn't
what you need to do whenever you are
going to inherit all the properties and
methods created in the animal class is
start off with the class that you want
to inherit from followed with a dot and
then call and then this and I'm going to
get a little bit more into what this is
what this is is a reference to the next
cat object that you create that's what
this is that's what this stands for and
what this is here is a call to the
constructor that you created the animal
constructor which is just the function
that's run every single time you create
a new
animal object so automatically this is
the way that all your cat objects are
now going to have name sounds and owners
even though you do not define and
they're also going to have set owners
and get owners and so forth in regards
to methods automatically but you have to
make sure that you call this specific
function this is actually forcing the
original animal constructor to be
executed that's what's going on there
then what you have to do is actually set
the animal class as the superclass for
the object or class called cat and how
you do that is just follow this guy cat
prototype is equal to new animal and if
you didn't do this what this would do is
it would actually make cat a subclass of
the main object superclass which I'm not
going to get into this stuff can get
really complicated really really easy so
I'm just going to stick with that and
then you're also going to have to assign
the right constructor to this object and
the constructor for the cat object is
going to be this one in JavaScript you
have to actually define that and again a
reference to cat prototype and here
you're defining the constructor to be of
type cat and then if you want to
actually come in here and create a new
set of mood methods for this new cat
object go cat
proto type get mood is equal to function
and just define it return this mood just
that easy and you would be able to set
that also in precisely the same way just
cat prototype dot set mood equal to
function new mood if it has been passed
over scroll this up and I'm actually
just going to copy and paste that in
there and then just change these to
moods and there you are so that's how to
inherit all the properties and methods
from another object that you previously
created or another class that you
previously created and then add
additional new methods and new
properties then if you want to call this
guy no problem just start off with var
and let's say I want to call my new cat
object Sophie no cat boom just create it
up and then if I want to come in here
and call all the different functions I
can do that
right like that copy/paste well let's
change the owner to me sound yeah and I
forgot my mood crazy there you are man
if I want to print them out again I'm
just going to grab this
up here changes to Sophie Sophie and
type in mood here you can see Sophie
Derek me out crazy all of them print it
out on a screen another thing you can do
is with object-oriented programming in
JavaScript is to actually check if one
object was instantiated or was created
in a way based off of another class
that's with what that means and let's
say I wanted to see if Sophie is an
instance of that's how you figure out if
Sophie is actually a cat object and you
can see the true came back here on the
right side of the screen because what is
really weird and what will actually
confuse you document right like let's
say we call type of which is supposed to
return what type of data type this is
well if you thought that whenever you
type this and you were going to be
presented with class you would be wrong
it's actually a function why because
that's what it's called inside of
JavaScript see function cat I just asked
it what is cat well you said it was a
function see welcome to the wonderful
crazy world of object-oriented
programming inside of JavaScript however
if you type in Sophie object comes back
onto the screen see little crazy
another object-oriented programming
thing and from this point on rest of the
tutorial you might not understand a
single thing I'm saying because I'm
doing this really to answer a lot of
questions that are going to be brought
up by people that understand
object-oriented programming if you have
no idea what it is or this is the first
tutorial ever seen on it some other
things are going to be confusing so I
leave you with that another concept an
object-oriented programming is what is
called method overloading what method
overloading is normally you can create
multiple different versions or multiple
different methods that all have a
different number of attributes and the
programming language if it follows the
basic principles of object-oriented
programming will call the right method
depending upon how many attributes are
entered when the method is called so
let's say the first one will handle or
will be called if just one attribute is
sent in and the second one will be
called if two attributes are passed and
the third method will be called if three
attributes are passed this is
called method overloading it allows for
multiple different methods to be called
based off of how many attributes are
sent and also it can be based off of a
couple other different things well if
you wanted to do this inside of
JavaScript you technically could and
this is where the world becomes crazy
all right do you remember how up here I
was checking to see if this value is
defined or not well just to save time
I'm actually going to copy this what you
can do inside of JavaScript however you
probably never will do this but this is
me trying to force method overloading
let's say you wanted to create a method
called set stuff and you wanted to
provide the option of accepting these
guys if at all possible what you have to
understand is inside a JavaScript you
can ask for these different properties
and if they are not passed and error is
not thrown well then what you can do is
actually create new versions of this
method based off of which attributes
were sent and how you would do that is
using this in my situation here I'm
using type of to do this so I'm going to
say is new name defined and I'm going to
continue to do this for all of these
properties that could be sent and I'm
going to say also owner all right and
inside of JavaScript what I'm going to
do now is I'm saying that if all of
these different properties were sent
what I actually want to do is create a
new version of the set stuff function
and you can do this and it's completely
crazy so I can actually go cat prototype
right like that set stuff and I might as
well just copy this and recreate this
whole entire function and this sort of
on-the-fly creates custom methods based
off of which properties were sent
whenever the object was first created
that probably just confused the heck out
of it but this is the basis of how you
would do method overloading since ID of
JavaScript though just so you understand
that and like I said just like before
you would just recreate this function
because the way JavaScript operates is
the last version of the function that is
created with this specific name so
basically the way to our script operates
is it says okay there's a new function
called set stuff and then whenever it
comes down here this doesn't trigger an
error when
you create a new set stuff function what
it does instead is it overwrites this
set stuff function so that just gives
you the beginnings of understanding
exactly where you would go if you wanted
to do method overloading and the final
thing is what is called polymorphism
what you have to understand in regards
to polymorphism is that because
javascript is loosely typed polymorphism
is possible but in it's extremely
different in regards to its usage in
comparison to other object-oriented
programming languages and just to
explain exactly how polymorphism works
in most programming languages like let's
say you create a function this time
doesn't have anything to do with the
actual objects or anything and you
define this is the way it works in most
languages not JavaScript you define that
this function is going to be passed a
property of type animal you could then
go on and print out the screen the name
the owner etc well in most programming
languages the way it works is because
cat inherited all of its properties and
so forth from animal what you would be
able to do in other languages is to pass
the cat object even though is expecting
an animal object to be passed and it
would automatically just work and it
would come in here let's just copy this
so what it would do is in this function
it would also be considering okay I want
an a object to be passed to this of type
animal and you pass an object that
inherited from animal which would be cat
to this function and what it would
automatically do in object-oriented
programming languages is to actually
automatically come in here and make sure
that the right methods are actually
executed that's how polymorphism works
inside of almost all of the languages
and the reason why that is cool is other
languages forced you to define the type
being passed to the function since
JavaScript doesn't force you to define
the type PM technically works because
you can pass anything but it loses a lot
of what makes polymorphism kind of
exciting and interesting and other
object-oriented programming languages so
there's an overview of object-oriented
programming inside of JavaScript have
led and confuse you too much if I did
just disregard the method overloading
partna polymorphism part and just really
understand how to create methods and
variables because that's pretty much how
object we're importing works with
JavaScript if any questions or comments
which you probably will if you sat
through this whole thing leave them
below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
