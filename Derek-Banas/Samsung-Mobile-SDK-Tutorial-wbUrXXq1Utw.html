1 of my Samsung mobile sdk tutorial in
this tutorial I'm gonna show you all of
the tools you're gonna need as well as
provide real code in an introduction to
the s-pen class and how you can use it
in this tutorial I'm going to be using
the brand new Google Android development
tools and in a previous tutorial I
showed you how to set those up as well
as how to install the Samsung Mobile SDK
plug-in and I provide a link to that in
the upper right hand corner if you
haven't seen it you definitely should
watch that first and if it's still
November 2013 you have an opportunity to
win a brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 3 or
one of three Samsung Galaxy gear watches
and this is brought to you by the
Samsung smart app challenge for 2013 but
is still going on and they're giving
away 1.1 million dollars but I am giving
away 3 devices that you have a very very
good chance of winning all you're gonna
need to do to get in running is go to
developer.samsung.com
forward slash sign up sign up for a free
Samsung developer account and then go to
my website which will pop up right below
here new think tank comm and then tell
me you signed up for a developer's
account and you're in the running to win
now I'm gonna show you how to set
everything up ok so the very first thing
you're going to want to do is go to
samsung calm /us /ki ES and to setup
your device and test your application
you're going to either need to download
this software for Windows or for Mac
quite simple installation process no
real reason for me to go into it any
further than that then what you're gonna
want to do is open up your device which
you can see an example of right here on
your screen and you're going to of
course have to enable the developer
options for your device to do that if
you do not see developer options like I
have right here you're gonna have to
click on about device open that up
scroll way way way far to the bottom and
you're going to want to put your finger
the build number and hold it down like
this whenever you do that eventually
you're gonna get a message I already
have the developer tools option set up
but in this situation it's gonna say
developer mode has already been turned
on in your situation if it hasn't been
turned on turn it on there you go now
you're all set now what you're gonna
need to do is go into developer options
like you see right there click on it and
then you're going to have to just put a
checkmark in USB debugging which you can
see right there I have a check mark
right here now your device is perfectly
ready to start installing apps and
testing them so let's take a look at
exactly what app we're going to be
developing here the guys at Samsung
thought if I'm doing an introductory
video I should use the introductory code
that is provided and it makes total
sense I mean this SDK is so new it's
very important to get very comfortable
with it up front so what we're going to
be doing is just going line by line
through the Hello pen introductory video
however there's one more thing you're
gonna need to do to be able to execute
it and you're gonna find that out just
by clicking on Hello pen on your device
it's gonna say you need to upgrade or
install the Mobile SDK application so
just hit OK that's all you need to do
Play Store is going to open up and
you're gonna see S Pen SDK you just want
to hit install and then hit accept and
everything is going to install for you
here super super quick and it's been
installed now what we're gonna do is
back out of this go back to the S Pen
program guide hit Hello pen and there
you can see it's on the screen and
basically what we're gonna do in this
tutorial is cover exactly how you're
going to be able with the S Pen be able
to go in and be able to accept a person
drawing on the screen so a whole bunch
of things but really if we take them
step by step it's quite a simple process
so let's go and take a look at that code
okay so to create an application that's
going to allow you to draw on your
screen you would think that maybe that
was really complicated but actually it
isn't because of the SDK we're going to
be using basically all you need to do is
have the activity
that uses the layout that is defined as
you do right here all that you need to
do is create your activity which in this
situation is the pen sample one one
Hello pen activity and then define your
layout which in this situation is
activity hello pen dot XML and then of
course we're going to make a reference
to the relative layout itself which has
the IDS pen view layout then to that
we're gonna add the s pen surface view
and basically what it's gonna do is
allow us to draw either with the s pen
or a finger or what have you and then
finally to that we're gonna add the S
Pen note dock which is going to allow us
to add and remove pages and then of
course we're going to add a page which
in this situation is going to be of the
type S Pen page dock and the S Pen page
dock is basically going to hold our
layers and our objects and also any
other imported information or images
that are imported into our page so
basically all we need to do is create
that inside of code and you're gonna see
it is actually quite easy so let's take
a look at that okay so here we are
inside of a clips and here we have an
sample one hello pen Java and activity
alo pen dot XML let's just take a look
at the layout first quite simple just a
relative layout and it has the ID that I
mentioned before which is s-pen view
layout everything else here is quite
simple so it's bounced back over into
hello pen Java and I'll go through
exactly what we need to import here now
since we're gonna be using the Samsung
SDK everything is going to start off
with that and you're gonna see that most
of this code that I'm gonna be writing
is actually going to handle what exactly
are we gonna do whenever they use the
wrong type of device or they don't have
an S Pen or something like that and this
exception right here is going to handle
those situations for us of course we're
gonna have to write some code to
basically decide how the dialog box is
gonna show up and so forth and so on and
what we're gonna do if an error occurs
then we're gonna need a way to
initialize and verify that the S Pen is
available in the library for that it's
just going to be pen S Pen right like
that and all the functions we're going
to need to carry out that initialization
is going to be available from that
library
and we're going to need a way to manage
what are called SPD files or s-pen data
files and like I mentioned before the
s-pen note Docs are going to hold all of
our s-pen page documents so in this
situation
I'm gonna go pen dot and document which
is what we're gonna be using and s-pen
note doc and like I said before those
gonna hold all of our pages so guess
what we're gonna need now we're going to
need pen doc document dot S Pen page doc
and like I mentioned before our pages
are going to allow us to add delete
retrieve change layers objects and also
provide for changing of general settings
inside of our page documents and that
basically just leaves us with the need
for surface view that is going to be in
pen so I engine dot s pen surface view
and like I said before this is going to
provide the capability to draw with the
S Pen or draw with your finger and then
this final guy is just going to provide
us with reference to our or file because
all of this is actually all these
examples that I'm going through here or
actually packaged together inside of one
great big giant example program as you
saw previously in the tutorial and now
that we have that all set up on create
us here just like it is for all the
activities that we're gonna create
inside of Android and then we're
basically going to have to define a
couple different objects inside of here
one of them because we are going to be
doing systems level operations we're
going to need to create a context and I
get questions about contexts all the
time so I'm basically just going to go
over almost everything a context is used
for basically a context provides access
to application resources launch
activities it also allows for the
receiving of intense managing sounds
Bluetooth management modifying the
clipboard yes I'm going to cover
everything it's going to handle requests
in regards to downloads interacting with
input methods it's going to retrieve a
layout inflator if we need to inflate an
interface or inflate a component it's
going to handle file creation and
retrieving of the NFC Manager and if C
of course stands for near field
communications which I'm going to get
into late
later tutorials also provides access to
the MSD manager for network service
discovery the search manager the sensor
manager the storage manager yes I'm
covering everything by the way the
telephony manager tech services manager
USB manager vibration Wi-Fi in regards
to peer-to-peer Wi-Fi as well as the
Wi-Fi manager and the window manager
okay so basically the context is an
all-powerful object that allows us to
get access to most anything so that I
hope puts it into perspective and wasn't
too much information
just remember it's all powerful it
allows you to pretty much do anything
you'd like to do in regards to all those
things I just mentioned and of course
we're gonna need our note doc which
we've talked about here and I'm just
gonna call that note doc and then since
we have the note doc that holds all the
pages of course we're also going to need
our page doc and there it is and then
finally we're going to need our surface
view and that's just s-pen surface view
which again allows us to use either the
s-pen or our finger to draw things and
to do other things as we're gonna see
later on in this tutorial and there we
go now we're gonna go down into on
create and of course this guy is just
going to define the layout we're using
which is activity hello pen dot XML
which I showed you a second ago which is
a relative layout then since this is the
main activity we have here we can go and
get our context by just assigning this
to it then one of the things I said
previously we're gonna spend a lot of
time in this code doing is verifying
that the device works and we're able to
use the s-pen so we're going to have a
boolean inside of here call it is s-pen
feature enabled and we're gonna set it
as false by default we're going to
assume that things are gonna go wrong
then we need to create our s-pen object
of course that's been packaged is equal
to new s-pen and then what we need to do
is try to initialize the s-pen and if it
doesn't exist triggering an exception
which we referenced previously and then
handle what's going to happen when that
exception is triggered so of course
we're going to be throwing this inside
of a try block and we're going
you try to initialize our s-pen by
calling s-pen package dot initialize and
then pass this which is our all-powerful
context then we're gonna say is the
s-pen available for use well we're gonna
assign this to is s-pen feature enabled
and to find out if it is or not we're
gonna go S Pen package and call is
feature enabled and pass in specifically
S Pen dot device pen which is what we
are checking for so pretty simple we're
just saying hey can we initialize this
guy is it enabled and then what we're
gonna do is go catch and what are we
gonna catch we're gonna catch this
exception up here s SD unsupported
exception basically means we don't have
a device that works or we cannot use the
S Pen for some reason or another give us
the name of E and then inside of here
we're going to say if process
unsupported exception e is equal to true
and we're gonna have to create this
function down below here in a second but
if that is true then we're just going to
return like to also throw in another
catch block which is just a general
exception and in this situation we're
not going to be able to initialize our
s-pen so what we're gonna use is a toast
which is gonna provide us with the
option to put a little message that
opens in a little gray box
if you've used an Android application
I'm sure you've seen them and basically
to make a little toast pop up on the
screen we need to pass it the context as
well as the message and also how long we
want the little message to appear on our
screen and to make it we just go toast
whoops spell toast right make text pass
it the context which is M context and
then the message we want to display so
cannot initialize s-pen and then we have
to say how long do we want this to
remain on the screen and one of the
defaults is toast length short and then
if we want the toast to up here we just
go so right at the end of that
and there we go now we got ourselves a
little message and get rid of this last
little bracket there and now we're set
then if that appears want to print out a
little message here so print stacktrace
change this t1 and then finally to drop
the activity out of memory we're gonna
call finish and there we go
now if we didn't have any problems with
this and no exceptions were triggered
the next thing we only basically know
that everything's working out fine so we
need to initialize the relative layout
inside of activity hello pen so we're
gonna go relative layout and call this s
pen view layout equal to and of course
it's a relative layout there we go and
then find view by ID and we're gonna
call it our dot ID dot s pen view layout
and there we go
then we need to create our drawing
surface on our device just like I showed
in a little diagram a little bit ago so
we're gonna go S Pen surface of U is
equal to new s pen surface view and to
create this we have to pass in our
contacts so there it is then we need to
check if the s pen surface was created
and if not display a toast error message
so we're gonna go if this guy right here
paste that in there check if equals null
and if so we're gonna make another toast
and splay another mayor message inside
of there and pass in our context again
and then our message cannot create new s
pen view and then finally how long is it
gonna display on the screen and I'm just
gonna copy this as well and show as well
point and there we go
and then after we display that toast we
can and free memory shut everything down
we'll finish again all right so if we
didn't get into that situation however
we're gonna need to insert the drawing
surface into our relative layout so
we're gonna go S Pen view layout and add
a view and that view is gonna be S Pen
surface view and then we're going to
call display and display is basically
gonna provide information on the display
in regards to size density orientation
refresh rates and so forth so on call
that display is equal to and to get this
we're just gonna call get window manager
and then call get default display and
then we're gonna need to create a rack
which is basically going to hold the
integer coordinates for our rectangle
call this rect is equal to new rect and
then call display
getrekt size and passing rect and then
we're going to need to create an S Pen
note dock which has a potential of
triggering another exception and we're
gonna create this by passing in a
context as well as the width and the
height so we're gonna go M S Pen note
dock is equal to new S Pen note dot and
like I said for we're gonna pass in our
context as well as our width and our
height and we get that from this rekt
now of course we could get ourselves
some errors here and we're gonna need to
catch them so I owe exception in that
situation we're gonna print out another
toast I'm just gonna copy this save it
here so that I'll be able to use it over
and over and over again paste that in
there past the context and I'm gonna say
can I create note dot and everything
else here is fine and then scroll back
up here again turn out an error message
so that we can track it and then of
course we'll clear up our memory close
our application otherwise get a general
exception here paste that in there and
in this situation we're just going to
call this exception and rather than
printing anything out we'll get rid of
that and we'll just print out a message
for us as developers okay so if we
didn't get an exception there what that
means we need to add our page to our
document so we're just gonna go M S Pen
page dot and call M S Pen note doc which
is gonna hold all our pages and call
append page with capital P then in this
situation we decided to change our
background color to do that we're just
gonna call s-pen page dot set background
color and here is that funky color we
can call on the page doc clear history
which is going to clear the undo and
redo history but the page is going to
store it and then we're gonna call the
s-pen surfaceview and call set page doc
and pass in the page doc and then we're
gonna pass in true as well
in this situation because we want to
update the screen that's what that is
for if it's false it's not going to
update it then what we need to do is
check if the s-pen is available or not
say like I said actually creating
everything so that we are able to draw
is pretty much handled for us by the SDK
well we have to make sure is the SDK has
all the tools that it requires to be
able to properly function so a lot of
this stuff you just do over and over
again so then we're gonna call the s-pen
surface view and call set tool to
recognize the finger as the drawing
implement and to do that we go S Pen
surface view dot and then we define the
finger as the tool that is going to be
using it and then we define the type of
action and like I said before we could
do things like define the eraser as the
tool that's going to be used but in this
situation this is just going to be using
a simple stroke and to do that we call
action stroke right like that and then
since we're not using the s-pen in this
situation we're gonna print out another
toast that's basically gonna say hey the
device you're using here doesn't support
the use of s-pen so why don't you use
your finger instead which kind of sounds
a little bit funny all right
device does not support s-pen you can
draw the stroke with a finger
I changed English there a little bit and
everything else is gonna remain the same
it's going to show up on the screen for
a short period of time and then show is
gonna be called which is going to
display the toast on the screen ok so
this video is getting a little bit long
so what I'm gonna do is cut it off right
here and in the next part of the video
tutorial I'll finish all of the code to
create our s-pen app please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
