3 of my cascading stylesheets tutorial
here I'm going to show you pretty much
every property we have not covered in
the previous two tutorials if you didn't
watch those definitely check those out
what I'm gonna do first here is going to
define some background properties and
I'm just gonna use the shortcut
background property and I'm gonna say I
want my background to be red and just
jump it into it here I'm gonna say I
want to use a graphic called little
brain in my background you can see her
don't have to put commas in here or
anything I'm gonna say that I do not
want it to repeat and I'm gonna explain
what all this means here in a second
animus I want it in the top-left corner
if I file save it you can see
backgrounds red there's the little brain
graphic it does not repeat either
horizontally or vertically and it's in
the top left corner and basically you
have a bunch of different guys here you
obviously have the background color
which I have here is red of course I
could define that also as background -
color : red if I didn't want to use the
shorthand and I could also define the
background image right like that using
the same little guy I got right here
remember this is shorthand up here right
here this is shorthand this is the long
way of donut and I could also define
background repeat' and type in no-repeat
but this time what I'm going to do is
I'm actually going to type in repeat and
what the heck let's make this background
and then you have background attachment
which makes the image scroll with the
page or stays fixed let's just type in
fixed and that's probably something
better to see actually shown here
background position and for this guy
this can be any color background this
can be any image that you'd like to use
for repeat this could be repeat no -
repeat or repeat X if you just want it
to repeat on a horizontal basis or
repeat - Y if you just want it to be
horizontal or repeat which I'm using
right here let's actually do no-repeat
again just so you can see how the
background attachment works in
background position and you can actually
use multiple versions of this can be
left right center bottom top or you can
put in a percentage or you can put in a
length those are all the possible values
for background position but I'm just
going to leave
again left-top say don't have to put any
periods it for commas inside of there
and let's copy this guy let's actually
make this gray cut that blank paste all
those guys inside of there keep
everything nice and neat and then just
so I can demonstrate the background
attachment which it seems I have a
fixation on I'm gonna grab this guy
right here I'm gonna throw in the body
and just like it says this is just a
bunch of random text and here I'm
commenting out the random text with HTML
see how hidden things all over the place
down here that you don't see and if I
file save that you can see how the text
is here this is gray there's a little
image so forth and so on and it's in the
upper left hand corner but you can also
see that it remains fixed even though I
am scrolling over top of that image
however if I type in the other option
for background attachment which is
scroll and reload this guy you can now
see that it Scrolls right along with the
page and disappears so those are a bunch
of different ways of manipulating the
background pretty much all the ways of
manipulating the background yeah and I'm
gonna come in here and I'm gonna delete
this guy and now I'm gonna show you all
the different ways or bullet types that
are available in lists I'm just gonna
create myself an unordered list Li and
I'm gonna use styles in line and the
style you would use to change the
bulleted list is list style - type : in
one of them is di see those that are and
I'm just gonna call that bullet type as
far as I know there are 12 total
different types of these guys so I'm
gonna put those there on the screen and
there's disc circle square decimal
decimal leading 0 now you know I'm
getting them all lower Roman upper Roman
lower Greek Weber as far as I know there
is no such thing as upper Greek there's
lower Latin up or Latin or Manian and
Georgian and then you get ass around
these guys with quotes sorry forgot that
for a second there then you have to
close off the list box and if you save
it boink you can see all the different
types of bullets that are available and
of course some of them are translating
over into this Chrome browser some of
them aren't and again this is just the
differences between browsers and I'm
just trying to cover as many of these
guys as humanly possible one thing I
have not been talking about much
table styling and that's just not right
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
come in here and I'm gonna create a
class called table style and you're
actually gonna see later when I talk
about box types and so forth that there
are numerous different ways to edit
tables because everything in cascading
style sheets is technically a box and
I'm just defining font-family I'm
defining that I want the text aligned to
the left I'm gonna define that I want
padding which I'm going to talk about
here in a second exactly what the
difference is between padding and
margins saying I want the padding on the
top to be 5 pixels and why don't we just
have the padding on the bottom be 5
pixels as well
background color and here I'm gonna
define that I want that to be white I
want the width to be 75% of whatever the
overall width of the browser is I want
to create a border that is 2 pixel wide
I want it to be solid and I'm gonna show
you all the different possible borders
that are available to you and I'm using
hexadecimal codes here so I can use some
different colors you may not have seen
again just go to Google type in wiki
colors and this will pop up I'm gonna
say that I want the border to collapse
so there are not lines in between each
of the individual columns and rows in
this table and I'm also gonna define
caption where I want the caption to show
up and I'm gonna say that I want my
caption show up on the bottom okay so
there is a class that is going to
control the whole entire table that I
create a spell border right and then I'm
gonna define another one called table
header and I'm gonna say for this guy
that I want the color to be white and
that's the color of the text not the
color of the background and I want the
background color to actually be the same
color as this guy there so I'm gonna
jump over and grab out and what the heck
let's create another class gonna be
called even rows background color and
this is gonna be like a brownish color
and just so you know you can put these
guys in any order you want your the text
color is gonna be a dark color alright
so this is gonna be styling for the
overall table this is going to be the
styling just for the first row or the
header row and this is gonna be styling
that I'm going to use on some even rows
so what are we gonna do we're gonna come
in and we're going to create ourselves
table table class is going to be equal
to
table style and then of course covered
this in previous HTML tutorial there's a
caption right like that and then there's
no table header class that I'm gonna be
using and let's just put in name scroll
that off Street City and of course don't
forget to finish off that by closing
that guy and then we're gonna create
ourselves another row and then just
shorten this up gonna go like this
however this time I'm gonna step in here
using the class even rows and I'm gonna
go in and let's just change one of these
close off the table and you can see it
showed up here on the screen a little
bit scrunch the reason why is the 75%
width that we defined up here but you
could see everything else all fits
inside of here and because I changed the
width as I change the browser it's going
to decrease or increase in size
depending upon if I increase or decrease
the size the browser and there's the
caption that we defined and I could also
put that on the right or the left or the
top just by putting right left up or top
inside of here and you could also see if
I went and chopped this guy on it here
that they break all the different things
up here inside of the table so that is a
bunch of different ways you can style
tables inside of cascading style sheets
and you could also put separate inside
of there instead of collapsed but that's
the default there's not really any
reason to do that but if you just want
to drive yourself crazy you can go ahead
and do that okay
now I'm gonna show you a whole bunch of
different cursors that are available and
this is really neat you want to really
find out how much somebody knows about
HTML straps know about how to change
styling on cursors first you have the
crosshair and again as far as I know
there are 16 total cursors so let's go
and copy this all right we got crosshair
then you have default no real reason to
put default in there then you have help
move and resize or nor three sides
northeast reasons these three sides text
pointer progress and weight those are
all the different cursors and you can
see how the cursor changes here see
crosshairs there's all the different
cursors that are available to you as you
can see they change as I put my mouse
over top of them
that's kind of neat it's definitely the
type of knowledge you're not going to
find many people know and that right
there is the majority of almost every
single property available to you in
cascading stylesheets like I said I'm
gonna be covering divs and spans but I
have a couple other things here
basically CSS treats everything as if it
is a box and every box has the following
different properties they have content
area padding area border and a margin
area now the content holds all of your
content including text images whatever
you got the padding is the blank area
that lies between the content area and
the border area I'm sure you know what
the border is it lies between the
padding and the margin just in case you
didn't and then you have the margin and
that's an optional area that surrounds
all the other parts of the box okay so
that's the basis of how cascading
stylesheets pays attention to boxes
which pretty much everything is
considered a box so I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna create some of these and you can
see some of these different box element
properties I'm gonna call this box out
on that one of course you got your
border color yeah let's just make that
black then you have your border style
and it can either be solid double the
roof out set dotted dashed inset or
ridges those are all of them I'm going
to show you solid this is gonna be kind
of a boring type of guy border width and
let's just make that 1.5 pixels again
you can also define the width of the
border in pixels the word thin medium or
the word thick then you have background
color and I'm just gonna say gray then
you have background image again I'm
gonna use my little brain does it have
that saved their background repeat'
again can be no repeat repeat - ex
repeat - Y or inherit which means it's
going to inherit whatever the property
of the parent of this box is again I'm
going to say no repeat background
position and I'm choosing top left alot
just so you can see exactly what's going
on here
line height defines the distance between
lines of text within the box and I'm
just going to put one point a DM font
family you've seen a whole
a bunch of times and previously I showed
you every single font available or every
single phone available on almost every
single browser anyway
and then there's font style and the
point here is I'm trying to make sure I
use just about every single one of these
I mean this is completely insane you
would never do this in a real portal to
find all these different things and then
you have padding which defines your
overall width of your padding and I'm
gonna get more into some additional
options because you might not believe it
but there are multiple different
versions of padding and margins and
border widths and border styles so for
example you could define the different
border styles by saying border top style
board or right style border the left
style board and bottom style and you can
do the same thing with margin and
padding look I said I'm giving you
pretty much everything conceivable here
and if I jump down inside of here I'm
gonna create a span I'm gonna say class
is equal to box element 1 and of course
put your quotes around there and a span
is what an inline tag and what does an
inline tag mean means there are no
spaces that follow it you can see right
there
random text is printed inside of here
with the brain order with gray Dada Dada
Dada Dada it up again I come in here and
change the padding on this I'll say and
you can see how this guy moves around
inside of here I'm actually going to
show you just by changing a couple other
things some of the oddball little ways
of moving these guys around inside of
here now let's actually come in here and
throw a break statement actually it's
throw to break statements and with the
next one I'm actually gonna make this a
little bit neater let's make the
background color yellow and I'm actually
in come in here and do some really
strange things border top color
let's make it double just become this
and can border right style I'm gonna
change that to Ridge border width let's
take it up to 2 so we can see these guys
a little bit better and then we can also
come in here border left wit just so you
can see all the different things
available thick background color let's
make this I am
let's leave no-repeat on background
position the same line I - II am not
that it's gonna really affect anything
leave this italic leave the margins one
5-foot margin right we're gonna make
that 250 pixels adding we're gonna take
down to 25 adding left we're gonna take
that to 300 pixels now let's look at
what this monstrosity became and you
could see there it is it's all stretched
out on the screen but that's just
because of how I got it laid out there
in the fact that I'm zooming in on the
browser so there is your little wacky
box you can see all the different things
I did here with the borders and all the
weird ways that I effected the padding
and all the other different things you
have available to you inside of the
cascading stylesheets property list
up next I'm going to go into layout and
I'm going to go more into divs and spans
and a whole bunch of other things and
soon you will be a cascading stylesheets
expert if you have any questions or
comments leave them below otherwise till
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
