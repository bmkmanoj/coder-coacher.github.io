7 of my tutorial on how to make Android
apps today I'm going to show you exactly
from step one exactly how I make Android
apps what we're going to do is we're
going to make a conversion app and I'm
going to show it to you here in a second
where I'm also going to cover spinners
relative layouts grid layouts XML arrays
and a whole bunch more so I have a lot
to do so let's get into it okay so the
only thing I did to prepare for this
tutorial is to lay this out this is
basically what the apps going to look
like hopefully whenever we finish it up
and what I'm going to be doing is
bouncing you step-by-step through the
use case where I basically document what
I want the app to do and then over into
the code and then back to the use case
and into the code the use case is
normally what I have laying in front of
me whenever I make tutorials that you
guys see but I've never really shown you
what my use cases look like or how I set
them up so this time I'm gonna do it so
let's go over and do it right now okay
so basically what I start off with is
just over in a text editor and the very
first thing I'm going to do is I'm just
going to document the simple actions of
making this work so I'm going to come in
here and just say okay the user is going
to enter a number they want converted
into an it text and that's going to be
start one and the second thing that's
going to happen is they are going to
change I'm going to put this in the link
in the tutorial or underneath the in the
description so you'll be able to get
this if you want to look at it then
you're going to change the spinner to
the unit of measure to convert from and
then the third thing is the other
conversion types all show their new
measurement version of that unit amount
okay so this is what we're going to do
this is the simple actions that my app
is going to perform now what I'm going
to do is
really go into detail and I do this
every single time I make these as
detailed as humanly possible and I try
to catch every single thing I'm ever
going to want to do with these guys and
I'm going to just type out a couple
things in I'm going to jump into code
just so I don't bore you so what do I
need to do well the very first thing I
want to do is what I normally always do
I need to create the layout in activity
main and then I can go into a little bit
more detail since this all applies to
activity main I could say that I want to
use a relative there's no planning going
on I'm just doing this out of my head
right now just when to see or show you
guys my process so I'm going to use a
relative layout for a label and I'm
going to put the text in the side of
there convert from and an edit text and
a spinner those are going to be the
drop-down sort of window that's what a
spinner is so those are the things I'm
going to create and then what I'm going
to do is I'm going to use a grid layout
for the bottom that is going to contain
two columns and six rows and that's
where all of the other different units
of measure are going to go and then I'm
gonna make the grid layout a blue color
and I'm going to use the units I already
know this I planned this part out what
units I was going to use so I'm gonna
have teaspoons tablespoons cups ounces
pints quarts gallons phones know liters
liters milligrams and kilograms so
that's what I got to do inside of the
activity main so now I'm going to jump
over in Android studio and start making
this thing and here we are and I'm going
to go new project and this is the brand
new Android point eight I cover this in
the last part of the tutorial and I'm
just going to keep this simple I'm just
going to call this conversion and you
think tanks my domain I'm gonna leave
that in there I'm going to leave this
exactly where it is come over here and
click on next this is going to open up
we're just going to use the 15 as our
minimum as it is asking us to do
click on next and then here I'm just
going to use blank activity again not
going to do anything with fragments
until I've covered fragments of detail
click on next and let's just say the
activity main I'm going to actually call
it main activity this is the Java file
I'm going to leave this activity main
there for XML layout and for our title
I'm just going to go conversion and then
click finish and Android studio is going
to build that for me and here it is and
we are inside of activity main so that's
good that's what we are going to work on
first that's normally what I always work
on first let's move this over here get
to side the way so you can see
everything one thing I always do first
though is I come inside of this guy I go
to build Gradle just make sure
everything's set up right and this is
set for 20 I'm going to set this to 19
change this so that I don't have any
emulator problems that's the reason why
I'm doing this right now and as soon as
Android studio in the my changes to 19
and target is going to be 19 minimum
versions 15 that's perfectly fun and
everything else looks like it is going
to be perfectly fine as well so and then
I'm gonna come over here and go sync now
and Gradle is able to properly build ok
so now we can close that and get into
activity mate now I said I wanted to use
a relative layout and match parent is
going to be perfectly fine here now all
these things look pretty good I guess
and the context here for main activity
is correct so we're just going to leave
that be exactly the way it is now I'm
going to get involved with my text view
which is right there it's real blurry I
know you can't see it so wrap content is
going to be perfectly fine because I
want to have everything go horizontally
from left to right if you don't remember
this is what we want our application
look like so that's why we have a wrap
content we're going to go left to right
like that I am going to change the text
in here though just like we had over
there to convert from and then of course
we come over here to our little light
bulb extract string resource and then I
have to give this a name I'm going to
call this convert from text I'm down
here click OK so there that is you can
also switch over into the design view of
course and there's convert from I can
highlight that come over here for text
appearance you can edit all this in
multiple different ways I could add drug
this out but I'm just going to use
what's here so for text appearance click
inside of there put some more
Android PR and then we can go text
parents large you can see now it's much
bigger I'd also like to come over here
and go and edit the margin right and
just put that right there and I'm going
to say 20 DP so that there's a little
bit of margin between this and the
editable text box we have right now and
everything is pretty much fine there so
what I'm going to do now is get an
editable text box someone come over here
and grab this plain text right there or
actually you know what we're going to be
using a number with decimal places so
grab this guy right here
I've to drop it there so you guys could
see it and then I'm going to have to
grab it and place it up here and there
it is you know jump over into the text
area and there it is
I'm going to change the ID for this guy
so that it's a little bit easier to
understand to amount text view and you
can see here exactly how the alignments
work and relative layout here we're
going to align parent top true aligned
parent right true and aligned parent end
true that's how everything's going to be
based off of inside of our parents this
guy is going to be arranged I'm going to
get rid of EMS here input type you can
see that automatically set it for me for
number decimal because that's what's
going to be put inside of there and I'm
also going to put in some default text
in here so just go text and I'm going to
put one point zero inside of there and
that's all I'm going to do with that
next up I have to put the spinner inside
of here so there's the spinner a little
drop-down and we're just going to drop
it in here like that for the width I'm
going to have this be matched parent so
it fills all the space available wrap
contents fine for the height for the ID
here I'm going to have this be unit type
spinner because it's going to contain
all the unit types there we go
and every single time you do this it
might align these differently in regards
to what other widgets that are on the
screen or the parent that surrounds it
and how it's going to be aligned that
way relative so these are relative
layouts just like we said before and
then what I want to do is get a grid
layout and put it underneath to here and
that is where all of the units are going
to go so your grid layouts here and of
course it's just going to align
everything using rows and columns and
I'm going to have this be set fill
parent fill parent for both of those if
we jump over into the text area you can
see there is our grid layout then inside
of here we need to define the number
of columns and rows that we have and how
you do that is column count and in this
situation we have two columns and then
for our rows just type in row count and
I'm going to have six of them so we're
going to have a total of twelve possible
units inside of this little grid layout
we have right here also going to want to
define my orientation and in this
situation that's going to be horizontal
and then I'd also like to come in here
and define padding and I'm going to make
this 15 DP also like to give this a
color jump back over inside of here and
that's going to be in background there's
background right there there we go click
here and then we can define our colors
just by clicking on color right there
then you can drag around and pretty much
pick whatever you want and I'm thinking
that looks perfectly fine so I'm going
to click on OK and there you can see it
changed and now what I need to do is put
all the text views in for all of the
different unit types I actually find
this a little bit easier to just do
inside of here because of code
completion so that's the way I'm going
to do it so we're going to go text view
and inside of this guy I'm going to
define an ID and the very first thing
I'm going to have on here is going to be
teaspoon text view and then the text
that I'm going to put inside of this is
going to be I'm going to define
something here 1.0 I'm going to say a
teaspoon and then of course I come in
here and click on that extract string
resource and say something like do you
fault teaspoon value click OK and I can
define my text appearance also in here
and here I'm just going to say Android
text appearance medium layout width and
I'm gonna have this be wrapped content
because we want to have two on a row
there layout height and have that be
wrap content as well layout gravity I'm
going to have it be arranged from left
and also top and then if I want to put a
margin on it as well margin right and
I'm going to put 30 DP see how that
looks and layout margin bottom and I'm
just going to put 30 DP in there just
because I did that way before all right
so there is text view and if we move
this out here you can see there it is it
looks pretty good and if you wonder
where the 1.0 comes from what I'm going
to be doing here is I'm going to be
using the TSP as the base as you're
going to see here in a minute and
everything else is going to be converted
to all the other different units based
off of TSP so if I want to change
from cups to gowns what I'm going to do
is I'm first going to change cups two
teaspoons and then let's see where's
gallons there's gallons right there then
I'm going to convert from teaspoons to
gallons and that is the way that I'm
going to do this because it makes the
most sense and it keeps everything very
flexible and nice all right so let's
jump back and keep designing all right
so after I do these first two I'll be
able to copy and paste them so the next
thing I'm going to do because it lines
up really nice are the cups so I'm going
to go I D cup text view and the default
text is going to be O 208 and we'll say
cup text appearance I'm going to use
exactly what I used up here just paste
that there and then I'm also going to do
the layout gravity and for this one I'm
going to use the same one I'm just going
to go left top know what I'm going to do
is I'm going to copy and paste these
guys right here and then I'll have all
of my different rows and columns there
you can see is everything all lined up
and the reason why I have spaced over
here is because this is going to come
out to four decimal places and I just
want to make sure that I don't push
those off the side of the screen might
work might not work but whatever that's
just part of the create and everything
hundred percent out of my head like I'm
doing right now okay so now I'm back
over into this little use case and I'm
going to continue thinking my way
through exactly what I need to do next
so this is going to be two because we
got activity main done and I have all
the code in the description so what I
want to do up next is set up the main
activity and I'm going to do this what
I'm going to have to do is first and I
have to initialize my spinner and my
editable text box and also all my text
views what else am I going to have to do
inside of there inside of oncreate I'm
going to have to do something here so
let's just go in oncreate and put this
here instead I'm going to add items to
the spinner and you're going to see how
I'm going to do that here in a second
and then inside of that more
specifically what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create an array adapter using a
string array resource so you're going to
see how this string array resources work
out and to do that make strings.xml say
I get real detailed I cover pretty much
everything here also find the layout to
use with my spinner which is just going
to be a default layout and then
I need to connect the adapter to the
spinner and that's pretty much it that I
can think of right there
I'm also inside of on connect I'm going
to have to run create I mean I'm also
going to have to come in here and add a
listener to the spinner I'm also I'm
going to use set on items selected
listener form a spinner and you'll
remember this stuff after you make
couple hundred Android applications it's
just something that eventually just
starts to stick in your head another
thing I may or may not do and in this
situation I'm going to put a note here
maybe check if I am going to use a base
class for the unit conversion which I'm
pretty much pausing what I mean by that
is I'm going to use TSP as my base class
and convert everything from TSP so
everything eventually becomes a teaspoon
and then becomes whatever else it wants
to be all right it'll make more sense
whenever I do it because you're going to
see the tiny amount of code it's going
to take to create literally infinite
numbers of different types of unit types
and I'm also going to get the value in
the editable text box which is going to
be you know whatever they put in one
point zero teaspoons whatever and then
I'm also going to come in here and
initialize the text views okay so now
that I have that all set up let's jump
back over and do it so here we are just
need to go into main activity dot Java
and what I say I need to do here alright
so what I'm going to need to do is come
in here and I'm going to create my
spinner and I'm also going to come in
here and create my editable text box and
I'm going to call it a mount text view
and then also going to create a text
view for every single one of the
different unit types then get down
inside of here in oncreate and do all
the other things we talked about our
little list of things we need to do with
our application now the very first thing
to do is I'm
going to kind of model eyes everything
and I'm going to fill my spinner with
the unit type options that I have
available what I'm going to do first off
is go over into values right here and
I'm going to create a new file inside of
here and this is where all of my
different unit types are going to be
stored that are then going to be pulled
into our little spinner and I'm going to
call this guy conversion types XML there
that is and whenever you are creating
these XML version equal to 1.0 and my
encoding is going to be equal to
utf-8 you're going to call this
resources or put these between resources
tags and then inside of that you're
going to put a string array and I'm just
going to give it the name of conversion
types and then what we need to do is
list out every single item that we are
going to use in our little spinner item
and then you're going to go teaspoon and
then create one of these for every
single one of these guys so we're also
going to do tablespoon and all of the
rest then we're going to save those on
of course make sure you come up here and
put a question mark all right
so everything's all set up for a
resources for spinner back in the main
activity I'm going to film a spinner
once again like I said so I'm going to
add items to unit type spinner sounds
like good name for a function I'll
create this function here in a second
another thing I'm going to need to do
like I documented in a use case is add
listener to unit type spinner create
that function I need to come in here and
get my data that was entered into the
editable text box and find view by ID
and that's it our dot ID dot amount
textview and then I'm also going to
initialize my text views all in one
function just like keep everything all
separated okay so if I want to set this
guy up first off I like to keep
everything modular when I really write
program in a roll world I it's a little
bit different than what you guys
normally see so I'm going to go public
void initialize text views and then I'll
do the first one here so the TSP text
view course I need to cast it to a text
view and I'm just going to do fine view
by ID again and r dot ID dot and then I
call this TSP text view got it
and then just speed everything up I went
and put in all the other ones there for
you and that's all I'm going to do with
initialized text views now I got a
handle which one add items to unit type
spinner that looks good let's go and
create that public void we go and now
you're going to see how to create an
array adapter for our spinner first I
need to get a reference to my spinner so
I'm gonna go unit type spinner and
spinner and I can do a five you buy ID
again
and our ID and this is your type spinner
so now that I got that I'm going to be
able to create an array adapter using
the string array we just created with
you know remember it's a teaspoon
tablespoon all that in it here this this
guy right here I'm going to put this in
the spinner read after is going to be
used to do just that and this is going
to be a character sequence that is and
I'll call this unit type spinner adapter
want to keep these names really detailed
at least that's what I like to do so I
know exactly what's going on now you
need to go ray adapter create from
resource there that is and then the
resource that we are going to use well
first off we have to put in this which
is a context so that we know what's
going on and all the things needed are
available and then to get that array
we're just going to come in here you
can't see it say our array and then I
just specifically say conversion types
and then on the next one we have to just
give it a defaults simple spinner type
thing you know layout to put it in side
up and I'm going to use Android our
layout dot and simple and I specifically
want the spinner and there's a spinner
item and there you go got that all set
up now I need to specify the layout to
use when the list of choices is gonna up
here so I'm going to go unit type
spinner adapter and I need to go set
drop-down view resource you can see it
comes up there for me and I'll go
Android tar dot layout dot and I'm just
going to go simple sure that's lowercase
a and there it is drop-down item it
popped up for me I do think I memorize
these things I don't I just know want to
use a simple type point unless I'm great
my own layout so that's what I do now I
need to apply the adapter to my spinner
I just got unit type spinner and set my
adapter
that is and then I give it unit type
spinner adapter there that is all setup
and that is how easy it is to take that
array and then put all those different
unit types inside of our spinner pretty
simple and then the final thing I'm
going to do in this part of the tutorial
is come in here and fix adlistener unit
type to spinner and then in the next one
I'll finish up everything so that's just
going to be public void again there we
go
it's not going to receive anything it's
basically just a utility little method
that we have here and I'm just going to
go unit type spinner equal to get a
access to this guy 5u by ID and it is r
dot ID dot unit type spinner there we go
and then I'm going to go unit type
spinner again set on item selected we're
gonna use the selected for our spinners
let me go new on item selected listener
and you can see it was nice enough to
generate everything for me and this is
going to handle everything whenever they
click or select anything in the spinner
first thing I'm going to do is get the
item that was selected item selected and
I'll call this in spinner because that
makes sense and to get it just go parent
dot get item and I'm going to rename
adapter view to parent so that just
makes a little bit more sense to me come
down here get item add position and then
I'm going to use this guy right here I
is going to be the selection inside of
our spinner change that to pause because
it makes more sense to me again and then
we're going to convert this to a string
another thing I'm going to want to do
here is I remember in the notes I said
check if I want to use base type in
regards to having the teaspoon be the
base type that we convert from an to and
I'm going to create this guy I'm going
to pass the item that was selected to it
and once again I'll show you that in the
next tutorial and then down here on
nothing selected we could come in here
and do something like to do and maybe
something here later ok guys so that's
all going to cover right now in the next
part of the tutorial I'll finish the
conversion amp totally please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
