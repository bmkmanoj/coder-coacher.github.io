my UML 2 video tutorial today I'm going
to show you component diagrams and
composite structures and go over all of
the pieces involved in using them as
well I'm going to answer some questions
that I've been receiving lately and this
is going to be a setup for what is to
come which is using component diagrams
and composite structures in pretty
elaborate examples so let's get into it
ok so where I am in Yuma let and this
guy is actually meaning this file is
going to be included in the link
underneath of this video because some of
you guys have told me you're having some
trouble creating these guys so they'll
be premade and ready for you components
which this is a component are used to
create reusable pieces of code
components are combined to create whole
programs and they perform operations
interact with classes and implement
interfaces
however components tend to perform more
complicated tasks than you normally
would with a regular class and like I
said here is a component and if you have
a component inside of a component you
can actually replace this word here
component with the word subclass but if
you don't want to you don't have to
now components must communicate through
interfaces so they must be loosely
coupled and easily swappable that's the
whole concept of a component and here
I'm going to show you 3 different ways
to show components and their interfaces
and how they connect with each other now
the interfaces and in this situation we
actually have two interfaces language in
and language out are going to describe
the service that is going to be offered
by that component or services required
interfaces which this is a required
interface is going to be one that is
needed for a component to function now
this is going to be a language
translator so if it doesn't have any
language input it is completely
worthless and required interfaces are
going to have this little half circle or
C shape on them provided interfaces
however are not going to need to be used
to make the component work however more
than likely in all situations it is go
to be something that you're going to
want to use like for example this guy's
going to take a string from one language
in on one side and shoot out a different
language on the right side and provided
interfaces are going to be designated
with a full circle now like I said there
are three main ways to create these and
this is the most common way here is
another way that you can do pretty much
exactly the same thing and the reason
why you would actually designate
everything like this versus like this
this is very compact where this is more
verbose is to be more verbose so for
example if you'd like to say which
specific method is going to be used with
this component for the most part well
you would designate that method right
here and if you want to create
components like this you would use what
are called dependency arrows if it's a
required interface or a realization
arrow if it is a provided interface
again required means it must be here or
the components worthless while a
provided interface is going to not be
required and the third way that you can
actually designate these guys is right
like this and this is the most compact
way and in this situation you would just
list it as a component with this little
shape up here that's important and then
you would list provided interfaces and
required interfaces and maybe what is
called an artifact or artifacts and what
these would be would be files databases
anything like that text files Excel data
sheets anything so anything that's an
actual file type or a way of gathering
information would be considered an
artifact so those are three different
ways to create components here is
another way that we can show components
attaching to each other previously we
didn't have components on the other side
of these interfaces and to show how they
connect we use assembly connectors and
as you can see this is a circle and this
is the half circle and we would point
with an arrow here to show in which
direction these components or the data
from this component is flowing into this
component and then
going over into this final component so
it's all pretty simple stuff remember
for the most part these are going to
need to be combinations of classes that
do something pretty baked and this is
just a nice easy global way to look at
your system and how it's created and how
it works together
now often components like I said before
are going to contain many different
classes and like before there's going to
be three different ways you can show
classes inside of your components now
this is going to represent a component
this box right here on your screen and
you can see the two interfaces there's
one there and there's the other
interface over here and an inside of
here inside of this component you're
going to document or show what classes
are going to exist inside of your
component and how they are going to
interact and these classes are known as
realizations sorry there's so much
jørgen involved in this but I figured I
throw all the jargon into one video now
just like before there is another way to
document these guys and this way
actually isn't used very much because
it's not very compact it doesn't provide
much more information but if you would
like to document the objects inside of
this component outside of the component
itself this is how you would do it and
then you have a pretty common way of
setting up components where we're going
to list provided interfaces required
interfaces there's the artifact again
and here are the realizations which are
the classes that are inside or make up
your component and then the final part
of using components is using what are
called ports and you can see a port here
and I actually have an arrow drawn
inside of it but they're not always
drawn as arrows inside of here sometimes
they're just simple squares and you're
going to create ports that have related
interfaces attached and you can even
give these ports different names outside
of just listing out the interface that
shoots out here so let's say I wanted to
actually shoot out in multiple different
languages so one language goes in and
one language would come out on the other
right side of the screen or multiple
different languages would come out on a
screen to document that would be quite
easy let's say that I wanted to mark
this as German out and this one as
Spanish out and then
actually give this a name for languages
out well that's exactly the way that I
would do it I would actually label this
port and give this port some information
in regards to what sort of output would
come out of it
which would be that it shoots out
different types of languages and then I
could name each individual interface
German out and Spanish out to document
that two separate languages would show
up in regards to output from this one
port and pretty much the only other
thing you need to know about component
diagrams is how to use what are called
delegation connectors and this is
extremely simple
all you're going to do is just show the
flow of the data through your component
so language in this it right here is
known as a delegation connector it's
going to connect to this object which
then maybe would break this string into
individual words and then shoot that
information out in German as well as
Spanish so these are known as delegation
connectors so there you are
that's pretty much every single thing
you could ever want to know about
component diagrams now just review
something that we talked about before
that has come up in a couple questions
sent to me these are relationship arrows
and I'm going to briefly go over and
provide an example of how they work now
this relationship arrow that you see up
here would be used in situations where
you have inheritance or if you're
writing java code you're using words
like implements or extends these arrows
are used when you have an is a
relationship between two created classes
or a situation where you would inherit a
situation where you would have a class
named animal and you have a subclass
named dog that is when you would see
these arrows then you would have a
dependency relationship arrow this arrow
would be used whenever you would want to
show that a class depends on something
but that something isn't a member of the
class for example a class that uses a
other object or a situation in which an
object is passed into another object
simply as an attribute of a method
that's used inside of there and then
discard it yes that class or that object
uses another object but it is no way
part of the object itself that is known
as a
pendens relationship and you would use
this arrow right here then you have
association relationships this is a
situation in which a class contains a
reference to another class or class
object if we go back to our previous
example this would be the situation
where a dog would have a specific breed
it has a breed this is an association
relationship a reference to another
object is contained inside of our object
and in that situation we would use that
arrow then you have an aggregation and
this is one of the things people have
gotten confused about but I'll clear it
up aggregations are situations where a
class is a container for other classes
but if the container itself is destroyed
the contained object is not situation
where we would have that is the sports
team now even though the sports team may
be destroyed that does not mean the
player itself or himself or herself
would be destroyed and that would be a
situation where you would have an
aggregation and that's when you would
use this relationship era and then
finally we have compositions and this
relationship era any composition occurs
when a class is a container for other
classes like here we have the window for
your program and if the container is
destroyed the contained object is also
destroyed now if we have a component
like we have in this situation that is
inside of a window that makes up the
whole of your program if the window is
destroyed definitely the component
inside the window would also be
destroyed and that is a composition
relationship so hopefully those examples
help clear things up because I've gotten
some questions about it and now let's
get into the simplistic composite
structures now the composite structure
is going to model how objects work
together sometimes whenever you find
yourself in a situation where a class
diagram is not particularly good it's
showing how different items in a class
are going to work together what we're
talking about here is product as a class
and these pieces here being parts of the
class and here we are going to show how
these different parts of our class are
going to work together and that is
whenever you would use a composite
structure
with a composite structure you're going
to draw items included through
composition inside of this big class
like here we have product description
picture user guides and the company name
and each one of these is going to be a
little bit different how they work it
either way like I just talked about
composition this is composition whenever
you have a container with other objects
inside of it so we're just going to pull
that back up there for a second and how
you're going to document these guys is
your first going to have the role name
so this is going to be a product
description and then you're going to
have the type for the specific object
that is saved inside of your project
class so product pic and picture which
is what it is attached file and user
guide company company name and string
and this guy's a little bit different so
we're going to talk about that last now
what you're going to do here whenever
you're creating these different parts of
your classes is you're actually going to
document the number of instances of
these specific objects and you're going
to write that in the upper right hand
corner for that object so in this
situation whenever we have a product
object that product we expect to only
have one description and the number of
instances of this object being the
description inside of the product class
is also going to be known as
multiplicity so one represents that
there's one instance and this represents
multiplicity then over here we can also
document that the number of instances is
not necessarily known so we could say
well with this specific product we may
have 1.3 1 2 3 pictures of said product
and that is exactly how you would do
that and you're also going to be able to
show relationships between parts of
these class objects by using what are
called connectors and whenever you're
using connectors you're going to put
numbers on both ends of the connector
like I have right here to designate how
many instances match up with other
instances so each description is going
to have one picture or you could
actually come in here and put 1.3 that
would actually make more sense because
this description in essence could have
more than one picture because of what we
designated up here and another thing you
can do whenever you are using
multiplicity and I'm going to use this
picture here as
example is you could actually put these
guys in brackets like this if you prefer
to use them that way
instead of putting them in the upper
right hand corner of the box like I did
just right there so that's another way
of designating multiplicity or the
number of instances of said object
inside of the class now these guys right
here meaning the description in picture
as well as the company name down here
are referred to as parts inside of
composite structures however there is
something else you can contain inside of
a class and those are known as
properties I know that's a little bit
confusing but just memorize it you'll
remember it and an example of a property
would be an attached file and these are
attached through what is called
Association and they may be used by
other classes so in this situation we
have a user guide it's only ever going
to make sense to have one user guide and
it's an outside file on top of that and
in that situation again just like we
talked about artifacts before and how
they are outside files very often in
situations where we have outside files
or references to outside data in those
situations we are going to call those
properties and they are going to be
inside of a box that is going to be
dashed then the final part of this guy
is what are called singular instances
now if this is a product catalog for a
said company chances are very very good
that there is only ever going to be one
company attached to every single product
everywhere no matter what as long as
they are a class of type product and in
that situation we are going to have what
is called a singular instance and this
is just a situation in which you have a
specific name that is going to be tied
into a constant value like we have here
with company company name what have you
in that situation this is going to be a
singular instance it isn't going to
change it's going to be something that's
shared by every product that you are
going to use product wide and then just
like before we're also going to have
ports with composite structures and
ports are going to connect your class to
other outside classes just like before
and also just like before these classes
are going to have
interfaces and also more than likely
there's going to be specific names for
each said port to designate what all of
the different interfaces are going to do
so in a situation we have our product
class customers are going to be able to
view these interfaces and these are a
little bit better name for interfaces
viewable and updatable and chances are
we're going to have multiple different
interfaces for the administrator and
probably more than likely for the
customer so customer name here is
actually going to be tied to this port
and it mens going to be tied to all of
the interfaces that come out of that
port and then the final thing you have
which are what are called collaborations
now what collaborations are going to do
for you is show how objects are going to
work together to accomplish said tasks
now whenever you're creating multiple
different objects they might not always
do the same thing their roles may change
so a collaboration is used to show
changing specific tasks that objects
will have through the use of your system
and participants inside of a
collaboration are also going to be
listed as role meaning products followed
by type and they're going to be linked
together with a connector and then
you're going to put in some information
in regards to what tasks is being done
or achieved through this collaboration
between the product and display object
which is to show the products to whoever
you want to show them to and the
alternative way to show collaborations
is this guy and this is the final part
of this now you know everything about
composite structures as well as
component diagrams here just like before
we're going to list show products which
is what the goal is or the tasks to
achieve whenever you put these two
objects together and then to provide a
little bit more information you're going
to provide the exact methods that are
going to be called meaning get product
information from the product class and
put product on screen so there is a
rundown of component diagrams composite
structures and some more information on
relationship arrows and what they mean
and how they were
hopefully that answers a lot of
questions I've been getting lately if
any other questions have come up please
leave them in the comment section below
otherwise
