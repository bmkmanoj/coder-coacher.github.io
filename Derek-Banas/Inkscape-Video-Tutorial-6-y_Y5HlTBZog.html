6 of my escape video tutorial in this
part of the tutorial we're going to
focus in 100% on the filter editor which
is one of the coolest tools that most
people don't know about and if you
haven't seen any of the previous parts
of this tutorial I provide a link in the
upper right hand corner and specifically
what we're going to focus in on are the
Gaussian blur the blend effects offset
merge turbulence color matrix composite
flood and diffuse as well as specular
lighting but you may be asking yourself
well why aren't you covering all of
these awesome filters well I actually
thought it would be a little bit tedious
to go through each and every one of
these filters so I provide a different
solution rather than doing that in a
link in the description what I did was I
went and actually used every single
filter so that you would be able to very
easily cycle through every potential
filter and instead decided to focus in
on the filter editor so that you'll be
able to create even more really cool
filters so let's take a look at that
alright so here we are inside of
Inkscape and to open up the filter
editor you just go to filters and go way
down here in the bottom and click on
filter editor whenever you do that this
guy over here is going to open up on our
screen if you want to create a new
filter you just go new and you're going
to see this little box open up here then
I'm briefly going to go through some
things that you need to know to use all
the different filters now if you want to
add an effect what you do is you just
cycle through whatever filters you want
to use or options to use inside of your
filter editor and I'm just going to
click on color matrix and then I'm going
to hit add effect and you're going to
see all of the different options for
color matrix pop up down here we're
going to look at those in a second but
what I want to focus in on first are
these guys up here because this is a
little bit confusing now basically what
the filter editor is going to allow you
to do is create custom filters using
what are called filter primitives and
you're going to be able to define what
parts of a graphic are going to be used
as input for your filter and you're
going to do that with this guy basically
you do as you click right here I'm not
sure if you can see this arrow or not
and then you're going to drag this out
to point to what you want to use as
input I'm going to briefly go through
what each and every one of these do
source graphic is just going to use the
graphic itself as input for the filter
source alpha you can turn your head on
its side a little bit here if you can't
see this this is flowing downwards
source alpha is going to use the
transparency of the graphic is input for
the filter background image is of course
going to use the area under the graphic
as input background alpha is going to
use the transparency of the area under
the graphic and then fill paint and
Stroke paint are a little bit quirky so
we're just going to ignore those for now
as you play around the Inkscape you're
going to find out more and more that
there are tons of different things that
don't quite work and in this situation
fill paint and Stroke paint don't work
but eventually I'm sure they will and
whenever they do what fill paint is
going to do is use the fill of the
target graphic as input and the stroke
paint is going to use the stroke of the
target graphic but before we can do any
of this stuff we have to make a little
bit of a fix to our Inkscape file you
want to use background image or
background alpha as inputs for our
filter what we're going to need to do is
we're going to have to find filter
editor example and make a couple little
changes to it inside of a text editor so
here is Inkscape filter editor and i'm
going to open this up in just a basic
text editor and this is really easy to
make this little fix you're going to
have to find the SVG
tag and it's way way at the top you're
going to have to come down here and put
inside enable - background equals new
there's a couple different ways to make
this show up inside of your file but
this is the easiest and that's all you
got to do you just have to type in this
line right here before Saudi potty
that's it and then you're done and
you're going to be able to use
background images and background alpha
as input for filters so after we save
that we're going to open it back up
inside of Inkscape and here we are back
inside of Inkscape now the Gaussian blur
which I'm sure you probably know what it
is I'm just going to draw a rectangle
inside of here it also not only can it
be opened up inside of here like you see
gauzy and blur there it is right there
you're also going to be able to find
in fill and stroke so let's just click
on this to open up film stroke there it
is and to keep everything nice and neat
I'm going to drag film stroke down here
and drop it inside of there and this is
an HD video by the way so if you can't
see what I'm doing just feel free to
view it full screen now with this guy
selected right here I'm then going to go
down and blur it and there you can see
the Gaussian blur and that's what
Gaussian blur basically does now also
we're gonna get back to gauzy and blur
later on because it does other cool
things let's open up the filter editor
first though oh another thing you're
going to see is whenever you do apply a
filter to one of your objects or
graphics or whatever you want to call
them it's also going to open up a filter
and show you exactly how that works
inside of the filter editor so that's
kind of cool
that you want to remove something you
just right click on and hit remove that
also applies here right click and remove
and it is gone now of course make sure
you make the change that I showed inside
of a text editor before you try to do
what I'm going to do right now but we're
going to take a look at another filter
which is called blends and to do so I'm
going to draw two rectangles click here
open rectangle and one of them is going
to be red so let's find red down here
and just click on red and then another
rectangle is going to be blue and I'm
choosing these colors because of an
effect that I want to show here and
there we have those and you can also
apply filters across layers and all
kinds of other different things now I'm
going to get rid of color matrix let's
remove that and go in here and I'm going
to add a new effect and that is going to
be blends there's blend and then blend
is going to allow us we have to hit add
effect first and there's blend right
there as you can see and basically what
I'm going to do is I'm going to blend
these two graphics that are on the
screen
with a special emphasis on the
background for the image so I want to
use the source graphic and the
background so I'm going to have to come
in here and drag this over to background
image and drop it right there and then
I'm going to be able to come down here
to this part and I'm going to be able to
change the modes now normal of course
isn't going to do anything while
multiply is going to take the top object
and filter out all of the light for the
object on
neath of it if I use multiply so I'm
going to click on multiply come up here
and then we of course have to put a
little check inside of this and now you
can see right here with the blue over
top of the red that where they cross
over each other that this is going to
turn black you're going to see similar
results let's say that we change this
red to a purple and let's change this
blue to a cyan and in that situation
you're going to see that whenever you
have the purple over top of the cyan
that it's going to filter out the red
and instead leave a plain blue inside of
it let's take a look at screen and
actually let's do something a little bit
cool here I'm going to get rid of both
of these rectangles like that
and I'm going to open up and creates
three ellipses there's one ellipse or
circles or whatever you want to call
them and there's another one and then
I'm going to draw another one underneath
of it and let's move this down here and
this guy is going to be red this guy's
going to be blue and this guy is going
to be green and there we go have all
those selected and if we click on filter
you're going to see they all overlay and
they create black everywhere that they
overlap whatever if I come down here and
click on screen you're going to be able
to see all of the different ways that
these different colors interact with
each other can also come in here click
on darken again every where they overlap
it's going to be black and then lighten
and you're basically going to get a
similar result to what you see with
screen so let's get rid of all those
circles and let's take a look at how we
can do something kind of cool which is
to create a drop shadow sort of effect
with the filter editor so I'm going to
remove that again I'm going to come in
here and I'm gonna create myself some
text so let's just say that we go hello
and let's make this a grey color doesn't
really matter just did that just to
create a grey color okay so there we got
it now if I want to create a drop shadow
what we're going to need is sort of a
blur type effect on our text because
it's supposed to simulate a shadow so
what I'm going to do is have that
selected come over here to add effect
and I'm going to come down here to
gaussian blur just
prove that you can use Gaussian blur in
multiple different ways and I'm going to
add that effect and then let's say that
I come down here and change this to
about six somewhere in that vicinity
five point nine is close enough and of
course apply the filter and there you
can see that it blurred I can also come
in here instead of calling this filter I
can call this Gaussian blur or drop
shadow maybe drop shadow makes more
sense because that's what it is okay so
there it is and now it has a nice name
I'm then going to come in here for the
Gaussian blur and drag this over to
source alpha so that our blur is
actually black because that makes more
sense and then of course since this is
going to be a drop shadow we're going to
have the shadow part offset from where
the normal text is and we can use
another effect down here which is offset
there's offset and click on that and hit
add effect and you can see that offset
is right here and it's linked to the
Gaussian blur which is good and then I'm
going to come in here and just change
how it offsets so let's just put it in
seven point eight I don't know I'm just
dragging them around there we go eight
point seven that works as well and then
if I also want to show the original text
as well as the drop shadow on there
that's quite easy I just go in to add
effect again and I'm going to merge
these two different graphics being the
unedited version as well as the edited
version so click on merge and I'm gonna
hit out effect again and you can see it
shows up right there and then inside of
merge I'm just going to connect this to
offset and then connect over to the
source graphic like that and now you can
see that the text shows up and let's
come in here click on this so that shows
up a little bit better and there you can
see it says hello in the red letters and
there is a drop shadow over there and if
we don't like the offset of course we
come in here click on offset come in
here and increase it whatever you want
it to be and there you can see it moved
again so that's a cool way of using a
bunch of different filters to create a
drop shadow another thing that is kind
of cool or another filter that's kind of
cool is turbulence and what turbulence
is used to do is to create or simulate
clouds fire smoke granite a whole bunch
of different things
so what we're going
to do is just click on this and then go
down in turbulence and you can see an
example of it right there and hit a
defect I'm just going to do something
real quick we're just going to create a
rectangle and let's say that I want to
make it gray and then I'm going to go in
and blur this guy so I'll click on that
actually let's remove turbulence first
remove this and let's do a gauzy and
blur first so click on that and add
effect and let's take this up to 6 on
this just using 6 as an arbitrary sort
of thing as you can say 6.2 and click on
that and there you can see that it
blurred a little bit then I'm going to
come in again add effect and this time I
am going to add turbulence there's
turbulence and I'm a hit out effect and
there you can see that it created all
sorts of craziness on the screen now
there are tons of little different
sliders on all of these different
filters and I'm going to briefly go
through exactly what all these guys do
now first off you have base frequency
and basically what it's going to do is
the higher it gets the smaller the
textures that are going to get so let's
just increase that and you can see there
they are and as I increase them you're
going to see that the textures are
indeed getting smaller and if I bring
them back down you're going to see that
they get bigger octaves which is right
here the higher it gets the sharper or
more uneven or little squiggle they're
going to get here on our screen as you
can see and maybe I'll click on this and
make it as big as the whole entire
screen I crash my whole entire video but
there's a lot of math going on here
seed is just going to change the random
number that's going to be generated to
create our funky little filter as you
can see right there and then of course
there is the option to either use
turbulence which is going to create sort
of a squiggly line type of look or to
use fractal noise which is going to
create a cloud type of look as you can
see right there and as we continue with
this tutorial bunch of other different
ways of using turbulence but as you can
see it sort of provides different ways
to create more organic sort of looks for
your design and we're going to delete
that so that it doesn't cry
and then we're going to take a look at
color matrix after we delete all these
other different filters so let's come
down here and click on add effect and
then click on color matrix right there
and then click on add effect and there
is color matrix now this guy confuses a
lot of people but I'm going to go
through here and explain it and
hopefully it makes a lot of sense
basically what color matrix allows you
to do is change the colors of an image
by manipulating numbers in this 5 by 4
matrix that you see here on the screen
and here is another representation of it
now as you can see right here basically
the first row is going to determine how
the Reds in the image are going to be
affected the second row is going to
determine how the Greens how the Blues
in the third row and how the Alpha is
going to be affected for said image and
whenever I'm talking about images I'm
referring to actual pictures not objects
drawn inside of Inkscape and then again
each column is also going to represent
the color red the color green the color
blue and alpha or transparency and
basically the way this is going to work
is if we take the first three numbers
for the red row for example and then add
the last number in this situation it's a
zero but this can be a number as well
what we're going to do is be able to
determine how much or how we are going
to affect the red in our image so for
example since we only have a 1 right
here in this specific column in our red
row and we have a whole bunch of zeros
right here what we're basically saying
with the color matrix is that we do not
want to affect or enhance the red for
our image if however if all of these
numbers right here are increased over
the value of 1 that is going to
intensify the red of our image while if
this does not equal 1 or it equals
negative 1 for example that is going to
decrease the red in our image so let's
take a look at an example and clear all
this up all right so let's import
image import and let's go and import an
image and there you can see there is a
picture of my baby at the beach so let's
go in here to the color matrix and like
I said if it's equal to one that means
it's not going to affect the Reds at all
however let's say I click down here and
change this to 0.5
that's going to be a number over 1 so
that is going to intensify the Reds in
order our image and then of course let's
click up here inside of the filter and
you're going to see that since now it's
equal to 1.5 that the Reds have been
intensified inside of our image we can
of course also intensify the greens
right here let's change this to 0.5 as
well as the Blues let's change this to
0.5 and there you can see and because
we're increasing both the red green and
blue of course those things combined
equal white and hence the color is
getting brighter and brighter and
brighter
a couple other funky things you can do
inside of here let's change this guy
right here to a 1 change this to a 1 and
change this to a 1 and you can see the
image over here is disappearing and you
can also see exactly how we could go in
and make pretty dramatic changes now
since this is all equal to 2 you can see
the image is completely white now if
however I go in and change this to a
negative 1 and change this to a negative
1 and change this to a negative 1 you're
going to see that very quickly just by
changing a couple numbers inside of the
color matrix that I created a negative
of the image that's on the screen
I could also SAP out all of the color
altogether let's come in here let's say
that I wanted to make a black and white
negative for some strange reason let's
change this to 0 change this to 0 and
then change this to negative 1 and this
to negative 1 and now you're going to
see that I have a black and white
negative so there are literally probably
millions of ways to change colors using
color matrix but that's sort of a brief
sort of run through and basically it
just comes down to the idea of if you
want to intensify the Reds you make
changes here you want to intensify it
make sure that all these numbers when
they are added up they're greater than 1
you want to change the Greens make sure
this
is greater than one you wanted to
increase the Blues make sure this is
greater than one and of course you can
also make changes to alpha and you can
also of course make it less than one to
take the red green blue or alpha out of
the image we're going to see more
examples of matrix as the tutorial
continues but as you can see there's
numerous different ways to mess around
with different colors using color matrix
so let's get rid of that and let's jump
into our next effect which is going to
be composite now basically what
composite is going to do for us is allow
us to apply logical operations to images
or to graphics on the screen one thing
that's a little bit strange however is
that the output for this filter is going
to be composited over the original and
there's a workaround with that and we're
going to use something called flood as
well as merge two other filters that we
haven't taken a look at yet but
basically we're going to use those other
two filters with composite to make the
original disappear so that only the
actual filter is going to show on our
screen and how we're going to do that is
we're going to click add effect for
composite and then we're going to come
in here and we're going to be applying
this on the source as well as the
background so go and drag this guy over
there and drop it on there we are then
going to call for flood which is just
going to flood a white sort of image
between the original and the new filter
just come down here click on flood click
on add effect and then we're going to
come down here and like I said we want
it to disappear so we're going to click
on this guy for the flood color and then
we're going to come down here and make
sure that this is white which it is and
hit OK and we're going to be making
these changes on two rectangles again
just to keep everything simple and let's
say that this first one is red and let's
say that the second one is blue and
there they are
and then we're going to need to do is
merge our composite with our floods so
that means we're going to need a filter
down here called merge click on that get
out of fact and then we're going to drag
this up here and point that towards the
flood and
and we're going to drag this second one
up here and point it towards our
composite and now that we have it all
set up we're going to be able to come in
here to composite and actually
demonstrate exactly how these work let's
highlight this click on that and then
I'm going to cycle through a default of
course is going to do nothing in is just
going to show exactly where these two
objects intersect as you can see right
there out is going to show everything
except where they intersect and what I
mean I'm basically just clicking on this
see there's in and out a top is going to
also show where they intersect
exclusive-or is going to show everything
except where they intersect as well and
then arithmetic is extremely cool
basically what it's going to allow us to
do is define what shows based off of how
we change the sliders down here in
regards to our two graphics on the
screen and I'm just going to leave that
the way it is and get more into that
here in a second to show you a really
really cool effect and basically I'm
going to show you that I getting rid of
this and I'm going to show you how to do
really really cool lighting effects and
basically the lighting effects are just
going to be used just as you would think
they're just going to make things look
more 3d so we're just going to put a
star here on our screen and just give it
a weird sort of funky color and enlarge
it so I'm positive you're going to be
able to see it and basically what you
need to do whenever you are using
different lighting effects is you need
to generate what are called height maps
and basically what a height map is going
to be used for is to simulate a 3d type
effect on your screen and basically the
transparent part of the height map is
going to be the lowest level while the
most opaque is going to be the highest
level and I'll just demonstrate it
because it is a lot easier to understand
whenever we do this we're going to use a
Gaussian blur in this situation to
generate our height map so let's just
come in here and go Gaussian blur and
hit add effect and I'm going to take the
Gaussian blur up to six because it like
26.2 whatever as you can see right there
then I'm going to use the diffuse
lighting lighting effect click on that
hit
out of fact and you're going to see that
it put a great big giant black square on
the screen but we're going to handle
that in a second then going to come in
here to all of these different options
that we have available I'm going to
change my light source to distant light
in this situation and it's exactly what
it sounds like it's going to simulate a
light that's in the distance then with
surface I'm going to be able to define
the height of my peaks and let's say
that I want this to be I don't know ten
point five and also come in here you
don't have to use the sliders of course
constant is going to be the strength of
the light so let's just say that we want
this to be two and I'm just going to go
in here and put two light source of
course like I said before colonel unit
length doesn't really work right so
don't worry about that and then azmuth
is going to define the direction or
angle for our light source on an XY sort
of plane I'm going to change this to 220
and in elevation of course is going to
define the direction of our light on the
Y Z plane so let's change that to 25 and
then you can see that the lighting is
sorting the show however because we have
two different things going on on our
screen at the same time we have to block
out this top filter and only show what
we want to show and that is where
composite is going to come in remember I
said we're going to use composite again
so let's go in here to add effect and
we're also of course going to be using
arithmetic which I referred to before
click on composite hit add effect and
there you can see now it's starting to
look a little bit more like what we want
it to look like the composite the first
one is going to point at my diffuse
light just as it is and then the second
arrow is going to point to our source
graphic just like that
then we're going to be able to do come
down here click on arithmetic and you're
going to see Y rithmetic is really cool
now what I'm going to be able to do
inside of this with the arithmetic is to
enhance and define that I want to show
only parts of the different graphics so
of course what I want to do is only show
the highlighted part for the diffused
light on top of my original star now how
I'm going to do this is come down inside
of here and if you actually drift your
mouse over top of these it's going to
show you the funky sort of formula it's
going to be used but I'm going to try to
simplify exactly what's going on here
now
hey one is going to intensify both the
first graphic as well as the second new
filter that I have on the screen so in
most situations
I'm not going to want to play around
with this slider whenever I'm trying to
lessen the intensity of the filter over
the original graphic that I'm working
with inside of here so what I'm going to
do first is jump down into k2 which is
going to allow me to play around with
the first input color now I don't really
want to do anything to the original
graphic so I'm going to leave that is
zero and then I'm going to take a look
at k3 which is going to allow me to
change the filter that is on top so
let's zoom out and I'm going to play
around with this filter that I have down
here and as you can see as I am moving
it up it is showing more and more of the
original graphic here on our screen
let's zoom in here and let's change this
to 0.6 and there you can see is the
original graphic now if I want to
intensify them all together I come in
here to this guy right here and let's
say that I just increase this to 1 and
see what happens boom now you can see
3ds star and of course I can come in
here then and jump into diffused light
and change the surface scale or I can
change this azmuth and play around and
make it look more or less 3d so of
course to really learn this stuff you're
going to have to go in and play around
with it and I'm very very quickly going
to shoot in here and show you what
specular lighting does which is
basically the same type of thing so
let's just come in here let's remove
this the difference between diffuse
light is it's used for more matte
surfaces like bricks or paper or
whatever and simulating 3d on them
specular lighting on the other hand is
going to create more of a rubbery type
of look so I'm going to use the same
star just like I used before
I'm very quickly going to go through
here and do this again so a defect in
this situation I'm going to go Gaussian
blur there we go add effect change this
to 6 so I throw a gauzy and blur inside
of they're going to come inside and I'm
going to do specular lighting like I
said it's going to create a rubber
texture click
fact there that is I'm then going to
come down here to surface scale I'm
going to change this to ten I'm going to
change my constant to two exponent which
is a brand new one this is going to
define how shiny it's going to be I'm
going to change that to 25 I'm going to
also use distant light you can check out
point light and also spotlight on your
own just for fun colonel unit remember
doesn't do anything azmuth I'm going to
change this to 230 like I said before
it's going to define the direction or
angle of our light source on an XY plane
in elevation I'm going to change this to
45 and once again that's going to define
on the Z plane and there you can see
start to show up anytime you see this
and you're like hey wait a minute it's
not showing exactly what I want what's
that mean that means we need composite
come in here click on composite which is
right there come down here and hit out
of fact there we go in this situation
we're going to grab this point to my
source instead and then the second one
I'm going to leave that be pointing to
the specular lighting and there you can
see it start to look a little bit more
like what I want I'm going to come down
here and go to arithmetic to define what
I want to show and what I don't want to
show out of there and in this situation
I'm going to change this to 1 and change
this to 1 and there you can see it has
sort of a rubberized type of texture
however it's still showing this gray
back here and I don't like that so what
I'm going to do again is I'm going to
use composite and get rid of that gray
so add effect I'm going to click add
effect again and then in this situation
whenever you're trying to get rid of the
weird effects of the filter you're going
to have the first one be pointing
towards the very last thing in the list
and then this arrow is going to be
pointing towards the surface or the
source and then with a special composite
I'm not going to use arithmetic but I'm
instead going to use in and what n is
going to do is show the parts of the top
that are in the bottom image and now you
can say there is my 3d rubberised star
so that was a whole bunch of different
things you can do with a filter editor
inside of Inkscape please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
