another live stream thank you for
joining me you are my true fans
everybody else is just a poser and I am
very happy for you to join me here
tonight we're gonna be playing blackjack
on Resident Evil and and I don't I I'm
actually kind of excited about this I'm
hoping that the odds are somewhat real
but all I know about it is in playing
blackjack and you know I'm going to jump
right into it and we'll see I'm gonna
play blackjack the way you're supposed
to play blackjack at least the way I
know how to play it and we will see if
the rules of the game are cool and let's
see here just checking out dot dot dot
well you will be a blackjack expert at
the end of this at least you'll know as
much about black jackets I know so uh
just trying to readjust this get this
song get this on get this on you know
how professional I am alright let's play
blackjack and I just started it very
very beginning as you can see I didn't
get any rewards or anything just so that
I could guarantee it was gonna work or
at least hope that it works it says now
Lucas's prisoner Clancy's only choice is
to play a sick card game we're winning
means matching your opponent's suffer a
little bit that let's start over now
Lucas prisoner now can I read that's for
now Lucas is prisoner clear above
whatever Clancy's being held prisoner
and forced to play blackjack at extreme
odds
oh and I guess we'll find out what where
am I oh this isn't BR but I'm aware of
the headset anyway oh yeah it is we are
cool hey do you have what it takes so
you two I'll go wailling away with wings
is to walk on out of here lies s'okay
things you all right because it's laughs
oh I like Lucas
alright so we got 10 so I'm definitely
hitting on 10 how do i what are the
controls I suppose they're gonna show me
something here what what do you think
uh-huh 21 secondly great gonna lose a
finger if I get this wrong oops how to
play it all right let's do this this is
fun well you know I'm hitting on you
know how do I hit not telling me
anything about the controls I'm trying
to do something here I'm hitting buttons
all wrong Clancy okay keep current hand
draw a card so i want to draw hate me
all right more than likely I'm gonna
stay no you share the same deck
huh well normally I would hit on a 16
and they're showing a 7 I would normally
hit so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
play the way you're supposed to play
blackjack and I'm gonna hit at least as
far as I know yeah 716 yeah 17 okay so
yeah that's how you play blackjack let's
see if the plane by the odds is gonna do
good for me here hate me no it is not so
I'm losing a finger of course you will
all right so not good what now huh you
cannot draw cards while bust okay so
what's up it's gonna happen here oh how
about no stay yeah why lost I know I
lost ok so I would have lost anyway so
whatever I would have had a 16-0 ah not
good
alright so we played the odds we would
have lost either way what can you do
alright so I got a 17 he got a 2 i'm
definitely not going to hit I'm
definitely not hitting on this I'm gonna
stay you better believe it he's over
well maybe not he's not I'm staying I
say eight yeah either way I'm staying at
raw does that mean I lose fingers or I
don't lose fingers ah oh good god
well I'm playing the odds but I'm losing
whatever that's all you could do okay so
this is my last chance I got an 18 I'm
staying I'm gonna stay if he has a 19
I'm gonna lose my mind hey I get to keep
my fingers oh he loses the whole game
he's losing all his fingers oh not nice
i'm not exactly going nite great i got
two fingers but and that's it that's the
game or not kind of guessing there's
more to this right let's see here i
don't think that's man he's still moving
so we putting the other hand into the
game all right
ok so here we go again boy all right
let's go play our odds and hopefully we
survive this thing all right let's go
for it what on earth is this two of your
opponents bet increases by 2 while this
card is on the table oak I draw the six
card if it is no longer in the deck
nothing happens ok and he gets two bonus
cards should I play the two up card and
increase his bet by two I guess alright
so I have a 20 there ain't no way I'm
moving from that I'm staying I'm gonna
stay you better believe it
not looking good for you dude I'm gonna
stay your opponent's batting crease is
by two of us cards on the table
obviously yes I'll Stiles Thursday yeah
baby okay I get any special cards return
the last face up card your opponent drew
to the deck okay oh I got a 12 he's
showing 11 so that means i am going to
hit what's this to up your opponents but
increases by two others cards on the
table I don't even understand what that
did last time okay i'm i am gonna hit
definitely
I'm going me okay so I got 14 and he's
shown an 11 that much that means that i
have to go again yes hate me yeah can I
do the I guess I can't do it now all
right whatever I'm gonna stay obviously
I got 21 I am see come on yeah baby
sorry Hoffman I'm doing good all right
what's that return the last face up card
blah blah blah blah and I got a six I'm
definitely hitting hate me and I got a
nine it up oh what's that draw the four
card if it's no longer the duck ever
ever ever ever I don't care I'm
definitely getting obviously
hit me hit me what was that draw the
five card that would give me out 14 oh
it's not in the deck they said there's
only 15 so that's worthless I don't know
all right I got 17 and he is showing
that so I'm going to stay he you said he
was gonna stay with a little bit of
force there but playing the odds I have
a feeling I'm getting shot yeah I know
good boy what can you do all right let's
keep playing the odds I know why Hoffman
as a bag on his head what's that we're
turning the last face up card you drew
to the deck okay I'm definitely hitting
my turn I'm definitely going hate me 20
definitely staying is this well
where is the okay up his bat and um I'm
gonna stay I'm gonna stay yeah baby oh
well that sucks hate me mara what I got
here I get a 17 he's showing a 70 that
mean oh he had to have gone over I'm
definitely staying I'm gonna stay Clancy
yeah baby oh hmm Hoffman is looking bad
for we're here
all right what's that draw the four card
okay all right so do I got I got a 16
he's showing a three that means I am I
should i think i should only hit if he's
showing a seven so i am gonna stay yeah
I'll stay I'm gonna stay off ins not
doing too good he's showing and I got a
16 and he's showing an eight nine ten
eleven so that means i should hit let's
see what these things are oh wait a
minute what's that say draw the four
card if it's no longer oh I can get the
four card and go up to 20 oh I can draw
the five card and go up to 21 we'll do
that as long as he doesn't have a 5 but
if I don't get a 5 then I know what he
has right it's not a deck so that means
he has a 16 and I have a 16 so that
means i want to draw the four card yeah
i met has to be in the DECA oh no I'm
stupid well either way night doesn't
matter I didn't realize the five guard
was what I had hey whatever I make
mistakes so I got a 20 there's anything
else I want to play no I'm gonna stay
I'm gonna stay sorry Hoffman I think
you're done for
I'm gonna stay we'll find out what ah
this is not good for Clancy oldest I
mean I die oh I died internet that was
very disheartening any you guys still
out there watching so what do you think
uh what are you gonna do what are you
guys are asking me here did what
software do you use to display both you
and the screen yeah I have a green
screen and i use a i made a video about
all this it's on my channel i have a
green screen and i'm using an
application called game show and i'm
using a mage well USB HDMI capture thing
I show it all in the video that's it's
in my on my channel and the I tried the
elgato I tried all these other things on
max anyway they don't work so the the
mage well is like plug-and-play works
absolutely seamlessly so yeah I would
definitely and obviously I'm not
sponsored to say any of this no one
sponsors me I'm a nobody on YouTube you
guys all should know that if you don't
know that um yeah stay away from Vegas I
played the odds as far as i know that's
how you play blackjack that's always
what I saw so
if you guys have any other questions
feel free to shoot them at me I'm
looking at the comments I'm not going to
play again I played blackjack the way
you're supposed to plate or at least as
far as I know how you're supposed to
play it and I lost so there's no point
in playing it from the beginning I'll I
didn't memorize what he got and all that
so whatever it was fun to try I wish
they would have stuck to the regular
odds and had you win if you've got the
odds so what do you got yeah I guess I
should have used the trump cards more
kind of ignored those until the very end
and then I it didn't hurt me but I made
that stupid error about the five and
whatever you know it was fun to try it
no uh no live stream tomorrow i have to
go to disney on ice so i'm not going to
be able to do a live stream a very sad
to have to say that and i'm out of the
play area anything else you guys want to
hear i am going to play horizon zero
dark is that what it's called I don't
know I'll play it on release day and the
new greatest ps4 game ever made in the
history of man is coming out and that
data and guess that's it you guys don't
have any other questions so just like
always please leave your questions and
your comments below and otherwise till
