4 of my SQL statements tutorial where
I'll explain everything there is to know
about SQL today we're going to call
cover the following statements the alter
change modify as well as go through all
the numeric functions and string
functions available to you in SQL
what do you do if you want to add a new
column to your table you probably
guessed it has something to do with the
alter statement and you're right let's
say you want to add a column to your US
presidents database for the president's
wives this is exactly how you do it you
started off with the alter statement
followed by the name of your table then
you would put this statement add column
followed by the variable name you want
to assign to that column you want to of
course assign a variable type in this
case I'm using variable characters and
I'm defining an amount of 15 and I'm
also saying that this column doesn't
necessarily need a value by putting the
null statement in there and if you want
to place the wife value in the table
after the value last name you would just
end this whole entire statement with the
statement after followed by last name
you can use the SQL statements first
second before last in way similar to the
after statement as well you can also use
alter to change the name for a column or
table as you can see here I am changing
the column wife to white first-name
that's how easy it is the alter
statement can also change the datatype
for a column with the addition of the
modify statement here you can see I'm
using the alter table statement followed
by the modify column and in this case
I'm going to go in there and change the
type of variable that it's accepted for
this column finally alter can delete
columns from a table with some help from
the drop statement here using the order
table defining that I'm going to be
altering the US president's table and
that I plan on dropping the column that
I just created named white first name
there are many built-in numeric
functions in SQL I'm gonna go through
most of the most often used first you
have abs which will return the absolute
number of the variable that you assign
then there are a whole bunch of
trigonometric functions there used to
relate angles of a triangle the links to
the side of a triangle if you know what
this is great you know how to use them
if you don't don't worry about it and we
have average which would return the
average of all values in a column and
you can see here's an example of how to
do that ceiling returns the smallest
number not less than X count returns the
number of non null values in the column
you can see an example how that's used
if you want to hit pause degrees returns
the value of x converted from radians to
degrees the next returns an exponent
then we have with floor which returns
the largest number not greater than X
then we have log which returns a
national logarithm of X and then we'll
return the logarithm of X to the base 10
again if you don't know what these
functions are don't worry about it we
have the maximum value which returns the
maximum value in the column and then we
also have the minimum which returns the
minimum value in the column you can use
the mod to return the remainder of a
division between x and y and we even
have a function that will will return
the value of pi' here we can perform
power functions on different values we
can return the value of x converted from
degrees to radians we can generate
random numbers between the value is zero
point zero to one point zero you want to
make those random numbers bigger you
would just multiply the value that's
returned you can also return the value
of x rounded to a decimal place that you
define you can use this to find a square
root you can also find a function here
to find standard deviation you can get
the sum of all values in a column quite
simply and truncate returns the value of
x truncated to whatever decimal place
there are also numerous built-in string
functions first you have concat which
returns a single string made up by
combining all strings sent to it insert
takes the two strings and combines them
based on the value of whatever you set
for the variable POS and LAN the
variable POS is where you want to start
entering the value of the second string
and le n equals the length of a string
want to overwrite here's an example
we're using the insert function we're
sending falling star in the value one
and six followed by the string super if
you ran this function you would be
provided with the result of super star
then we have another function here that
converts the strings to lowercase left
returns the number of characters defined
by length starting at the left of the
string you can see an example here where
we are going to delete cow from this
string then we've with the length
function you'll return the length of a
string locate returns the location of
the first occurrence of the substring in
the string here you can see I'm looking
for the first occurrence of key within
monkey it returns the number four
because that's the fourth character
replace replaces all current is in the
string of the string variable named
replaced with the value of variable
replacing here what we're going to do is
replace super in the string super dooper
and replace the word super with the word
major reverse reverses the characters in
a string and write is very similar to
left trim trims trailing characters that
you define from the string that's
probably here to look at the example I
have here I'm going to trim off the
stars in the string ace that has a star
in front and a star in back and you can
see right here would return the value
simply of ace you case returns string an
uppercase format and that is all I'm
covering in part four of my SQL
statements tutorial hope you enjoyed it
next time we're going to talk about
atomic data normalized at our primary
and foreign keys till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
