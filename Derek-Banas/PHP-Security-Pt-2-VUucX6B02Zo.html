2 of my PHP security series this series
by the way is brought to you by the guy
up here in the upper right hand corner
that's on link to his channel thank you
to him for requesting this tutorial here
we're going to continue fighting SQL
injection code injection and I'm also
going to show you how to make your user
activate their account with a valid
email address first what I'm going to do
here however is this is really about
blocking SQL injection is I'm going to
show you the query that I am going to be
inserting if you remember from the last
tutorial I showed you how to use regular
expressions to strip out any potential
malicious code and how to use strip
slashes to unquote quoted strings and
this also helps you fight against code
injection I'm going to show you exactly
how SQL injection can be used to do all
kinds of random nasty things to
databases and of course you would never
want to do this on any site that you did
not own because that is quite illegal
and you could get in a lot of trouble
because it's very easy to figure out
what IP addresses are attacking a
database so let's say here is my query
and here actually I do another thing
that helps in security so after I gather
all the information from the form I'm
actually going to pass all of this
information that was sent to me through
the form in a different order than the
user entered the information and why I'm
doing that is I'm trying to make it hard
for them to figure out what is the last
value that is going to be placed inside
of this query if that didn't make sense
it will in a second so plugging in all
the information they sent to me all this
information has been scrubbed using
regular expressions and numerous other
different functions that I showed you in
the previous tutorial and sha is used to
encrypt the password before it even gets
to me you always want to do that you
never want to store the real name for a
password in your database the function
now is used to get an exact time
whenever this account was registered and
I use obscure names so that it is also
harder to figure out exactly what I'm
doing okay so there is your query now if
the user actually registered let's take
a look at what this actually looks like
on the registration
where they're going to be entering the
information whenever a person or a
hacker would be trying to use SQL
injection they are going to guess and
this whole set kind of confounds them
they're going to guess that the last
value that was entered in the form is
going to end the query hence they would
then put their SQL injection code
directly at the end of password well
this sort of confounds them as well
because I have code that checks that the
value that is stored here is also stored
there but to confound them even further
yet I do not have the last valued
entered set as password but instead I
have it set for the phone number which
is right up here so if we jump back you
can see right there the phone number is
the last value that goes into the query
now why this is important is as you can
see here I'm checking whether the value
entered matches the regular expression
now let's say I don't do this which a
lot of people surprisingly do not and
instead for phone number which is what I
ultimately want to protect if I'm trying
to protect against SQL injection I just
come in here and go equals underscore
post so I assign the value of two
telephone number equal to whatever they
entered here well this is how SQL
injection works if the hacker can figure
out what is the last value that is going
to be entered in the actual query what
they can do is take these values right
here and copy them to the end of the
telephone number and then insert their
own queries and this is exactly how you
would do that so they would come in here
and for the value of telephone number
they would actually input quote and
close off the end of that query and then
insert any of their own queries
afterwards so let's say they wanted to
delete a user based off of the user ID
being equal to nine or they could delete
the whole table or they could delete the
whole database or they could do pretty
much anything they'd want to do and
that's basically what they would do they
would take this right here and in the
registration box where there's telephone
number they would type in and then
in their query that they wanted to
delete but I also put additional added
security on top of that so it just keeps
on going on and on and on so you
definitely want to use regular
expressions to make sure that this code
is all valid just like I show you right
here and I showed you in the previous
tutorial exactly how this regular
expression works this is checking to
make sure it's a valid telephone number
and then here as I showed you in the
previous tutorial is where we're going
to check that the password has at least
one capital whether one a lowercase
letter and one number and then if it
does we also want to check that the
value that is passed in password 1 is
equal to the other one see there's just
multiple different layers of security it
just never really ends so here we're
going to check the password 1 is equal
to the value passed in password 2 and if
it is again you want to make sure that
you escape out any dangerous information
that is passed in this guy I'm just
going to copy and paste this in right
here so this also makes it very hard to
slip in a password or any SQL injection
the person would want to send to you and
also it's probably a good idea to come
in here and if any of these things do
start to occur that you would actually
have a log that you would be able to log
potential attacks based off of anything
that you would have set up in here ok so
there's all the information and all this
code by the way is available in a link
that I have in the underbar so there we
were checking out the password and again
doing the same things that we went over
previously now what I'm going to do is
come down here and check that a value
has been inserted for every single one
of these guys so put an if statement in
here if N and N and E and all of the
rest of them so we're basically checking
to make sure that every single value
that has been entered is valid then what
you want to do is make sure that the
email address that they entered is valid
and we're going to issue a query here to
make sure that is true and that's
exactly what we're doing with this query
as we're coming in here and checking to
see if there are any current user IDs
set up that use the email that has
already been set here and also point I'm
going to point out here that I always
use the MySQL query function whenever I
want to run my queries because this only
allows me to send one query at a time
again that also keeps it very hard for
the hacker to be able to come in there
and inject an additional query at the
end because - ql query the function
doesn't allow you to do it so there's
another way to block that code or air
and here what we're doing is inserting
an if statement MySQL num rows what this
method does is it returns the number of
rows that were affected by the last
query that you sent so if you're coming
in here and you are running this query
to see if this email address matches any
other user IDs and the results come back
as 0 that means that the email address
is not taken so it's possible to create
a new account because the previous email
address wasn't taken then what we need
to do is to jump in here and create
ourselves an activation code this is
going to be a really crazy random number
generator we're using md5 and I'm just
going to put all these in here we're
actually layering multiple different
random number generators all at one time
here I'm going to type them all out then
explain what they do alright so what we
have here is the ran function that's
going to create a random number for us
then we're going to use that random
number created by this guy then we're
going to send it to the unique ID method
and if I didn't have true in here this
would generate a random number that is
13 characters in length but since I put
true in here it's going to generate a
random number that's 23 digits and
length and then on top of that and then
this is based off of the current time in
milliseconds whenever this function is
called then we're going to take that
random number and we're going to send it
to this function md5 which is going to
create another random string that is 32
characters in length and this is going
to be used as our activation code then
we have down here the query that I
created earlier which is going to insert
all this information into the database
and just in case you're wondering the
function that allows you to insert
multiple queries at once which I would
never use is called multi query you can
actually send multiple queries all at
one time
and that function is a
and available for SQL injection so do
not use it even though it might save you
some time
just as a double check here with result
we're going to run this minus QL query
or trigger here and of course you could
put in better errors than what I'm
typing in here I'm just typing these in
just to keep them as short as possible
and then after you run this query you
want to double check that only one row
was affected by this query and I
definitely would log if more than one
query occurred maybe there's some way
around this that I don't know well but
either way it doesn't matter if there is
or there isn't the whole idea is just to
make it as hard as possible to confound
people and if you do that they're going
to give up and go after an easier server
to attack or an easier web application
to attack so here only one row was
affected which is only one row should
have been affected so we're going to
consider this to be a positive and now
what we're going to do is create the
body for the email message we were going
to send activate account by clicking
this link throw a break statement in
there then we're going to use my SQL
insert ID to retrieve the value of the
last Auto incremented ID which is going
to be equal to this query that you just
performed and we're going to attach this
link for me it's going to be localhost
but for you it's going to be something
else
activate dot PHP and I'll show you what
this guy does late a later date or the
next tutorial equals two so we're going
to use my SQL insert ID and then we're
going to attach our random activation
code to the end of it Y is equal to the
value of the activation code that we
just created that random number and then
we're going to call a mail function and
we're going to supply the email address
that they provided and we're going to
give them a subject that's going to make
sense here and then we're going to
insert into the body of the statement
what we just created here above from and
there's my email address then to skip
ahead over a lot of the HTML we're going
to echo out the screen thank you for
registering and we're going to exit out
of the script otherwise if this process
did not go through this F if statement
here meaning that the number of
that Rose isn't exactly equal to one
then we're going to tell them that the
email address has already been
registered and we're also going to tell
them if they forgot their password use
the link on this page to have their
password sent to them and then after
that of course we want to come in here
and go a MySQL close to close the
database off close the connection and
then the rest of this guy is really all
going to be your form well of course you
want to close your if statement and
closing and come in here and close off
the PHP part all together and then you
can put something like an h1 tag
register those at all form action equal
to what I call the register page which
we're actually on and we're going to be
using post and then I'm not going to go
through every single one of these but
I'm going to show you again remember the
codes on my website you can use it it's
all free do whatever you want with it
first name and you can also make your
website a lot more secure by putting
restrictions in here so here you're
creating your input text box name equal
to you're going to assign the value that
you're then going to look up using the
post array I'm also going to come in
here and define what I want as a maximum
size and then I'm also going to come in
here and define what I want as a maximum
length and the value is going to be
equal to they call it a PHP if I'm a
check that it's been filled in properly
anyway and if it has echo it off the
screen and closed off the PHP and close
off the input tag and close off the
paragraph with the paragraph tag and you
would do that for each item that's going
to be entered into the form as you can
see that I did right here and then I
went in and assigned all my sizes and
max lengths for all of these different
values to keep people also from
inserting code that could be potentially
malicious and you can see here inserted
the submit button the person will click
on and then we have a hidden field here
that's going to have yes this is indeed
submitted and if we shoot up to the top
of our code you can see where this comes
in right here so this whole entire PHP
code this whole entire block of code is
going to be executed if that
value is given a value so there is a ton
of different ways you can block code
injection and SQL injection and a bunch
of other issues like how to make sure
that the new user has an active account
through emailing them a highly secure
activation code you have any questions
or comments leave them below otherwise
