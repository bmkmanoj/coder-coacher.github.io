objective-c and Xcode tutorial a
five-part tutorial that will show you
all the basics behind Objective C the
reason I created this tutorial is
because keV one left a comment asking me
to do this tutorial if you have any
requests for tutorials just leave them
in the comment section below here I
begin my tutorial on iPhone iPod touch
and iPad development it's actually
surprisingly easy to develop for these
devices if you have a background in
programming you must learn a new
language however to be able to develop
anything on these devices and that
language is objective saying in this
tutorial I will begin by explaining
object-oriented programming briefly
using objective-c later I will go
in-depth into object oriented
programming with Objective C so what is
object oriented programming well
technically there are two types of
modern programming languages procedural
programmers write programs based on what
actions they want the program to be able
to do basically they create one function
after another while thinking of the user
of these functions as some disembodied
soul object-oriented programmers create
a representation of every object that is
needed to solve the problem and what
actions those objects need to be able to
perform they create multiple blueprints
for every object they will need and then
based on that blueprint they can build
as many of those objects as they need
the blueprint novopay is known as the
class definition so if you are creating
a blueprint for your average car you
would have to create a car class
definition inside of your class
definition you define the actions your
car needs to perform called methods in
object oriented program you also need to
define all the values you want to
associate with your car called variables
now we'll pay an example variable would
be the color of your car and an example
method would be drive forward after you
to find your class car you can now
create individual cars which are
referred to as instances of type car
noop so why is opie more powerful than
procedural programming opie always
sounds odd to long term procedural
programmers because they don't normally
grasp the power of what is called
inheritance and polymorphism I'll
explain them both now using our car
example
all cars are similar but they all have a
special quality that sets them apart
just ask yourself would you rather go
off-roading in a Jeep or a Kia
let's use our drive forward method in an
example to implement a drive forward
method in procedural programming you
have to start out by asking what type of
car you're going to drive forward like
this if the car is a Kia Soul you're
driving into a field then perform all
these actions if the car is a Hummer and
you're driving into a field then perform
all of these actions and then continue
to repeat onwards and onwards
continually asking what type of car you
are driving and then drive forward using
the limits for the abilities of said car
but how does inheritance work NOP
differently from procedural program well
when you create a new instance of type
car with o P each car comes with the
most common drive forward method that's
gonna work with most cars if your car
doesn't drive forward like a normal car
however you just override that drive
forward method this is the power of
inherent inherent those methods and
variables you want and replace those
that need to be different so what is
polymorphism well let's say you're going
to test drive a new car that you've
never heard of and it's in the shape of
a cube you know it's a car though and
decide to call it a car it drives
forward and everything just like every
other car when you get behind the wheel
turn the key and drive your car forward
you just experience polymorphism you
were able to use it and everything just
simply worked even though you didn't
know its name I'll cover polymorphism in
much more detail later I'm gonna go
through now your first objective-c
program the first line in your program
is a comment here you can comment on
what the program does any words that are
placed after two forward slashes are
ignored altogether also all the words
that lie after a forward slash and a
star are ignored until the comment ends
with a star and then another forward
slash and you can see an example of that
on the lower left-hand corner the second
line of code import foundation ports
last Foundation dot H imports all the
information in the filename foundation H
into your program so all the variables
and methods created in foundation H are
now available for your use the next line
of code int main int argc
, constant character star argv with two
brackets in a closing bracket is the
definition of the function named mein
every Objective C program will contain a
function named main and they all will
look exactly like this this is what each
word in this statement make the word in
is telling the program interpreter that
the function main will return a value of
type integer when it is done executing
the name of the function is main and it
is looked to first for direction when a
program is first executed by the
compiler everything pass to the function
main will lie between both an opening
and a closing bracket the variables
inside of these braces are called
arguments next I'm defining another
integer named argc
and here states again that the value of
Arg C is of type integer the variable
Arg C contains the number of arguments
that are being passed to the function
main and if that doesn't make much sense
don't worry about that at this point
character then tells us that this
variable is of type character meaning it
will contain a string of letters numbers
and symbols the brackets tell us that
argv is an array an array is like a
bunch of boxes inside of one bigger box
and each contain different values I'll
cover arrays later also in much more
detail you don't need to really focus in
on this main function here just
understand that it's the same in every
single program that you create the
opening and closing braces surround
every action that will be performed by
the function main when the interpreter
sees the closing brace which you can see
here in the example the very bottom it
knows that the function has ended what
the line of code that begins with NS
auto-release pull does is reserve space
in the computer's memory for you to use
for your program it provides the
resources need for our program to
execute properly and again more on this
later special note however every
statement is of course ended in
objective-c with a semicolon that's how
the compiler knows that that line of
code is done then I define three
variables that are all of type integer
and then assign them a value the first
two are assigned a value using the equal
sign followed by the value to assign
third line of code assigns a value to
the variable number three by adding the
values of the two previous variables
together and then
signing that sum to the variable name
number three again special note
variables in Objective C are
case-sensitive meaning that n um
lowercase with an uppercase T wo is much
different than if you would capitalize
the TW NL in that variable name as you
can see here in the lower left hand
corner NS log function that was created
and is stored in the foundation dot H
file that you imported at the top
whatever values that are passed to it
will be displayed on the screen of
whoever execute this program everything
place after the @ symbol and in between
the two codes will be displayed if you
want to show variable values in this
string of text you tell the interpreter
where those variable values will show up
in this example with a percent sign
followed by the letter I the values will
appear based off of the order they are
in after that final quote and we are
using the letter I specifically because
we are using an integer in this case you
are using a different type of variable
this code would change and I'm going to
show you those codes here in a minute
and finally you see the line of code
where it says pool drain this tells the
computer that you no longer need the
memory it provided to you and I also
cover more on this later just understand
that this will end most of your programs
in Objective C this final line of code
returns zero tells the interpreter to
stop executing code in the function name
the zero tells the interpreter that the
program ended because it wanted to and
not because of an error like I stated
previously the closing curly brace
signifies the end of the function all
together
and if you want to see what the user
would see on their screen if they
executed this program you can see that
in the second line here on the left they
would see the sum 1 + 2 equals 3 in the
next presentation I'm going to explain
the implementation and interface code
that is needed in Objective C
programming if you have any questions
leave them in the comment section below
