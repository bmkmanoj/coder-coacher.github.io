my web design and programming tutorial
today I'm going to divert away from PHP
and focus in on MySQL for a little bit
and then after I explain how to use
MySQL and SQL in general I will go back
into PHP and then show you how to
manipulate databases using PHP and then
we'll move onwards from that point on
well the first thing you're going to
want to do after you have MySQL
installed of course is know how to and
blog on and you just type in MySQL and
I'm in my terminal right now and I
specifically my version of MySQL is nice
ql5 then you can type in - H for host
which would be localhost followed by
your user ID and then followed by - P
then it's going to ask for your password
and then boom I'm logged into SQL well
just so you know how this is how you get
out of SQL you just type quit enter and
you're gone now I'm going to show you a
shortcut if you want to execute the last
command you issued in your terminal that
started with Emma why boom like that and
you're back into MySQL just as easy as
that I'm going to clear my scroll back
so you can see exactly what I'm doing
inside of here and if you want to create
a new database you're often told to do
everything capital letters but you do
not have to so I'm going to create a
database and a database is just a
storage of information so you can store
like first names last name States
birthdate street city's address so forth
and so on and you can just think of it
as a spreadsheet except a lot more
powerful now to create a database I'm
going to create one called customer just
type in create database and then the
name of your database and hit enter boom
you just created a database now if you
want to show databases all the databases
that you have currently you have to end
it with a semicolon just type in show
databases and it's going to show you all
of the databases that you currently have
on your database and if you want to use
specifically the customer database guess
what you do you type in use customer and
you just change your database and if you
want to see the current database you're
using type in select database followed
by parentheses and it shows you're
currently using the customer database
and if you want to create
a table inside of your database type in
create table getting the point that's
pretty easy and I'm going to call it
customers and I'm just going to hit
enter put at opening parenthesis and I'm
going to define my database all the
different things going to be in it so
I'm doing a customer database so I want
the first name and because I don't know
how long the first name is going to be
I'm going to type in VAR CH AR this is
just like a data type and let's put in
25 so I'm going to say I expect the
first name to be about 25 characters in
length or less however if it isn't
that's perfectly fine then I'm going to
type in not null this doesn't have to be
capitalized just data so you can see it
a little bit better on the screen and
all this means is this information must
be entered if it isn't we're going to
call an error so if we are going to
create a new customer in the custom
database by defining not and all that
means you are demanding that they put a
first name in also makes sense to have a
TAS name and we're going to keep
everything the same for the last name
then I'm going to show you a new data
type and it is called character data
type and you use it whenever you know
exactly how many characters you're going
to have in this case up to a maximum of
two characters not now I'm going to say
I absolutely must have that and I'm also
going to say that if something isn't
entered I want to use PA as my state
then I'm going to create a birthdate of
the date datatype and I'm going to say
that that also absolutely must contain
information and I'm going to get more
into describing the date datatype here
in a second it's just what you think it
is then don't get yourself too excited
I'm going to define an enumerator and
what that means is it is either going to
contain male or female you can actually
have strings in here but I'm just going
to leave it as M or F just to keep it
nice and simple and all this means is
the only values we're going to accept
for content labeled under sex is either
M or F we will not accept anything else
and we're also going to say we
absolutely must have that by putting not
an all in here again then don't get too
upset this is a little tiny bit
complicated we're going to
find a customer ID just think of this
like your social security number or any
type of identification number we're
going to say it's going to be an integer
meaning it's not gonna have any decimal
places we're also going to say that it's
going to be unsigned meaning it is not
possible for this to be a negative
number
not null again you know what that means
it must contain a value and I'm going to
define auto-increment and all that means
is my first customer for example would
be customer 1 customer 2 would be the
second 3 4 or 5 it's going to auto
increment it's going to continue to
increase in value and this is going to
be my primary key and this just states
that this value must be unique and that
you plan on using it to speed up the
process of searching through your
databases and I'll get much more into
what a primary key is and keys in
general foreign keys and such in a later
tutorial and then we're going to define
another one another variable called last
meeting and we're going to give this the
timestamp we're going to say that this
doesn't have to be entered if they don't
want to and a timestamp is just a date
that also goes into minutes and seconds
and milliseconds and all that again more
on that in this tutorial in just a
little bit then I'm gonna type in money
owed and I'm going to say this is a
float because it's a number that can
contain a decimal place and I'm going to
put null in here saying that I don't
need a value in there you know know a
lot about my SQL just from creating this
one table then you want to have your
closing parenthesis and your semicolon
and hit enter boom you just created a
new table inside of minus QL and if you
want to show the table just type in show
tables and you can see customers is
right here you just created the customer
table inside of this database now if you
want to delete it drop table and he's
probably thinking he's crazy but I'm
going to show you in another way to load
tables you just type in drop table
customers to delete that table and then
if we type in show tables again you're
going to see nothing came up because
it's empty because you just deleted
everything all right so I'm going to
jump out of my school and I'm going to
show you how easy it is to import that
information again so what do we do we
type quit then I want to load all that
information into MySQL and you can see
right here on the screen everything that
I just typed in however I saved it as
a file called create customer SQL if you
can see over here create customer and
I'm going to show you how another way
you can create tables inside of SQL real
nice and easy so now to load that
information or run those SQL statements
inside of SQL you're going to type in -
ql5 or whatever you have versions the
table that you want to run this SQL
command on the file I just showed you
that contains the SQL statements my SQL
admin - P there you go it loaded all
that in there and I'm going to prove it
to you
I'm back in my SQL use customer type in
show tables and you can see customers is
loaded back inside of there and then if
I specifically want to see more
information on that specific table I
just type in either describe or DSC cut
off the bribe and typing customers and
you can see all that information that we
just entered is right here on the screen
if I shrink that down a little bit so
that you can see it a little bit better
so there is everything that you defined
and how you created those tables and so
forth and so on now let's say that you
want to come in here and actually start
plugging information into the table that
you created in your database how do you
do that well just type in insert into
customers and the word values I'm gonna
make that uppercase you can see it a
little bit better and then I'm going to
type in all the different things I want
inside of here so I'm going to say Paul
Jones stay he lives in the state of
Pennsylvania say that his birthday is
1972 - 10 - to say that he's male then
I'm going to put in null for the
customer ID and why that's fine is it's
going to auto increment so put that in
there
and you would never type in a timestamp
like this but I'm going to do it
normally you would use the now command
which I'm going to get into here in a
little bit but this would be the last
time you supposedly saw him and let's
say he owes Fitch four dollars and 96
cents boom okay we typed in we got all
that information inside of there and
let's just say that we want to prove
that that went in there I'm just going
to say real quickly here select
everything that's what this little
star means and display it to screen from
the table called customers and you're
going to see Paul Jones PA birthdates X
customer ID is one last meeting date
money owed so forth and so on
so there's that information that we just
entered in regards to Paul Jones our one
and only customer and I went in here and
added a couple more customers to the
database or the table just so we could
play around with some additional things
just know that you could also type in
insert into customers values last name
first name followed by values Paul Jones
if everything was not required through
not null that is so that is just another
way that you could enter individual
values inside of the table of the other
database then let's say I want to put
out to screen just so you can see some
additional commands all the first names
from table customers easy enough and you
can see that I put it all of the first
names for all the customers that I've
stored in the table inside of my
database and I'm going to do lots of
examples on this stuff so in the next
tutorials say I want to display the last
name in the birthdate from customers and
you can see that it does that quite
easily and we're going to get into a lot
more complicated things here such as
display everything for customers where
the item called money owed is greater
than $10 and you can see everybody has
me more than $10 and of course you can
use the less than and less than and
equal to not equal to s and so forth and
so on again we're going to get more into
that in upcoming tutorials and just to
give you a one more SQL query that's a
little bit more complicated I want all
the first names from customers where
money owed is greater than $10 let's
just say greater than $50 and state is
equal to PA and you can see the pollen
Rick both owed me more than $50 so both
those names showed up and in regards to
the data types that are available with
MySQL all of them right here you can see
a list of all the main data types
there's tiny
you would use this if you plan on not
having any digits higher than 127 or
less than 128 or if you mark these is on
signs you're going to be able to do
these two numbers added together in
total lengths small Lant would basically
be anything up to thirty two thousand
seven or 68 medium aunt integers are
quite large two to the power of 31 big
ants and you can see floats are also
quite large and here's doubles and
remember floats and doubles are just
numbers with decimal places an inter
review again string types or character
that's whenever you have a fixed maximum
length is the best to use whenever you
want to conserve space and also speed
variable characters is whenever it's a
variable length use blobs whenever you
want to contain a large and a lot of my
information in regards to like comments
or something like paragraphs of text
usable log enumerator that's whenever
you have a limited number of total
values like our female or male example I
gave before sets would be whenever you
have a limited number of values however
you want the person actually be able to
choose multiple different values from
there like delivery methods might be an
option where you'd want to maybe select
like deliver in back and Co D and you
wanted to keep all your delivery options
on one area you wanted to be able to
select multiple options for each single
one of them that's where you would use a
set I'm going to give examples and here
are all the date and time variable types
you have in - QL and exactly how they're
laid out so I'm going to continue on
with MySQL in our next tutorial with a
ton more examples again if you want to
read this stuff there is a link to an
article in the underbar and that might
also provide you with more understanding
regards to minus QL leave any questions
or comments below otherwise until next
