2 of my android development tutorial in
this part of the tutorial series I
decided to get kind of the boring stuff
that you need to know out here into one
giant tutorial so we're going to be
covering things like understanding the
Android activity lifecycle the Android
manifest file and how to support
different languages and a whole bunch of
other different things but you by no
means need to memorize all this stuff in
fact in the description I'm basically
going to provide you with a cheat sheet
you're going to be able to copy and
paste from and of course everything
covered here is going to be covered in
all the tutorials afterwards I just
wanted to cover this all at once so that
in parts three four five and so forth
and so on we'll be able to just make one
app after another so I'll do my best to
make it all interesting if you haven't
watched the previous parts of this
tutorial I provide a link above to those
so I have a lot to do so let's get into
it
the first thing I'm going to talk about
is lifecycle of an android activity and
I hope from watching the previous
tutorial you understand what an activity
is now you have to understand whenever
an Android app starts the Android system
constantly calls different methods in an
activity that correspond to how the user
is interacting with your app as the app
starts the methods on create on start
and on resume are going to be called in
order and then once again whenever your
app is shut down the methods on paused
on stop and then finally on destroyed
are normally going to be called and
these methods are going to be needed to
avoid things like app crashes and of
course the minimize system resources
needs and also of course to save data
entered into the app by the user now
aside from resumed paused and stopped
every other state documented here is
just going to be a temporary State
resume paused and stopped are going to
be states that can occur over an
extended period of time however so we're
going to really focus in on them here
for a second the resumed or the running
States and whenever I talk about these
states I mean we are currently going to
be in these methods on resume on start
on create resumed or running State like
I said before is going to stand for the
state in which the activity is in the
foreground and the user is currently
interacting with the pause state or when
we
in onpause is going to stand for the
state in which the activity is obscured
by another activity and it won't be able
to execute code or interact with the
user in any way whenever it is in the on
pause method the on stop method is going
to stand for the state in which the
activity is in the background and
whenever we're in this method all data
that is being used by the user is going
to be retained but of course just like
before you're not going to be able to
execute any code for that set activity
so now jumping into the Android manifest
file when the user opens up your app the
system calls the oncreate method and
this is an example of the oncreate
method as you can see right here and
this comes from mainactivity.java so
whenever the oncreate method is called
for the activity that you're going to
define in Android manifest right here
dot XML and the activity that contains
both this intent filter which you can
see right here which is just another tag
and also has the main action as well as
the launcher category this is going to
tell the Android system that this is
going to be where we are going to start
or this will be the starting activity
for our application now every time an
activity is started the oncreate method
is of course going to be called and what
oncreate is basically going to do is
perform basic startup logic that is only
done one time over the course of the
activity's lifetime
then again whenever your activity is
being removed from memory eventually the
ondestroy method is going to be called
normally I'm going to get into in a
second why I keep saying normally now
the ondestroy method is normally only
going to be created if you are using
things like threads or you have other
long-running resources and in fact most
of the cleanup is normally going to be
handled by these methods which is going
to be on pause and on stop and as we're
going to see later on in the tutorial
you could actually end an activity by
calling a method named finish pretty
much any time you'd like now normally an
activity is going to be considered
paused when it is partially obscured
let's say a dialog box or something is
over top of it that's what I mean by
partially obscured and whenever an
activity is paused it is very important
to release resources that may be needed
by whatever the current focused activity
maybe so you should release things like
the camera GPS shutoff sound any video
that's playing end animations or
anything else that may consume resources
and always pay attention to anything
that may deplete battery life and in
fact you may also want to save any data
that would be needed if the app was
completely closed which of course if you
ever get to the on pause method it is
very likely that the app could be shut
down altogether however normally you're
going to want to save any data inside of
the on stop method so that you don't
slow down any transition from one
activity to the next by consuming
resources to save information and then
once again whenever an activity is
resumed we would once again provide
access to these resources that we shut
down whenever we entered the on pause
method so if we were using the camera or
GPS or sound or video we would then
provide those resources back to the
activity whenever it received focus
again now an activity is considered to
be in the stopped state whenever it is
not visible in any way on your screen
and whenever this occurs whenever you
get to the on stop method what you
should do is release all resources that
are absolutely not required and
understand of course that if an activity
is stopped and system resources are
required by the system that the system
will very often kill your application
completely often without even calling
the on destroy method so you should like
I mentioned before use the on stop
method to complete any CPU intensive
shutdown operation saving of data and so
forth now whenever an activity has
restarted on restart is first called and
then immediately thereafter on start and
you're basically going to put inside of
the on restart method any restorative
work that would be needed when you are
coming from a stop state which as you
can see here that's exactly what's going
on however understand that the use of
the on restart actually isn't very
common but it is however sometimes
needed to once again allocate resources
that may have been lost whenever the on
stop method was called and that
basically covers the life cycle of any
activity that you would create and
whenever you're creating andr
apps and that brings us to supporting
different languages now as we saw before
it's often good practice to store
strings in external files and like we
did before we stored them in a file
called strings XML and if you don't
remember that was in the resources
directory under values now if you want
to support different languages basically
all you need to do is create additional
folders that are going to have a dash
after them and then they're going to be
followed by a country code and I just
listed a couple of the most common
country codes here and down here is a
link to many of the different language
codes that are available in the world so
rather than me just talking about this
I'm going to show you exactly how to do
it
so here we are once again inside of the
app that we created last time and this
is what I was referring to strings dot
XML now if we're going to want to cover
other different languages it's actually
pretty easy we're just going to go into
resource and we're going to come in to
this guy and go new create ourselves a
new folder right like that and then
inside of here we're gonna go values so
let's say that I wanted to cover Spanish
well we're just going to put es inside
of there and hit finish then what I'm
going to do is open the strings XML file
which actually have it open here already
and I'm just gonna select everything
copy that then down in values dot es
again for Spanish we're going to come up
go new come down here and click file and
then inside of this we're just going to
go strings dot XML exactly like before
and hit finish and then inside of it
paste in exactly what we had before and
the only difference is we're going to
come in here and change these English
words into Spanish words and magically
I'm just going to come in here and paste
that in there and there you go that's
all you need to do and this is
automatically going to work for Spanish
and of course you could do exactly the
same thing for French or whatever I'm
just picking these randomly resources
new folder come in here type values - fr
click finish create a new file
strings.xml click finish and then inside
of this paste in your French version of
all of your resources and that's
basically all you got to do now if you
want to be able to grab these strings of
course after you have saved them inside
of the strings.xml file what we're going
to do
here is go into mainactivity right here
and you can see right here where I'm
actually grabbing that based off of ID
so this is grabbing the edit message
string so if we go into strings.xml here
is edit message and over here I am
grabbing it using its ID now I could
also get it and this is in my actual
Java code remember we're in
mainactivity.java I could also grab
these strings let's say I want to go
string message and save it in here I
could go get resources like that get
string and then inside of it go r dot
string dot edit message that's another
way to get a hold of it and I also could
assign a string resource to a method
let's say that I go text view text view
is equal to new text view this like that
so I just created this resource and this
is mad down here because I already have
a message but either way I'm just
showing this for demonstration purposes
if I wanted to pass a resource inside of
here set text I just go are once again
exactly the same thing string dot edit
message right like that so that's how
we'd be able to pass an in so you can
see I'm basically using exactly the same
thing to pull information out of
strings.xml now if I want to actually
pull that information out into my XML
file like I do here with my manifest
file you can see a couple examples here
how to do that here we're pulling a
string out of that strings.xml file by
just putting in an apt symbol string
forward slash app name and if we jump
over here we're going to see app name
there it is right there and if we jump
back over into this XML file again we're
going to see there's appname again and
we're going to see here title activity
display message so basically just at
sign with a string forward slash and the
name of whatever the string is named
inside of strings.xml so that's how to
pull it in based off of if you're in a
Java file or if you're in an XML file so
now to finish off I'm going to cover the
androidmanifest.xml file and I'm going
to go over a whole bunch of things and
what they mean inside of this file again
don't
try to memorize this a link in the
description has everything I both say as
well as I display here on the screen so
I'm just going to go through here real
quickly and explain what this says I
guess I actually should say exactly what
the manifest is basically what the
androidmanifest.xml file does is it
defines requirements components and
security for your app it also talks
about services the app requires and so
forth and so on but we'll get into that
at a later point in time but basically
what we're defining here inside of
package is just the package name for
your app then what we're going to have
here is the version code and this is
basically just used for whoever
developed the application it's just
going to provide an easy way to track
app versions as changes are being made
and then here finally is the app version
that would be displayed to a user if
you'd want to do that now the uses SDK
is going to define both the minimum as
well as the maximum SDK version that's
going to be required on a device to be
able to run your app and whenever you're
defining this you should always make
sure that you set minimum otherwise it's
going to default to one which is
probably going to cause all kinds of
crashes and the target SDK version
should almost always be set to whatever
the latest version is and that is even
going to be true if you are not doing
anything special with that specific
latest API and there's another one of
these tags inside of uses SDK that
allows you to set the maximum SDK but
it's advisable not to even mess around
with that
now the uses configuration is going to
find hardware and software features that
your very specific app is going to
require now this is normally not going
to be needed because you should aim to
have your app work on pretty much any
device however in those situations in
which certain order is required this is
how you would do it so under this first
one right here required five-way now
this is going to be set to true if an
input device that is capable of
navigating up down left and right is
required here again keyboard type is
going to be set to true if a keyboard is
going to be required to use your app and
then down here you can see exactly the
types of keyboards so if you require a
very specific type of keyboard to be
available well here you would define
that then if you require a way for the
user
to navigate using your app you could
also define down here whether you would
have undefined no Navdeep ad trackballs
or some type of wheel device and then
down here finally if you required a very
specific type of touchscreen you would
define that either as no touch or a
stylus or a finger type touchscreen
device here inside of the uses feature
tag you're basically going to define
numerous different hardware features
that your app requires and in essence
what you're doing here by using this tag
is requesting permission to use this
hardware and I'll provide a link to a
whole gigantic list of all the different
types of Hardware types that you can
possibly ever need if however this is
really just simply a request and you do
not need it you could just come in here
and type required equals false and that
would allow your app to run on devices
that do not have or do not give you the
permission to use these different
hardware features and here is just
another example of how to use the usage
feature tag that sometimes confuses
people let's say that you want to
require an absolute minimum OpenGL
version well in this situation what you
would do is the first four numbers are
going to represent two and then point
one so that is how you would define a
very specific type of OpenGL and this is
the minimum requirements that would be
needed to use your application now
permissions are going to be used to
restrict access to certain application
components so here what I'm doing is
defining a permission and I'm going to
go through here and step-by-step explain
exactly what all these different
attributes mean the description as I'm
sure you're well aware is just a
description of the permission and of
course it can be provided if a user ever
requests it icon is going to represent
the permission itself label is going to
be the permissions name that is provided
to the user name is going to be used if
you ever want to refer to this
permission inside of your code
permission group provides a way for you
to group permissions and then finally
protection level is going to define
certain risk possibilities that are
associated with providing this permit
and just to briefly go over those normal
would be a low-risk permission that
shouldn't hurt other applications the
system of the user dangerous would be a
higher risk for mission that could
provide access to private user
information or could hurt the system in
some way and then signature is a
permission that the system grants only
if the requesting app has the same
certificate as the app that created the
permission once again don't try to
memorize all this stuff it's available
in the description now uses permission
just to cover this really quickly
requests access to restricted code or
data on the device or something else
that could be potentially dangerous and
each of these permissions has a unique
label and if you are asking for one of
these potentially dangerous permissions
with your app just understand that at
install time the user is going to be
asked if they want to grant you this
power or not and then of course based
off of how you create your app whether
the user decides to provide this
permission or not could either cause
your application not to install or fail
and here you can see an example of some
type of information you might not want
to provide to an app now as you're well
aware Android is obsessive about being
able to run on numerous different types
of devices and inside of the support
scream-tag you are going to be given the
option to specify different screen sizes
that your app is going to support I'll
just understand that normally resizing
applied by the system for most app
doesn't require you to do pretty much
anything for your app to be resized
you're basically going to use this only
to find very specific situations in
which the way that the system decides to
resize your app just plain off don't
work and here basically you're just
going to be defining true or false is
your app resizable then you're going to
be defining true or false does your app
work on screen smaller than HVGA and in
the previous part of the tutorial I
talked about those resolutions by normal
screens we're talking about cell phone
screens here so does your app run on a
cell phone probably should buy large
screens we're asking will your app run
on the device that falls somewhere
between the normal phone size and a
tablet extra large screens as you see
here nor
referred tablets any density should
never be touched and of course it's
going to be true by default so just
ignore that and you should also
completely ignore requires smallest with
the pay just don't even pay any
attention to that and then whenever we
get down into this area right here
compatible with limit D P is going to
allow you to define the upper bound your
app may not work with while largest
width limit DP is going to allow you to
define the upper bound in which your app
definitely won't work with and that
brings us down into the application
nodes which is actually going to be the
last thing that I cover here now there
are numerous different attributes that
are available using application nodes
and I just have the most common ones
listed here I provide a link to a
gigantic list of a whole bunch of them
underneath in the description basically
I'll just go over these basic guys here
right now by marking allow backup to
true if you so choose to mark allow
backup to false just understand that no
backup or restoration of the app will be
performed in any way so this is almost
always going to be true icon of course
is going to be a reference to a drawable
resource that's going to represent your
apps default icon label is going to
provide a name to the user for your app
and then theme which we're going to be
covering later on in great detail is
going to reference a style resource
that's going to represent your theme for
your application don't worry we'll get
into that later again down here inside
of the activity node which you see here
here we are just like I talked about
before going to define using the intent
filter right here that as well as main
and launch or inside of here that this
is going to be the activity that is
going to be loaded by the app when
everything basically just starts off and
that is basically a rundown of all the
technical sort of things you need to
think about put into the back your head
in regards to making apps from this day
forward I'm just going to make one app
after another in parts three four five
six seven and onwards and onwards and
onwards please leave any questions or
comments below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
