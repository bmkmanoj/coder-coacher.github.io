3 of my blender video tutorial in this
part of the tutorial I'm going to finish
up covering all the generate modifiers
including screw skins solidify
triangulated wireframe subdivision and
the remesh modifiers and like always
there is a text version of everything I
do here in the description underneath
the video and I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay so here we are
inside a blender and I'm going to just
delete this alright the very first thing
I'm going to do is cover the screw
modifier which is very similar to the
previous screw tool that we covered and
what we want to do here is create
another spring or hose or whatever you
want to think of it so what I'm gonna do
here is I'm gonna switch to front
orthographic view so I'm gonna get 1 and
5 and there it is and you can see down
here is everything that I type in and
you're going to be able to sip here that
I have front orthographic ok if you
can't see everything just view at full
screen
it's an HD video so very first thing I
want to do is I want to create a circle
and what I do I hit the wrong button so
let's keep our 3d cursor in the middle
of the screen and I'm gonna go shift a
and I'm going to create a circle and you
can see the circle right there then I
want to rotate a said circle so I'm
going to go rotate X plus 90 and now
I'll be able to see it on a screen
instead of seeing half of it and I'm
gonna left click to place said circle
and now what I want to do is I want to
shrink this down in size so I can shrink
let's say I want to just drink it in
half I can go shrink it with an S
followed by 0.25 and enter and that's
how easy that was and then I'm gonna
basically just make like a spring type
shape so I'm just going to grab this
axis here move it over a couple spaces
and drop it down inside of there then
what I'm gonna want to do is I want to
basically set the location for our
object so that it is at 0 0 see it's all
over the place and to do that what you
can do is go ctrl + a in a location and
now you can see everything has been
zeroed out and then I just want to apply
the screw
modifier to it to have it basically on
the first way that I use this it's just
gonna create a doughnut so I come over
here to odd modifiers and screw and you
can see it basically just created a
doughnut shape but what I need to do is
go in the y-direction so there you go we
just created ourself a doughnut and what
its gonna allow me to do is I can define
how many iterations so I can click on
that and that's going to increase we can
then decide how far apart we want the
different loops of our I guess we'll
just call it a spring and I'm gonna hold
down the shift key move us into position
screws basically just going to define
the height of each of the rows then
you're gonna have the option to
basically define if you want the axis to
be based off of a object or not in this
situation I'm not going to do that but
if you did it that way and then in that
situation the height of each iteration
will be based off of set object angle is
going to be the number of degrees
covered by an iteration so it's going to
depend upon well you can just come in
here and play around that I'll either
play around with it or you can play
around with it on your own and see how
that's moving around both steps and
render steps are going to be increased
to improve quality calc order is gonna
be used if there are any type of shading
problems that you had flip is going to
flip the shading so let's go say what's
gonna do iterations like I said before
is going to define the number of
iterations we're gonna have or how many
loops you're gonna have inside of here
both stretch you and stretch V are gonna
be used if you have 2d images on top of
a 3d shape and merge vertices are going
to merge adjacent vertices ok so there's
all the different things we can play
around with in regards to our screw
modifier and you can see here I went and
changed this on the X plane and how the
changes have occurred there alright so
neat little tool and now I'm gonna jump
over and show you a really cool tool
which is the skin modifier alright so
this is gonna be fun um the skin
modifier is going to provide a quick way
for us to create base meshes that we're
gonna be able to use for sculpting
up next in my next tutorial I'm gonna
cover our materials and then I'm gonna
try to get into sculpting soon
afterwards because that's whenever
blender becomes a lot of fun alright so
what I want to do here first off is I
want to create a plane hold this down
move this around on the screen um so
let's create a plane so I'm gonna go
woops keep it in the control eh alright
so there is our plane shape and I want
to switch over to edit mode so I'm going
to go into a tab and then I'm gonna go
seven and five which is gonna give me
the top orthographic view which is what
I'm shooting for here and I'm gonna do
more with this whenever I do actually
cover sculpting but I think you're gonna
get the idea how this works here alright
so I'm gonna hit a to deselect
everything and then I'm gonna get my box
select select these two guys over here
and we can go and delete them so there's
that and then we're gonna have this
shape here that we can then extrude out
basically a wireframe that we're gonna
be able to turn into a three-dimensional
character and so it's really neat stuff
so I'm going to just grab this guy box
select this and you can move it over or
wherever we want to I'm gonna put it
right there and just put it right there
in the center of our screen now what I'm
gonna be able to do is I'm gonna select
this top part and I'm gonna zoom in here
so you can see a little bit better
alright and then I'm gonna be able to
hit E and then let's say I want to draw
define like a a character wireframe
character that I want to you know create
character models out of so I just hit E
and extruded that out that's gonna be
the shoulder and then I'm gonna go and
extrude out and this is gonna be upper
part of the arm and then I'm gonna
extrude out and then this will be the
lower part of the arm alright and I
probably should have mirrored that but
whatever I can do it this way also E and
I'm just gonna extrude this out and
extrude this out roughly the same
position again I'm just hitting the e
key and extruding this out and just
making additional parts to this and it
probably makes more sense this is
nothing to represent the waist so I'm
gonna bring that down here I'm then
going to extrude this out and then this
will represent like a hip extrude this
will be the upper leg and extrude and
then this will be the
lower leg and I'll hold down shift key
move this up into position I didn't put
a head in there but that tongue doesn't
matter you can see what I'm doing here
for a second alright so let's move this
in here and E and E okay so what we did
here is we created like a wireframe
model of a person that we can later on
animate and do all kinds of really cool
things with but what I'm gonna do right
now I'm just gonna box select this whole
entire guy write that and then I can go
and apply the skin modifier so we can go
skin right there and there you can see
it is a little person now what we're
gonna be able to do I hit Z to get a
wireframe version of this probably going
to want to come in here and grab an edge
so I'm gonna select this and then I'm
gonna come over here and I'm going to
say that I want to subdivide to create
additional vertices inside of here
hit Z again jump back out of that and
then I'll be able to adjust this guy to
make it more like a rib cage if I'd like
to do that which I would so to do that I
can go control an a and scale out all of
these different parts
I say it's getting to be more like a
body and then I can come in and find
like this is the hip area and I can go
control again and make this more like a
waist you know I'm just doing this in a
real simple simple form here right now I
can go and grab this let's go like in
that area again ctrl a and I can shrink
the different parts of our body control
again and I could come in and I'm all
down the shift-key come up here and
let's try like the hip area control a
maybe we want to make the hips a little
bit thicker that makes sense in control
a and make them thicker yet and and then
just like build up from there okay you
can also come up here to the center area
I'm hit Z so I can see if I can figure
out where there it is right there this
is our central point whoops let's guide
select our vertices so I can select that
okay and I could go and extrude either
I'm gonna hit Z again and so I can do
another extrude just by hitting E
and see if I can create like a neck I
don't know if I caught the right part of
the area there that I was aiming for but
I think you get the idea and whenever I
do sculpting I'm actually we're gonna be
able to use the skin modifier to
basically save us a lot of time in
building these different models that we
will then be able to turn into character
animation so just a real brief sort of
explanation of how skin works there you
can play around with that and see how
that affects other different things I'll
playing around with these different
parts of this skin modifier but now I'm
gonna jump over and talk about the
solidify modifier okay so the solidify
modifier is going to add a thickness to
our meshes so let's go and create
something I'm gonna create a sphere and
I'm going to cut the top off so let's
switch into this mode and be and we will
unselect everything unselect and then B
and then grab it like this now actually
we do it in the opposite direction also
um lets me that's fine doesn't really
matter okay so I'm just gonna delete
that and all the vertices and then you
can see all of the different parts here
I'm gonna come down here and I'm gonna
say I'm gonna deselect this so that I
can select multiple different vertices
through walls and such and B and then we
will move it up something like that and
zoom in and B and delete all those
vertices also so X and vertices alright
so now we got ourselves a proper Bowl
but it's you know paper-thin
so let's say we wanted to add some
thickness to it how do we do that well
we first off come in here and select
everything and then go on modifier and
then we can come in and click on
solidify and then what we're gonna be
able to do is to find the thickness
right like this just by changing this up
a little bit you're going to see that it
has actually creating a proper ball
shape and if we click on Z and you could
say that it's going to create a
wireframe that is pretty much exactly
what we're looking for us go back to
this and let's deselect that and you can
see to see it's a proper Bowl type shape
hold down the shift key move this up and
there we go
of course you're going to be able to
offset so if you would go and change
this from negative 1 to 1 and hit enter
it's going to put the thickness on the
outside and then of course applying is
going to be able to have a brand new
wireframe automatically generated so
very very simple way for us to create
more three-dimensional shapes just by
using this modifier and then clicking on
apply very useful tool and since I have
this here why don't I go and also add
another modifier to it which is going to
be the triangulate modifier which is
something I actually don't use very
often I just want to cover it basically
what it does everything here is a quad
polygons and what this is going to do is
force everything to become a triangular
shape so I'm gonna go triangulate see if
we can see the differences in that so
see if we zoom out of those it's
probably easier to see if we would
actually mmm what would be the shape I
could use alright so let's just get rid
of it
triangulate and see how it changed so I
don't know if you can see that or not
I'm gonna zoom in really close alright
so basically everything is just a simple
polygon and then if we come in here to
this add modifier and change it to
triangulate you're gonna see triangles
pop up everywhere see triangles
everywhere now I actually have never
found much use for this modifier maybe
somebody out there in the comments can
tell me why I would ever use this but it
has a tendency to really over complicate
meshes and it and I've had some issues
with it
the only thing I can think of is that
might be better in some situations in
which we have more pointed shapes harder
edges not sure but just wanted to cover
it just because it is there and it is an
option for us to use so there is the
triangulate modifier and now I want to
talk about the wireframe modifier hey
why don't we just stick with this all
together all right so what I want to do
now is I am going to let's go and get
rid you know what let's keep the
triangulate modifier here and let's add
another modifier to it this one is going
to be the wireframe modifier and
basically what its gonna do is convert a
mesh into a
wireframe by converting all the edges
into four-sided polygons so what I'm
going to do is actually apply these
different modifiers so I'm gonna go tab
into our object mode and I'm going to
say apply and then I'm gonna say apply
and then you're going to see if I hit Z
someone in wireframe and this is solid
this is why our frame so what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna convert those wireframes
oops let's jump out of that for a second
these wireframes that you see right here
to create sort of a wild
three-dimensional mesh Bowl and you're
gonna see what the the wireframe looks
like and so we click on wireframe and
you can see basically it created a
four-sided polygon around every single
wireframe if we switch back into the
regular you can see exactly what it did
so there's an example of what you can do
with triangulate you can sort of
complicate up a wireframe and that's
definitely something that the triangle a
modifier does and this is what the
wireframe modifier does it basically
gives a three-dimensional look to the
wireframe that you're working with
inside of blender all right so pretty
cool stuff I could definitely see this
is providing an easy way for you to
create a cage and other different
structural objects such as that and now
what I want to do is jump over and talk
about the remesh modifier okay so the
remesh modifier is basically going to
generate new meshes with different
levels of detail to cut down on the
needed number of vertices and it's also
going to be used in some situations that
interesting block effects so if you're a
big fan of Minecraft then the remesh
modifier is going to be for you so I'm
in object mode I'm going to come in here
and go shift a and I'm just gonna show
you a couple examples so we can throw
our cone inside of here for example and
let's zoom in on this and I'm going to
throw the remesh modifier on it you can
see what it does so here it is remesh
and you can see it distorted basically
we're gonna have a couple different
options we're gonna have blocks which is
going to have no smoothing to it we're
gonna have smooth which is going to
provide for a smooth image with rough
edges and then we're going to
which is gonna be smooth with sharp
edges you can see all the different
options so there's block see what I said
about Minecraft it's basically going to
create Minecraft with any type of shape
that you throw inside of it the next
level of detail is gonna be smooth say
it has rough edges on it and then you
are going to have sharp and then what
we're gonna be able to do with this
depth option right here is define if we
want to increase the resolution as you
can see as I'm increasing the value
there it's getting sharper and sharper
and sharper or if I want to decrease the
resolution as you can see how it
degrades and this is going to be good
specifically if for objects like let's
say your object is really really far
away well you're not going to need a
high level of detail with it resolution
wise but as you zoom in on set object
you can increase the resolution just
that much more so at this level this is
not going to look that much different
than if we went and increased the
resolution dramatically which would
cause a or the need for many more in
regards to calculations and such so
that's really what this guy is used for
scale also is going to lower the values
and decrease the overall resolution this
guy right here here's our smooth shading
option which is going to define if we
want to use smooth versus flat shading
just like we have over here and this
tools option we have on the left side of
the screen and then also you're going to
be able to remove disconnected pieces
depending on the setting you have here
inside of the threshold alright so just
a way to lower and raise the ledge
resolution on images to cut down on the
number of polygons on your screen and
now what I want to do is jump over and
take a look at the subdivision modifier
okay so the subdivision surface modifier
is going to smooth objects inside of our
scene non-destructively and at the same
time it's also not going to require
complex meshes so let's just go and
create something simple let's just throw
a sphere inside of here and there we go
now what we're gonna be able to do with
this sphere we'll be able to add a
modifier to it again this isn't going to
affect the wireframe just like all of
the other modifiers so subdivision
surface and you can see how much
tighter it is however the modifier
itself is not going to be affected so
let's go and get rid of the modifier and
we'll add the modifier back inside of it
again okay and jump back out of that you
can see how smooth it is now we're going
to be able to define how smooth it's
going to be on the the final render just
by playing around with this or base off
of the view that we have directly here
on our screen and you can see how
dramatically smooth that is inside of
there however you wouldn't want to
operate with this object inside of here
if you have numerous different objects
otherwise you know it's going to be very
straining on your computer hey let's go
in there and do something kind of useful
so let's get rid of that we'll come in
here and we're gonna add the decimate
modifier inside of here and then what I
want to do is I want to lower the number
of faces
I'm gonna go unsub divided and let's say
we take this down to say 64 that's been
a number of iterations on that guy and
then what I'm going to do and we can
apply that and then I can come in to add
modifier and back into subdivision
surface and you can see how it's cleaned
that up a lot and then come in and you
can see how it's smooth that object up
that was really cut down and degraded a
lot there's basically going to be two
ways of smoothing these out you can use
the simple or the Catmull clark version
these guys are famous i think they
actually work for pixar used to work for
pixar not sure i then look into the
history of the guys that this feature is
named after but you're more than likely
going to use the option on the left
rather than the one on the right for
obvious reasons already talked about
view and render subdivide UVs
is going to be checked if you want to
subdivide surfaces with 2d images placed
on 3d objects or not and optimal display
is going to show the original wireframe
while in wireframe mode so you can come
in and jump into wireframe mode whoops
escape out of that and wireframe mode
and then click on this guy and see the
differences alright so there you go guys
that is the all of the generating
modifiers actually except for one eye
there was one that I did not cover which
is multi-resolution
and I plan on covering that also
whenever I cover sculpting which is
gonna happen very soon so hopefully you
guys enjoyed that up next
we're gonna talk about materials which
is gonna be a lot of fun and like always
please leave your questions and comments
below otherwise until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
