my descriptions my favorite wordpress
plugins and today we're going to start
it off with the featured content till we
see right here and it go completely
throw how to make your own here it will
list of all plugins if you've been
watching all of the different videos I
put together here some of them you see
me installing before the one I'm going
to show you how it works today is called
dynamic content gallery and I'm just
going to jump right into it click on
settings obviously I installed an
activate okay go through it i'm going to
show you what i do because i think this
is the best way to do it and I think
it's whenever there's numerous different
options and ways to do things I think
it's better to just say okay do it this
way you don't like the way I do it sorry
I'm just trying to help you out here
okay under image file management you
want to click on full URL down here
under gallery method you want to click
on pages because what you're going to do
is you're going to feature pages on your
website since you have page is selected
you're not going to have to put any
information in multi option or one
category just skip over both of those
and this is how you add content to your
website what you do is you simply put
all of your page ID numbers separated by
a comma with no spaces between them
right here then right here you would put
a default photograph that would show up
in your featured content area what if
you forgot to put on an image in this
area so let me explain some things page
ID numbers and your photographs where
are they go back up here pages just
click on pages edit in your left side
board and if you it's going to be harder
for you to see but i'll try doing it
down here if you put your mouse over top
of one of your pages see the 281 that is
your page ID number so that that's the
code that you would enter into the
dynamic content gallery now where is
your content located in your media
library it's the best place to store all
of your information
so what I'm going to need to dig against
I have an article on subliminal
marketing I'm going to click on that and
then select and copy and paste this then
what I want to do is jump over back into
pages at it find my subliminal marketing
article which is right here click Edit
and will show you exactly where to paste
that information superhero says DF c g
dash image you would paste it right
there or or inclusive you can paste it
over here in this box dynamic content
gallery see it in both places and that's
basically all you need them you need
your ID number you can also see there's
a post right here i'm going to jump back
over into my plugins and continue
describing everything to the dynamic
content gallery click on settings i
think this is the best tool I'm sorry if
anybody else made a featured content
tool so you can see back here there's 11
12 that was the post ID and here is a
default image you see here I have 6 45 x
400 I think this is good practice to put
the dimensions of your photographs into
the names now we're going to slide down
through here I prefer auto number number
of characters to display in this slide
pane description you see here your I'm
defining the gallery with 6 45 645
pixels gallery height 400 pixels gallery
border width I chose not to have one and
then you can choose the font size you
can choose the font color you can choose
almost anything that's what I think it's
a great about this toll it's just
dynamite whenever you come down to the
select JavaScript framework you want to
make sure you click on mootools the
reason why is I've had some plugins have
problems with feature content gallery
have here the dynamic content gallery in
regards to conflicts with jquery
show carousel this is you can decide
what you want the title of your content
galler to be where you want it to be
displayed home page only all of these
great things I have all those chapters
so what's the last thing you want to do
here well obviously where do you paste
the featured content links i'll show you
that you go up here to appearance you go
to editor if this is if you will only
want your dynamic content gallery to
show up only on your first page so i'm
in the appearance and intersection i
want to go over here go to main index
template am this is all you have to do
cut and paste or type in this code from
here to here that's all you need to do
what I just highlight it right there so
you want to go to your main index
template which is right here you want to
find art dash content and PHP if posts
and paste it right in the middle of that
then obviously update file and you're
not so that's a diamond dynamic content
gallon and the next plug-in is intense
debate you can see it right here intense
debate plugin as the reason I install it
has been shown to get users to visit
your site over and over again it also
dramatically increases number of
comments receives helps you figure out
who's call which of those commenters
have the best reputation and it's just
nice little tool so I click activate hey
there we are so I got intends to be
activated go over here its settings
tense debate
you want to come in here sign up did it
all again here create account click on
sign up data doubt it down we sent an
email private papa buh buh buh duh buh
buh okay jump back over here type in
your user ID and password and login then
what you got to do is you can read all
this stuff at sold on size just click on
start imported comments sometimes it
takes all time I'm obviously going to
jump pass this whole entire process in
the video okay success it got intense
debate all set up for you that actually
takes about two or three minutes willing
to go through basically I keep
everything just set up exactly as we
have it right here and I just click on
Save Changes both okay it allows people
to log in using an open ID it allows
them to use their intense debate it
allows you to track all kinds of things
like I said you can get access to
reputations and so forth and so on and
it just seems like users in general like
to use this as a commenting system more
than some of the other different systems
so if users like it I like it and that's
intends to make ok now I'm going to go
through the last plugin for today series
and it is the mailchimp plug in
MailChimp is a newsletter distribution
system that is free as long as you don't
go over a certain number of subscribers
i think it's dynamite it does all kinds
of amazing things if you leave comments
below you want me to show you exactly
how to set it up for me set up a
newsletter system on MailChimp I will do
so basically how to set up the plug-in
once you have a newsletter set up is you
have to click on the mail chimp set up
which is under your settings this is
after you install and activate but then
right here you're going to log in with
your MailChimp account right here you're
going to show it which list for
mailchimp after it logs you in
you can decide to turn on monkey reports
I I have that setup I have this check
for JavaScript support included
unsubscribe link i had that turned on
this is the header content for this
subscription area this is that the name
that i went on the button to make sure
the person realizes are subscribing and
this is probably the most important part
for you you can either decide you want a
border or not that's completely up to
you but background color is very
important or a reason why you wanted to
seamlessly blend in with your website
background so you want to figure out
whatever the background is up your
website and change that then you decide
what you want to have is required so I
only require their email address do I
just one to disseminate information and
you can have the first name and last
name they choose not to do it that's
great when you click update subscribe
for signs and this is what the MailChimp
plug-in when its installed on your
system looks like right here get free
newsletter email address first name last
name hit subscribe oh and this is the
rest of the lips a front leg this is
really good article but that's it for
today and I'll see you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
