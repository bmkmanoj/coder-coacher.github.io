mean stack tutorial in this one tutorial
I'm going to show you how to install and
verify that MongoDB Express angularjs
and nodejs are all installed and
properly working on your system and in
this tutorial I'm going to focus in on
using Windows but if you are a Mac user
don't worry in the description
underneath the video I have a tutorial
called nodejs / MongoDB tutorial and
then I'll show you how to install mostly
everything except for angularjs which I
have a timestamp for this video in the
description also it's going to allow you
to just click on that after you see that
video and easily go in and install
angularjs but if you're on Windows
everything is going to be in this one
video also in the description I have a
link to all of these things listed
step-by-step so if you prefer to look at
text you can look at that or you can
watch the video and look at text and I
also have individual tutorials for
nodejs / Express MongoDB MongoDB and
nodejs
as well as Jade which we're also going
to be covering in this tutorial so I
have a lot to do so let's get into it
now mean it stands for MongoDB Express
angularjs and nodejs and we're going to
be using the MVC pattern to develop our
application using this mean stack as
it's referred to with MVC will separate
the model or the data source or the data
manipulation part of our site from the
view or the rendered page or the user
interaction part of our site and then
we'll have the controller which is going
to handle communication between the
model and the view now briefly nodejs
allows us to build server-side web
applications using JavaScript like
you're probably aware of and node also
is going to utilize a module system that
which makes it very attractive and also
very easy to extend in regards to adding
additional capabilities while Express is
a node.js framework which is going to
provide the capabilities of nodejs while
also making it easy to build
applications using the MVC format
MongoDB is a new SQL database that
utilizes JSON data models which make it
very flexible and allow for us to use
diverse groupings of different types of
information in compare
- like relational databases they're very
highly structured and MongoDB also is
going to provide this flexibility while
at the same time offering fast querying
and ease of scaling angularjs then is
going to shore up everything by
providing a framework that makes it easy
to make single page applications and
once again it's going to provide an MVC
structure that makes pages dynamic
through the use of data binding so that
is a rough overview of why we're using
all these different guys and how we're
going to use them in comparison and now
I'm gonna jump over and show you how to
install everything ok so I set
everything up here in a frame-by-frame
basis so it should be very easy for you
to click on pause and then just work
your way through installing installing
everything because it can get a little
bit confusing very first thing we're
going to do is we're going to install
node.js by going to node.js org and
you're going more than likely use the 64
bit version if you're on Windows after
you click that you want that of course
it's going to ask you if you want to run
it and you're going to say yes and it's
going to pop up on the screen and we're
going to basically just click on next a
whole bunch of times so click on next
accept the terms click on next it's
perfectly fine to put this in your
Program Files click on next you're not
going to need to change anything here
going to click on next once again and
then click on install after everything
is installed then you're going to click
on finish and now what you're going to
want to do is open up your command
prompt and we're just going to verify
that node was properly installed by
typing in node with a space and a dash v
and whenever it pops back the version
number of node which might be different
depending upon when you were looking at
this video you're going to know that
node was properly installed
now what you're going to want to do is
you're going to set up the directory
where you are going to be storing
everything so you're going to want to
come in here and it's perfectly fine to
put it in the users directory you're
just going to go mkdir and I'm going to
create a directory called mean Tut and
then I'm going to change to that and for
your first run-through in regards to
installing all these different things
it's a good idea to keep the names
exactly the same so that you don't get
confused and now it's going to be time
for us to install Express and to do so
you're just going to come over in your
mean Tut directory and type in MPM
install with space dash G space and
Express after you do that you're then
going to want to come in here and
install express generator so we're going
to type in M p.m. space install space
Express
- generator with another space and a - G
and after you do that you're going to
see that everything installs without an
error that's super great and now it's
going to be time to come in here and
have Express
generate our sample site and to do that
you're inside of the mean directory once
again you're going to type in Express
with a space and then sample site and
then at this point in time you're going
to see all these different files and
directories that are all going to be
created once again I covered that in the
Express tutorial in an ultimate detail
but you're going to see here there are
no errors and everything is working
perfectly fine and at this point in time
you could actually come in here and run
your server or node.js server to verify
that everything's working and to do so
you're just going to come in and you're
going to type in node followed by index
J s and then if you go to localhost
colon 3000 you're going to see that
Express Works pops up here on your
screen so now you know that you have no
js' as well as Express installed
properly and what we're going to install
next is Jade and to do so you're just
going to type in M p.m. with a space
install space Jade and don't worry about
these two warnings they're not going to
matter at all at this point in time also
if you'd like to come in and install
handlebars you could do so by typing in
NPM install - - save Express -
handlebars and also verify that no
errors pop up on screen anywhere at this
point in time we're going to have to
setup the package.json file so that we
will be able to have MongoDB as well as
Jade I'll be able to work with it and
that's going to be located in your mean
Tut directory sample site and then
you're going to see package.json so just
open this up in a text editor like
notepad plus plus that's what I'm using
here you don't want to open this up in
Microsoft Word or anything like that
notepad plus plus is great also verify
that you have private true right here
and also pair make sure that you have
commas at the end of all these different
lines you're going to get all kinds of
errors then at this point you're going
to want to come in and make sure that
you have Kerberos set up inside here
with the exact settings that I have also
with the commas at the end MongoDB and
also Jade if Jade isn't already inside
there then you're going to save that
file and now we're going to have to come
in here and install Python because we're
going to also be installing Bower here
in a little bit and we're going to need
Python to be able to do that and you're
specifically going to want to install
the two points
Evon version of Python so you're going
to want to click on that and whenever
you do you're going to specifically want
to look for the 2.7 version and this guy
right here the MSI installer and you're
going to click on that whenever you do
it's going to say do you want to run
this of course click on run and it's
going to open up the installation file
and you're basically just going to click
on next a whole bunch of times so
install for all users next all this is
perfectly fine click on next and then
you're going to click on next and then
it's going to complete installation
you're going to click on finish then
going to open up a command prompt once
again and type in MPM install with space
dash G node gy P once again this is
going to be used by Bower you're going
to verify that everything installed here
without any errors and then you're going
to open up your sample site directory
once again you're going to type in M
p.m. with a space and install and if you
get any errors whenever you type that in
you could of course come in instead and
type in NPM with a space and install and
then - G and an M p.m. @ latest and if
you do that that should get rid of any
errors that you might have gotten by
just typing in NPM install then once
again in the sample site directory
you're going to create a data directory
that's going to be used by MongoDB so
just make sure you're in sample site and
then type in MD with space and data and
then once again we can type in NPM with
a space and start in the command line
and you're going to make sure the
command prompt and you're going to make
sure that you keep this command problem
to open and any additional times I say
open up a command prompt you're going to
want to open up a new command prompt
because this is your nodejs server
that's running here and once again you
can come in and go localhost colon 3,000
and you're going to see that Express
opens up right like that now it's going
to be time to install MongoDB and to do
so you're just going to go into MongoDB
org and it's going to pop up here on the
screen and it's probably going to be
automatic it's going to say you're on
Windows so it's going to pop-up windows
you're going to click on download and
it's going to open up this page and of
course you're going to come in and say
that you want to run it so that you can
install MongoDB and you're going to go
through a little wizard once again which
basically is going to require you to
click on next a whole bunch of times
accept the Terms click on next complete
that's perfectly fine click on next and
then you're going to click on install
and it's going to say that that's all
finished so
go and finish now it's a good idea to
come in here to create a basic directory
inside of the C part of your drive so
directory C just that guy right there
and you're going to go in and type in
make directory and data and then make
directory data with backslash and DB
you're then going to want to make sure
that you have MongoDB in your path so
what you're going to do is make sure
that you have the directory for MongoDB
so open it up and look at the properties
for that file and then you're going to
go into system and security inside of
your control panel click on advanced
system settings this guy is going to pop
up you're going to go to the Advanced
tab right there and then you're going to
click on environment variables then this
guy is going to pop up and you're going
to need to come in here on your path for
both paths just to be safe you're going
to want to make sure that you come in
here and type in C colon backslash
Program Files MongoDB server
3.0 and then bin with a final backslash
and of course make sure you have a
semicolon right here and then once you
do that for both of these paths you're
going to click on OK now you're going to
want to open up a new command prompt and
in that command prompt you're going to
type in Mongo D and a space and DB path
and then you're going to put a link to
the data directory that you created in
your sample site and whenever you hit
enter on this this is going to run the
MongoDB server so you're going to have
the node.js server running up here and
the Mongo DB server running down here
both in separate command prompts you're
then going to open up the MongoDB shell
by just typing in Mongo and then you're
going to see this little test open up
right here then what we're going to do
is we're going to create a new database
in our MongoDB database and to do that
you're going to type in use sample site
like that and then we're going to throw
in some sample data just to verify that
MongoDB is working and to do that you
can see everything right here
I have DB students insert student make
sure that you have everything exactly
the same please pause the screen to make
sure that you want this or like I said
in the description I have a link and you
can just copy and paste this guy but
you're going to want to put all of this
sample data inside of the database right
like this and you're going to hit enter
and whenever it says inserted one you
know that you
properly we're able to insert this piece
of data that you see right here on our
screen now we're going to verify that
MongoDB is going to work with Express
and to do so you're going to open up a
file called app dot J s so go into mean
Tut directory sample site directory and
then app J s and a lot of this stuff is
going to be here on your screen and what
you basically just need to do is put
this one line of code right inside of
there and you're going to save app j s
then we're going to come in here to
another file called index J s and that
is in the sample site routes and inside
of index J s you're going to be adding a
whole bunch of different information I'm
going to go through exactly what all
this stuff does but you're going to put
all of the information you see here on
your screen after where you see the line
that says router is equal to Express dot
router but before where you see the line
that says module dot exports equals
router that module dot exports equals
router has to be the last line of text
so you're going to say and I'll just go
briefly through exactly what's going on
here basically this guy right here is
going to define the route route which
means whenever they go to localhost
colon 3000 this is going to define
exactly what's going on and we're going
to say here that we want to open up the
index page and then pass over the
attributes title with the value of
express that is the reason why you saw
Express on there let's see if I open and
up see where it says Express that's that
and localhost colon 3000 is the route
that we're talking about and this guy
right here where the request object is
going to represent the HTTP request and
it's also going to contain any query
strings parameters bodies headers
whatever then you're going to have the
response object which is going to be the
response that express is going to send
whenever it receives a request and what
render is saying here is that it wants
to open up a view which is a Jade file
which you're going to see here in a
little bit and that Jade file is going
to be located in the views directory and
it's going to have the name of index
Jade and like I said previously it's
going to pass in title as variable with
the value of express this down here is
where we are going to actually verify
that we
I'm going to be all set up with our
Express application and what it's going
to do is it's going to print out the
student that we plugged into the
database previously this guy right here
is just saying that we want to get a
Mongo client so that we'll be able to
work with our Mongo server this right
here is going to define where the
MongoDB server is located this guy right
here is going to connect to the server
and it's going to print out an error if
it were if we were unable to connect to
the server or something like that
otherwise it's going to pretend out that
we actually were able to create a
connection this line right here is going
to get the documents and specifically
it's going to get to the students
documents then we're going to issue a
basic fine query which basically since
there's nothing inside of here it's
going to say that we want to get all the
results of all the documents for
students and you saw previously where I
set that up inside of the MongoDB shell
and if it's able to get this array of
information what it's going to do it's
going to print out an error if it had an
error otherwise what it's going to do is
it's going to say that we want to render
a new Jade view called student list
which we're going to create here in a
second and we're going to pass over the
result of our query and otherwise it's
going to print on an error that we were
not able to find any documents but if
everything goes great everything should
be fine and then finally we're going to
have DB dot close right like this and if
you get any errors whenever you do this
just click on the little link in the
description and copy and paste all this
stuff to make sure that everything's you
know set up properly because it's very
easy to get a wrong parenthesis or a
semicolon in the wrong place and that
will cause all kinds of errors of course
and here is the student list dot Jade
file that we're going to save inside of
our views directory and you're just
going to go and type in all the code
that we have right here and this is
basically going to cycle through all the
results of the query that we issued and
then output all that information on the
screen and this is the location its
views you're going to save it in the
same location where you see error index
and layout but Jade after you have that
all set up you're going to want to hit
ctrl C to shut down your node.js server
and then you're going to want to type in
NPM start once again to restart it you
don't need to do anything in regards to
restarting the MongoDB server though and
then if you come in here
go to localhost colon 3000 the list it's
going to print on all the information
that you have in your database so now
you know that MongoDB is set up properly
now we're going to have to come in and
install git and to do that we're going
to type in get slash SCM comm and go to
this guy right here you're going to see
downloads for windows you're going to
click on that and then it's going to say
do you want to run this and of course
you're going to click on run and it's
going to open up the installation wizard
once again which means you're just going
to click Next a whole bunch of times
that's all perfectly fine perfectly fine
to have it in the programs file all this
you can leave exactly as it is that's
perfectly fine as well I like to change
it to use git from the windows command
prompt and click on next then we're
going to go to check out windows style
which is the default that's perfectly
fine click Next min TTY perfectly fine
next don't need to do anything here I
almost never use anything that's
experimental and click on next and it's
going to jump through there and install
everything for us and then it's going to
complete everything if you want to look
at the release notes click on that
otherwise check uncheck it and click on
finish now you're going to want to set
it up so that get is going to be in your
path so you could just come in here and
type in environment variables if you
just type in an environment down here
this guy is going to pop up and we're
going to click on that then you're going
to be able to come in and open up the
Advanced tab once again click on
environment variables and then mean both
of these paths make sure that you type
in C colon program files get backslash
and bin and then after you do that click
on OK now in your command prompt it's
going to be a good idea to shut the
command prompt down and then reinstall
it or reopen it whatever and then at
this point we're going to install Bower
and Bower is basically a package manager
that is used to download and maintain
multiple different third-party libraries
and you're going to come in here and
type in MPM install dash G followed by
Bower and this actually says Bower here
but the text is weird so it's the reason
why it doesn't show up and you see there
are no errors so that's perfectly fine
now you're going to need to come in here
and create some files so we're going to
go into our sample site directory right
like this we're going to keep complete
or create a file called Bower JSON and
this is exactly what you're going to
want to put inside of here name me and
version
dadadada dependencies and so forth and
then once again save that as bower dot
JSON in your sample site directory and
then once again you're going to create
another file this is going to be dot B o
wer are see there's it looks like an
extension but it isn't that's what
you're going to put inside of there and
you're going to type in directory and
public Lib exactly like that and once
again that's going to be saved in your
sample site directory another thing
since we're going to be installing
angular inside of your bower JSON file
make sure you have angular inside of
here and also make sure you have quotes
around everything and you're going to
want to save that as well once again if
you didn't do it you want to close down
your command prompt and open up a new
one to make sure that git is all set up
and you're going to want to change to
your sample site directory and then type
in Bower install and you're going to see
that it goes and creates our angular
files that we're going to be using and
then if you go into the sample site
public live angular that's where all
these files are going to be created you
can see them all there exactly how they
look now what you're going to want to do
is go into sample site public and delete
all the directories that are inside of
there except for the Lib directory and
then inside of public we're going to be
creating a brand new file and that's
going to be called application dot J s
right there sorry about the zooming I
just want to make sure that you see it
and what you're going to put inside of
there is main application module name
followed by mean and then what this guy
is going to do down here is bind a
function to the document whenever it's
hits you know the document meaning your
web application whenever the ready event
triggers and then in that situation it's
going to use bootstrap to start a new
angularjs application using our main
module and in my angularjs tutorial I'll
get more in regards to detailing exactly
what's going on there so save that as
application j/s once again we're going
to be saving that in our public
directory this guy right here so click
on save and now what you need to do is
include angularjs in your main layout
file so you're going to want to open up
your sample site views directory and in
and then specifically open up a layout
Jade and then inside of that you're
going to
make sure that everything is set up like
this you're going to want to make sure
you have ng - app is equal to and then
just two quotes and then more
specifically you want to make sure that
you come in here and link to angularjs
which is going to be saved on your
system as well as the application dot J
s file that you have set up and pay
particular attention to white space
because Jade is real picky about white
space and now we can also come in to our
index dot Jade file once again that's in
the views directory inside of sample
site and you're going to type in exactly
what you have right here what this is
going to allow us to do is to come in in
here and verify that angular is properly
installed and once again like I said
previously I'm going to go into how
angular U is used in my angularjs
tutorial which is going to be coming up
next and then if you go to localhost
colon 3000 after saving that and of
course making sure that no js' server
and your MongoDB server and all that
stuff's running you're going to be able
to come in here and type in Derrick or
whatever you want to type in and have
the hello part right here automatically
update as you type and there you go guys
now you have a mean stack setup pretty
easy
I know it's it can be a little bit
hair-pulling event but hopefully
everything made 100% sense and you were
able to walk through this tutorial
without any errors if not please leave
any questions you have or about errors
or whatever in the comment section below
and before we go one to send out a
special thank you to all my patreon
supporters I really couldn't make videos
anymore on YouTube if it wasn't for the
support that you guys are so awesome and
give so thank you thank you thank you
and like always please leave your
questions and comments below otherwise
