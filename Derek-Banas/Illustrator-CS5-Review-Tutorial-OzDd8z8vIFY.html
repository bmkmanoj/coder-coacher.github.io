illustrator cs5 tutorial and review here
I'm gonna show you all the new tools
that are available to you with
illustrator cs5 one of the most
interesting new tools available to you
with cs5 is the perspective grid you get
it by clicking on view perspective grid
and if it wasn't showing it would say
show grid and you would click on that
now what's neat about it is let's say I
want to take this smiley face and stick
it on the side here completely in
perspective well it's real easy all I do
is first off open up the grid then come
over here and click on perspective
selection tool drag it and it's gonna go
completely in perspective right there on
your screen
well another neat tool that's not new to
cs5 but it's a tool that I don't think
people use enough because they don't
understand it I'm gonna select this
image go to live trace and then instead
of make I'm going to go to tracing
options then I'm gonna select in the
preset over here color high fidelity and
then click on trace it's gonna give me
an illustrated version of the photo that
I use right here now what I'm going to
do is I'm gonna convert it convert it
into a live paint item go to Live Paint
click on make automatically does that
for me now I could actually go in and
select all these different colors make
changes to any of them and for what I'm
going to do here instead is to drag this
image over and throw it in perspective
on the side of this grid go to
perspective selection tool got it right
here and I can drag this over its gonna
automatically resize it and throw it on
the side of the perspective grid for me
now if I scale it it automatically
provides that while at the same time
still keeping it in perspective and you
can do this with any image or item that
is created with paths another new tool
available to you with Illustrator cs5 is
the ability to create custom brushes and
how you would do that let's just create
a general path like that now what I can
do by going into the width
tool click on that it's select it
automatically creates new points within
that path and edit it any way that I
want just like this now I'm just playing
around with it right here just to show
you the tools quickly as possible but
you can do some really neat little brush
strokes with it okay let's say that you
really like this in and out sort of
brush stroke go click up here click on
save give it a name click OK now let's
say we want to apply this brush stroke
to the smiley face
select the smiley face then go up here
find your new brush you created see it
says random to click on it and it'll
give you some different interesting
brush strokes again just like anything
in illustrator the more you play with it
the more you're going to be able to
create more interesting things and I'm
going through this tutorial mainly for
speed another really neat feature is
illustrator provides you with the
ability to actually paint inside of any
item so let's say I wanted to draw
inside of this firetruck I'm just going
to select one path like this I'm gonna
jump over here go to drawing modes click
on draw inside of course I'm gonna need
a stroke let's go over here to the blob
brush tool and this is also another new
feature that I'm showing you here there
are new brushes available to you and if
you click on new brush this is the new
brush the bristle brush and then you can
click on pick up anything you want I'm
just going to choose fan there's a bunch
of different options available to you to
edit the different brushes and now since
I have that paint inside checked
whenever I zigzag around inside here it
will only paint within this area that I
have selected so that's another new tool
available within illustrator not only
can you draw like I did here with this
firetruck but you can also copy and
paste directly into text without
outlining the text so let's say I wanted
to take my st. Bernard here
and cut and paste him directly into this
text over here all I have to do again I
selected the text and I chose draw
inside now I'm gonna come over here grab
my st. Bernard copy him go over to the
text again and paste and it will
automatically go directly into the text
that we have here it can resize this so
that it'll completely fit the text and
you can see the st. Bernard that I had
over here is now inside of the text and
a really neat feature is that I can
click on the text tool and as you can
see I put a space in there this is live
text and the st. Bernard is still seen
inside of their previous cs4 illustrator
gave us the ability to have multiple
artboards well now you have the ability
to edit and move around your artboards
you do that by clicking on window and
then clicking on artboards then you can
decide if you want to move your
artboards around like let's say I want
artboard 1 then I'll appear after
artboard 3 click on this and then click
on rearrange artboards and then ok and
it moved my artboards from one being
there and so forth and so on
also what I'm not showing in this
presentation they've made some amazing
changes in regards to what is called
flash catalyst and I mean I'm probably
gonna get involved with this in another
tutorial but it allows you to create web
pages directly inside of illustrator and
then import them directly into flash and
it is a really really really neat tool
and the final tool I'm gonna show you
here which is new with illustrator is
the ability to really easily combine
paths so you can see here that both of
these paths are separate but if I come
over here to the shape builder tool
click on that after I selected both of
these items I can just simply drag
through both of these paths and they'll
automatically be turned into one path
this keeps you from having to use the
Pathfinder tool all the time like you
previously had to
if you wanted to do something really
simple like that so that's basically my
rundown of all of the different features
available inside of Illustrator cs5 also
if you'd like me to do a tutorial on
flash catalyst leave me a comment down
below and I'll definitely get into that
till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
