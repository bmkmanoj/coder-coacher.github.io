21 of my android development tutorial
today I'm going to continue talking
about fragments fragment activities list
fragments adapters and a whole bunch of
other things
if you missed parts 18 19 and 20 you
should definitely watch those before you
watch this one because we're creating a
pretty big app and I provide a link in
the upper right hand corner if you want
to take a look at those well I have a
lot to do so let's get into it
okay in the previous tutorial basically
what we did we as we set up census app
and the fragment container and we moved
in contact fragment which was to provide
for the capability of adding information
regards to name and address and so forth
to each one of our contacts and this is
basically what it looked like whenever
we were done and if you can't see this
view at fullscreen this is an HD video
now what we're going to be doing is
making our contact list which is going
to hold all of our contacts and show
them all on the screen at the same time
to do that we're going to need to use an
adapter to connect to our all contacts
our array so that we'll be able to
display that information and we're going
to display that through an adapter like
I said before and whenever we do it this
is basically what it's going to look
like so let's jump over to the code and
start making it okay so here we are
inside of Eclipse and what I'm going to
do is go into the graphical layout and
start creating what each of the lists is
going to look like what each part for
each person that's in the contact list
so basically what I'm going to need to
do here is I'm just going to use
relative layout because this is for one
list item it isn't for all the list
items basically what I want is two text
views one's gonna be a name the other is
gonna be a street address this is all
temporary for now so I'm going to drop
that guy inside of there and then we can
jump over here and let's change this to
contact name because that's going to be
the contacts name something else I'd
like to do with this guy is actually put
some text inside of here instead of text
view of course so to do that we're going
to go into strings dot XML and here we
are so I want name to be displayed there
just temporarily is sort of like a junk
sort of box and I'm also going to want
to put a dress inside of there and also
a new title for this so might as well
just get the title out of the way first
off I'm going to call this fragment
this is a fragment contact list title
and we want to keep these in lowercase
letters of course and I'm just going to
put contacts in there for our title for
this and then I'm going to come in to
this guy right here and I'm going to
call this list item contact name and I'm
just going to put name insider like I
said this is just going to be temporary
it's not going to show up but I like to
have everything in place then what I'm
going to do is change this from name to
Street and then we're going to put
Street inside of there and file saves
strings.xml now we can jump back over
inside of here and I still have that
textview highlighted so I'm going to
come over here to the text area and
click on that and then I'm going to come
down here where it says contact name
exactly what I just made and now it's
going to show name inside of there then
underneath the name I want to get
another textview and that's we're going
to put our street address and drop that
guy inside of there and then jump over
here and I'm going to call this contact
street and then I can jump in here and
hit the text view and of course it's
going to pop up this I'd like to keep
that going so I always allow that to
occur jump back over into text view or
the text area and then we're going to
just select Street and there that is so
we got the name in the street now we
want to have a little check box on side
of there that's going to be whether we
contacted the person or not and it
doesn't have to have anything in it so
I'm just gonna grab check box and drag
it over here and
I don't know where it's gonna go let's
try just throwing it right there that
looks good enough and for its text well
first I won't come over here I guess I
am repeating myself a little bit but
that's okay I want to make sure you guys
understand this stuff this isn't a video
API like you would normally see I'm
literally making apps okay so contact
contacted checkbox is what that's gonna
be called and for the text I'm just
going to have this be nothing so we
don't have any text lips still there
there we go now it's going so now we
have nothing next to that checkbox we're
going to know that that means we the
contact the person or we didn't then
we'll jump back into the actual code of
this XML file and we'll take a look at
exactly what we got here so contact name
that's fine
with height wrap content you can see
right here where it has layout aligned
parent to the left true and then here it
has lined parent top true and that's
just positioning it relative to other
things margin left I'm just going to
take this out of here
and instead I'm going to say padding for
no apparent reason just just to do it
there we go and then I'm going to just
put some four DP padding around
everything there we go and then the
check box as well let's just put it here
and you can see a line bottom to contact
Street everything's relative to other
components that are on the screen jump
back here make sure it still looks
normal
yeah it looks good enough to me so I'll
save that and we're done now what we
need to do is go into contact list
activity Java and a lot of things inside
of this are going to be very similar to
the census app as they should be because
contact list activity is going to take
the place of census app in this
situation so basically we're going to
copy some stuff out of Census app put it
in the contact list activity and reuse
it so I'm going to come over here open
up this open up the source directory and
find census app there it is
and then we have ole bunch of stuff and
I'm just going to select everything copy
that
close this jump into contact list
activity paste that inside of there
let's just get rid of these comments and
then I'm going to select everything
inside of here and go into source and
correct indentation yes I know there's a
shortcut but I don't
new shortcuts and tutorials and then
this guy's going to just like census app
did it's going to extend fragment
activity if I'll save that those errors
go away like I said before the fragment
manager is going to add the fragments to
the activity view then on to on create
which is going to be called and this is
created of course we have the fragment
manager everything here is fine we're
just going to let that exactly the way
that it was we're going to check here if
it can find fragment container and you
saw previously in the slides that that
is where it's going to put our fragment
check if the fragment is found and if
the fragment wasn't found
then we must create it and in this
situation we're not going to have
contact fragment we are instead going to
have fragment contact list which you can
see right here say I replace contact
fragment which was in the Census app
with fragment contact list we're going
to make fragment contact list here in a
second and it's going to give an error
because it hasn't been created yet but
that's perfectly fine and then just like
previously we're going to use the
fragment manager to put it inside of the
fragment container inside of our
activity and that's all we need to do
with that guy so let's file save it and
now we're going to go and actually
create fragment contact list so here we
are inside a fragment contact list and
what this is going to do well first off
we need to extend list fragment and what
the list fragment is going to do is it's
going to display a list of items in a
list view and by binding to our array
list which we created previously in all
contacts we are then going to use an
array adapter inside of this class to
pull all the data out and throw it into
a ListView so to do so well first we got
to get the import this guy and then
we're going to come down here and we are
going to of course need to have our
ArrayList and it is full of contacts and
I'm going to call it contact list and
get these libraries and then because it
didn't show up inside here I'm going to
right click and I'm going to go into
source and then I'm going to come down
here and go override and implement
methods and then inside of this I'm
going to scroll down into fragment and
go and find on create what
the bundle and I'm gonna say hey
generate that for me and hit okay just
do this stuff so much eventually it just
sort of spills out of you and that's
sort of the goal this tutorial is to
show you things so many times that you
can just do it okay now remember we
previously wanted to change the title
for our current activity that's what we
did over here strings.xml
fragment contact list title so let's
just copy that jump back over into this
if you want to change that you just go
get activity which is our current
activity and set the title and then
we're going to go since we want
something out of the strings.xml file
we're going to go string and then we're
going to paste in fragment contact list
title and that's going to throw that
title in there just like we want it so
there's another thing you know how to do
now then we have to get to the array
list from all contacts and to do that
we're going to a contacts list is equal
to all contacts and we're going to say
get and to get it we have to go get
activity since this is global we can do
that and then we can say get contact
list and there we go now we have our
ArrayList and it's ready to go then what
we're going to do is create contact
adapter we're actually going to extend
the arrayed adapter here in one second
and we're going to call it contact
adapter so it's a customized adapter new
contact adapter and then we're going to
pass inside of it our contact list our
ArrayList then after we get that back
and it's ready to be put on the screen
to provide the data for the ListView
we're going to call set list adapter and
that's going to connect the adapter to
our ListView and of course we have to
pass in the adapter otherwise what we're
doing it and there we go now after this
we're going to create a private class
and it's called contact adapter and tell
you a bit about adapters here once I get
going and it's going to extend the REA
adapter with contacts inside of it
we'll go get those libraries as well and
basically what an adapter is going to do
is it's going to act as a bridge between
an adapter view and the data for that
view and the adapter also makes a view
for each item in the data set
our each list item in our list view so
remember whenever we created this guy
list item contact ID XML it's going to
create one of these named streets and
check boxes for each item it pulls out
of our ArrayList now our constructor
adapter is going to of course get passed
the ArrayList that is going to be full
of contact objects and call this
contacts and then we are going to have
to call the parent constructor and it's
going to be passed a context using get
activity and that's going to be used so
that it will be able to use the resource
being the simple list item and then
we're going to call Android our layout
dot simple list item one right there
there it is we'll scroll that up a bit
and this is just going to be a
predefined layout that is provided by
Android that's going to stand in as a
default until we get ours built and then
finally we pass in contacts which is our
ArrayList this guy right here now what
we need to do is to define or create get
view and I'm just going to go in here
because I'm lazy and go down here
override implement methods and then
inside of array adapter we're going to
say get view that's what we want click
on that and throw it in there and
there's get view
now get view is going to be called each
time it needs to display a new item on
the screen because of scrolling for
example it doesn't pull in all of these
list items at once because that would be
kind of taxing so what it does is every
single time it needs a new list item in
our list view it calls get view and the
adapter is going to be asked for the new
list row and get view is basically just
going to provide it now in regards to
what these guys are going to do right
here position is going to represent the
position in the array from which we will
be pulling data and then you have
convert view which is a pre created list
item that will be reconfigured in the
code that we're going to cover below and
then view
Roop finally is our list field so that's
what's being passed into get view and
then we want to check if this is a
recycled list item and if not we are
going to inflate it and to do so well
we're going to call convert view which
is a list item and check if it's equal
to null and if it is we're going to say
well convert view call get activity to
inflate it and go get layout inflator
and then we're going to call inflate and
we're going to go and use the list item
contact which is this guy up here
remember look at it again this guy right
here named street and check box that's
what that's right and to get that we
just go layout dot and it's list and all
the code is available in the description
in the for this video of course contact
and then pass an all inside of it okay
after that is setup and we have inflated
it we need to find the right data to put
in our list item so to do that we go
truant act and contact is equal to and
we need to get the proper item which is
provided in position that was passed
inside of this so it's going to get the
right contact out of our ArrayList and
then basically everything else is pretty
easy we just have to put the right data
in the right boxes so we need a textview
and i'm going to call this contact name
textview and it's going to be equal to
well we have to convert this or cast it
to a textview and convert view and to
get it we have a fine view by ID and
it's named contact name we just made
that and there you go and we have to get
this library of course and then after
that we go contact name text view and
set the proper name and we get that from
the contact that we got and then we call
get name there we go we just set the
text you pretty easy and then we get
this guy right here and copy it because
we got to do the same thing for street
so instead call this street textview and
this is a textview
except this is going to be contact
street and then this is going to be
street textview and set text well we're
going to go street
address and then that set and then we
need to set up our check box check box
and I'm going to call it contacted check
box and we need to cast it of course and
then we're going to use this guy again
so there's no use in typing it out get
it by ID paste that in there and this is
contact contacted checkbox and then we
go do it yeah got the right now
even it was kind of ridiculous and then
get this library and then to set our
check box and just get this guy right
here remember it's a boolean so it's
either going to be true or false or
checked or unchecked and set checked to
they'll contact get contacted I think
that's right yep and then after we're
done with that of course we need now
that we have the whole entire list item
set up properly we just go and take it
and return it and that's it unless I
have an error here which it looks like I
do up get layout inflator it's me
spelling inflator wrong again I do that
all the time don't know why ok save and
we are done with fragment contact list
now to set it up so that instead of
opening up census view it's instead
going to open up contact list activity
this guy right here what we need to do
or what I'm going to do temporarily in
the future it's going to be changed with
a menu system I'm going to go into the
census app manifest and I'm going to
leave the census app inside of here but
I'm actually going to copy this I'm
going to sort of get rid of census app
being called by default and to do that
I'm just going to comment it out because
that's easy for me to do like I said
we're going to make this cleaner later
just want to cover as much as possible
and then this guy we're going to change
this we don't want to open up the census
app by default whenever the application
is opened we want to open up contact
list activity so that's what we're going
to do and we don't need to change
anything else this is basically going to
open that up by default and there we go
and we are done so we can file save it
and execute and you can see whenever we
go to execute it contact list activity
is actually shown there not
comes because we changed our manifest
and when this guy runs you can see that
Paul Smith Silas Smith Mark Smith all
show up in a nice list exactly like we
wanted so that is a whole bunch of
information like I said before all the
code is available in a link in the
