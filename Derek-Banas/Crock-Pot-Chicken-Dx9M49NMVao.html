time how hard it is to cook so today I'm
going to show you just how easy it is to
roast a chicken first you're going to
need two stalks of celery you want to
chop them up I like to cut these head
into nice thick pieces so there's almost
no work they're involved in that and on
top of that you can end up with some
really good chicken broth when it's all
done then I got some fresh parsley you
could use regular parsley like I said
this is extremely easy then I'm going to
take some carrots this is roughly two
carrots and again I'm going to leave
these nice and big and Hardy because
that's how it's going to work the best
real simple then I got some fresh basil
again you can use dried basil just big
handful right to move those aside and
keep our herbs separated from these
vegetables then you're going to get two
onions move the skins cut off the edge
with the skin from the second on you
then cut the onion into quarters take
this onion cut it into AIDS again we
want this to be real hearty and we have
to prep our chicken and here it is my
chicken this is a four three four pound
chicken and then we have to find the fun
bits inside I don't eat this but if you
want to earth chicken neck and chicken
liver my heart longs um digging around
inside of it when I have a real sharp
knife and cut off this knack the tearin
up again my wife always has me cut off
this n skin if you wonder this is the
same knife they use in the TV show
dexter called a future a Mundell there
you are seconds all pretty much set up
now what we're going to do is we're
going to brush on some olive oil and I
always put it legs down so I'm going to
just put some olive oil on this guy
brush it all over them hit it with some
sea salt it was some tougher and this is
cracked pepper with you know these
doohickeys you don't need that but I
have it so I'm just using it regular
peppers fine and hit it with some of our
herbs try to get them to stick if you
can pat it on there and we're going to
take the onions that week ordered shut
them up inside of this guy kind of a
little chicken song can't get them all
in there then I have a basic crock pot
this thing cost 30 box it's a regular
crock-pot slow cooker it just one reward
for being the best one even though it's
only 30 bucks and most of the other ones
or severally more expensive hit it was
small of oil brush it on there again
this is mainly to get to stick all the
herbs it was more sea salt some more
pepper we're almost done it with some
more herbs these are fresh best
investment you can make pretty much
because herbs cost so much money in the
grocery store and cost like next time
nothing to grow ground again that's just
parsley and basil my wife likes dried
oregano so just
throw some honor and take your onions
throw them in there there's some carrots
too awesome in there again and there's
your silver II know you're going to get
yourself six cups of water do it in
there might end up being a actually
there's 11 cups of water it's estimated
there and you put the lid on a guy know
if you can see this but I'm setting at
the high and I'm going to cook it for 1
hour exactly on high then after that our
I'm going to switch it to low and cook
it for an additional six hours and when
that's all done you will have a finished
it and here we are after first cooking
it on high for one hour and then letting
it sit and totally ignoring it the next
six hours on well you can see how nice
this chicken is and how it just breaks
apart from the bone absolutely delicious
and on top of that you're going to have
right around a gallon and a half of
chicken broth which is always very
useful you've any questions or comments
below otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
