9 of my java video tutorial series today
because of a lot of messages I've
received I'm going to cover arrays and
how to use them inside of Java first
what we're going to do is we're going to
import an array library that we're going
to use later on right like that and I
trust you know how to do that cause you
guys are smart and then we're gonna go
Java lesson 9 is the name of our class
and then we're gonna go to a public
static Boyd and everything you ever
wanted to know about a race is gonna be
covered here we'll be able to jump back
into our video game and then you'll know
what to do if you don't know what I mean
by video game watch part 8 but you
should probably watch part 9 first
because it makes more sense alright so
if you want to declare an array and just
to make this really easy to understand
an array is a variable that can hold a
whole bunch of different values and you
can think of an array as just a big box
filled with a whole bunch of other
little boxes and each of those boxes has
a number on it and that number is called
an index number and you use the index in
collaboration with the array variable
name or field name to locate those
individual values now if you want to
declare an array every single array can
only have one type of data in it so
here's an integer array and I'm just
going to call this random array and
though these variable names don't have
any meaning at all it's also important
to know that an array has a fixed size
so once you declare it or create that
array and you tell it how big you want
it to be it cannot be changed and also
an array is an object which really
doesn't really matter but I thought I
should bring that up so here we declared
an array well you can't use it until you
define how big it is
so number array is equal to new and then
you just go int 10 and the 10 here is
how big your array is so it's going to
contain 10 individual values inside of
it it's how you do it every single time
now you can have anything in an array
just as long as everything in the array
is exactly the same and you can add
values to this array in numerous
different ways so let's jump back into
my random array which I've already
declared above so I don't need to
declare it again but I do need to go new
and say how big it's going to be and
little integer part on there so now
let's go and add a value to one of those
boxes and the whole box concepts going
to make a lot of sense here in a minute
there in the
the part of my random array that is the
index one I'm going to give it the value
of two which is an integer so you can
put the little values in there that way
you could also say create an array full
of strings and I'll just call this
string rank is equal to without defining
how big the array is you can just start
putting things in here so just random
words
you know ports put your double quotes
around this thing so that Java knows
this is a string so this right here what
I just did
says that there's going to be three
items in the array and it's forever
going to be three items now you can go
in and change these values but this also
is a way to declare or create an array
for yourself now one of the most common
ways to add values is through a loop so
let's do that
so we'll go int I is equal to and 0
every array unless you specifically
don't want it to be will start out in
the zero index then 1 2 3 4 5 don't
worry if you don't understand that in a
second you will because I'm going to
show you all this in like a little
pretty sort of format and if you want to
get the length or the number of items in
the array you just type in the rain' aim
followed by length and then don't forget
to increment it be getting a whole bunch
of questions about incrementing inside
of loops for some reason so that's how
you do that so now let's take our number
array input I inside of it that's the
iterator or the value that's going to
continue to change going to start out at
0 and it's going to go until it reaches
the point where it can no longer
continue and we're going to just assign
the value of whatever is to set array
there's another way to add values to an
array and now I'm going to create
something here that's going to sort of
give you an idea of what an array
actually looks like so let's say I want
to go and I want to create some lines to
make like a box so I'm gonna go wild and
I'm going to go K is less than or equal
to it I'm going to say 41 I don't need
to put that in there and then all on one
line I'm just going to go
system.out.print and I'm gonna put
myself some dashes inside of there close
that off and then increment K right like
that all on one line and of course
system out dot print line and I'm going
to use this kind of cheat as a new line
and just so you see what I'm doing here
let's just execute this there you go I
drew up a whole bunch of lines on the
screen nothing that crazy
alright so now with sort of
drive exactly what an array is so I'm
going to go for int I'm gonna go J is
equal to zero
J less than number array length J
increment J and I'm going to go
system.out.print and I'm gonna put a
little or sign in there plus J plus put
some spaces inside of there close that
out and then jump down here and I'm
gonna go system.out.print line I'm gonna
close off my little box now you're gonna
see what an array looks like and this is
literally what it looks like there you
go there's your array real nice and easy
to understand now all it is is a bunch
of values inside of boxes there you are
and I just put these little things in
here to sort of demonstrate exactly how
that would work
here's the zero index there's the 1
index there's the 2 and so forth up to 9
understand that we went and we said
there was going to be 10 items in here
and there is however there's not space
for both 0 and 10 so that's the reason
why you get what you get there now I'm
going to show you what I mean by a
multi-dimensional array now you can
actually have a raise not just
individual values inside here and
they're just going to stretch down this
way multi-dimensional it's going to not
one-dimensional but two-dimensional so
what do I got to do I got to create it
and all I need to do is say that I want
to put it in two brackets that's saying
this is going to be a two-dimensional
array and it's just call it multi array
and then you just go new and then string
just like we did before and let's say
that we want to put 10 inside here so 10
elements okay now let's go and actually
add values to this guy so I'm going to
go int I is equal to 0 again I less than
multi right followed by length which
means it's going to be the same size as
that array and we have to create a new
for loop now if I want to load up
everything in this side of this guy and
in J is equal to 0 well J is less than
multi array and you're gonna put aa
inside here what's what is this okay
what it's saying is alright whenever we
have lengths up here it's saying how
long is this guy ten elements well
whenever we have multi array and we put
I inside of there it's saying how long
think of a column here you're going to
say it in a picture form in a second
it's going to make total sense but you
have to put that inside of there so
you're saying how
long is this well it's going to kick
back one since there's only one item in
there but we're going to change that
because up here we defined 10 so we
already know the answer to our question
and then create another for loop multi
right and I'm going to go I J Here I am
I'm just assigning the values just like
we did before except in this situation
we go I plus put a space in between
there just you can see exactly what's
going on okay so what we did error is we
assigned values to this array so now
what we're going to do is we'll kick
them out so make sure you jump out of
this both of these for loops jump down
here and then I'm going to want to print
some lines out across the screen so I'm
going to copy this jump down here and
now we're going to print everything out
onto the screen except this is going to
change the 61 I believe everything else
can say exactly the same and then I can
also copy this stuff here so let's go
and copy it as I'm spitting them out and
I'm going to spit them out in exactly
the same way that I put them in there
all right so we're just creating another
for loop here
and then inside of here what we're going
to do is we're going to go system out
and you can download all the code it's
underneath this video be much easier to
understand what I'm doing if you have
the code and we're just going to make
this a little bit pretty so multi array
and I'm going to go I and I'm doing here
saying I want whatever is in those
indexes and then here I'm going to put a
space again it's purely there to
prettify this or whatever make it look
like a whole bunch boxes and then to
make it really look like a whole bunch
of boxes I'm going to copy this guy up
here again actually made a little bit of
steak you can't define this integer
twice so let's get rid of that so that's
fine and that's cool that you got to see
that because it makes sense now
and then let's copy this again jump down
here on it out of our floor loop or that
out screen and let's run it now you're
going to see what a multi-dimensional
array looks like and there is a
multi-dimensional array but one thing
that I should have done here is actually
command get system.out.print line and
underneath of this go like that so that
everything lines up a little bit better
and we have everything like a
multi-dimensional right and there you
see our multi-dimensional array and you
see how everything's laid out see this
is for I right here this is for I so
what it's doing is it's incrementing J
here's the J values and it's just
putting everything here on the screen
all based off of what the index is for
those individual compartments for our
right now there's other different things
we can do with race
of course you can use the enhanced for
loop to print on array values and how
that works is just go for and then int
is going to be whatever type of values
this array holds row is going to be a
temporary placeholder it's going to hold
the values as you chuck them out of the
array and then number a is an array that
we defined and you see that and then
we're going a system print and you just
go row which is the temporary holding so
for that value copy that
throw that down there and I've got an
asked us a whole bunch of times this is
how you do a newline or add two spaces
execute and there you can see it printed
out all of the values currently stored
in the array called number array now if
you want to do the same thing which is
use the enhanced for-loop
with a multi-dimensional array this is
something that's kind of tricky but I
think I can explain it basically you're
going to follow this format so let's say
we got our string that we created before
which is a multi-dimensional right
you're still going to go in this
situation I'm putting rows inside of
there because of already used row up
here don't want to cause confusion and
then let's go multi array right like
that then what you need to do is put
another one of these enhanced for loops
in here except this time we're gonna go
string and not with the array part there
and then I'm going to say column : rows
now inside of this enhanced for-loop I'm
just gonna copy this so let's scroll up
here get this guy copy paste and then
we're also going to copy this and paste
this at the end of this for loop you're
gonna say it's going to print out this
exact same thing
oops oh and that didn't go through and
the reason why is this is what I want to
put in here no multi array like we did
before column is going to be storing the
string that I want to print out to the
screen so I'm just going to change this
to call them and you can see this time
that it printed out the
multi-dimensional array just as it did
up here and let me just get a little bit
more into exactly what's going on here
because this is a little bit complicated
or at least it could be hard to
understand if you want to use the
enhanced for what you need to do is go
for and then what you're going to follow
that up with is the data type and then
you're going to have those brackets just
like we always had before but then
you're going to have the variable for
the row that's what's going to go there
then colon and then the array name this
is the part that's probably maybe
confusing you the variable for the row C
whenever it's print
out the value of rose starts out at zero
and it remains zero as you can see Rose
only changes once and then the column
changes numerous different times so this
guy right here is creating this row of
values well this guy down here is
creating the zero and the one the two as
you can see the individual columns for
said row and then just simply what you
would do down here for this guy is do
exactly the same sort of thing
you're gonna let me just copy that paste
it in in this situation because you're
going to print out a value now which is
the string that's these two things
together you're not going to need the
array it is a string it's not a array
type and then you're going to go the
variable for the column and then the
array name itself so hopefully that
makes sense if it doesn't leave a
comment below and I'll try to explain it
better but just understand if this isn't
all confused you this is something
you're not going to do very often and
this is kind of a weird sort of thing to
do with an enhanced for-loop
now you can do it obviously and it's
kind of useful but it's nothing to fret
about if you don't quite get it don't
worry about it now up here way at the
top the first thing I did was imported
this little library well now I'm going
to show you why I did that
you can copy an array in a bunch of
different ways let's just come in here
and let's just create a new array and
let's call it number copy if you want to
copy the array named number all right
just put in a raised dot and then follow
that up with copy of which is a method
then you go number all right and then
you tell it well how many different
things do I want to copy from the
beginning of this array and if it's five
well then that's what you do you just
copy the first five elements which is
going to be 0 1 2 3 4 that's what it's
going to do and if we just jump up here
to this guy right here I could print
that out the screen you're gonna see
exactly what it means
throw in the Enhanced for this is number
copy and I guess this is another way to
make an array because there's another
one so as you can see there's a whole
bunch of different ways to make arrays
and then let's just go and be crazy and
you can see 0 1 2 3 4 so you copied the
first 5 spaces from that other array so
there's a way to copy arrays and also
another way you can do it
you can just copy part of an array so
you can go like array and use copy of
and then use copy of range instead so
let's say that you wanted to copy from
the number array like we did before but
you want to start at the third index and
you want to go through till the sixth
that's how you do it so that is copy of
and then if you want to copy a range
which means you want to start at a
specific place and end at a specific
place you use another method the copy of
range method another thing you can do is
if you want to print out a whole entire
array you can do that as well how you do
that is just type in I'll raise dot to
string and then let's say number or copy
and there you see it right there
that's what this does it prints out the
entire array with all the values out
onto the screen and that is what two
string does for you
now before I showed you how to define a
default value for all the other arrays
this is in part eight of this tutorial
now I'm going to show you again so let's
go create ourselves an integer array and
we'll call it nor more numbers is equal
to new int and let's say it has a
hundred values inside of it now if you
want to fill those with just random
values or not random values actually a
defined value let's go to new monomers
which is the name of the array that we
just created here and let's say
everything wants to have the value of
two well there you are fill just did
that for you it's going to put two in
there as the default value for every
single item that's in the array name
more numbers and like I showed you
before if you wanted to do this like for
a game board like we were working on
before and we want to do like characters
inside of this well you could call this
board game and go equal to new character
remember this is a multi-dimensional
array and I'm just going to say ten by
ten and you can use the enhanced
for-loop to do the same thing so we're
going to go character and you have to
put the little brackets inside of there
and then we can go row and then we can
go board game and then come down here
and call arrays fill again in this
situation or what we did before type in
row inside of there and then you could
go and put a bracket and a star inside
of there which
what I did before so that's the way you
would do any fill with a default value
of star for a multi-dimensional array
using an enhanced for-loop and you know
that now so you were really smart and
seriously you're smart a lot of people
have no idea how to do this stuff you
can also sort an array using a nice
method that comes with the arrays
library and here I'm going to create a
new one and go new int 10 items inside
of it and if I want to generate an array
full of random numbers for example I can
go for int I is equal to 0 I less than
10 in this situation I could have put
lengthen error but whatever all right so
what this for loop is going to do is
it's going to generate an array that's
going to have a bunch of random values
in and I'll just say nomes to sort
bracket put I inside of there is equal
to and then I want to cast whatever the
random number thing does so I'm going to
put the integer in there and cast just
means that I want to convert whatever
this guy does on write into an integer
making sure that it doesn't have any
decimal places in and hundred inside of
there is going to kick out a number
between 0 and 99 so that's just gonna do
all that which is nice another thing you
just learned is how to create an array
full of random numbers well I can sort
all those numbers in ascending order by
calling a raise sort and n gnomes to
sort and it's just going to do it for me
in the most efficient way imaginable and
let's just go system out and then I'm
going to show you the to string again
gnomes to sort and of course the whole
system right and as you can see it did
it shot out 1333 4 you see everything's
sorted all real nice and a nice order
that's how that works and then for the
last thing there's the binary search
which is going to return the index for
the search value if it finds it or
otherwise is going to return a negative
number that's very important a negative
number not a specific negative number so
let's say where is 50 is equal to and
I'm going to call rays and binary search
and gnomes to sort and I'm going to say
that I want to be able to come in here
and find the value of 50 if it exists
and if it doesn't well then we won't
find a value of 50 copy this save
themselves time and we go where is 50
boom
when it shot back negative seven because
why because 51 exists but 50 doesn't
exist so there are all the main sort of
things you're going to do with arrays
inside of Java if you didn't quite catch
everything leave a comment below or send
me any questions that you have or
download code or do whatever you want to
do up next having decided I'm going to
continue doing the game or get into
ArrayList I guess you'll find out next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
