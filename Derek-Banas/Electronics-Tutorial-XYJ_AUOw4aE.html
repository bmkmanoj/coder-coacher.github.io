1 of my electronics tutorial in this one
tutorial I'm going to show you how to
build a Threepenny radio on a breadboard
and explain exactly how it works and
because this is an introductory video on
electronics I'm going to be covering a
bunch of topics sometimes with a lot of
detail some with just a little bit of
detail just to get you in the mood and
to keep it fun so specifically what I'm
going to be covering is electricity of
course conductors current voltage power
resistors using breadboards LEDs semi
conductors Ohm's law electromagnetic
waves
now microphones work carrier waves farad
rod antennas integrated circuits
piezoelectric earphones and variable
capacitors once again I'm going to cover
some in a lot of detail some in a little
bit of detail but the whole idea this
tutorial is just to have fun so if you
guys have never heard of a Threepenny
radio this is a Threepenny radio that I
personally made I'm gonna make one on a
breadboard though instead because I
think it'll be a little bit more simple
because sometimes it won't work if the
pennies aren't clean enough and so forth
and so on so I'm gonna be building one
in a breadboard and I'm going to jump
over and show you exactly how that works
right now so here is the circuit that we
will be building as well as explaining
in this tutorial and you'll hear it
right now
okay so you saw the final product and as
this tutorial continues I'm going to
show you how everything works but let's
first off define exactly what is
electricity electricity is simply the
movement of electrons through a
conductor more specifically electrons
move towards a positive force through a
good conductor and if you connect a
conductor to both ends of battery
electrons will flow from the negative to
the positive terminals and this movement
of electrons is known as current which
has the symbol of an uppercase I now an
electrical current is going to exist
when electrons move through a substance
and we measure it in terms of the number
of electrons that pass a point in a
second now an ampere is the unit of
measure for current and 1 ampere is
equal to approximately six point two
eight times ten to the power of 18
electrons passing a point per second so
a ton of electrons now an example of a
good conductor would be a metal like
copper as you can see right here while a
bad one would be something like diamond
which I sort of kind of represent with
the carbon atoms that you see on the
right side of your screen now resistance
is going to measure how easily electrons
can move through a substance now what
you see here with these circles is what
is referred to as the electron shell and
the electron shell configuration of an
atom determines if something is a good
conductor or isn't now if the outer
shell can accommodate many electrons it
is a good conductor as you can see
copper is right here now the way
electron shells work is you can fit two
electrons in the first shell eight in
the second 18 and the third and 32 in
the fourth and they keep getting bigger
and bigger but I'm going to stick with
fourth because that's how many copper
has your on our screen now copper is a
good conductor because it has 31 empty
spaces in its fourth shell there's only
one electron there which means once
again it can accommodate 31 additional
electrons a carbon molecule however can
easily fill its four empty spaces in
it's just fourth shell as a comparison
so what is voltage voltage which is
represented by the capital
Vee is the force being applied to a
current volts is the unit of measure for
an electro-motive force which occurs
whenever you have a buildup of excess
negative number of electrons in one
place or a shortage of electrons in
another place which would come out as
being a positive charge now I'm going to
jump over and show you a video in which
I use a digital multimeter to measure
the voltage going through a battery and
you can see right here if I put the dial
on the V with a straight line underneath
it for direct current I can measure it
comes to 1.6 now to clear all that up
I'm going to use a common symbol
basically the only new thing here is
power which is going to represent the
work performed by an electrical current
in this situation it's going to be the
work that is needed to turn it turbine
but to bring it all together if you had
a water tower with a nozzle on it the
released water onto a turbine which
spins in this situation you would have
voltage being equal to the amount of
water in the tower current would be
equal to the amount of water passing
from the nozzle resistance would be the
size of the nozzle and power once again
would be the spinning of the turbine so
what specifically is a resistor a
resistor is going to reduce the flow of
current and voltage as you saw in the
little diagram that I just showed you
and you're going to be able to figure
out their value by turning them so the
either the gold or silver strip is on
the right in this situation I have a
gold strip on my sample resistor silver
is going to mean that the value is
accurate within 10% while gold is going
to mean that it is accurate within five
percent of all the other strips that are
on the left side of screen if you have a
resistor however that has no gold or
silver strip turn the resistor so that
the strips are on the left side then
you'll be able to use all of these rules
that I have here on the screen if you
figure out exactly what the resistance
is on your resistor so in this specific
example we're going to start from the
left and figure out exactly what the
resistance is on this sample resistor so
the first strip here is yellow so we
would come over and find yellow right
here and we would see that a first part
of our resistance would equal 4 then we
would come right here and look at this
color and we would see that that's drawn
that means the resistance is going to
start out with four and eight then we
would come to this third little bar that
we have here and see that it's brown and
see that that has only one zero so what
that's going to mean is our resistance
is going to be four hundred and eighty
ohms and because this is gold we'll know
that whenever we check this with a
multimeter that it's going to come
within five percent of that 480 ohm
number now I'm going to jump over and
show you exactly what it would look like
if we measured the resistance not using
the colors but instead with a multimeter
and now you can see I have the Doucet -
the symbol for ohms and I can just put
my terminals on there and it comes out
to approximately 480 now I'm going to
jump back to that video here in a second
and show you exactly how we would use a
breadboard as well as resistors and two
light LEDs but first I think we should
talk about LEDs or light emitting diodes
to understand an LED you have to however
first understand what a semiconductor is
a semiconductor is going to have a
conductivity that comes either between
being an insulator which would be a bad
conductor or a metal which would be a
good conductor and a semiconductor can
have positively charged carriers called
holes or negatively charged carriers
called electrons a hole quite simply is
just an atom with more positive protons
than negative electrons and in this
situation an LED is going to contain a
positively charged semiconductor
separated from a negatively charged
semiconductor with a transition layer in
between and whenever you apply enough
voltage these two are going to meet in
the middle and in that situation you're
going to release energy or light or a
photon and that's how we produce light
with an LED now the higher the current
the brighter an LED will get until it
burns out and if we want to get into the
specifics of when an LED is going to
burn out that would occur in a situation
in which the transition layer which lies
between the positive and negative semi
conductors breaks down when too much
current flows through it and in some way
damages it so the dled can no longer
create photons or light and specifically
if you want to know exactly the
different parts of an LED the law
y're is known as the anode which would
be connected to the positive flow of
current through our circuit
well the shorter is known as the cathode
which has a negative and as you're going
to see now in the video we're going to
use resistors to limit the current to
protect our LEDs and you can see right
here I'm able to wire my breadboard by
putting in the black or the negative
line inside of there which is going to
shoot down six volts the whole way down
that row underneath of the blue line and
I have a jumper wire that then goes to a
resistor that is then going to go to the
LED and then across the board to the
positive terminal and you're also able
to see how resistance changes the
brightness of the LEDs at the top where
it is the least bright that's a 2000m
resistor and then a thousand and then
480 so how exactly did I know what type
of resistor to use to protect our LEDs
well it all comes down to the wonderful
Ohm's law which you can see right here
we can figure out voltage if we have
current and resistance we can figure out
current if we have voltage and
resistance we can figure out resistance
if we have voltage and current we can
also figure out power if we have voltage
and current or power if we have current
and resistance so let's say I want to
protect my led by not going above 15
milliamps or that would work out to
approximately 0.01 five amperes for my
total current what I would do is I would
plug in six volts because I am using for
1.5 volt batteries and I would divide
that by 0.01 five amperes and that would
give you a resistance which would work
out the 400 ohms so that means if I want
to protect my LED which I am assuming
can't receive more than 15 milliamps or
0.01 5 amperes of current I want to use
a resistor that has 400 or more ohms in
it and as you saw in the video
previously I went and used a 480 ohms
resistor and you can see the results
here a one thousand and a two thousand
and as you also saw the higher the
resistance the less bright the LED lit
now let's get into exactly how our radio
is going to work and then I'll show you
how to build every
now basically radio waves are just a
form of light that we cannot see we make
radio waves by moving electrons up and
down an antenna in our radio example
here and when an electron moves from
atom to atom in a conductor it leaves a
hole in that atom and we talked about
holes previously once again a hole is an
atom with more protons than negative
electrons and electrons are going to
produce what we call an electrical field
you can see a representation of this
right here and you can further imagine
how electrons would create a wave if you
imagine an electron bouncing on a
trampoline like here creating a wave
okay just imagine this electrons
bouncing up and down on that field now
the length of each wave is what we would
call a wave a length so from this point
right here to this point right here and
the number of waves that occur over a
fixed length is going to define the
waves frequency now a radio transmitter
from a radio station is going to produce
waves at a specific frequency and it's
then our job as the receiver to tune
into that frequency now these waves are
going to be sent in all directions from
an omnidirectional antenna in most
situations and these waves can bounce
off of objects or even the atmosphere a
receivers job is going to be to specify
the radio waves at once to receive and
then we're going to define the radio
waves we want to receive based on the
number of wraps on our ferrite coil as
I'll show you here in a minute so that
brings us to the origin of sound before
we get to the receiver let's talk about
how we actually take the person in the
radio station who is speaking and
convert that into an electrical signal
now sound as it comes out of our mouth
is going to cause air molecules to
vibrate in a way that produces waves and
these waves are going to hit the
diaphragm of a microphone and the
diaphragm is going to vibrate and as it
does the resistance changes in the
microphone so that the flow of electrons
both increase as well as decrease this
is going to create a pulsating current
that looks like a wave sign waver and as
the waves increase and decrease in size
they're going to create an alternating
current so that brings us to how do we
send that sound
well a carrier wave is going to transmit
the sound over long distances using a
specific frequency so as not to in
career with other carrier waves that are
also sending very important information
and the conversion of the sound we want
to send to this specific where you can
see is called modulation I'll get more
into modulation later as well as
anything else that might confuse you
here in further tutorials now the
current is then amplified to send
electromagnetic waves which are going to
contain our sound over long distances so
now I want to jump over and actually
create our breadboard version of a
Threepenny radio now I'm going to
connect my black lead into the negative
port and the red lead into the positive
port on the breadboard and you can see
right here I have my farad antenna and
how I'm going to add terminals to the
end of it and basically the way a
ferrite rod antenna works is it's used
by most portable transistor broadcast
receivers because the antenna is compact
and it is made by wrapping a coil around
an iron based magnetic ferrite rod and
the ferrite intensifies the magnetic
field inside of the loop so that we can
tune in to it and where of course we're
going to use a variable capacitor to do
so and the variable capacitor is going
to set the resonance frequency also
known as tuning the radio and it's going
to allow us to block a frequency or a
range of frequencies and act as a filter
so that the target frequency is clear
and this is the piezo earphone I'm
actually going to jump over to slide and
explain how it works so you saw a piezo
earphone and I just want to get into a
little bit more specifics in regards to
how it actually takes a signal and
converts it back into sound now a piezo
earphone is used to turn electric
signals into sound and it contains a
brass disk which is coded in barium
titanate ceramic and whenever an
electrical signal hits it the ceramic is
going to bend the brass disc back and
forth vibrating the diaphragm and then
the diaphragm is going to convert
vibrations into sound just like the
sound waves from your mouth previously
back in the radio station
we're converted in an electrical signal
basically it does this by vibrating
against air which creates sound waves
and then the plastic tip sends the sound
into your ear canal and now I can start
building everything I'm going to start
off with a one hundred thousand own
resistor which is brown black yellow and
I'm going to plug it in the i-9
and j17 terminals and then I'm going to
add a 1000 ohm resistor brown black red
and I'm going to plug that into the I 17
and I 20 terminals on the breadboard
I'll then add a point O 1 micro farad
capacitor which is marked with a 103 as
you can see right there and I'm going to
put that in the G 9 and G 15 terminals
in the breadboard and I'll cover more on
capacitors in a later tutorial I'm then
going to be adding 2 point 1 micro farad
capacitors which were marked with a 104
which you might be able to see there if
you squint really close and the first
one's going to go in the f15 and F
and that brings me to the MK 4 84 Radio
integrated circuit now an integrated
circuit or microchip is going to contain
many resistors capacitors etc that in
this situation are going to convert AC
to DC and amplify the sound among other
things the IC also contains a crystal
that's going to receive an alternating
current from an antenna and reject half
that alternating current turning it into
direct energy if it hadn't converted
that into a direct current the waves out
of the alternating current would cancel
each other out the coil also is going to
generate electricity as distant radio
waves hit it and an amplifier in this IC
is going to use the coils electricity
plus the electricity from the battery to
increase the sound and the final thing
that this IC is going to do that's very
beneficial is it contains an automatic
gain control which determines how much
amplification to use and for example a
weak station is going to receive more
amplification while a stronger station
is going to receive less which is going
to avoid the need for a volume control
in this situation and we're going to
place this in the row of H starting at
15 16 17 with the flat side facing row G
and then we're going to place another
point 1 micro farad capacitor in row G
in the spot of 17 and 22 now it's time
to add in the antenna coil we're going
to get to the black line and we're going
to insert that into j9 and the white
line is going to go into G 16 well then
insert our tuning capacitor and the
center post is going to go in F and the
right
most polling is going to go into f-16
and then we'll add in our black negative
battery wire into port j15 and the
positive red battery wire into j-20 and
then we have to put in the terminals for
the piezo earphone and they're going to
go in f20 as well as f-22 and that is
the finished radio and as you can hear
here I am going to be able to tune it to
multiple different stations there you go
