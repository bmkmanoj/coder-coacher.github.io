video on editing every single thing in
cap skating style sheets today I'm going
to cover layout and positioning if you
haven't read or viewed my XHTML w3c
tutorial or am i adding CSS style and
CSS boxes tutorial you should definitely
do that before watching this it is very
important to enclose all of your code
into a series of block elements in your
HTML everything when your page should be
enclosed by a header or a paragraph tag
as you can see here if you do that not
only will you be XHTML compliant you'll
also have no problem with positioning
your content later on if you forgot here
are a listing of all the block elements
that are available in XHTML now let's
move on to the dip tank when you have
all your content separated in the block
elements it's time to start sectioning
off your content using the div tag for
example I separated the boys content
from the girls content on this page and
also I gave each div tag an ID so I
could style them as I like you could
give them a them an appropriate
background color by editing the CSS page
as I did right here where I gave the
background color for the boys div tag
blue and the girls pink that is a sexy
decimal code for pink dibs operate just
like the box principles I talked about
in the previous CSS tutorial so if
you've watched that you'll be able to
understand divs there now and give you
some sample code to play with so you
really get dibs right here we have HTML
code if you saw the HTML tutorial you
understand what all this is this is
defining that i'm using a strict version
of XHTML here's my opening tags and so
forth and in my body if where I want my
div to be displayed I just create a div
followed by ID equals whatever I want my
div to be called in this case brain and
then within that div I want to display
this header I want to display this image
right here in that I
contained within a paragraph tag as you
can see and then I have a final
paragraph tag right here well if you
enter that in your browser you would get
something that looks like this what a
brain and then here is my image and all
of the information that I followed up
with that this is a basic div let's make
this div more stylish by editing some
CSS code here i'm using the exact same
layout however i'm editing the way the
dev looks what did i do i added a border
with two pixels i added this border
style of dotted added a custom border
color added a background color made the
overall width 200 pixels that's why see
here i am demonstrating this stretches
out as far as it can in this case i
defined my width is two hundred that's
why you have box here and then i chose
to line everything as center whenever
you type this and to your HTML in
exactly the same way you can see how it
would affect that day you can edit the
divs elements margins and padding to
move it around on the screen just like
we did it in the box element tutorial
and the best way to learn is to start
messing around with HTML and the CSS and
a simple text editor you get all this
stuff okay another great thing about
developments is that you can edit the
tags inside of it with ease let's say
you want to change the color of the HT
three header tag inside of the brain to
div just type the following into your
style sheet and automatically that
header is going to change to the color
of purple now let's move on to spans
it's great that we can use developments
to contain and edit block elements but
what about inline elements you may ask
you can edit inline elements with a
great tag called span let's say you
would like to make text blinken fuchsia
just to irritate some people I'm going
to show you how to do that right now
here I'm defining a principal or a class
named irritate now everything that I
label me being the span right here with
the irritate class is going to show up
xuxa and blink and just that simple you
can see the code right here and that
code is right here so there's a nice way
to irritate people if you'd like it's
time now to make some div elements move
well you're almost a CSS guru I just
have to teach you how to move your
content around the screen then you'll be
able to create multi-column layout or
even irritating pop-ups and I'll show
you how to do that to get the brain div
just created to place itself in the
right corner of the browser requires
just one line of text float right here
is an example if you would use float
right in a property within your brain
tag that we showed you before I'll click
on this and you can see right here here
is the web page and what I did what was
previously over here is now found in the
right corner that's just how simple it
is to make a sidebar column is exactly
the same except i put float right
property in this content area so that's
how easy it is to create right sidebar
the only thing you must remember is that
the div you are floating must appear
before the div you want to be to the
right of as you may notice brain to give
is not floating to the right of the
title and let me show you here again see
the title is up here and the brain
sidebar property that i created our
sidebar div that i created is next to
the main content area but not next to
the title order matters within CSS so
you want to make sure down in your HTML
code that you put your div that you're
defining that you want to be to the
right of the content area which we have
here which is another div so that's
basically all you have to remember in
the corner in regards to the HTML I know
the first example wasn't pretty it
didn't have a header footer the main
content sidebar area were sort of
flowing together so here's an example
it's a little bit nicer
here you can see I defined a title bar i
defined footer here's the main content
area which is divided by padding from
the right sidebar so how did we do that
simple what I did was I defined this
body background color to be different
than anything else here being white then
I defined my header section with the
color text color and padding to find the
footer this is all all it goes into
creating layouts like this I mean it's
it's just so simple then lipson which is
the name of my main content area this by
the way is the reason the main content
is separated from the sidebar the reason
why there's those aren't button up
against each other is because I put 240
pixels then we have brain where did I
get the 240 pixels from you might have
this width of the brain sidebar and then
I added 40 pixels and that's the reason
why we have a gutter on there then you
see right here float right this is how I
was able to put this on the right side
of the screen but I could also put it on
the left side and then without this your
sidebar would be touching the header
that's why i defined the margin talk at
20 pixels in then what I did was I went
in here I put my head or first because I
want that to show up then I put in my
brain to div which is my right sidebar
and here's where I close it on here's my
main content area and here's my footer
so I did everything nice and in order
you may not realize it but you have
learned a ton about cascading style
sheets if you wanted to turn this into a
three column display with two side
borders on the left just create a new
div filled with content of your choice
give this div a custom class name and
create CSS styling for it adjust the
property margin right in your main
content area like I did before with the
gutter as you can see right here you
want to adjust for that and then you're
also since we're making a three-column
layout you're going to want to adjust
the padding area on the main content
area on the left as well and
and boom you got yourself a three-column
layout here is an example if we would
actually put two columns in for a
three-column layout with using XHTML and
cascading style sheets all that I did
here was use a float right tag just like
I did before and then I adjusted the
property margin right and margin left in
my main content area to make everything
lineup and here is an example of a
three-column layout where I have both a
left sidebar and a right sidebar and if
you go to this page you'll be able to
click on view page source and see
exactly how I did it but it's real
simple I just floated this one left
floated this one right and whenever I
was doing my hea or XHTML layouts I made
sure that both of these divs appeared
before this Center content div</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
