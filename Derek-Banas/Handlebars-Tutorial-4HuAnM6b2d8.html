handlebars video tutorial I decided to
do this tutorial because I plan on using
handlebars in my node.js tutorials which
are coming very soon and also because I
saw a student pulling their hair out
trying to use handlebars so I'm
basically going to try to teach all of
the things that tend to confuse people
without handlebars in this one video now
handlebars is a superset of the mustache
template engine and a template engine
quite simply just helps us separate our
HTML from our dynamic content created by
languages such as JavaScript and in this
tutorial going to cover how to
dynamically place data templates how to
work with arrays of data helper
functions passing attributes escaping
strings for safety block helpers using
elsif function inverse width I'm also
going to cover partials and of course
pre compiling templates and a whole
bunch more basically I'm going to cover
everything you need to know about
handlebars to get started and do
whatever you'd ever want to do with it
so now let's jump over and I'll show you
exactly how to install everything
alright so if you're on Windows or Mac
it doesn't really matter either way your
going to have to go to no js' org and
you're going to need to come in here and
download node J s we're going to need
node J s so that we'll be able to pre
compile our templates what you're going
to see in a moment with templates or
don't get confused by that so that our
pages are going to load faster so just
go on to node J s org and click on this
and if you're on Windows or whatever
just click on run and Mac everything's
going to work exactly the same click on
next again click that you want to accept
this click on next it's going to show
you where it's going to install it
that's perfectly fine click on next and
again click on next and then click on
install and there you are node J s is
installed and click on finish now we're
going to go in here and install
handlebars CLE and you're going to have
to do this in either your command line
if you are on Windows or in your
terminal if you're on Mac do it exactly
the same way you're just going to type
in MPM install handlebars - G and as you
can see right there it's going to
install quite easy now we can go over to
handlebars and download the library
you're going to need just quite simply
click on download and it's going to
download
and this is what it's going to look like
as of now handlebars dash V 4.0 point
two and I'll show you here in a minute
exactly where you're going to use that
in your code so now let's get over and
start writing some code all right so on
the left side of the screen and you can
see right here exactly where I installed
handlebars and you're just going to put
this in the directory with all of your
code just to keep everything nice and
simple but I just have sublime text on
the left side of the screen and I have a
browser on the right side I'm using
Chrome here and I have the little
console window open down here if you
want to open that just come in here and
go view and developer and then
JavaScript console and that will open
that up now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to jump into the body section and
I'm going to create a div inside of here
and it's going to be called ID and I'll
call it Derrick data and this is where
all the information that's going to be
generated is going to be placed on our
screen and now I'm going to keep this
simple I'm going to create a script
inside of here and this is where the
JavaScript code is going to go and then
here I'm going to structure exactly how
I want my data to come out on the screen
so I'm going to create a variable I'm
going to call this my info is equal to
and I'm going to say that I want to have
paragraph tags here and I'm going to say
my name is and then here is the
handlebars or mustache code where you're
going to go in here and put name and I
live at and I can go Street in City
comma and then I'll put state inside of
there and then I'll close off my
paragraph tag and throw in a semicolon
now what I need to do is generate a
JavaScript function that will create the
output for me and I'm just going to call
this template doesn't matter what you
name these things and I'll call
handlebars compile and this is basically
going to join the data that is in
JavaScript with the HTML to keep
everything separated from itself so now
we all go and create that data
I'm going to go template and then I'll
define everything that I want to place
inside of here as you can see name is
going to be Derrick and you can see how
those match up there so of course I'm
going to do exactly the same thing with
all the other pieces of data and of
course all of this code is available for
download there's a link in the
description underneath this video it's
free of course there you go got all of
our data and then all I need to do is go
and place it inside of this div that I
created up here so I'm just going to go
document get element by ID and the ID
for this guy is Derrick data a lot of
times we use jQuery but I decided to
just stick with basic HTML here and then
I'll just add in all of the data that
was generated from that and of course
the script tag ends and if we reload
over here on the right side of the
screen you can see that all of that
information went right inside of there
so there is handlebars in action in its
most basic form now I'm going to go and
show you some more complicated ways to
use it okay so of course make sure you
have this and this is in the directory
remember we downloaded this from the
handlebars website this is in the
directory where all our code is now I'm
going to come in here and create another
div and there that is now of course it's
going to be better for us to separate
our templates from our actual JavaScript
and I'm going to show you exactly how
we're going to be able to do that going
to create another script tag and instead
of having it be text JavaScript however
we're going to have it be text and an X
- handlebars
- template and I'll show you how to pre
compile these so that they load quicker
here in a little bit now just like
before I'm going to come in here and
create all my HTML so I'm going to do
something like favorite and then I'll go
name quotes and I'm going to do a little
silly thing with some Yogi Berra quotes
now I'm going to create an ordered list
and I'm going to use the each helper
here and what it's going to allow us to
do is insert arrays of data and how you
use it again this is handlebars as you
go each and you're going to put a hash
symbol inside of here then follow that
with each and then you're going to cycle
through whatever array of data you're
going to cycle through and then inside
of this let's say that I want to create
little links and then I'm going to have
quote and I'm going to create this in a
second so you'll see exactly how those
arrays are structured and then how you
end these each helper blocks is just by
putting a forward slash and each and
that's it then of course you want to
close off your ordered list and then
outside of this templating area we're
going to have our JavaScript code
so we're going to leave this be
JavaScript now if we want to come in
here and get a reference to our template
that we have up inside of here we're
going to have to go into this guy right
here and give it an ID and I'm going to
make the ID equal to quote template and
the reason I left that office so I can
show that I'm going to be pointing at
that right now so I'm going to go var
quote info is equal to I'm going to go
document get element by ID and then
quote template right like that and then
we're going to go enter HTML and now I'm
going to go var template equal to
handlebars and like I said this is going
to compile or join the data that is
generated by the JavaScript in with the
HTML so I'll go quote info just that guy
right there and then I'm going to come
down here and create our array data just
call this quote data is equal to and
then we're going to say template and
then inside of here we'll define all the
different pieces of data we want to pass
so we want to pass in a name and there
is Yogi Berra and we're going to
separate these with commas of course and
then we'll have our quotes part like
this which is going to be our array and
then inside of it we'll define all of
our different quotes so quote and you
can see exactly how this lines up right
here we have quotes and then right here
we have quotes this is the array we're
cycling through and then quote or all
the individual items inside of there and
I just went in there and threw in a
whole bunch of different quotes for us
and you can see of course that these are
all separated with commas so now that we
have our name and our quote array that
have all of our different quotes inside
of it we now want to go in there and
place all of that information inside of
our quote data div that we have up
inside of here and how we're going to do
that is just go document again and get
element by ID this is going to be quote
data is what we're going to be putting
the information in and then we'll just
go enter HTML and add in all of our
information with our HTML as well and if
we load and save that you can see right
there it says favorite Yogi Berra quotes
it automatically put his name inside of
there and it also cycled through and
generated this ordered list with all the
quotes right there so that's how we go
and merge or separate our templates this
is our template right here from our Java
Script as well as how we use e
to cycle through a whole bunch of
different array items and go in here and
automatically generate ordered lists so
pretty useful now let's come back up
inside of our templating area and I'm
going to show you how you're going to be
able to use HTML tags with a triple
stash as what it's called so we're going
to put three stashes inside of there and
I'm going to do something like a yogi
bio throw a couple break statements
after that and now I can come back down
inside of here and add to the data that
I'm going to be passing inside of it so
let's say that we wanted this to be an
italic bio on yogi berra we're going to
go yogi bio and then we'll come in and
make everything italic just to do
something and there that is and we can
save that and reload it and now there
you can see as a short bio on Yogi Berra
and it's all italic now the reason why
we use to triple stashes inside of here
let's go and get rid of them is you just
use double and you reload it it's not
going to use the tags so that's the
reason why we did that now up inside of
here I'm going to call a custom helper
function which is going to generate HTML
tags that are going to allow me not to
need to use the triple Stash's inside of
here if I'd like to and I'm going to
call this make link and it's going to be
passed a string so let's say something
like Yogi Berra museum and it's also you
can see there's no commas or anything
separating this you just put a space and
there's a website and then I'll throw
another break statement after this keep
everything separated and then down
inside of the Java Script area I'm going
to come in here and create our own
helper function and you're going to type
in handle bars dot and register helper
and remember I call this make link see
right up here this guy make link and
it's going to receive two pieces of data
inside of it so I'm going to go make
link to find the name of our helper
function and then you're going to define
a function you're going to be working
with this information and it's going to
be the text for the link that we're
generating as well as a URL down here
through that semicolon in and first I'm
going to need to do is go in and get the
text that I have here I'm going to call
handlebars dot utils
dot esque
a expression and this is going to escape
the past ring so that it is safe to use
in our content area and whenever you are
creating your own custom helpers you
should use this method all of the time
to avoid issues like code injection and
things like that so I'm going to get
this text make sure that it's safe and
then I'm also going to get the URL and
make sure it is safe throw that in there
go URL pass URL inside of this and now
I'll generate our custom link so I'll go
bar and let's just call this the link to
keep it simple is equal to and then we
can go and put our HTML inside of this
and then we'll add the URL to that close
this off close off that tag plus and
then of course we'll throw the text for
our link inside of there and then
finally we will close off our link tag
and there that is and now if we want to
pass back our finished link we're going
to go return new handlebars and I'm
going to call save string and save
string is going to prevent the string
from being escaped which means basically
we won't have to use the triple stash as
like we used before and I'll pass back
our link right like that and I went and
put the little register help report here
in wrong place so let's go and cut that
out of there make sure you put this in
before the template part meaning this
guy right here and if we save that you
can see that the Yogi Berra museum shows
up right there so there you go just make
sure you always have the all of your
helpers defined before you have the call
for the template to work with all the
data causes a little bit of confusion
and now I'll show you how to come in
here and pass in attributes to a helper
so once again we're going to come up
here I'm going to call a custom helper
called change color and the text that's
going to show is make my text red and
then I'll define an attribute which is
the color is blue for a break statement
on there and then it'll come down inside
of here and actually create the change
color registered helper and we'll call
handlebars again and register helper
course this is going to be called change
color and then we'll define our function
that's going to work with this and it's
going to be passed some text and then
it's going
be past our attributes in options right
here close off that semicolon we're
going to get the text that was passed
inside of here and escape it so
handlebars utils escape is expression
and we'll pass the text inside of there
and we're going to be able to access our
attributes by name and how we'll do that
is go if and the attributes are passed
in options like you can see right there
so we're going to go options and then
we'll go hash and then we'll go color
and color is what we defined right there
see there's the color right there blue
and we'll say if it is equal to red we
can then come in here and return new
ándale bars save string can save string
doesn't get rid of any tags that we have
there and I can say that I want to put a
span inside of here and I'm going to
give it a class which is going to be
equal to red text and you can see that
class up here say red text blue text
green text I can change these
dynamically based off of whatever color
they pass inside of there as an
attribute and then inside of this I'm
just going to throw in the text that
they passed inside and said they wanted
to use and then close off our span I'm
going to do exactly the same thing for
all the other different options that we
have so I can come in and say else if
and then let's just go and copy this but
here we're going to check not that the
color passed in was red but if it was
blue and then we're going to return a
different span that's going to have a
color of blue instead so we'll call this
blue text for that class and then
finally we can go else and we can paste
in or return and in this situation we'll
change this to green text so just an
example of how we can go in pass
attributes as well as how we can
generate different types of spans or any
type of HTML document with different
types of styling on the fly
and we save that reload it you can see
right there make my text red and if I
want to make it red I can just come up
here and it's blue by default because
that's what I had in there first I can
change it to red and reload it and now
it's red so there you go there's a way
of passing attributes as well as how to
change styles dynamically now I'll show
you how to pass options that are going
to be available to all helper functions
that you create let's say I want
create one called say hello now come
down here and register a new helper so
just like before handlebars register
helper and this guy is going to be
called say hello and then once again
going to define a function inside of
here this time only options is going to
be passed inside of there then what
we're going to do is we are going to
print out different information
depending upon a value that's stored in
options so go data and that data is
going to be a language it's going to be
defined I don't come down here inside of
the template area so you can see exactly
where you would pass any type of data
that you would want to be shared with
all helpers you're just going to come
after this little curly brace right here
comma and then you could put in data and
then you're going to define all of the
individual pieces that you would like
inside here so language in this
situation and what I'm going to put
inside of here is Spanish and you come
over and indent that and close that off
just so you can say so that's how we
pass information that would be available
to any of the helpers and now what I can
do is just go in this switch statement
and say case Spanish is the value of
Lang which was passed in there in that
situation I want to return Jolla and
then break and then we'll do this for a
couple other ones we could also do this
for fringe with Bonjour and then finally
of course we could do a default and
return hello there we go and if we
reload it you can see that Jolla shows
up right there and you can also make
sure that you have a little closing
semicolon there got that sorry about
that and there you go so that's how you
can pass in a whole bunch of different
types of data and use them in the
templates and keep everything separated
and neat now what I'm going to show you
is how to use a really nifty trick
called block helpers okay so now I'm
going to come in and create another
helper function for us to be able to use
here and my basic idea is I'm just going
to show you so many examples that
everything is going to make a lot of
sense so in our JavaScript area we're
going to come in and get the documents
it's element by ID and once again we're
going to target our template here so
let's go and copy that paste that inside
of there and then go inner HTML and then
great template is equal to call
handlebars and we need to compile this
and let's go and give this guy a
template info name and that's what we'll
be compiling here plate info and then
we'll come in and register our helper so
register helper and I'm going to call
this make radio because it's going to
automatically generate a bunch of radio
elements radio buttons for our website
and it's going to receive the name
that's going to be associated with radio
buttons and options as well now I'm
going to use a new guy here to generate
the list of radio buttons that's going
to be passed inside of here by calling
options and FN and what this is going to
do is it's going to return a string and
save it in radio list based off of the
data that's passed inside of make radio
then I can go and jump back and forth
and create these as well up here in our
template if we want to call make radio
again this is basically a block helper
that we are defining ourselves and we're
going to pass inside of here size being
the name that we are going to associate
with each radio button and then we're
going to close off make radio and then
inside of here we can throw in all the
options that we want to pass inside so
we can go small medium large and this is
going to be what is passed back whenever
we call this function right here and the
name right here is going to be size
which is going to be associated with
those radio buttons okay easy that is to
set up so once small medium and large or
pass back to this I'm going to call
radio list and radio list and I'm gonna
trim any white space that is on those
and then I'm also going to call split on
this and I'm going to separate them
based off of new lines so we'll be able
to throw all these into our little array
list right here and we'll get ready to
any white space and we will break them
by the line breaks so that's how we'll
be able to separate those out and then I
go to create a variable that is going to
contain all of the output and the output
is going to be the radio buttons and
we're going to you have to use a for
loop here so I'm going over
bow in radio list to cycle through all
the radio list items and specific items
going to be equal to radio list and then
the specific value part of it and then
we'll come in and trim that as well just
to make sure that is all gone and then
we'll add into our output that we just
created and then for each radio button
we're just going to come in and go input
type is equal to and this is a radio
button and then the name for our radio
button close that off and it's going to
be the name that was passed inside of
here
so what's that going to be it's going to
be sized so each of these radio buttons
it's going to have size as our name and
then we just define our value based off
of the values that were separated there
as well and we can use item to get ahold
of those close that off and then of
course we're going to have the item at
the end here and we can give min and
throw a break statement or as well and
there that is then of course after we
are done cycling through and creating
all the radio buttons that we need we
just call return output which is going
to contain all those radio buttons now
in this situation we're going to be
generating all these radio buttons but
we do not have a template of data that
we're going to be passing it well in
that situation we'll just go template
data is equal to and call template and
just leave an empty simple that's all
you do and then of course we want to
command and documents decide where we
want to place all this information and
that's going to be our content div that
we created up there and then of course
we're just going to go in our HTML and
pass in template data and then of course
if we do that we're going to have to
jump up here and create that div content
div close that off and then close off
the div itself and then reload and there
you can see we automatically generated
our radio buttons so pretty cool and you
can see it is very nice and easy to go
in there and be able to do that and of
course there would be numerous ways for
us to specialize this and it's just
overall pretty cool so you may ask
yourself well is there a way to come in
and be able to use alternative templates
yes there are let's come down here
I'm going to do something a little bit
silly it's basically going to decide if
two values are going to be equal or not
so I'm going to call handlebars again
and I'm going to register a helper and
this is going to be called are equal and
of course we will create a function
that's going to be called here and it's
going to be passed two numbers and
provide different output depending upon
those numbers and then we're also going
to have options come inside of here
close that off and then quite simply
it's just going to say if number one is
equal to number two then we have to
define which template we want to work
with well if we go options FN this it's
going to execute the first template else
we're going to call options inverse it's
going to execute the other template
you're going to see exactly what this
means I'm going to come up here once
again into my template area and I'm
going to call our equal which is the guy
that I just defined down there and it's
going to be passed two values I'm just
going to have it be 1 and 1 and if they
are equal I'm going to have numbers are
equal that's what's going to show on the
screen else and this is where I'm going
to define the other option if they are
not equal numbers are not equal and then
we close off our our equal block
customize block function by going or
equal and then throw some break
statements in there so you can see right
here let's just change that the numbers
just so it's the same but you can see
right here in this situation if it is
equal it's going to call this guy right
here which is going to show this on the
screen and if they are not equal it's
going to call inverse this guy right
here and in that situation this is going
to show up on the screen and you can see
if they reload it numbers are equal
shows up on the screen and if we come in
and change this to 2 I'll say I've
reload you can see that numbers are not
equal shows up on the screen let's
enlarge that so you can see it a little
bit better there you go that's how we
can create another custom little block
helper file for us and how we can show
different templates depending upon
different conditions
now handlebars also has a built in if
conditional that we're going to be able
to use to display different results and
here I'm going to create another helper
function handlebars register this stuff
is very easy to remember once you do it
for a while and and handlebars
specifically is some a tool that
whenever you first start using it you're
going to be pulling your hair out going
what but then once you get it you just
get it and everything makes sense and
it's a really awesome little tool you
can have in your toolbox so here we go
I'm going to say data if it is equal to
the string is active that's passed into
this guy right here again we're going to
do a similar type of thing we're going
to go return options and call FN and
this and else if it is not equal to is
active well we're going to return
options inverse and then this once again
so similar type of style then we can
come up inside of our little templating
area and we can call our little helper
with if just like before we can define
that we want to pass in is active inside
of there
and then we could put anything inside
air it doesn't have to just be text
let's go and throw in an image for
example so we could say image source is
equal to NT to a little bit of ping this
can be any image it doesn't matter as
you'll see and then I'll change the alt
to this as active and then if I want to
you try to use multiple different
possible templates of course we're going
to throw else inside of there and here
I'll just throw in a different image and
we'll close off our little F there it is
and we'll change this to horizontal
reload and there you can see the image
shows up and then this can literally be
anything because I check for is active
and otherwise it's going to show like
that so there's a whole bunch of other
little helper blocks that we can create
a whole bunch of the things we can do
with handlebars now I'll show you how
you can work with nested parameters in
the data that's passed in using width so
I have my content div inside of here I
pulled in handlebars and let's go and
create some stuff okay so you can see I
have the content div which is where all
the information is going to go I have
the handlebars library right here and I
went down inside of here and
automatically threw in some data for us
to work with
is what we want to try to do here is
demonstrate how we can work with a
nested parameter using width that's
pretty easy again I'm going to work with
handlebars and I'm specifically going to
register a new helper and call with like
this and then define the function so you
can see I can doing the same type thing
over and over again s in context and
options close that off and what context
is is going to be this data right here
and we're going to use that to come in
here specifically and target the tech
data part of our data we want to work
with so quite simply all we need to do
here is go return options FN and pass
context inside of that and most of the
work in this situation is going to be
built inside of our templating area so
I'm going to create a div inside of here
and I'm just going to give it the class
name of Potter 1 and I can structure
exactly everything else that I want here
let's close this div off so let's say
that I wanted to throw an h3 tag or
something inside of here and I wanted to
get the title out of here there's the
title so I just time in and type in
title and close off that h3 tag and now
if I want to be able to target the ISBN
and author for this guy what I need to
do is I could either come in and type in
tech data dot ISBN Tech data dot author
but with with what I'm going to be able
to do is just use Tech Data once and
then just refer to the ISBN and author
on their own so it just makes things a
little bit neater and then after that I
can just create another div and let's
say that I give it a class ISBN number
for our Harry Potter book and then I
want to come in and grab the ISBN from
the data section and then I'm going to
do exactly the same thing for the
author's throw author inside of there
and author inside of there and save that
reload it and you can say Harry Potter
and the Philosopher's Stone shows up and
you can see the ISBN number and the
author's name also shows up it's a
pretty simple really simple example just
want to show that because that was
something that really confused the
student I was working with so there's an
example of using with ok so now I'm
going to use something called a partial
which is basically going to provide for
code reuse but unlike with helper
they don't compute anything but instead
they basically act like reusable
placeholders for our data so let's
create one right here and you can see we
put a different little bracket inside of
there and let's say that the data I want
to pull in in this situation is my name
it probably makes sense to come down
here and actually create all that data
so I'm going to stick to the same naming
conventions I'm going to create template
data it's equal to and then template I'm
going to throw a whole bunch of these
guys inside of here a bunch of different
data we can work with so I'm going to
throw in name and let's just have that
be Derrick we're going to throw in an
author let's say that author's name is
John Smith I'm going to have a comment
the joint I'm going to basically try to
show you how to print out a simple
comment and then have all the other
comments just directly line up no matter
how many comments there are underneath
that comment so we should say something
like let's say John Smith makes a
comment where should we vacation and
then I'm going to have all of the other
comments made to that statement show up
underneath of it and those are also
going to have an author as well as an
additional comment it will close that
off and then let's say we want to do one
more after that just copy that change
that to Paul Smith and then we'll say
something like Disneyland here and then
everything else closes off I'll actually
get rid of that and then down here we
can handle the my name that we just
called right here with a simple partial
so you could just do very it provides a
very easy way for us to transpose some
dynamic data here directly into our HTML
so we'll go handlebars once again and to
register a partial we go register parcel
instead of register helper and again
we're going to just give it a name it's
my name and then we can find what we
want to pass inside of it and we could
do name like this and you can see that
my name pops up there just make sure
that whenever you define this it has my
name with a capital n and my name with a
capital n like that and you can see that
we were able to pull that data out from
down here inside of the pieces of data
that we were working with and now let's
do something a lot more complicated
we're going to create another partial
here paste that inside of there and
let's call this asked question and this
is going to be where we add the question
and a whole bunch of comments are
automatically going to line up directly
underneath of it let's just come up here
and start creating out exactly how
that's going to work because I think it
sometimes looks better works better
whenever we see the template before we
actually have the partial created
underneath so we're going to define
exactly what we want to see here so
we're going to have div and class and
let's just name this post then inside of
here partial remember that bracket we're
going to call asked question and we're
going to allow them to also pass in the
tag name that we want to surround this
information we're going to be displaying
let's make a h2 and then we can intermix
just regular old HTML of course directly
inside of here and then on top of that
we can use each which we've used a
couple times here you're going to use
each a lot with handlebars and we can
cycle through our comments which is this
data down here there's all our comments
and then once again we can call asked
question and we could define a tag name
and say that wind pass and h3 tag inside
of it this time and then close off our
little each block and then finally close
off our depth so you can see how those
are structured how we're calling asked
questions so now let's actually create
asked question basically we need to
define how this data is going to be
passed inside of here
so we're going to be passed a tag name
as you can see there is the tag name
we're going to be passed in and we'll
just go tag name then we're going to be
passed our author that we're going to be
working with and you can see that's
where we're going to be pulling that
information from the data we define down
here we're then going to pass in tag
name once again which is going to be the
tag that surrounds that author's name
and then after that we could define a
div class is equal to and put that
authors comment inside of there by once
again referring to the data down below
and then finally close off that do and
there you are
and if we reload it you can see John
Smith where should we go on vacation and
then suggestions and you can see here
Sue Smith suggests the beach and Paul
Smith suggests Disneyland ok so that's
how you can work with partials now I'm
going to jump
/ and do one more example with each and
it's basically going to be a grocery
cart type of thing a grocery list and
then I'm going to show you how to
pre-compile with handlebars alright so
down here inside of our JavaScript area
just as a final review I'm going to call
for the grocery template that we have up
inside of here and how I get ahold of
that is I go of our template info is 1
we call that just like I have a for
document.getelementbyid d and then of
course I'm going to Pro grocery template
inside of there I'm going to call inner
HTML then come down inside of here and
create template equal to call handlebars
and we're going to compile this guy I'm
going to show you how to pre-compile
here in a second but I wanted to show
you both ways because at least I'd never
saw any version of using pre compiling
and handlebars in which they show you
the previous versus the post where you
have the pre compile which I think
really helps everything make a lot more
sense and let's go and define our data I
like to show you a couple different ways
to set all this stuff up here I'm going
to have a groceries array and then each
of these items call it item and I'll
just throw a couple different food items
inside of here
and there we go and then finally after
all that is all set up we're going to
call and create template data is equal
to call template and pass in our context
or data that we have here and then
finally we're going to make reference to
a div content div up here and that's
where the data is going to get placed
inside of so get element by ID a content
div and inner HTML I'm just going to get
the value of template data all right so
that's how we have all that structured
up now I'm going to come up here and
create the template for our little
grocery store list so again I'm going to
be cycling through a bunch of different
items so I'm going to use each once
again and groceries is what I'm going to
be cycling through which is this guy
right down here and I'm going to close
off my little each block right there and
then I can just define anything I want
inside of here so let's say I want to
div with a class name and let's go and
call this grocery item and then inside
of paragraph
F tags I'm going to list item and then
if I want to get the specific item in
the list that we're cycling through just
go to this item close that paragraph tag
off and then close that div tag off
save it reload it and you can say potato
flour yogurt and beans all load up there
so now how exactly do we set this up so
we can pre compile everything so that
all of this is going to load a lot
quicker actually it's pretty easy we're
going to come in here right where we
have normally have our template and
we're going to copy all of this
everything between these two scripts so
copy that and paste that into a file
that I called groceries dot handlebars
into your same exact directory where you
have everything else save so have that
set up there and we're going to save it
now you're going to open up a terminal
or the command line whether you're on
Mac or Windows or Linux whatever all of
the commands are precisely exactly the
same and to pre compile this we're going
to go handlebars make sure you're in the
same directory as your a file we're
going to go handlebars and then inside
of here you're going to put the template
that you just saved and you're going to
put dash F and then you're going to
define exactly where you want the
JavaScript file that is going to be
compiled where it's going to be saved
the name of that hit enter LS and you
can see right here
groceries Jayesh shows are you up there
we can take a look at it inside here
open groceries Jas this is the file we
just generated here it is right there
just basic JavaScript and now we can
jump over and make this work with our
pre compiled template so to make this
work all we need to do is come in and
reference that file that was just
generated and we're going to come in and
comment these two lines of code out when
we comment them out or delete them
whatever I'm going to leave them there
so you can see exactly what we are
getting rid of as well as what we're
going to be adding to this to make it
work it's actually quite simple
everything down here is going to stay
the same the context is going to stay
the same the only thing it's going to
change is our template area and of
course we got rid of that script if we
jump back here see here was the
handlebars tag that we have here we're
getting rid of all that so that's all
gone but to pull our template in all we
to do is go of our and template is equal
to handlebars
and then we're going to call templates
and then the name of it was groceries is
so groceries this guy right here paste
that inside of there and if we reload it
you can see that it shows exactly the
same thing even though we got rid of all
this guy so there you go guys there are
examples of numerous different things
you can do with handlebars
and I'm going to be using them in the
upcoming new j/s tutorials so please
leave your questions and comments below
