three of my low-fat vegan recipes today
I'm going to show you how to make
homemade noodles meatless marinara meat
sauce mushroom risotto and vegetable
stock so let's get into it
many people for some reason think it is
very hard to make homemade noodles or
they think they need eggs no all you
need is 2 cups of flour and then 1/2
teaspoon of salt just any type of salt
will work and then 3/4 cup of warm water
you're gonna add that to your food
processor and process it until
everything is mixed up and looks pretty
much like this now you may need to wipe
down the food processor a couple times
with a fork just run it around the
outside edges and then you're gonna
transfer this to a bowl and make sure
you get all the good parts out of there
and then you knead it with your hand
until everything is pretty much all firm
you really don't even need to let it sit
you can just put it on a floured surface
and then roll it with a rolling pin
you're also not going to need any type
of pasta processing press or anything I
just use a pizza cutter and cut out all
the noodles to the desired size and you
can see basically what they look like
when they're all done and I'm gonna make
my meatless meatloaf which I'm going to
use with my marinara sauce and I'm gonna
get 1/4 of a cup of water 1 teaspoon of
Vague egg substitute blend that up and
here you can see I have 1 cup of
textured vegetable protein 1/3 of a cup
of leftover veggies from veggie stock
and 1/2 a cup of quick oats to this
mixture I'm going to get my vague that I
just blend it up and add that into the
ball and then we have a couple more
ingredients we're also going to be
adding in one half of a tablespoon of
nutritional yeast and then we'll add 1/4
of a cup of simply heinz tomato ketchup
I like it because it doesn't have corn
syrup and then I'll add one cup of
veggie stock and in a second here I'm
going to show you exactly how I make
that you want to make this so that it's
kind of soupy and you want to make sure
that everything is very well combined
and then the final ingredient you can
either use 1 tablespoon of liquid aminos
or 1 tablespoon of soy sauce whichever
you prefer then you're just going to
give your little mixture here good mix
until everything is very well combined
and then you'll put this in the oven for
45 minutes at 375 degrees until
everything is all done now I'm gonna
make some marinara
so everybody has their own recipe for
marinara sauce this is mine I'm going to
use five cans of low salt tomatoes all
chopped up and then I'm gonna take a
potato masher and mash those up really
good what my goal here is to get all of
the liquid out of there as you can see
after you cook it for about five minutes
on high a lot of the liquid comes out
there and I went and strained all that
liquid out now it's time to add my
ingredients I'm going to add one
tablespoon of garlic powder and then I'm
gonna stir it up make sure it's well
combined and then add one tablespoon of
dried oregano and of course you can use
any brand that's out there and make sure
that it started very well to combine and
then after that I'm going to add one can
i'm hunt's tomato sauce or you can just
blend up some of this to make it a
little bit thicker that is the only goal
here and of course stir to combine
now the noodles are very easy to cook
all you do is bring a big giant pot to
boil throw the noodles in and after
about three minutes or until they float
to the top your noodles are done so
throw them on a plate and then I went
and took some of the meatloaf that I
cooked in the oven and I threw that on
top of it and then I got myself some of
the marinara sauce and threw it on top
of that this is surprisingly delicious
this is probably one of my favorite
things to eat period and it's super
simple and now it's time for me to make
my veggie stock it's very simple I just
take two cups of onion one stalk of
celery two cups of carrots two cups of
mushrooms and two cups of tomatoes and
I'm going to throw those in my food
processor and I'm gonna blend them all
together it's gonna make it very easy
for the stock to be really really really
good and after those are all nicely
blended I'm going to get a pot and turn
it on high and I'm gonna get two
tablespoons of minced garlic throw that
in the bottom of the band of course you
don't like garlic don't put that in and
then I'm gonna scoop in all of my
veggies and then I had some dried
mushrooms right around 1/4 of a cup
soaking in liquid about I'd say that's
about 3 cups of water since I'm gonna be
making mushroom risotto I'm going to be
putting that in because I wanted it to
be able to absorb the mushroom flavor
then I'm gonna add either a tablespoon
of liquid aminos or soy sauce to this
it's really going to bring the flavor
out in the stock and not taste a lot
like soy sauce you just have to try to
believe it and then
going to add one teaspoon of salt to
make all the liquids come out of the
vegetables and then whenever that's
starting to stick I'm going to add in
six cups of water now I'm gonna bring
this stock to a boil then turn it down
to 20% and let it cook for right around
an hour and then I'm gonna strain out
most of the liquid out of there and now
in my pan I'm gonna get ready to start
making my risotto first thing I'm gonna
do is start making the vegetables for
the risotto though I start off with one
and a half cups of onions and then
there's a cup of carrots and then I'm
going to add in the dried mushrooms that
we're soaking and then I'm gonna add 10
ounces of mushrooms and then about 10
stalks of asparagus to this I'm gonna
add 1 teaspoon of salt again to bring
all the liquids out of these vegetables
then after the vegetables are all done
we're gonna stir those around a lot and
it's time for the risotto I'm gonna add
about 1/4 of a cup of water to the
bottom of a pan on high and then I'm
gonna get myself three cups of risotto
rice and I'm gonna stir that in the
water just get everything all combined
real nicely now risotto has a reputation
being hard to cook but it's really not
you just have to stir a lot what I'm
going to start off with liquid wise here
is the dried mushroom water that was
soaking and I'm gonna put that in first
because I want this rice to taste like
mushrooms and I'm going to stir like
crazy then I'm gonna take some of the
vegetables put them in there so some of
that flavor also translates over into
the risotto and then I'm gonna go to my
vegetable stock and start adding two
cups at a time and stirring and this
process continues over and over and over
again you're gonna stir the risotto
until it starts to stick add in 2 cups
of vegetable stock and just continue
doing that until the rice is done and
I'm going to combine the risotto rice
with my vegetables and there's the
finished product so I hope you guys
