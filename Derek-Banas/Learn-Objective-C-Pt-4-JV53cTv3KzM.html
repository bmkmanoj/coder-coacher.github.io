my objective-c tutorial in this
presentation I'm going to cover looping
decision-making and a bunch of rhythmic
operators available to you an
objective-c every modern day programming
language provides a way for you to
perform actions through looping they
also do it in a very similar way most
common looping tool is called the for
loop let's say you wanted a program that
print out the numbers 1 to 100 well if
so you're a lot of luck because I made
one just for you using the for loop I've
gone over most of this code in previous
tutorials so I'll just explain how the
for loop works in this example the basic
format of a for loop you can see down
here in the lower left hand corner after
the for keyword you define the starting
value for the variable that you are
going to iterate after the opening brace
by iterate I just simply mean change in
some way then you define under what
conditions you will continue looping and
to finish off this loop you define by
how much you will increment the variable
in the example I'm stating I want to
continue looping while I is less than or
equal to 100
the code that will be executed lies
between the two curly braces in this
case I'm printing value of I to the
screen by including the newline
statement which is a backslash followed
by the letter n each number will be
printed on individual lines here are all
the relational operators available to
you to have the greater than greater
than or equal less than less than or
equal equal or not equal to
relational operators you can create even
more complicated comparison statements
by using what is called a logical
operator if we wanted to loop as long as
I is less than or equal to 100 and I is
not equal to 50 you would just simply do
that by inserting these two and signs
between these two checks here are a
couple more logical operators available
like I said before and we could also use
or or to change a definition to a
negative we would just simply put an
exclamation point in front of it and it
would perform the absolute opposite
result
and to clarify that let's say as we're
doing here we're checking that I is not
equal to 50 when this circumstance let's
say I is equal to 40 well normally then
that would return a value of true
however if I put the exclamation point
in front of that same check it would
return a value of false so that's how
the not logical operator works you might
also be wondering what this statement
here means where I have I followed by a
plus sign equals and then the number one
it means that you want the current value
of I to be added to one and then
reassigned back to the variable named I
and here is another shorthand way in
which you can increment a variable by
the value of 1 and then reassign it back
to that variable and you can also use
this shorthand code with negative x in
to make sure that you understand you
don't specifically have to stick this
for statement definition exactly if you
wanted to find the iterated variable
outside of the for loop the for
statement and would instead look like
what you can see here which is just
simply a semicolon you could also define
multiple variables in a for loop as I
show you here in this example as I'm
defining the variables I and X inside of
the same for loop another tool available
for looping is the while loop it is used
when your initial variable looping
condition variables or iterator variable
are different from each other and it's
basic syntax is while followed by just
the looping condition then you would
have an opening curly brace followed by
your code and then finished off with the
iterator here is how you would perform
the same act with while loop as you did
previously which would be simply just
creating a while loop that would print
out the numbers 1 through 100 onto the
user's if you want to make sure the code
in the body of the loop is executed at
least one time you would use the
do-while loop and you can see it's basic
syntax here on your screen make sure you
don't forget however to put the
semicolon after the while statement
because this is a common error and here
I'll use the do-while statement to
perform the same loop as I did
previously with the for loop as well as
the wild lift if you ever want to a
immediately leave a loop when a certain
condition is met you would use the break
statement and it looks like this is just
simply the word break followed by
semicolon remember that if you nest
loops inside of each other however that
break will only jump you out of the
current loop that the break lies in it
will not jump you out of both of the
nested loops a continued statement which
is just the word continue followed by
semicolon will jump you back to the
beginning of the loop and continue
iterating all statements that follow it
in the looper skipped but you are not
jumped completely out of the loop
altogether it is used to bypass certain
statements under certain conditions
there are three tools available to you
for making decisions in Objective C
first you have the if statement followed
by the switch and then you have the
conditional it's a common way to make
decisions it's through the use of the if
statement and you can see its basic
syntax here which is just the keyword if
followed by a condition you can also see
on this slide you can use an if or else
statement so what we're gonna do here is
if the condition is not true
then we're gonna perform that code that
lies within the curly brackets after the
keyword else instead or you can use
compounded if statements here what I'm
doing is I'm gonna check a condition and
if that doesn't work then I'm gonna
check another condition with the else if
keyword phrase and then if that doesn't
work by default I'm going to process the
code that lies between curly braces
after the keyword else here I'm actually
providing real code that's gonna check
if someone can legally drink vote or
drive first I'm gonna check if they're
21 if they are then I'm gonna print out
to the screen that the person can drink
drive and vote that I'm following that
up with an else if statement if their
age is greater than 18 if it is I'm
gonna print out you can drive an boat
and you probably get the point the
switch statement is commonly used for
decision making as well when you know
ahead of time all of the possible values
that are available for the variable that
you're gonna check and you can see on
the right side of the screen the basic
syntax of the switch statement here's a
real world switch statement in which we
are checking what value is assigned to
the variable name number entered if the
number entered was zero we're
printout to the screen you entered zero
let's jump down here and look at case
two followed by case three what this is
doing is if the person entered a value
of two or three we're gonna pray out to
the screen you entered a two or a three
and take special note where we're using
the keyword break to jump completely out
of the switch statement in both of these
circumstances whenever we hit on a value
because if we hit on that value we don't
want to jump down into the default
statement which is gonna say you entered
a number bigger then there's also a
shorthand way to perform decisions in
objective-c and it's called the
conditional operator you can see its
basic syntax here in the second bulleted
item and a real world example on which
we are checking whether a character has
been assigned the character M and
depending upon what variable has been
assigned we're either going to assign
the string male or female back to the
variable which in this circumstance a is
person sex above I already showed you
the shorthand way to perform arithmetic
in objective-c
after you have any experience in
programming I bet you already know how
to perform arithmetic but probably not
casting but just in case I provide
examples of all the arithmetic
operations probably the only one you've
never seen is the modulus which is the
very last bulleted item and what it does
is it returns the remainder of a
division so in this example here I have
five modulus two it's gonna return one
because the remainder of that division
would be one if you want to convert an
integer into a double or any other type
of casting you need to use the casting
operator and here are some examples in
the second bulleted item here I'm
performing a multiplication and then
turning the result of that
multiplication into an integer and in
the second example by placing the
characters int inside of brackets in
front of the number one point two three
I'm converting that decimal placed
number into a simple integer with the
value of one and then I'm going to
perform the multiplication but this cast
is not going to cast the value of four
point five six because I don't have the
cat
in front of that specific number it's
just making that change to the first
integer so in this specific example
double number would be assigned the
value of four point five six in the next
part of the tutorial I'm going to go
completely through object-oriented
programming with Objective C do you have
