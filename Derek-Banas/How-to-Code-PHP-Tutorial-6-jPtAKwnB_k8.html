6 of my how to code PHP tutorial today
I'm going to show you a sample login
script that is complete and would be
usable on your own websites I don't know
about you but I learned better by
looking at actual code and having it
described to me and that's why I put the
tutorial together the way that I did
here I'm going to show you how to code a
PHP login script I hope this works in
helping you better understand PHP
definitely watch my other PHP tutorial
from the beginning before trying to
watch this video or you may be very
confused here we're telling the
browser's that we're going to serve up
some PHP code with the PHP opening brace
the first function I call OB underscore
start turns output buffering on to keep
it simple this function allows you to
send messages to the server with less
restrictions I'm using it here to make
session calls but you could use it to
send a string to the server and other
such things if you want more on this
leave a comment below since this script
is going to be registering new users and
allowing the user to log in I need to
create a new session and that is what
this function does this line of code
opens a connection with the database the
require once is used to call code
directly into a page so that the page
contains only HTML code we do this to
keep the page all nice and tidy
obviously to make my job easier I'm
writing all of the JavaScript and PHP on
the page directly for presentation
reasons you should however use the
require once function instead here we're
creating constants in PHP this is also a
listing the information required to
connect to a database you need to supply
in this script the user ID password host
address of your database and finally the
database name you want the config dot
Inc dot PHP file to be stored in a
directory outside of your root folder so
it can't be accessed by anyone other
than you unless you want a hacker to
have your database password that it Maya
school Connect connects to the database
if you provided the right information
and then stores a reference to the
database in the variable DBC here the
PHP code is checking if the database
name supplied exists if it doesn't an
error is triggered and a warning message
is sent to the browser then the exit
function terminates the
a script and the if-statement block is
closed with a closing curly brace if it
couldn't connect to the MySQL database
we print an error message on the screen
and exit from the PHP script like before
function i and i underscore get checks
to see if magic quotes are activated on
the PHP server magic quotes
automatically escape out quote marks
entered in your PHP code as you can see
the PHP interpreter wouldn't know which
double quote closed the string and would
throw an error you could escape out a
double quote with a backslash like this
the function stripped slashes does just
that it deletes the slash is that the
magic quotes function at here we're
providing security from people sending
potential damage enquiries to our
database first we're checking that the
function minus QL real escape string is
available if it is we run it on the form
data we use the trim function to
eliminate whitespace from the beginning
and end of the string then we return the
data and close the PHP script with the
closing brace here you can see the
beginning of a normal HTML page if you
saw my HTML tutorial or learned HTML on
your own I'm sure you understand where
all is me here we're checking if we have
session data set for the current visitor
if we do we greet them by printing their
first name to the screen I've included
an image that represents what this box
might look like in this block of code
we're checking if the user ID variable
has been set in a previous visit we're
also checking that the visitor is not
currently on the logout dot PHP page if
both of these checks come back true then
we place the link to the logout page we
follow that up by placing a link to the
change password page I finished off this
block of code by providing links if the
person isn't logged into their account
and have no session data saved I print
the register log in and forgot password
links to the page and finally close the
diff thanks for watching part 6 of my
how to code PHP tutorial in part 7 I
will give you all the code behind
creating a new user registration script
until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
