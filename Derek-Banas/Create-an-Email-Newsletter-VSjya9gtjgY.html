tutorial on how to set up a newsletter
campaign with MailChimp I really like
MailChimp mainly because it's free as
long as you don't go over 500
subscribers as it says here see and this
is how you set it up you basically go to
MailChimp com fill in email address user
name password so forth and so on
click on create my account then they're
going to send an email to you you're
gonna have to confirm that you do own
that email account then once that's
established you want to go in here
and log in to your new account this
looks like some crazy pyres but it's
it's actually a joke the company's
actually kind of funny and you'll see
your dashboard and you can see here that
I've added 43 additional people have
subscribed on my website since I sent
out this campaign here currently up to
349 total subscribers so totally free
from the dashboard you can create a
campaign right here click on that this
is so simple I almost always use a
regular old campaign so that's what I
would tell you to use as well then what
you want to do is click on the people
that you want to send this campaign to
click Next then you want to name your
campaign this is going to be the subject
of the email that you send out and
MailChimp goes through a lot of spam
filters I've that's another reason why I
continue to use them this will be the
name that's listed as who the email is
from and that can be completely
different than the email that the person
would reply to and then over here I
track opens I track any HTML clicks what
I mean by that is I track what links
people click on inside of the email you
can also track plain text clicks and as
well do some Google Analytics tracking
but I don't do that because it will
actually show Google Analytics and
MailChimp URLs but it's up to you if you
want to do that and here also if you
want to check this box it'll
automatically notify Twitter every time
you mail out a new campaign then you
click Next here I have a whole bunch of
emails already created but I'm going to
actually show you how to make a new
one click on design genius see right
here click on get started this is so
simple to use they provide you with a
whole bunch of different templates
abstract could see here animals
anniversaries birthday celebrate so
forth and so on and see here there's a
bunch of retail newsletters you could
use just click on select and it pops up
a nice little design now if you want to
go in here and change your header and
this is the header right here just click
on design header it gives you the option
to change whatever background there is
here so it's just a straight how simple
it is let's click on music and bands
let's say that I was a DJ this might be
a good one click on select then what I
would do is I put in my heading text
this is gonna be the biggest part which
just call it spinning around as you can
see this is black so you can't see it on
a black background so you want to click
in here on color and let's change it to
something crazy you can also see here
that this is too big so let's shrink it
down a little bit typed in here
newsletter for disco fans again want to
change the color and that size is
perfectly fine you can also set up here
if the person clicks your header where
they're gonna be sent you would put your
link right here I'm not going to do that
but you could definitely do that you
definitely would want to do that you can
see it automatically updated here
on-screen then if you want to change and
edit this which you definitely would you
just click on edit you can come in here
and just change all of this text just
like you would any word processor and
it's going to automatically update and
you can change all this you can put in
links you can import images bold so
forth change your styling of your text
your font the size so forth and so on
and you click on save you can see it
automatically updated there then that
also provides you with the ability to
just by clicking on these little themes
to automatically change your theme
colors then after you're happy with that
click on structure and if you're happy
with your overall design click on save
and add content template name I'm just
going to call this spinning and you can
actually edit the text inside of the
previous editor or you could edit it
here
again just by clicking in the box and
changing whatever text is here to
whatever you want it to be and then
click on and save okay so obviously
you're not going to send this out but
you get the gist of how to edit the text
change the header and change the title
and the slogan in your newsletter click
on next
right here would be a plain text version
that's automatically created for you
inside a mail chimp you always want to
include this and you can also see down
here
a pop up preview of what this would look
like if this was sent to somebody and
they had a spam filter that blocked your
newsletter but like I said most the time
MailChimp gets through all the spam
blockers and you could click on this to
send a plain text test to whatever email
address you'd want it to make sure that
it looks good
and you come up here and click on next
again and then what it does is it gives
you a final run-through of everything so
that you don't accidentally send it to
the wrong recipients or with the wrong
subject line and you can see that
everything here is checking out a
hundred percent and then if you were
100% happy with all this you would click
on send now and it would send everything
out if you wanted to make sure that it
was all to your liking you would send
test and then type in an email address
I'll show you all you do is type in your
email address where you want to send it
to click on send test you could click on
popup preview to see what its gonna look
like whenever the person gets it looks
pretty nice except that there's no text
in it and then you could also set up a
scheduled delivery in which you can tell
it when you want the newsletter sent out
or of course hit Send now and it goes
out to in my case all 286 recipients but
I don't want to send that out because I
do not have a DJ company so I'm gonna
hit cancel and you can see over here in
your dashboard they provide easy ways
for you to use surveys and notify people
on events and provide them the ability
to easily subscribe that they're going
to come to an event you can see here my
last campaign I actually sent it to one
individual that's not common for me and
there's all kinds of information here as
well as video tutorials which are
probably better than mine I'm the only
reason I did this tutorial is to get
people to get out there and do
newsletters period because I think a lot
of people think they're very hard to do
and they're not see up here
I click on lists and this is going to
show me all of my lists that I currently
have set up I can import these are all
the different file types you can bring
in here you can bring in different
spreadsheets you can bring in
information from Google Docs maybe a
Google Doc spreadsheet and all these
other services provide you with an easy
way to import all of the lists that you
want to send your newsletter to I can
also click on where I clicked on create
forms and set up a system where I email
out at person the opportunity to
subscribe to my newsletter and here I
can click on reports and check how good
my last campaign did go on the a list in
this case which is the name of my
newsletter and you see here that the
last time I sent this campaign out I
sent it to 273 people I receive zero
complaints of those deliveries a hundred
and eight of them were received and it
gives you all kinds of statistics as
well as a pie chart shows you how many
run open shows you your click rate shows
you everything and I can click on click
map and it'll actually show me exactly
what people clicked on inside of my
newsletter which is really helpful
because this shows me exactly what
content those people that I send my
newsletter out to are most interested in
and you can see here by looking at what
I got almost 30 percent clicked on
wanting to know how to create their own
website for free so I know that I need
to generate more free stuff and or more
website related information in my
newsletter I can also click on who
opened to see how many people open my
email not going to do that because
you'll see the people in my list and you
can also set up an autoresponder what
this does is it will send out an email
to anybody who subscribes to your
newsletter and these are also extremely
easy to set up click on create
autoresponder what list you want these
autoresponder to sent to and you can see
here under settings I'm sending one day
after a person signs up for this list
right here and then I could put in the
autoresponder name I'm just typing in
tests to create email click on next
again type in pretty much the same
information we
typed in with the previous campaign
click on next
here I could choose from one of the
other templates I've already created or
I could go into design genius and create
just like I previously did but here I'll
go back and show you what my
autoresponder actually looks like click
on select and you can see here what my
autoresponder actually looks like it's
nice and short and sweet and I think
it's very important to focus in on
previous articles that you received a
lot of click throughs on and that's
exactly what I do here but make sure
this is nice and short and sweet because
then that'll give the person the
impression that you give them good
information you don't overload them with
advertising I would never put
advertising in an autoresponder and you
can make all the same changes here as
you did before and that is how easy it
is to use MailChimp to send out email
newsletters and you should definitely
try it if you have any questions leave
them in the comment section below till
