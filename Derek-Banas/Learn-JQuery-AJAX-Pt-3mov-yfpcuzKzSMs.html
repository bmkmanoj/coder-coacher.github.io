3 of my jQuery in Ajax tutorial this
video is a response to an email I
received stating that I did not show
every possible way to select elements
using jQuery so in this presentation I
will do just that
so what exactly will be covered I'll
show you every option available to you
for selecting elements with jQuery in
jQuery you surround the type of element
you are looking for with the jQuery
selector which is represented here by a
dollar sign followed by both an opening
and a closing bracket the elements that
fit your description can then be
manipulated in bulk with numerous
functions that come with the jQuery
selector I'll now show you the codes you
can use in concert with the jQuery
selector to find any element on your
webpage I just want to make sure you
understand that you would place these
following codes inside of the jQuery
selector in the place of the letters
that I am now going to describe think
instead of these letters as tags that
you are going to be searching for now if
you just simply put a tag in here
represented by the letter X it will
match all elements with the tag named X
the third bulleted item will match all
children elements with the tag one and
that lied in the element X in the fourth
bulleted item this matches all children
elements with the tag Y that are direct
children of the element X and finally
this will match all elements of tag Y
that are immediately preceded by a
sibling of type X this code and the
first bulleted item will match all
elements of tag Y that are preceded by a
sibling X and by siblings what I mean is
let's say you have a div element and
inside of that div element you have an
h1 header element and a paragraph
element they both lie in the same div
hence they are siblings
the second bulleted item will match all
elements of tank X that contain an
element of type Y in the third will
match all elements of type X that have a
class name of Y in the fourth bulleted
item this will match all elements of
type x with an ID of type Y and finally
the fifth bullet item woman
all elements of type acts with an
attribute why that can have any value
and in this bulleted item this will
match all elements of type X with an
attribute of type Y that have the value
assigned to Z in the second bulleted
this will match all elements of type X
with an attribute of type Y that begins
with the value assigned to Z and finally
this code will match all elements of
type X with an attribute of type Y that
ends with the value assigned to Z this
is probably better understood in code
examples but this is the best way that I
could show you every possible way to
select elements so if it's a little bit
confusing move on to the next tutorial
or I'll explain a lot of this through
the use of actual code that you can see
working here in the first bulleted item
this will match all elements of type X
with an attribute of type Y that
contains the value assigned to Z and
finally this the last piece of code will
match all elements of type X that
contain the text string entered I'm
going to show you how to select elements
based on position on the webpage if you
use this code inside of a jQuery
selector it will return the first
element of type ax the second role will
return the last element of type ax the
third bolt at item will return the first
child contained in the element X hence
the fourth will return the last child
and you can also return the Y child of
the element X Y could also be a
mathematical formula that has a number
as a result first bullet item will
return all even or odd elements of the
element X the second returns the Y
element with the tag X on the web page
the third returns all elements that lie
after y on the web page and the final
returns all elements that lie before Y
on the web page and here is how you
would be able to select form elements
this first bulleted item will return
elements that are animated the second
returns elements that are buttons the
third returns elements that are
checkboxes the fourth returns elements
that are checked the fifth returns
elements that are headers and for
example here I show you what I mean by
headers and finally this last piece of
code will return elements that are
hidden first here returns elements that
are images then the next one returns
elements that are form elements the
third returns elements that have
children
elements the forth returns elements that
are of type password' v returns elements
that are radio buttons vi returns
elements that are selected and finally
the last returns home instead of type
text that is every single way to select
elements inside a jQuery in the next
tutorial I'm going to show you how I
made this page right here gonna show you
how we can add a little icon next to
this email make the table a little bit
prettier fix the table title so it's a
little prettier mess with the fourth
paragraph mess with all paragraphs in
this day of right here highlight the
fourth find a paragraph based off of
whether it has an attribute or not and
find the paragraph name third all in the
next tutorial till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
