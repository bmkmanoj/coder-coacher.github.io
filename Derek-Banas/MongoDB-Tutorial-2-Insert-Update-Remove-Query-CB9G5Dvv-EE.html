2 of my MongoDB tutorial in the first
part I showed you basically how to set
up MongoDB on Windows as well as on OS X
and in this part of the tutorial I'm
going to get into a ton of examples in
regards to how we can insert update
delete as well as query our database if
you didn't watch part one most
definitely watch it otherwise you won't
have MongoDB properly set up and I
provide a link here on the video as well
as in description underneath the video
and all the code that is used in this
video is available in a link in the
description so I have a lot to do so
let's get into it okay so here I have my
terminal or if you are on Windows this
would be your command line and we get
rid of that and I'm going to restore it
my Mongo server and there it is all
started up and in another tab don't
close this one in a brand new tab I'm
going to open up the Mongo shell and
here I'm going to use a brand new
database so to create it I just have to
type in use test DB or whatever I want
to call it and there we are I'm switched
to it and ready to go first thing I'm
going to cover is how to insert
information and I did this a little bit
in the previous tutorial but might as
well do it again and we just come in
here and go insert and in between curly
brackets we define our document we want
to create and this one's going to be
named and Barry Bonds is the document
I'm creating or the name inside of it
and I just have to close that off and
then close off the insertion function
and just like that we inserted a new
document in our database now let's say I
wanted to come in here and insert
multiple documents at once I would do
that through setting them up as an array
and to do so I'm just going to go test
DB insert and then I'm going to put a
squared off bracket showing that this is
an array of documents curly brackets
which shows that this is a document the
key would be name and then the value
assigned to it is going to be Ruth then
I'm going to close off that bracket
right there and I'm going to throw in a
new document this one is going to start
off once again with curly brackets a key
which is going to be name and then an
additional value which is going to be
Hank Aaron I close that off to close the
document and
a closing square bracket there to close
off the array and then I close off the
insert function and then we went in and
you can see the two were inserted and
we're ready to go we'd also be able to
come in here and do a find on this to
show that we have Barry Bonds as well as
Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron all insert it
into our database let's go back and
let's do this find once again because I
want to focus in on the object ID now
this is just a unique key that's going
to be made up of 24 hexadecimal numbers
and two digits of this unique key or
going to represent each byte so the
first four bytes or eight characters or
going to represent a timestamp for
whenever this was created and you can
see Barry Bonds was created before the
Babe Ruth as well as the Hank Aaron
right here the next three are going to
represent right there a unique ID for
the computer that generated this
information the next two bytes right
here are going to represent a unique ID
based on the process for the computer
whenever this was all generated and then
the last three bytes are going to be
incrementing numbers for each generated
ID and you can see as they're being
generated they are going to be
incrementing okay so that's an ID and
now you know exactly what it looks like
and what all those numbers mean also if
I then wait to come in and delete a
document also easily done I just type in
DB and the name of the database that I
am using and then remove and then I just
have to tell it well how to match what I
want to delete so I'm saying here
basically that I want to delete a
document if the name has equivalent to
Babe Ruth and make sure you spell
everything right of course and then I
close off that document and close off
the remove function and you can see
indeed that it has been removed just
want to show you once again which we use
pretty here we're going to be able to
output all that information on our
screen or if we use find with pretty and
if you add more and more data types it's
going to get prettier and prettier so
add lots of different information to
your documents to make it prettier now I
can also come in here and update a
documents and to do that go in and use
the update function and start off I have
to define how to match
the document that I want to update and
I'm saying here that I want to match the
document that has the name of Hank Aaron
put a column in there and then after
that what I'm going to do is define of
what information I want to update and I
can update information that's already
there or I can insert additional
information I'm just going to have to
put a dollar sign and sat next and then
I'm going to put in name if I want to
update the name I can do that
so when to have it be Hank Lewis Aaron
and also in the same exact place without
doing anything so I put in common
between it I can also insert additional
information so let's say I wanted to
chart the number of home runs that were
associated with Hank Aaron I could do so
and put 755 inside of there and then I
just have to close off this document
right here and then I have to close off
this part right here that comes right
before the set then I have to close off
the update function and when I did that
you can see that updated and if we come
in here into a finds you can now see
that all that additional information was
updated in the Hank Aaron document that
we have now we're also going to be able
to update multiple documents what I want
to do here first though is insert
multiple documents so just like we did
before I'm going to do an insertion with
an array so insert I'm going to put a
document inside of here it's going to
have name and it's going to be Babe Ruth
because I think we deleted Babe Ruth out
of here I'm going to put additional
information being Hall of Fame and let's
say that I want to put inductee inside
of here and then I'm going to close that
document off and let's go in and throw
in a bunch of other different people and
there you can see those and hit enter
and you can see the five were inserted
and we can come in here and do a find
and you can see all that information and
how they match up but the original thing
was to update multiple documents not to
show you how to insert multiple
documents so let's see exactly how to do
an update on multiple documents does
database and I'm going to say update and
the first thing you have to do is tell
it how to match the information that I
want to update so I want to match for
the key of Hall of Fame and the value of
inductee and there that is close that
off put a comma and then
have to come in and Stockley tell it
what I want changed in all the documents
that match with this once again put set
inside of here and then I'm going to say
Hall of Fame and I'm going to say
inducted in 1936 and I have to close off
the document that I have their clothes
off the other curly bracket comes before
set and then if I want multiple values
to be changed at once
I have to go multi followed by true and
then close that off and then close off
the update function and there we go and
you can see that I matched five and I
modified five so all that information
should be perfect if I come in here you
can see that they all indeed did change
so I'm pretty cool another thing we can
do is we can increment values so if we
come in here and do a find and we say
that what we were looking to find is
name and Hank Louis Aaron like that and
you can see there that came in here
let's say that I wanted to increment the
value of homeruns for this I can do that
so I've got a test database update
doesn't make much sense to do this with
Hank Aaron since he's no longer playing
baseball but for other things that will
come up this will definitely be very
useful I just have to again say what
exactly I want to update and then if I
want to come in and increment I just
come in there like this dollar sign
increment and then what exactly I want
to increment and by how much I want to
increment it so I can go home runs and
if I want to increment the value I just
put a one inside of there and then I
close off all the curly brackets and do
that and if we do a find on Hank Aaron
you can see they went up to 756 now if I
then wanted to come in and decrement it
well we could just come up here to the
update part and just change this to
negative one and hit enter and if we do
another find on hand closer and you can
see that it's back down to 755 so that's
how to increment as well as decrement we
could also come in here and multiply
values so let's say that I wanted to
come in here and figure out how many
home runs Hank Aaron might have had if
you would have played for one additional
year I don't know I'm just making stuff
up I would just change the increment
over here to MU L for multiplication and
then I just have to define how much I
want to multiply the value inside of
homeruns by
I'm going to say at 1.04 since he played
baseball for 28 years I believe
we met here and run that matched and
modified and if we then do a find on it
you can see that seven hundred eighty
five point two home runs comes up and of
course using the multiplication function
right there we will also be able to
handle the vision and so forth and so on
we can also add to an array or create
one if it doesn't already exist come in
here and create this and we'll go update
and what we've said that we want to
update here is a name that matches for
Barry Bonds and to push additional
information onto this I would just go
with the dollar sign and push and then
the additional information that I want
to push on to it so I could just have
records and then I could throw on a
document that is going to contain
single-season home run record home runs
career as well as walks so we could go
single-season runs
seventy three home runs in career and
walks and I just have to close off those
curly brackets and then close off the
update function and we matched and we
modified and we do a find on here for
name and let's just change this to Barry
Bonds and there you can see that we went
in and through a records array inside of
here and inside of that records array we
have a bunch of documents that contain
different records that Barry Bonds has
set during his career as a baseball
player
just to show you something you may use a
bunch of times but isn't terribly common
let's say that we wanted to have a
maximum number of items on an array
would be able to have well we could Jim
in here and we could do an update once
again we have to show what we want to
update so we want to update the document
that has the name of Barry Bonds then
once again we can come in and we can do
a push push this information on here and
the information we want to push on here
now is best home run years and then to
this and use the each command and then
I'm going to put an array inside of here
of the best years he had so we're going
to throw that on there now we have six
inside of there but let's say that we
want to only allow five items in that
array to go on there at one time let me
do a slice and put in five like that
FLOTUS off all the curly brackets closed
off the update function and one matched
and one modified I'm in here and you can
see that only five went on there instead
of the six that I had listed so that's
one way to limit information that goes
on there we could also use another item
called add to set which is going to add
a value only if it already doesn't exist
so this is going to be another update
function and once again we're just going
to match for name and the name we're
going to match for is Barry Bonds add to
set once again it's going to add it if
it doesn't exist however if it does
exist it won't add it and I have to say
exactly what I want to add to so best
hon homerun years which is the item that
I just placed inside of there in this
situation I'm going to say that I want
to add 47 to it we go one match one
modified and if we come in here to see
the information on Barry Bonds first off
the slice no longer is going to impede
the ability to put additional
information inside of there and also you
can see that since 47 didn't exist it
did indeed add it in however if it would
have existed it wouldn't have added it
we're also going to be able to come in
here and remove the last item in anorak
see if we can do this a little bit
easier here is the update so I'm going
to match for Barry Bonds but instead of
add to set like I have here right now
I'm instead going to put in pav and I'm
going to let this be best home run years
and I want to pop off the last item
inside of that array so I'm going to put
one inside of there
see I matched it and I modified it and
if we do a find you're going to see the
47 disappeared the 47 that I just placed
inside of there so that's how to pop off
the last item in the array inside of a
document we could also come in and
remove the first item in an array once
again very very similar way we're going
to use update once again we're going to
use pop here once again the only thing
we're going to change we're going to put
negative one inside of there there we
can see we matched and we modified do a
find and you can see one of the
additional or the first homerun that we
had inserted in there which was 45 is
now gone and another thing we can do is
actually remove items specific items and
we're going to
to it in much the same way we're going
to use our update once again but instead
of pop we're going to use the pull
command so let's get rid of that and
type in pull instead best home run years
that's what we want to match or where we
want to pull information from and in
this situation we want to pull the
specific number of 73 out of there and
remove it from the array we matched we
did all that and you can now see that 73
is gone all right so there is a whole
bunch of different ways of inserting
updating and all kinds other different
things we're moving information from
documents using MongoDB now let's take a
look at quarrying the database first
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
come in here and drop some information
out of this database and I just took in
drop like that and now all that
information is gone and if I then come
in and do a find on this let's just get
rid of all this stuff and then put find
inside of there you're going to see that
the database is empty now I'm going to
insert a ton of information so that we
will be able to come in and do a whole
bunch of different querying so just
paste in all this information I'll go
through here exactly what's going on
okay so we're doing just a basic insert
we're using an array of documents you
can see named Dale Cooper street
addresses cities states date of birth
this is how we would create a specific
date inside of a document you can see I
put a date of birth inside of there
there's mail there's GPA the status you
can see I have here student you can also
see we have an array right here contact
information and all of that so I'm going
to be querying all of these different
students and right there I went and
inserted 10 different students that we
will be querying information from so
let's say I want to come in here into a
fine and I specifically wanted a student
that's going to be from the state of
Washington and then let's say also that
I wanted this person that I want to be
searching for to be a male a problem and
that is how easy that is and then close
that off close that off and let's do a
pretty on site for that and there you
can see all that information is printed
out so out of all the students that have
inside of there Dale Cooper came from
Washington he has a male as well as
Harry Truman came from Washington and
he's also a male and that's all the
additional information that I have on
the
two different students that I have in my
class now let's say that I didn't want
all that information literally every
piece of information on the student but
I only wanted the name and the date of
birth for male students that come from
the state of Washington I can do that as
well let's just come in here and do this
right here and we'll leave pretty on
there and right after this little curly
bracket right here I want to go and put
additional information inside of that so
that additional information is that I
only want the name to be returned and in
that situation I put a colon and one if
I were to put a colon in 0 it would
specifically say I didn't want something
and date of birth I also want that to be
returned everything else can be exactly
the same well make sure you put a curly
bracket in here however to close off
that additional information enter and
now you can see that the object ID and
the name and the date of birth also
comes back like I said if I would have
wanted the object ID not to show up I
would put a colon in 0 but you're going
to see more of that here in a moment oh
why don't I just show team right now so
let's come in here and do this and just
put in another comma like that in this
situation underscore ID colon and 0 and
if I do that and I run this command now
it's just going to show me the name as
well as the date of birth and it's going
to not show me the ID the thing is kind
of neat is we're gonna be able to do
queries in which we can search for
things that are less than greater than
greater than or equal to or less than or
equal to so let's say that I wanted to
find students in my class with a GPA and
a range between 3.0 and 3.5 tested eBay
do a find GPA is what I'm specifically
searching for and then inside of curly
brackets I define that I want to look
for things that are greater than or
equal to if it was just greater then it
would just be GT greater than or equal
to 3.0 and I can define a whole bunch of
different rules here and I'm going to
say less than or equal to : 3.5 and then
I can just close off those two curly
brackets and then let's say that I only
want to get the name and GPA to be
returned afterwards I would just type in
name like that : and a 1 and I also said
that I wanted the GPA to read be
returned only so I put one there and
then I do not want the ID to be returned
because it just gets in a way type in a
zero there
close that off close off the fine
function and there you can say pops back
all the students that have the matching
conditions for that information so
pretty neat we're also going to be able
to come in and search for people that
were born at different dates and like I
said we can come in here and use
JavaScript if we would like so we could
have something like the Year 1969 is
equal to and create a new date inside of
here and find a date which is going to
be January the 1st of 1969 and that is
defined and now what I'll be able to do
is come in and do a search so let's do a
test DB and a find and I'm going to say
that I want to search for date of birth
and specifics for it so greater than and
I can go and put that variable that I
just created right there that's going to
contain that information on the date
that I'm searching for so I'm looking
for people that have a date of birth
that's greater than 1969 and once again
let's just say that I wanted to get the
name returned and then I also want the
date of birth returned and I do not want
the ID returned and there you can see
show a Johnson pop back and there is her
date of birth and on a hayward pop back
and there is her date of birth I could
also do searches in which I look for
things that are not equal to so we could
do a test DB now to find and
specifically looking for people that
have a sex value that is not equal to
male so you can do a not equal to or an
equal to and let's on top of that let's
say that we want to look for a status to
make sure that this is a student we're
looking for and once again let's just
limit the information let's say that we
want to get their name but we do not
want to get the students ID and their
comes back with Donna Hayward Audrey
Horne and Lucy Moran so pretty neat
let's do some more just want to cover as
many of these as humanly possible so
that you can see all these different
little tricks and functions and things
that are built into MongoDB this one I'm
going to say that I want to look for
GPAs I want to find GPAs that are having
equivalents inside of an array a 3.4 3.5
3.6 or 3.7 once again what I'm going to
be searching inside up is going to be
GPA
then I'm specifically looking for things
that are contained inside of the array
that I'm going to put inside here let's
go in the next line so if they match up
GPA wise to three point thrower or three
point seven I want that information to
be popped back to me close off all those
curly brackets and let's keep this nice
and simple and let's just say that we
want that name and no ID
those that off close that off and you
can see the tail Cooper Harry Truman
those are the students that have GPAs
that are equal to one of those different
values inside of our array and we could
also come in and find all GPAs except
for 3.4 to 3.7 in much the same way and
what I'm going to say is not in so we
want to find all the matches that are
not in this array and let's just leave
that be exactly the same right there in
that situation you get all the other
students that didn't match the first
time we could don't also do or searches
so let's say we wanted to get results if
one thing was equal or another thing was
equal so let's say we're specifically
looking for troubled students I only
could come in and do a find and the
additional information we want to put
here is or so we're looking for
either/or of these different things and
the different things we're going to be
looking for it's going on a new line I'm
going to put this inside a member right
and I'm going to say that we want it
returned
if status for the student is dropout
that would be a situation in which the
students probably in some trouble closed
that off like this and then put a comma
and then the next thing we're looking
for so maybe we'll be looking for GPAs
that are less than 3.0 close that array
off and then close off the curly bracket
and I just want to come in here and get
the names so that I would be able to
come in and contact them without any
other additional information close that
off and you can see those are either our
dropouts or our students that have a GPA
that is below 3.0 which is less than
okay
we could also use another command in
which we could find GPAs that are not
greater than a certain amount and using
the find command so here we're saying
GPA that's what we're looking for and
then the specific thing
looking for is a GPA that doesn't meet
this condition which would be greater
than 3.0 close off all those curly
brackets and there you can see all the
students that don't have a GPA greater
than 3.0 another thing we can do is
let's say that we just want to contact
three students per day we can do a limit
on this just by leaving this be exactly
the same way that it is and then putting
a limit at the end of it and then
throwing three inside of there you can
say pop back first three also in a
similar vein we could skip certain
numbers so let's say that we contacted
the first three and we want to skip the
first three this time just do skip
there's the next three students that we
want to contact and we could also come
in and sort these different students in
a very similar way let's go and do
exactly the same thing that we had
before and instead we're just going to
put sort and then how we want to have
these students sorted we want them to
have them sorted by name oops and I
forgot to put the little curly bracket
right there let's just Gump in here it's
curly bracket like this and there you
can see that they're all sorted in
alphabetical order based off a first
name and then let's keep on going let's
talk about regular expressions I'm not
going to get too much into regular
expressions I have tutorials on them if
you'd like to see let's say that I
wanted to find every single student that
first name began with a letter D do that
this is testing do a find and what I'm
specifically going to be looking for is
name and then if I want to search for a
name I'm going to put forward slash this
is a regular expression I'm going to put
the caret which is going to match for
the beginning of the line then going to
look for a letter D that's the reason
why that's inside of there and then I'm
going to put a dot and a star whenever
you see that a dot and a star what that
means we want to match any number of
characters which is the dot part and
this star matches many different times
and then at the end of this I'm going to
put a dollar sign which is going to be
the end of one and then close off the
regular expression itself OOP and it
gave me a little error because I forgot
the little squiggle mark there again a
little curly bracket there that is right
there and we can continue onwards here
in which we're going to say that we want
our name and not the ID and there you
can see the two students that have the
name that begins with
the capital letter D we can do all sorts
of regular expressions of course we
could also come in and check tests so
let's say that we wanted to find
students that got a zero on one of their
tests and we wanted to come up here and
correct that and look into how we could
deal with that student in our tests
array that we have assigned to this and
I have all this available of course link
in the description you could look at the
array while we're doing these queries
maybe that might help make a little bit
more sense and there you can see Shelly
Johnson and James Hurley inside of the
tests array come back with a zero and
let's do a quick find you could come in
here and see tests say there was an
array called tests and there's all the
different test scores that we had inside
of there for the different students
that's what I was searching inside of
another thing we could do is maybe do a
search in which a student received a 10
out of 10 on a test and a zero on a test
meaning that something sort of up with
this student and then we should go and
take a closer look at how we might be
able to help them do a fine and we could
do tests which is what we're going to be
searching for right here again make sure
you put that curly bracket inside of
there and what we're going to be
searching for in this situation is we're
going to use all and what we're saying
here is we are looking for a situation
in which the tests array contains a 0
and a 10 and you can see that Shelly
Johnson pops back so that's a situation
we had a student that got a 10 on one of
her tests and then go to zero
something's up with Shelly and we should
definitely check her out to make sure
that everything is ok with her we could
also have other situations in which we
want to take go and find students that
got a 10 on their first test and we
would just use indexes in that situation
so let's come in here and let's go and
get this guy if we specifically want to
look at the very first test we would put
point 0 that said 0 indexed array and
we'll look for a value of 10 inside of
there and you can see that Dale Cooper
Shelly Johnson Donna Hayward all got a
10 on their very first test so that's
how we could search individual different
arrays let's say that we just had an
additional test and we want to push that
new test score on to a student array we
can do that as well of course test DV in
that situation we're going to do an
update and we will first off come in and
we'll say what we want to update so
we're looking for a document that's
going to have a name
that's going to match with Dale Cooper
and then specifically what we want to
update is the tests array and we want to
push additional information onto an
array we use the push command this and
push and the array that we want to push
information on to is called tests and
what we want to push onto it is a test
score of nine goes off the curly
brackets you can see that it went and
matched and it modified don't need to go
and look at that you can look at it on
your own then what we can do is come in
and check for students that have taken
for tests using the size function and
this is only and come back with one
because that's Dale Cooper because he's
the only one that we input in there at
the time so I do to us and we're going
to do size and what we're looking for is
a size of four for the tests array you
can see Dale Cooper pops back because
he's the only student that took the test
ordered we entered the information in
regards to his test score anyway we
could also come in and get a specific
number of tests out of our test array as
well Dale Cooper and specifically what
we're looking for is our tests array and
then we can say that we want to get the
first two tests out of it so we just use
a slice command which you saw before and
go in there and play around with all
these different things see what types of
interesting information you can get out
of it and there's all the information on
Dale Cooper and you can see down here if
we come down to the test part that it
just shows the first two tests that Dale
Cooper took let's come in here and do a
couple little bit more here just to
cover last couple queries if you want to
get the last two tests the Dale Cooper
talk dudes negative two and you're going
to see there's eight there's the nine
likewise we'd be able to come in here
and get the second and third tests that
he took just by going inside of here and
putting two square brackets and then
let's say that we wanted to skip the
first one so we want the number one
index which is going to be the second
item and then we want to total items
from that point and there you can say
nine and eight pop back other things
kind of neat is let's do a find right
here you can see down inside of here
where we have a document inside of a
document so there's contact information
and inside of it we have the email
address how do we go in there and get
the information inside of that document
just to find
let's say that we specifically wanted to
find the student with the name Lucy
Moran and get her email address to
contact our for some reason we just say
what we want to match then inside of
here we can just put additional
information so we'll say we want name
that's going to show up and then we want
it contact info and if we want the email
inside of there and just put a dot right
that and there that is and one and there
that is and you can see it pops back the
email address for Lucy Moran and then
the final thing I'm going to cover here
let's search for a match using the dot
operator so I'll do test ebay find again
we just put contact info which is the
name and phone is specifically what
we're going to be looking for and let's
say that we're looking for somebody with
the phone number seven nine two dot two
two three one one one five and we want
to get that student's name as well as
that's or we don't want their ID nothing
come back because I put a dot up here
let's go up here and fix that dot and
Tommy Hill pops back so there you go
guys that is a ton of information in
regards to how to insert delete update
and query a whole bunch of different
documents using MongoDB and please leave
