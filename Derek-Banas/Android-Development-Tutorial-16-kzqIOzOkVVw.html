16 of my android development tutorial
today I'm going to introduce you to
Android fragments if you haven't watched
in the previous tutorials I provide a
link to the playlist in the upper right
hand corner and of course like always
all the code is available in a link in
the description for this video and
basically I'm going to break down
fragments when I say introduction I mean
I'm breaking them down to the most
simplistic of levels and then with the
videos that come after it we're going to
build on layers of complexity but for
now I want you to 100% understand
everything in this video so basically a
fragment is a sort of mini activity
which you can add or remove from other
activities and this is going to allow
you to create really nice interfaces and
really complex interfaces and you're
going to be able to use them to create
reusable pieces you'll be able to add to
your interface and they're often used so
that depending upon whatever screen size
of the device that the person is using
with your application you'll be able to
either add more or less fragments in any
way you want so enough talking I have a
lot to do so let's get into it okay so
here I am back in my nice friendly
Eclipse and I'm going to be creating
strings.xml dimensions that XML fragment
text viewed XML activity main.xml simple
fragment Java and main activity job a
whole bunch of files but they're all
going to be pretty short and I'm going
to start off inside of strings.xml here
and I'm just going to add another string
inside of here and here I'm going to put
instead of hello world I'm going to put
in hello fragments and then down here
I'm going to call this main textview
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
display some words in the main activity
as well as in a fragment on top of that
activity so it's going to be simple but
like you said fragments are very easy to
get convoluted and crazy and that's it
that's all the changes I'm making to
strings or XML so now I'm going to go
into Dimensions XML over here gonna do
some simplistic things again
I'm just going to add one little guy
inside of here and this is just going to
handle the padding for my components so
I'm just going to call this component
padding and input in 5dp say if that's
done now I'm going to jump into the
actual fragment itself inside of
fragment textview XML this is going to
be the XML version of it anyway I
basically can leave everything here
exactly the same except I'm going to
come in here and go textview and then
I'm going to add a whole bunch of
different things here like I'm going to
get the width and the height up here
paste that inside there and I'm going to
change this to match parent should it
did that before and this to match parent
and there we go then the only other
thing I'm going to do is put the text
inside of it
Android text is equal to and then I'm
going to take one of my strings inside
of here and I'm going to put in hello
world hello fragments but whatever and
then I'm going to close that textview
off and that's going to represent the
textview
fragment we're going to be using now I'm
going to jump over into activity main
put the guy in place and if you're
wondering why I'm using match parent in
this situation the reason why is fill
parent has been deprecated so there's no
other reason asides from that so now
what I want to do is put it in another
textview I'm just going to jump over
here and copy this and then jump back
into activity main there's a new text
view layout width I'm going to set this
to zero pixels and the reason why I'm
going to do that is so that I will be
able to define absolutely everything in
regards to how much screen real estate
this textview is going to take up using
weight so what I'm going to have is two
text views on the screen one is a
fragment one isn't and they're equally
going to take up 50% so that's what's
going on there Android and I just
decided to use the text editor rather
than the graphical tool this time and
this is going to be like a light yellow
and then inside of this I'm going to add
in our text padding component padding
that's just going to put the five pixels
around it then this guy is going to be
changed to main textview and that's
going to be the text inside of there so
now I need to create a text view for our
fragment so there we go
view I'm going to assign an ID for this
guy so I'll be able to reference it
later technically should put an ID on
all of them and because this is a new ID
that I'm creating here going to put the
plus sign inside of there there we are
simple fragment setup going to leave
this set at zero pixels again so that
weight is going to define that it's
going to take up 50% and this is going
to take up 50% this is going to be
matched parent I'm going to get rid of
the background color orientation in this
situation I'm going to grab this come
back down inside of here paste that in
there and I'm going to change this to
vertical component padding is going to
be perfectly fine right there and I'm
not going to put anything inside of that
and there we go now main activity or
activity main.xml setup now I'm going to
go into simple fragment Java and
actually write some code so like I said
before a fragments just pretty much a
mini activity it's going to allow you to
add little pieces to your overall layout
or delete them or lay them out in
different ways depending upon screen
size that's what they are and to use
them I'm going to say extends fragment
and of course I'm going to have to go
get my libraries for this there we go
and actually to use this version of
fragment I'm going to go into the
androidmanifest.xml file this guy right
here he's way down here if you don't
know where it is and I'm going to change
this to 11 later on we can roll it back
so that we'll be able to use more
different types of devices but for now
I'm going to leave that at 11 another
thing I'm going to do with this guy is
I'm going to go into source right up
here and then come down here where it
says override implement methods click on
that and you're going to see this come
up here this is the fragment class and
what I'm going to be able to do is go
through here and define that I want
certain methods to be created whenever I
use this class or whenever I extend it
and I'm going to leave it as my first
member and hit OK and there you can see
oncreate was thrown inside of there
which is good because we definitely need
it now what oncreate is going to do is
it's going to be called whenever the
fragment is first called for whenever
the activity says hey I want you this is
the guy that's going to be called I'm
just going to get rid of this
then I'll go through exactly what all of
these different attributes here do the
layout inflator is going to inflate the
XML file into the view and it's going to
specifically inflate fragment text view
dot XML that guy right there into your
activity so you can see it view group
this guy right here is an abstract class
that all view groups like linear layout
for example extend so that's what that
guy does and then bundle you've seen
bundles before if you've watched
previous tutorials it's just used to
pass data between activities such as the
variable data you want to save if the
orientation of the device changes and
things like that okay so that's what all
those different guys do so the very
first thing we're going to do is create
a view here and I'm going to call it
simple fragment view and what this guy's
going to do is inflate the fragment put
it on our device so we just go inflator
inflate spell inflate it right and then
we just have to say what specifically do
we want to inflate well I want layout
dot and then I'm going to say I want to
inflate fragment text view this guy up
here just like I said before okay
well then after that what I need to do
is push in container and then I'm going
to say false at the end and that is just
in reference to what is called attach to
root as the attribute and it is used
whenever you don't want to attach the
fragment to the main activity or the
linear layout and that's what it's for
so now you know and then at the bottom
of this I'm just going to go simple
fragment view copy that and we're going
to return that write this and like that
and there we go we got our fragment set
up it's basically just going to get our
XML file that we created this guy over
here and it's going to push it into our
main activity I mean that's it so now we
just create the main activity and we're
done and here is our main activity
basically to manage fragments we just
are going to need something called the
fragment manager and what the fragment
manager does is basically just provides
different methods for interacting with
fragments inside of the activity and I'm
just going to
a fragment manager just to be simple and
to get it we just get fragment manager
that's it okay so we're ready to go with
that and we're using the Android app
version right here like I said next
tutorial we're all going to change that
but for the most part everything is
going to look the same so don't get
scared and think well why is even doing
this then what I need to do is get
myself a fragment transaction and I'm
just going to call this fragment
transaction and what this is going to
allow you to do is to add remove replace
to find different animations for
fragments and different things like that
then what you got to do is take your
fragment manager up here base that in
then we're going to call begin
transaction and that specific method is
just going to notify it Android that
you're ready to begin editing the
fragments that you're using then we have
to create our fragment object which he
already did that's what we created it in
simple fragment Java previously and I'm
just going to call it simple fragment is
equal to new simple fragment and then we
issue a transaction with the fragment
transaction and this specific one is
going to add our fragment to the
activity so we just go our ID dot simple
fragment and then we're going to say
simple fragment pretty simple and then
the final thing we need to do is go
fragment transaction commit and
basically all that's going to do is to
schedule for the addition of the
fragment to our activity and that's it
we're done
very simple explained to everything that
was my goal here so let's execute it and
let's look at what we made
and whenever we execute our application
you can see right here main activity
textview and hello fragments this is the
fragment this is the main activity looks
really simple but guess what you can put
pretty much anything inside of here that
you would put in a main activity have
them completely separate you can add or
remove it depending upon what the
resolution the device is you can move it
over here you can move it pretty much
anywhere I mean it's a fragment totally
functional and in the next couple
tutorials I'm going to show you how to
make them look really nice please leave
your questions and comments below
otherwise till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
