do what I hope will be the definitive
explanation of how to write HTML I know
that's really going out there and I keep
making changes until everybody who wants
to know HTML knows it it's not very
complicated a web browser basically
Rives HTML which is just a text file
filled with tags and tags are just words
or individual characters in angled
brackets that tell the browser what test
needs emphasis is a paragraph where to
get images how to take a visitor to
another page etc there are 89 total tags
but most of the time you only use 20
here are the most common tags
first off doctype defines what type of
document you're using this will almost
always be the same on every HTML page
you ever create so you don't even need
to know what this is just cut and paste
it
right here it finds a link that if
clicked will take the user to another
web page B tells the browser that you
wish for the text to be surrounds to be
bolded body tells the browser that this
is the beginning of the main content of
your web page this little guide here
creates a line break it skips to the
next line eeehm italicizes the text
between these tags form defines an area
in which the visitor can interact with
your website creates a for Marion h1 to
h6 defines text that you want to
emphasize normally a title between the
head tag you would describe the content
of your document HR dress up draws a
horizontal line on your web page HTML
the funds beginning and ending of your
HTML page IMG tells the browser you
wanted to ruin certain image li defines
an item in a list you wish to pull it Oh
L tells the browser and an ordered list
is about to be defined P
defines that a paragraph of text is
being defined table defines there's a
table title is where you put the title
of your webpage and you Elvis tells the
browser that an unordered list is to be
defined and that is basically all you
need to know about tags in HTML I'll
cover all the times in detail for
completion reasons throughout the rest
of this presentation first off here's
the doctype that you would copy and
paste into your web page
it starts off every HTML file then let
have this set up these are what are
called block quotes I have descriptions
here of what the HTML is so this is the
HTML that is not in blue boxes so after
you define doctype you would then tell
the browser that your HTML code is about
to begin and you do that by having
bracket HTML that's it then you divide
your heading remember heading is where
you define describe the content of your
web page then this line again copy and
paste tells the browser what language
you're writing in this area here style
will define any changes that you want to
make in regards to style for example I'm
telling it here that I want everything
that is enclosed in h1 brackets or tags
to be the color red here we have link or
e l equals stylesheet this tells the
browser that it should go pick up this
file and style all of your text based
off of what this file tells you again
this is something they'll be covering
the cascading style sheets tutorial
coming up this is where you would
provide ating description of what is on
your web page
here is where you would define any
keywords that you wish to associate with
your web page meta name equals keywords
content
filling keywords here you would define
if you liked the author the web page
title is where you would provide the
title of your webpage obviously you
would want to put a closing tag at the
end of the title section so that the
browser is aware that the title has
ended and you always want to put a
closing tag here is the closing tag for
your header section of your HTML file
now we're going to tell the browser that
your content is about to begin
in the head section you are going to be
defining what your document is about
mainly title descriptions the end
keyword body is where you actually have
your content we would open up that with
the body section then we're going to
have a kenning this is again another
tank you can see here examples of an h1
header and h2 header h3 the whole way to
h6 again just to close the text within
the tags this is an abbreviation tag you
can see what it does right here when I
put my mouse over top of the breviary
tag it puts a little pop-up right there
this is what is shown when somebody puts
a mouse over top radiated link the
acronym does pretty much the exact same
thing as you can see this is displayed
when a person puts a mouse over it this
is what shows up and this is what the
tag looks like if you want that feature
you can see here I use this B tag or
bold tag to bold the text I used the big
tag to make the text bigger blockquote
this is actually a block quote normally
however block quotes are just indented
but I have a style for my blog quote
we'll go to that in the cascading
stylesheets tutorial if I want to Center
text like I did right here I would just
place a Center tag around it with a
closing center tag
when to draw emphasis or into italicized
text use the e/m tag I wanted to draw a
horizontal rule I would just type in HR
forward slash in a closing bracket
here's another way to isalud sighs your
text with the I tagged with the P tag
you can define a paragraph with a Q tag
you can define a quote if I wanted to
draw a line through my text I would use
the estatic strikethrough small wouldn't
it protect smaller strong make the text
larger and bold it and to finish off the
descriptions of the major tags I will
show you right here subscript and
superscript it and I skipped over a
couple tags but I'm going to be covering
them later on in the presentation real
quickly here I'll go over the image tag
basically an image tag looks like this
and I'll show you what all of this
information means image basically tells
the browser that an image is pawel ready
to be displayed source SRC in this case
tells the browser where the image is
located and you can have this be
anywhere even on a website that you do
not have alt tells the browser that you
want alternative text to be displayed if
the person cannot see the photograph
height defines how big you want the text
of the image to be and which defines I
want obviously and that's basically all
there is to know in regards to image
tags there are other attributes you
could use but they're considered to be
in that standing and in the current
world but basically just leave it at
that so these are all the you need to
know in regards to defining image
in the next presentation I'm going to go
over all of the list tags to create
different lists and proceed onwards from
there hope this helps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
