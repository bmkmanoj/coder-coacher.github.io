telephone sales presentation this is the
second part of that presentation so you
should probably go and watch the
previous version for so much miss some
things might not make sense
my lady sent at the end of the last
presentation telephone sales is all
about for the three real name things
attitude acknowledge and move on and
never ask for permission always assume
the sale and as well I'll give you a
couple other tips attitude is not a
cliche throughout life you have to
really try to grasp onto whatever it is
that makes you happy
and the reason why is that success is
10% of really what happens to you and me
we'll have unlucky times and so forth
and subtle but the really successful
people I came across in life I'm not
really Sam I'm Susan or anything by any
means but I'm just talking about people
that have came across that have been
really successful just seem to always no
matter what happens to them they would
just turn almost anything and I saw by
being a trainer and also whatever I was
in sales the people that surrounded me
those people that had the best attitude
its and laughed off everything just so
happen also be the best salespeople and
what you have to understand there's a
couple quick tips if you start to feel
yourself getting in a bad attitude or
start to feel yourself get angry or
upset or depressed or whatever a lot of
psychologists say you could switch
yourself out of that to move quick
enough to just stand up and start doing
jumping jacks start doing something very
easy just do anything you can't keep
yourself negative mood and if you are
only people with bad attitude we all
know that that will rub off on you
suggest get away from them if you're an
employer Feiner them or just simply
don't hire them in the first place
custom the reason why these customers
can set your attitude on the telephone
in telephone sales there's a calming for
a smile and dial and it is there's
something I'm not quite sure what it is
but there's something and into this
in regards to if you do smile at those
seem people crossed the telephone can
actually sense that and if a customer
flips out on you
very few will just say thank you have a
nice day and move on it's simple
so what is acknowledging move on if
someone responds to a mailer this was a
technique I used after the Do Not Call
list came out I would post an
advertisement and local newspapers that
if people responded that advertisement I
would simply call them up and say Oh
Paul first let's say yes this is Derek
pianist with ABC insurance how are you
doing to that pretty good which would
elicit another yes now why did I say
that how are you today a pretty good eye
because I don't really I mean I'm
certainly doing fabulous but when it
comes down to it I don't have time and
if you don't do this you will
occasionally somebody will spend a half
an hour telling you other days
that's why it's there why am I trying to
loose it yes yes the reason why is this
is called the offset and it is in fact
that if somebody says yes no matter what
they're saying yes to a certain percent
number of times each time they say
that's the chance that they will say yes
to what you want them to do we're going
astronomically I think you to do call I
call because I received a request for
information from you on whenever they
requested information I click back
together and I'll be providing it on
Tuesday at 1:00 or 6:30 which works best
for you just that simple why did I see
providing reason one is I don't want the
person to think I'm just coming I'm
gonna hand them a packet and leave I
want you to tell them that I am
definitely going to provide them with as
much help in regards to the information
I put together as possible
normally around the time that I would
get to the point of a be insurance first
when we say something like I've loved
your instant why well that person is
confused
you caught them off-guard you call them
they were expecting a telephone call
they mailed the information in but very
often they might have even forgotten
about an alien so what do you say I
don't care what the objection is I
understand that but the reason that I
called don't do this
wait wait wait or well let me tell you
or don't know you don't want to do that
you will weaken yourself you want to
just simply say no matter what they say
I understand that but the reason that I
called you also don't want to get into a
Q&amp;amp;A session like for example if they say
well I already do business with look you
don't want to follow up with well well
who you buy or what you buy from them or
how much does it cost
where are they nice you never want to
get into this sort of situation where
there's a Q&amp;amp;A session going on and in
fact if you do get into this situation
you know more than likely you've already
lost the first again I have all of the
blank if I need you follow that up with
I'm glad to hear that but the reason why
I call your calling because they
requested information not for any other
reason not because they already do
business well the competitor you're only
calling because they requested it at
some point they decided in their life
that they may want to buy from you so
why not assume that today they would
again want to buy from you or one help
from you or assume they still want the
information that they ask for it I mean
it's just common sense then they might
retort with I didn't mail you anything
to you well you say let me check the
information to make sure I'm talking to
the right person
yes again of step I'm establishing yes
this is mr. Hall shadows with yes anyway
the one two three may extreme and he
follows up with yes yes you say and that
is it Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
he says yes and then you follow up with
yes Paul I have that information for you
and you requested and I'll be and you
continue with your call a lot of people
seem to believe there are tons of
objections they need to worry about and
insert in trying to think about answers
to every single objection they basically
find themselves a nice excuse to not
just you know a telephone there's
basically six objections one is I'm not
interested second is I have all of
whatever you're selling I need third I
don't have time for I don't have any
money
fifth occasionally somebody would shoot
out an expletive or they can hang up
that's it those are the projections and
pretty much every one of them has the
same so do you know if somebody does
hang up on you say hello Paul after you
call them obviously when Paul or we
disconnected or did you hang up 80% of
feed people I actually found will say
they were disconnected they're
embarrassed great the reason for my call
and then you continue most people in
fact when you do this will not stream
expletives at you or tell you how you're
such a terrible person most people if
you are late and nice and doing this
will complement you on yourself skills
often the rhetoric whatever I did this
was you're not coming to my house
because you're a heck of a sale version
so if you want to answer to what are
people gonna do whenever you follow up
this way that's what they do be
persistent at all times but always be
polite the average person that followed
my scripts I wrote on average these were
new employees made one appointment for
every 10 conversations during their
first week this in comparison the
average agent company-wide this is
everybody from the most advanced most
experienced to the newest they average
one appointment for every 20
conversations so yes this does work and
yes I did
if you ask a question also remember this
is something I saw if you say to
somebody which works best for you want
or six-thirty
don't say anything understand you by no
means want to say are you still there so
that's a quick tip in regards to your
introduction by law you must state your
name and company and also it's just a
polite thing to do get excited smile you
know get revved up people like to hear
excited happy people sometimes I might
make a little bit sense to sound like
you don't particularly care if you sell
a product where they you mean with a
person this is a little bit more
advanced technique that you can do in
the future you also want to pace that
overall voice patterns but of course
don't make it obvious
well this presentation stretching a
little longer than I thought it was next
I'm going to get into the why not to ask
for permission and hopefully we can wrap
this up in three videos until next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
