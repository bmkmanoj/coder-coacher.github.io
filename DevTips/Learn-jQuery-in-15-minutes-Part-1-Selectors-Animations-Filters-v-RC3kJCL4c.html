we want to learn about jQuery our basic
selectors basic selectors are just like
CSS selectors you can use this to real
quickly run through your document and
select anything that you need to then
manipulate so for example we're just
going to start with the dollar sign and
then write a paragraph now this is
selecting all the paragraphs on the
pages and there's four of them let's
write a quick CSS method to just get the
boarder and turn it red now when I save
this all four of these paragraphs will
just turn red because I'm using this
paragraph selector tag but now what if I
want to select only the paragraphs with
the class of lead or I could use parent
and child as well so all of them that
are in the in the body I guess you know
that would still be the lead could even
select not only tag in class but let's
say ID we have an ID here of a lesson
one and it's selected we can use a CSS
star here to select everything in the
entire document in and make it have a
red border on it and now the design is
just perfect and those are basic
selectors they work just like we are
familiar with with CSS now let's move on
to basic animations I'm going to focus
on these little orange boxes here at the
bottom and I'm going to say I'm select
the boxes and then filter them for the
first one animus a box I want you to
what hide and I want you to do it over
500 milliseconds I'm going to hit save
it's going to shrink up and fade out and
that's hide you can also do show I'm in
the time that you put in here for
example I put 800 milliseconds is how
long it takes so now it's slower on the
coming out you can even put a delay dot
delay right in between them and say you
know 300 and now it's going to go up
stop and come back out so you can do
pretty powerful animations like this
instead of saying hide late let's do
something else
let's do slide capital you P get rid of
this delay here and now instead of
shrinking it's sliding up and coming
back down and we can say a slide down to
up-and-down fade-out which is just more
of like a opacity kind of animation so
these are all kind of methods that have
built-in animations now let's focus on
the actual animation method and it's
called animate actually inside of here
you can put any see
attribute and values so for example
height and let's say 200 pixels and then
after this curly bracket you put the
duration how long is that animation
going to last I'm gonna hit save and
this thing is going to grow 200 pixels
in 300 milliseconds and it doesn't have
to be just the you know the size of it
let's say for example bottom want to
move it up it goes up from 200 from the
bottom and you can chain these two so
for example bottom 200 pixels
well let's add another one let's add
left and now it's going up into the left
and you can say how long you want it to
do let's say 800 milliseconds right so
there's a lot of power built in to these
built-in animations and this is why
people like me really enjoy jQuery
because you just write one like line of
code and all of a sudden you have things
flying around on the page and it's just
so much fun next we're gonna talk about
index filters we've already seen this
where I save and it's just just just a
paragraphs but I can take all that
selection and filter it down with jQuery
to just the first or like the last or
even all the ones that are greater than
two that start either greater than 2 or
less than 2 or equal to 2 there you go
so you notice that it's the third
because this is zero index jQuery starts
counting with 0 so 0 1 2 that's what
we're talking about so those are index
filters you're basically walking through
your selection and finding the one that
you specify now let's quickly talk about
relationship filters these filters are
based on the relationship of the Dom
element so for example let's take this
h2 here and then we have one let's
actually add another one copy-paste but
this time let's remove this span inside
of it ok so now we have two h2 elements
and they're both being selected but now
we want to select only one that has
inside of it a span and there's only one
that has a child of a span and that's
the one that's being selected all right
let's get this selection out of here
let's look again at those boxes now I'm
selecting all the boxes now I want to
filter that selection for only the boxes
that that have things in them children
in them so if they have a children then
they are a parent so this selects only
the ones they have numbers because those
numbers are children but what about the
ones that are empty so it selects only
the last one here because it has no
children all right those are
relationship filters next let's look at
attribute filters HTML attributes are
things that are inside of the tag like
class or image source or like the href
on it on an anchor link and we can
filter for those things for example I
have all my paragraphs selected and I
can narrow that down to the ones that
have a class of lead like we've already
done before but it's a lot more powerful
than just saying has class of lead we
could do we could do things like name
and I think I named the second one
shorty or some reason but what about if
we don't know the full name but we know
just like a short string of it I could
say find the one that has any type of
the string name of shorty asur in show
with all else all I know and this can be
actually quite useful for example if I
want to look at all those links at the
bottom and I want a filter for the href
the one that has an href of doc cote UK
and i don't know all the links but I
know that it ends with like it's a it's
a British site I can use the dollar sign
to say this is the string that matches
at the end and so now because YouTube is
a British web site so I can find all of
the links that you know enjoy tea and
crumpets or something you can imagine
how powerful this can be if you want to
like search on the page for all of the
links that are PDFs the end in dot PDF
and add like a little link or something
like that right there's a lot of stuff
you can do here thanks for watching this
video it was so much fun to make and if
you like making cool things as much as I
do be sure to check out the rest of this
series and after that take your
JavaScript skills to the next level and
check out my killing it with jQuery
courses now these are some courses that
I'm currently developing so when you go
to killing it with jQuery com you can
sign up to be informed about updates as
I go along little snacks of value and
bonuses that I'll be setting to
everybody as I gear it further release
later this year and if you're watching
this now later after the course has
already been released we'll go to
killing it with j.crew calm and
are killing it with jQuery right link is
definitely in the description below
thank you so much for watching
oh my goodness sign up I'll see you next
video
and keep on hacking okay okay okay
killing it killing it with jQuery
killing it with jQuery killing it with
jQuery killing it with jQuery killing it
with J clearly no how do you even say
this how do you say killing it with
jQuery without sounding stupid killing
it with jQuery killing it with jQuery
killing it okay jQuery
oh that was a mess geez alright a nitro
gun killing it with jQuery killing it
with jQuery yo killing it with jQuery
jump y'all just - killing it with jQuery
up killing it killing it killing it with
jQuery killing it with jQuery that's
that's the winner that's the winner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
