Travis and this is dev tips of course I
don't have a tutorial video for you
today because it's been a long week I
spend a lot of time in Southern
California at a conference is an Adobe
MAX conference and it was a great
experience I got to meet a lot of people
that I admire for a long time kind of my
personal heroes and talked to them for a
while and on Saturday which was actually
yesterday I um I gave a talk to the
design students at Berkeley University
and I was so nervous I didn't know what
to share with them and so while I was at
the conference I took this camera around
and I was I just asked people what they
would tell themselves five years ago ten
years ago when there were students
entering into the professional workforce
and so that's why we share with you
right now while I go work on the next
tutorial I'm going to share with you the
advice that people have given me to
share with the Berkeley students and I
think that you will like it so without
further ado here's my experience at
Adobe MAX
ah
there isn't this year and keep focusing
on the weird side projects for the weird
like ideas you have for things fist
those tend to start by folding into
other projects if you really really want
to follow all your gut weird embrace the
beard
Robert generate the third I'm an
illustrator educator self-proclaimed
vector art monster
so device wise because I know y'all
scared right now look scared right now
need to be scared right you need to be
number one learn as much as you possibly
can to be prepared to move with the wind
and three apply whatever you learned or
whatever you're currently and finally
things are connected together
just like we are now you know school the
creative projects in general is when in
doubt keep created because you never
know what the next video what the next
picture you take what the next project
you do is going to be your big
breakthrough so whenever you're doubting
yourself any facet of life just keep
creating keep making that video you
don't want to cuz you never know if that
next thing is going to be your rectum
it's just yeah my name is Mike Roberto
I'm an illustrator and cider and Shopify
and my piece of advice is don't be
intimidated by how big the design
community seems it's actually pretty
small everyone's kind of friends as ever
I'm pretty quickly and you'll probably
be friends with that pretty quickly dude
my name is Jay Lewis I'm the creative
director and founder of Nike Fox
my biggest advice for creatives try to
get in the industry is to continue to
document everything you need to document
all your work you do so that people that
are looking to hire you can actually
find your work and say well how you know
I'm Mary James Gravlin 43 years old a
graphic designer
oh you youngsters little animals enjoy
your lives enjoy your youth and don't be
too eager to go out with that big job
learn to love what's up a studio we get
the lighting it's rolling it's rolling

situation where I'm like hey guys and I
have like you around me I want that
lighting be good you know it is thank
