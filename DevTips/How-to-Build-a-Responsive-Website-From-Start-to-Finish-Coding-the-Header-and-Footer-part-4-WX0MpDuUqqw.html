Travis Nelson we'd be building stuff
today this is the fourth video in a
series called how to create a responsive
professional website from start to
finish if this is the first time you've
ever seen a deputy's video click here
for the playlist of this whole series up
to this point you may want to start at
the beginning but I don't care you'll be
you sassy before we start I want to
point out that if you go to the github
page the dev tips github page here at
github comm slash dev tips you'll find a
new repo called hardest theme you can
download this project at any stage in
our progression and check out the code
for yourself and follow along
also the Photoshop document is included
in the repo so you just have that for
free you can also fork the repo in and
fix any of the dumb mistakes I made so
if you catch something that I didn't do
or haven't done in my project role
mapper or just make make it more awesome
that I'm currently making it I'll
mention your name here and I'll feature
your fourth now I'll talk about why it's
awesome here on the show so please by
all means take a look at the github repo
a link is in the description of the
video you can also subscribe on github
by watching it here and you'll get the
updated code a few days earlier than the
videos actually come out so that's cool
alright let's start this session by
looking at our Trello board and we can
see that all of the sections are in the
design call now let's start from the top
and we're going to work our way down
we're going to be moving them into the
development column as we work on them
the first card here is the asset
collection I have a little starter file
that I use for all of my project and it
includes bourbon and jquery's we already
have those now for the font i went to
google fonts and got open sans and I
included the light normal and bold
weights of open sans indoor project so
that's the general assets now I need to
start with the header and we can see
that we need a background image we need
to extract from the PSD and also the
logo up at the top here I kind of want
to get into the coding first before I
start extracting those elements so if I
run over to my render web
sigh as it is I just have this
placeholder paragraph that I put in
there just to make sure my font showing
up and that everything's rendering like
it should my CSS is working and
everything like that so the first thing
that I want to do is create a section
called header create a space so I can
put in my HTML for the header and in
Jekyll if I create a folder called
underscore includes
I can then include specific files and
then inject them into the HTML at a
later point and I want to call this one
header dot HTML and I'll set a header
bro whoo and then I want to take my
index and notice that I have these three
lines at the top those three lines are
requisite for my main for my main root
level template so this tells Jekyll that
this is going to be rendered and so I'm
going to include this that header that
you saw me create and it wouldn't work
if I didn't have those three lines of
top that's kind of important it's it's
also why I have it in this in the sass
files so if I do mustache bracket
percent why % and then I write include
header dot HTML - you know and say if I
can refresh my project over here and see
header row ok so that HTML file here is
getting pulled into my index file right
here and so my main project will just be
a series of include scripts and that way
I can kind of make my project more
modular and easy to find certain things
and change certain things as necessary
ok now I also want to create a space in
my assets folder for a new section
called header also create a new file and
call it header in fact I'll call it
underscore header any any file that has
a
in front of it in Jekyll does not get
directly imported into your underscore
site directory header dots ass and let
me go into my sections directory and
right at in import header now if I write
a header dot SAS just make sure it's
working body back ground pink and
refresh background is pink okay so I
know that that's working and with that
quick test so I have a development
environment now that supports a place
for markup for my header and also a
place to style my header and that's
really what I want to be focusing on for
this section in the video ok so the
first thing we're going to do is block
out this whole area here and I'm going
to call it a header these that means the
header tags to do that now if you look
back way in the history of Deb tips
there's one of the earlier videos and I
talked about how to mark up a website
and I talked about how you do it kind of
just you're basically describing what
you see and so I'll show you that now
header is a header tag and I see a space
at the top for a logo of the div class
logo and that doesn't need to always be
a div but I'm but I'm just talking right
now I'm describing with my code what I'm
seeing with my eyes and then I'm going
to see it I see a nav and then in that
nav I see a series of links a ref I see
about me
when is at four there's four links here
so about me work clients and contact
cool and then after that I see a big
headline so I'm just call that a h1 and
it says artists me and then after that I
see a little kicker and I'm going to
call that a P with a class of kicker or
a lead paragraph whatever you want to
call it and it's like a subtitle right a
thinker fancy slashes designer a
youtuber now just this is describing
myself right now but this is really I
want this to be really easy to be
editable for anybody who's using the
statement and look at this whole content
block it is is just you know in these 15
lines of code and I'm being liberal with
how I space them out and I'm being
liberal with how I describe what I'm
seeing here okay so um I think that's
good right now for the for the markup
let's get into styling this thing and
I'm going to do that here so header I'm
gonna make it what is this looks like
about 450 height in the background here
too I'm going to make it a little soft
gray alright now just we can see it I
haven't extracted that image yet so we
need to get that background in there so
we can kind of block it out and then
let's just jump into the logo I said it
is a class of logo and I'm like height
and width on this thing is I believe a
hundred
it's 50 actually I'm using a bourbon mix
in and I can say it's a 50px and I'm
called the background so it's a little
darker at 999 and yeah okay and let's
move on a little bit we'll come back to
that in a second and let's say our now
element here we want these these links
in here to be floating left actually
they already are left we wanted to be
block element so I'll call them
display:inline-block so that they can
have so they can have a little bit of
margin on their left side how much
margin looks like about 20 pixels of
margin on the left side that way they
can be separated from each other nicely
and also just styling why is not
structure wise I want them to be font
weight was it 800 or 700 700 Oh text
transform uppercase we can do this with
the sass you can say font weight so size
I say 14 pixels okay let's go in the
color the color looks to be about black
70% so I'm going to use an RGBA here so
color
zero zero zero zero point seven and
we'll check out how that worked out okay
so right now we have open the hover is
turning into this blue so let's let's
nip that in the bud right now we wanna
write and hover
now this little character here is a key
word in SAS that means all of the
selectors that have come before so when
this prints out it'll be header nav
a:hover not just you know randomly hover
so I want the color of the hover to be
RGB a 0 through their own 0.01 or be
solid black
so let's hover over it and yeah it gets
nice black right there okay so this is
the 50 pixels by 50 pixels for our logo
here's our navigation elements separated
by 20 pixels of margin on the left here
is our headline or our we're gonna call
that it's a guy jirobo and call that h1
and that's going to be let's describe
that that's going to be 72 pixels bold
so thought sides 72 pixels and weight
700 and colors maybe white
and text transform we want it to be
uppercase let's take a look at it
oh it's nested inside the h1 let's say
this is inside the nav that's why this
wasn't rendering properly because it's
on the same level isn't as an A so I
want to just be quick to out dent that
and now we that'll be targeted that way
fantastic I want to add a little bit of
letter spacing and I add just a little
bit so one point zero 5 m/s and that
should yeah that's quite nice um all
right now to get this box around the
words I'm going to actually have to go
in and throw another element nested
inside here so I'm going to say it once
a span its non-semantic it's just a
spans just for decoration and so what
we'll do is we'll say the h1 is going to
be fought or sorry text-align:center and
then we're going to create a nested span
color missus span selector here we're
going to say display:inline-block and
want to give it padding of let's say 1m
to start with if you just measure from
there now it's going to be 0.5 M that's
going to do it big and then um border to
be white
it's all solid and about 10 pixels I
think see we got ooh look at that so
that that margin or sorry that padding
is a little heavy on the vertical so we
want to say point to em I think that's
catching me from the sides okay so it's
going to be 0.5 at point two and point
five in oh that's quite nice is that
that's nearly exactly how we wanted it I
kind of like it okay and then I have
this line here designer thinker and that
is 14 points which is our default size
right let's make sure this is 14 points
font size 14 yeah okay and that was
called a kicker um
the kicker is also going to be centered
text-align:center on the font weight 700
the size is already good okay so don't
need anything else and then we want to
say that it's going to be text transform
uppercase I like the idea of the letter
spacing that I had here I want to mirror
the size just smaller you know and then
the colors white okay let's see what we
got
that looks good but we have too much of
a margin here let's find out why my h1
has a huge margin around it so the h1
margin bottom I'm going to take that
down down to 10 pixels yeah let's do 20
it's a little off because this line
height should be 1 there we go perfect
so that looks really good for that lock
up right there and then up here for this
logo and for the nav the nav just needs
to be we're going to flow this guy load
right and we'll give him some margin on
the top and bottom so it I came down
like 30 pixels and 40 pixels is it on a
grid or something okay yeah let's just
let's keep it squared off one is this 10
thirty let's just say thirty so they'll
say margin 30 from the top 30 from the
right zero from the bottom ends or from
the left left okay that is where we want
to except for this guy here and he needs
our logo needs to be float float float
floor float right and his margins need
to be a top and I say 10 pixels a right
zero bottom zero left 30 see how we're
doing there
Oh float left ha ha ha ha tell me more
okay so now what's happening is because
I floated these elements my artist theme
h1 element has a hanger margin top of 20
or 30 or something like that is intense
actually but it's kind of just like
jumping up to the top it's being pushed
and into the left here and into the
right here and so it's offset and
everything what we really need to do is
clear this navigation we could do a
clear fix right they're not fixed
everything that's a lazy man's way the
proper way is to say is you're here
clear Bowl instead of doing the clear
fix hack just do it that how it should
be both clear Bowl and it should jump
down where it should be great great
great great great and now I have to
figure out the padding top of the h1
because remember it's the span that's
Kim Estes white border so the h1 will be
right here because this that margin is
still jump it up through this bloke so
let's say actually let's measure from
here
it wants to be met a hundred and ten
hundred so let's say padding top 100
pixels boop fantastic oh that's nice
look at that header oh look at the way
it scales down oh it's so beautiful
that's great
okay so we have this all block down what
we need to do now is get the asset of
the background and the logo now this is
going to be interesting for the logo we
notice that it is it's a vector shape
and I want to keep it that way so I'm
going to print out my direct selection
tool we'll just copy that
open illustrator I make you illustrate
our small so we can fit in this window
over here alright and I want to create a
new document in Illustrator and I I'm
going to make it that's for web 50
pixels right and paste
oof that was bad copy paste okay so this
is asking me if I wanted to be a
compound shape or a compound path I
don't really care this wise is a really
simple shape beautiful and what I want
to do is command shift s to save it as
an SVG in our color logo SVG I'll save
it right down to the desktop not
directly indoor project and yes confirm
and what this is doing a illustrator say
is SVG's but SPG's remember they are
vectors and put vector
or code so if I look at this in my in my
quick look obviously it's a big huge
image with nice clean lines here but
what I want to do is is actually drag
this SVG down to my code editor and look
what happens it opens up an SVG like
document right this is interesting so
what I can do I can jump over to my
includes and create a folder called
icons and a new document called logo dot
HTML Emily where did it go okay and I'm
going to copy this SVG code I there and
paste it right in one thing I want to
get rid of is this view box thing it
kind of screws me up uh and then that's
it okay so what this is done is now I
have an HTML page with a with a SVG
shape inside of it and then I can
include it into my header right here
just like we did before with a dull
matte mustache a double percent or some
percent there we go and then we want to
call it I con slash know unless I
include icons slash logo dot HTML hold
on to your butts I'm not sure if this
will work and then refresh oh look at
that our logo appeared right inside of
our box
now the logo is blue I guess I should've
saved it as black but you know that
doesn't matter because the logo is like
that color is defined right here zero
zero zero and refresh it's black so now
this is cool because look at that this
is actually a property if I take this
off entirely I already know what color
will be like they believe default to
black all right so we can go into our
CSS for the header and say
background don't talk about it and then
for the SVG again we go look at the logo
HTML there's an SVG GG path and path is
the one we want to apply the color to so
we would say path and then Phil is that
is the property and we can say I want to
be RGB a and I want it to be you know
70% so black is zero zero zero zero
point seven let's take a look at the
magic oh wow okay so and now when we
zoom in look at how crisp and clear that
logo is going to be for us forever and
ever and ever and we can control the the
color of it and we can even like stroke
in that stroke it but you know apply a
stroke to it and stuff really really
cool really classy we're going to use
that a lot later as well this technique
but I like that because it's not using
another again those HTTP requests if we
look at our compiled markup it's it's
right in there it's right in there so
I'm not calling the server for like a
icon font or anything or or a or an
external SVG or an image asset it's like
right in the markup so like it's super
fast not waiting on any requests from
the server super cool okay uh what we
need the background image okay oh this
is a lot lighter what is this
forty percent okay stylish woo okay this
header image is really beautiful a shot
of the coast of California and it is
taken by goodness it's from gratis
ography calm a bells design I don't know
so this guy takes these pictures that
are really good and he's quite talented
and he lets you use the name
just for free and you doesn't require
attribution it's just it's just a really
nice thing let's look for this there
just downloaded again because I want in
full full resolution and say
background:url Nash - imagens hero - VG
dot JPEG I'll see what we get yay okay
it's see how it's tiling there are our
website is a little bit wider than a
thousand picture pixels and that is
super fantastic fine we want to make
sure that it got Center Center ze and I
don't care if it repeats so I'm not
going to say anything but now centering
that image that's fine and I don't want
it to I don't want to see the repeat I
actually want to stretch that image so
I'm gonna say background
- size M say cover cover is like one of
the coolest CSS properties to ever ever
hit background images it was like
awesome when it came out what it does
it'll stretch this image just to cover
the size in proportion so it'll start
cutting off the bottom in the top as
long as the edge hits you know what when
I hit refresh you'll see what I mean see
how it stretched it and then when this
gets wider it'll it'll either show or
hide the information on the bottom or
top and so - it hits that apex right
there like that that aspect ratio is
right about there
that's seeing prims the whole image now
I'm going to cut it from the side I'm
cutting in from the top see it's cool
great doesn't look really wonderful for
responsive design helps you can show
full with images to cover the whole
place I'm just talking to us this is
cool one - great it looks like we got a
really good start on our header the
footer for this design also uses that
image ooh cool ooh yeah
okay um I want to call I'm going to do
the footer actually yeah
so assets sections new file underscore
glitter dot SAS and sections directory
footer there we are now I want to create
a include called Fleur is just like we
did for our header set HTML and now when
I go into my index and include the
footer after the paragraph right before
the end and footer cool
alright so let's describe that footer in
the floater HTML I have a footer and I
have a I'm going to call this a do class
lock up glow CK you be alright and in
that lock up I have a div I have this
actually on the header information
basically have this stuff right and then
I also have another guy right here
called a class actually it's a paragraph
call it coffee copyright and in there I
want to put all content copyright 2014
these guys are going to be to group
together and so they're going to need to
get a div I'll call it content
I tend rap in this dude and then you'll
be nested in one alright that looks good
let's see how that turned out okay
hahaha what alright
oh this this height I was worried about
this height this height is based on the
default size of this logo even though I
its that view poor thing
how do you find will be fine so let me
show you what we're going to do you go
over the footer HTML or sass and say
your footer first thing I do is do that
same on the background of the header ok
that's good and then I have a walk up
here and then inside out logo so class
lock up margin is going to be 50 nose
maybe 30 pixels and so I'm gonna have 30
pixels around these things and then I
want to get these this content floating
to the left of this logo so as logos are
going to need to be taken care of logo
it needs to be size 50 pixels this needs
to be a plus sign so again that's that
bourbon include all river mix in to give
me the size okay cool uh 30 pixels will
just say padding then okay and let's
float this content content wrap load
left of this logo integer float left to
margin - right
is going to be 30 X yes here we go okay
ooh
our footer we're in the clear fix here
and that is included in bourbon clear
fix cool that's looking good
not looking like what we wanted oh is
going to be a bit bigger let's go you
about 50 well what are we saying here 30
was a three from the side 50 from the
top to the bottom
oh that's nice
oh it's going to need a clear fix to
these things are floating up inside
actually let's bring that clear fix down
to the lockup
that's why this size under it wasn't um
wasn't right that'll be good
okay I'll be maybe a little too much but
it's because of this guy content wrap
let's take care of this so I call it
copyright margin:0 text align or text
transform uppercase and the size of
ethically 12 font yeah 12 and of colors
forty forty percent transparent so I was
at a size font size 12 and color is RGB
a Rea there we are zero zero zero zero
point four oh I like it okay cool and
then these colors need to be about the
same as they were before now we have an
interesting a thing that's happening
here this font size 14 bold you know
uppercase hmm happens quite a few in
this design here's another instance of
it 14 bolder bouquets you know all
throughout here there's quite a few
places 14 volt uppercase not just this
these two places so what would be a good
place what would be a good idea to do
would be to abstract that style into a
more reusable pattern and so I go into
my tools here I'm going to create a new
file
called of placeholders dot sass and then
I got to pull that in with my importance
you know what actually I don't maybe
don't want there and what in the base
yeah I want in the base near my bars
after my bars so I get it out of here
now what placeholders are there going to
be a little snippets of code that helped
me to kind of organize and reuse reuse
code similar to mix actually I'm going
to use them in conjunction with mix-ins
to to make to make the code more
efficient in fast instead of rewriting
things out over and over again I'm just
going to collect collect the selectors
actually around the placeholder so let
me show you how that works in the
placeholders I'm going to create a one's
called percent what should I call this
small block title I don't know who is
this the same one fourteen bold fourteen
voltina so there's another one okay I
let's call that small bolt I was called
small bold and then in small bold I want
to come over to let's save yeah um go to
header and where's the yeah pretty much
that placeholders font size 14 wait
seven text transform uppercase small
bulbs or incontinent and now I'm going
to run back
or to all of the places where I put in
this block of text kind of and say mm at
extend small actually percent worse
percent percent small bold I don't use
this this is the first time I've been
using this a lot I've just been reading
about it last week let's see if it makes
a difference looks like we're all right
cool so every time we did that font
weight 700 every case
no I don't want to do the same style to
the navigation at the bottom of the
footer so what is this going to be
called in the now let's look at my
footer markup footer markup says yeah
content wrap nav a class kinda trap okay
also I'll visit all the A's are going to
have that extend small bold look and
there they are and I want to make my
colors a little table just like seven
right 0.7 and then that hover and hover
is going to be color a full color so
rgba 0 0 0 1 okay and I just want to
give these guys a margin was it
display:inline-block margin:0 fixes so
they can have that the 20 or 30 30 now
so they can have that space between the
elements is it 20 or 30 oh that's 35
yeah it's 30 days to keep it 30 they're
a lot lighter in the footer I looks like
we use a lighter tint so oh we are
coming from 70 Oh Alex 70
let's do five okay so 50% opaque and
then we'll take it up to 70 so point
zero seven percent okay okay cool
and now it looks like the footers done
contact clients about me copyright logo
okay so this effect with the logo here
that's actually my bad because it's
actually a you know a layer style in
Photoshop of overlay so we can't really
get it totally looking like that I mean
that looks really really cool but I
don't think that's going to be totally
possible in with code because we can't
do overlay styles totally yet we can
with some filters but they're kind of
unreliable at this point so let's just
do logo remember it's a what is it path
is that right or is our icon yeah its
path okay a path fill is going to be G's
RGB a 0.3 Oh
huh wonder what margins left in here
content crap oh I put aspirin okay um
yeah that's a hard one I was making a
little bit more opaque I'll call get
let's say five yeah that's good
so one last thing I wanted to do before
we wrap up is is take advantage of some
of the templating systems that are built
into Jekyll so for example in the header
I have my headline and my sub line here
my kicker these things would be more
dynamic in fact in my configuration file
my config llamÃ³ here I have a title and
the description actually defined so if I
go into my header and I write a mustache
mustache mustache mustache clothes miss
- site title and then I write down here
site dot description and save
I have to restarted that server because
the configure file is only read once on
the configuration when Jekyll runs now
look there's no changes at all but if I
change now go to configure and change
this to something else like my theme and
then refresh you notice that the
headline has changed down to my theme so
this is going to make it easier when
another person opens up this theme and
they can enter in their email they hit
enter in the description of the site and
move that up a little bit and that way
it's like more you know CMS a more
template e and it's easier to use for
other people there we are that's the end
of the first video I'm pretty happy with
where we're at I pretty sure we're going
to have to refactor a bit but right now
it's looking pretty good if I jump back
into Trello and take a look at our
progress for the head and footer we've
got that background image got the logo
all done and that's great we can
actually move this card header and
footer actually past development into
complete I'm going to put this as a QA
for quality assurance it's not actually
not actually complete until the whole
thing that's complete but once all the
cards are in this column we'll take
another pass and review everything and
make sure it all looks good and operates
the way I want I have a feeling that
these things are going to move back and
forth a little bit as I as I update my
expectations for this project in the
next video we're going to look at the
personality and the About section so
I'll just move that in development right
now and we'll see you guys next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
