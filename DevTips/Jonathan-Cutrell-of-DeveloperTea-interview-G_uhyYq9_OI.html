fantastic episode of dev tips I probably
say that every time but you know what
they just keep getting better and better
and today is no exception I have with me
a fantastic creator content producer
podcaster Jonathan Cottrell say hello
Jonathan hey everybody and thanks for
having me Travis
oh man I'm so glad I'm so grateful that
you stayed up late to to have this
conversation worried where are you at
right now
Chattanooga Tennessee so it's on the far
eastern side of Chattanooga of Tennessee
rather and so it's a eastern time and I
think you're on Pacific time yeah yeah
all the way across the country and so
you stayed up late from me and I really
appreciate your sacrifice everybody
that's watching this John is is is going
out of his way to be awesome for us so
thank you so much
thank you so as Amy oh sorry but thank
you for having me oh no problem in okay
um so as I mentioned before Jonathan is
a podcaster Jonathan's podcast how long
ago did you start at Jonathan the
official release of the first episode
was January 5th so just over two months
wow that's amazing
considering how how much content you put
out so far so the podcast name is
developer tea and the concept is that
you can listen to an entire episode
about is it'll take you about as long as
it takes to brew and consume a nice cup
of warm tea and you'll have Jonathan's
sweet manly voice whispering in your ear
the whole time
am i off on saying that look that's
totally a subjective opinion I'm not
gonna say either way you know it's you
make your own call so I want to jump
right into it when you opened up your
when you started your podcast the first
episode I listened to is the first one
you made and it's on one of the topics
that's just like really like dear to me
and it gets a me it gets me going it's
on the topic of focus yeah I love the
way that you debunk multitasking and the
the thing that you said about how focus
is one of the most important
for a developer to cultivate it would
really kind of struck home with me can
you tell us a little bit about why you
think focused that the skill of focus is
so much more important than you know
mastering your IDE or a new new language
or technology sure so it's kind of along
the lines of it's like a prerequisite
right so you know if you went and got
your 101 like you're I'm sorry you're
computer science degree then computer
science 101 is a prerequisite to
everything else that you're learning you
have to understand you know a while loop
and you have to understand an if clause
and all of these things before you
really can start learning the rest of
computer science before you can dive
into algorithms for instance so I feel
like focus is kind of a fundamental kind
of core skill that you need to have and
you can't really master an IDE
effectively until you can focus first
because it takes focus to be able to
master an ID right it's a walk before
you can run kind of thing sure
interesting
so can you can you expand on the idea
and I really love the way you put this
in your first podcast you talked about
pull over push and how that relates to
focus absolutely so we're in an age now
and and you're probably watching this
while you are doing or trying to do two
or three other things maybe in the
background there may be half of you or
so that are watching this solely doing
this one thing and you have your time
set aside to watch this the show but a
significant number of you are probably
trying to do you know five things at
once throughout your day and if you look
at your phone right now I bet you about
half of you also have a notification
that's waiting on you that some
application probably thinks is necessary
for you to have to go throughout your
day but the reality is it's very
difficult for us to go throughout our
day effectively when we're constantly
being barraged by all the media right so
we're we have email and we have tag
then we have our boss coming up to our
desk and we have this and then the other
you know phone calls whatever on top of
the facts that we're trying to we'll
take the same example master our IDE so
while you're mastering your IDE is that
the time that you need to know that
Netflix has your has the next episode of
a show on it like there's no need for
you to have that push notification sent
to your phone until you really want it
right until you are saying to yourself
you know what it's time for me to watch
my favorite show on Netflix at that
point you pull so rather than allowing
Netflix to push that message to you you
go and get that message and the same is
true not only for superfluous things
like Netflix but also necessary things
like work communication and pretty much
anything else that would otherwise be a
push notification that's a problem for
me because when I first started using
smart phones and you know like when you
install a new app and it says like hey
can we send you push notifications I
used to always be like yeah of course
you can yeah and now like like all of
all of these random old apps just like
push me notifications all the time so
like I'm in like this bucket of like all
these notifications are coming at me
it's kind of crazy because most often
now your brain has become so used to
those notifications that they're
meaningless right so like I know that I
did this with my email recently I can go
through my email and know that I'm just
gonna go ahead and mark like 20 emails
as read without even reading them and
it's like a subscription emails and
stuff you know it's like why do I have
I'm very clearly I'm wasting time doing
that right so in the same way I'm
wasting time looking at my phone and
seeing these notifications that I really
I don't need them right more than
anything they're just cruft totally do
you even turn your email notifications
off I do yeah so I actually only go and
get my email there are very few
notifications that actually stay on on
my phone I keep phone calls and text
messages on by
like for instance when I'm recording a
podcast that stuff would be would
completely destroy my focus to be able
to record a podcast so I turn off all
notifications like and throw my phone
across the room essentially when I'm
recording a podcast because I have to be
totally zoned in and I feel like a lot
of people don't recognize that the same
could be true of their work or even like
side projects if you really actually
completely removed all of the stuff and
really focused you'd be surprised at how
much you can actually get done mmm I put
my phone in - do not disturb mode like
maybe a few weeks ago yeah and I'm like
wow this is nice and I haven't taken it
off even like during prime time like
even like when like my wife is gonna
call me cuz she's on my favorites right
so it'll come through but like it's like
do not disturb mode is like my new
favorite thing yeah you know it's
surprising we think that if we don't
have our if like if we don't have our
phone for instance you know just imagine
10 years ago of what life was like you
know like without without it so I guess
10 years ago you had cell phones but how
did her parents survive without constant
push notifications even if all you had
was the ability to call somebody we
think that things are more urgent than
they are and the reason that we think
that is because we've allowed ourselves
to disseminate information to each other
that is urgent on a minute-to-minute
basis so I'm constantly connected and
most of my friends are constantly
connected we're at are you sure there's
like arm's length breach essentially you
know it's I can I can text my friend and
if he doesn't text me back within 5
minutes I feel like oh there's there's
got to be something wrong what's going
on but in reality what all do we do
within 5 minutes that's so urgent that
we should be nearing back that quickly
it's kind of crazy that brings back so
many memories like we used to like leave
your house not knowing if your friend
was gonna actually meet you at the spot
you know like and you would get there
and like where are you I can't call you
like what's the you know you know it's
funny
about that my wife and I just watched
Aziz Ansari's new live special in
Madison Square Garden and he talks about
exactly this I highly recommend it but
he talks about how like if they didn't
show up in 15 minutes the reason that
they didn't show up is because they're
dead
okay make it because you can't cancel
like you can't cancel at that point
they're just oh you must have died the
only logical explanation yeah exactly so
I want to go back to your podcast for a
second your I think it's your second
episode is about learning yeah and and I
really like the way you you like really
underlined it and kind of like you did
to bold and underline the idea they that
as developers we need to be in a process
of continual learning it's not just like
go and get your degree or go learn this
one thing and then you're good it's like
every day you're learning more can you
talk to me a little bit about the
involvement of measurement in learning
sure so I think I even mentioned it in
in that particular podcast that we do
learning throughout our lives once we've
gone past school in like the opposite
way that we did it when we were in
school so and what I mean by that is
everything in school is done with some
sort of metric behind it so you have a
semester or you have a class time or you
have a grade or you have you know
different markings to kind of tell you
hey this is how you're learning this is
how you're progressing and then when we
get past school we have this tendency to
think that we no longer have to mark
those things off we no longer have to
measure our learning and I think that
while there's some truth behind the idea
that school isn't the most effective
necessarily the most effective way to
learn it certainly is an effective way
to learn and one of the reasons I think
it is is because it has that metric
system it has feedback which often we
don't get accept kind of in a weird like
happenstance way right so an example of
this when you learn on the job the only
feedback a lot of us get when we learn
on the job is either hey you get a raise
right or that project works functionally
it just it actually works
and instead of us actually going back
and intentionally looking at the things
that we've done and the things that
we've learned we kind of unintentionally
get this feedback and then adapt you
know I guess is part of our natural way
of being our natural way of responding
to our situation so in terms of
measurement one thing that you could do
is just literally write down how
productive you felt that day as well as
taking some taking some notes about how
many tasks you were able to complete and
then looking over that data you know
there's a million different ways to
track data right and I write it's kind
of how does writing things like what you
accomplished or how you felt how does
that actually help you to learn I think
it helps you when you go back and
reflect right because actually another
thing I was watching recently I think is
called brain games right it's on Netflix
and they were talking about the
malleability of our memory so we have
the ability to remember things if we are
doing it correctly but when we choose to
look back and reflect that memory can
actually be changed like Biola Arab
physiologically or whatever it's
chemically it's changed and so now that
memory can be shifted and our our
retrospective if you want to call it
that in the agile world is called
retrospective you go back and you look
at the work that you've done and you
very well could be remembering wrong so
right after the fact if you record how
you've done how you feel in that moment
it's it's a little bit more likely that
you won't you know erase that and change
it
whereas with your memory you essentially
can accidentally erase it and change it
interesting now what I think about
measuring something I'm always thinking
about measuring them against what like
against goals right so like is that a
part of your processor already already
or are you more talking about like
journal keeping or it's kind of both so
it kind of comes down to what what are
you trying to accomplish and so I can
say that I want to
I don't know become a jet pilot and if
if I don't become a jet pilot because
that's an unrealistic goal for me at
this point in my life
then I failed but that's not really what
what we're talking about here right so
being able to estimate properly for
instance that's a part of this process
if you don't know how well you can learn
or how well you can perform if you
aren't recording any of these things
then setting goals is just kind of a
blind task anyway right because you have
no idea what you can accomplish so it's
possible to set a goal blindly at first
and then say okay well I made 80 percent
of my goal so that's probably my rate of
completion at this point if you have
that kind of recording then next time
you can say okay it's more realistic for
me to say you know maybe 82 percent
because I'm improving hopefully and
we're gonna shoot for 82 percent of the
amount of things that I did last time
that's really interesting let's jump
next over to the addictions episode I
wanted to talk with you a little bit
about that in in the addictions episode
you challenged your listeners to do not
listen to any podcasts in the next few
days and to take five or ten minutes and
just be still and just listen to
themselves listen to their ideas listen
to the birds chirping what have you what
experience were you trying to provide
for your listeners but what was that
about you know when I think about the
great minds of past generations or this
generation or hopefully in future
generations one thing that I don't see
is them consuming constantly and so it
when you think about you know Einstein
for instance he's not constantly trying
to like level up his game you know
that's not that's not his goal most of
the time what Einstein is doing is East
he's in the lab right he's actually
doing the thing that Einstein did right
so I feel like it's very easy for us to
get caught up in this cycle
and in that in that episode I was I was
talking more about like the the
behavioral addiction but in reality
there's also a deeper addiction there to
us trying to become something that you
know we're trying to construct something
out of all of these things that we are
consuming and so the idea behind the
five to ten minutes of silence is to say
okay I'm going to be in control of what
I do rather than the things around me
controlling me I want to you know
intentionally set this stuff aside and
clear my mind there's plenty of benefits
which I you know I won't go into because
I'm not the expert on this but there's
plenty of benefits to meditation and to
stillness and to living in the moment if
you want to call it that and it's not
even you know it's not likes mystical in
any way a lot of it is is scientifically
you know completely validated validated
and so the idea is to clear your mind
and give yourself some space away from
these things that are barage in you as
we talked earlier we have these
notifications that are coming in and we
have these emails and it's very easy for
us to look at those things and say hey
that's that's exciting I really want to
read that email and the reason why is
because many times those emails contain
awesome stuff right so like you know my
wife and I a lot of the beginning of our
relationship was built on text messages
and so now every time I get a text
message my mind kind of triggers the
same reward cycle that I got when my
wife would text me right so like but it
may not be my wife texting me at all it
might just be my friend saying what's up
dude you know like has no reward at all
no value other than my friend is bored
and so like what why can't I set that
aside and instead focus on things that
definitely have value right because it's
it's like a it's like a you're not sure
if the if the thing is gonna have value
and very few times it will
yeah so you value the stillness the
meditation the moments for your so I do
and I think that it's uncomfortable at
first so if you try it if if the people
who are watching this you know you try
meditation tomorrow you try five minutes
of stillness if you haven't ever done
that I can tell you right now it's gonna
be a little bit uncomfortable because
you're not gonna know what to do with
your hands
and you know like you're gonna be like
well I should probably be reading my
thing right now but but the that's the
point is why are you uncomfortable
without it so releasing your
dependencies on these things so that
when you go to them you could be more
intentional about what you do with them
but that comment about your hands like I
sometimes like when nothing is happening
I just reach in my pocket and look at
like I don't even know what I'm looking
at like I slide to unlock
yah-hey page through a little bit I'm
like there's nothing here
and put it back I feel like the moat
like the worst grossest person in the
world for doing that this is like this
nasty little habit that I've developed
over the past four or five years of
using smartphones it's so funny that you
mentioned that because even since I did
that episode I'm kind of preaching to
myself because I'll open up a onin and
look at the stats for the podcast for
the day or whatever you know and and
that reward system is like the number
goes up in fact you know Jeff Atwood who
created Stack Overflow and a lot he said
that you have to be very careful when
you put a number next to somebody's name
on line because they're gonna want to
make that number go up no matter what
it's for they're going to do something
to try to make that number go up and
he's right like we we enjoy these things
for whatever reason I don't know it's
deeply psychological stuff that I don't
understand it oh yeah
Ismene that shot a dopamine yeah I'm
doing good I'm better now like my number
went up I'm a better person score was
raised
let's go oh my gosh
so is this a regular practice of yours
then the meditation stillness I would
say that it's not as regular as I want
it to be but but intentionally detaching
myself from my phone is definitely a
regular practice and detaching myself
away from my computer a colleague of
mine wrote a medium post about he called
it digital stab authorial adder day they
put their phones down and don't pick him
up till the next day for 24 hours than
me I know quite a few folks in the tech
industry that do this in fact Tim
Ferriss actually does that as well yeah
he says something that Tim Ferriss does
like oh yeah yeah
he takes his phone and puts it like in
the garage right so like yeah the idea
being to separate yourself like not just
at a mental level but also at a physical
level so that you have to put yourself
through something to go back on whatever
it is that you're separating yourself on
right so you have to walk to the garage
and in the time that you're walking to
the garage maybe you'll rethink maybe I
don't need to go get my phone right now
yeah that's a good point it's so the
habit is a lot harder to accomplish
right that dopamine is a lot harder to
get if you're not just reaching your
hand in your pocket and pulling out a
phone you're making the trek all the way
down to the garage right and you have a
detached garage yeah yeah well I do so
that would that would work there you go
put it in another house so I actually
want to ask you about the challenge so
this this was it not just like you're
just not just talking about it you
actually challenged your audience have
you had any response to that anybody
giving you feedback on your challenge
and nobody gave me feedback on the
challenge specifically I I would welcome
it I'd love to hear what people thought
of it I think a lot of this resound with
a lot of people but then like it's easy
to just be like oh yeah I really like
that podcast now what's the next podcast
yeah oh yeah yeah cuz then throw another
play your next episode it's gonna start
immediately exactly this is particularly
I wouldn't mention this because a lot of
these things apply like enlarge not just
to developers but there's a particular
difference for developers that's
important to note and that is they we
don't just use our computers for
recreation a lot of people use them for
recreation and a little bit of work but
we use computers for like 99% of our
work and because of that we have a
pretty like close relationship with them
you know we I spend as much time with my
computer as I do with my wife you know
and so when I when I think about that is
yeah or really any of my friends or
anything else and so when I think about
that relationship I also have a
relationship where I'm able to create
things and do productive things on my
computer so it's easier for me to
justify my constant connection with it
and so for that reason we have to be
hyper aware of how that affects our
health and how it affects our mental
state these are all very very good
points so why don't we reissue that
challenge anew a dev tip audience people
you guys watching this Jonathan gave
this really really really great
challenge to to take some time and you
know after you're done watching this
episode or if you feel really passionate
about the topic you can just turn it off
right now
and and just take some time and reflect
and look inwards
look around you and be aware and we
talked about sorry drop the thing on dev
tips we talked about awareness and we
talked about being able to understand
the world around you in your place in it
and this this goes hand-in-hand this is
a tool that Jonathan is giving us to
help us to become more aware of where we
are what we can do to make it better and
to influence those around us this is
awesome
great great challenge so let's let's
jump a little bit forward as well
Jonathan you have an episode called feel
back versus feedback or maybe it's
feedback versus feel back but
I've never heard the term feel back did
you coin that yeah I did actually
it's so appropriate I'm like when I I
remember I was walking to work when you
when you pitched it I was like feel back
was no no and then and then you
explained it I was like brilliant it's
just brilliant do you want to explain
feedback we're just feel back just like
really shortly yeah so the basic idea is
feedback is something that you can take
and do something with right so let's say
that you built a home a landing page in
HTML and CSS and somebody came to you
and said that that text needs to be
three pixels larger okay that that's
good feedback right because then you can
go and into your you know ID or whatever
and change that text to be three pixels
larger and the feedback has now been
resolved feel back however is is less
actionable and it's it's more emotional
right so it's it's like a flavour of
feedback if you will but it's very
difficult to act on it sometimes because
if somebody might come to you and say oh
well you know that the text feels like
it needs to be a little bit bigger right
and even though that has some actionable
elements to it it's not totally
actionable because you you don't know
how much bigger right and you also don't
know why they feel that way
there's not really a rationale behind
the feeling and so that difficult gap
between how they feel and the code that
you're actually riding three pixels Bart
larger that is the gap that you and
whoever is providing that feedback or a
feel back has to that you have to kind
of merge that gap so I'm a designer I
don't actually developed for a
profession and and you do of course is
this is that does that kind of feel back
something the developers get I'm not I
don't know because I mean that sounds
like design stuff right like that needs
to be bigger make the logo bigger yeah
looks like what what kind of feel back
do you developers get you know will we
often will get
along the lines of it feels a little bit
slow right or something even more
ambiguous
it doesn't feel bright enough it doesn't
feel happy enough to me and so even
though the designer has already finished
their side of things now we're iterating
in the browser or we're iterating you
know on a phone or whatever the the
final media is we get this feedback of
like okay well the design is done but
now it's your turn and it feels it feels
unhappy to me like for instance a
project that I worked on one time was
for a kid's camp and the the feedback
that I was getting was it doesn't feel
like camp to me like what are you
talking about and so we worked through
it and we eventually came up with a
solution but that idea is that I have to
translate it doesn't feel like camp into
actionable code I have to actually write
code to make something that feels like
camp which is very difficult good of
course yeah what's the best way to
respond to feel back in your experience
I think to ask more questions alright so
on that episode I think I mentioned the
one way is to say hey can you show me
something that does feel like camp right
or ask the question how much larger
would make it feel right right or what
kind of just basically get some ideas
that are more concrete so ask for them
as a developer ask for that next step in
the feet in the feedback loop I think a
lot of developers have a tendency to say
oh well that's ridiculous and I'm just
gonna turn it off like I'm not gonna
listen to you because what you're saying
is obviously illogical right I think I
can't do anything with you saying that
you feel a certain way so I'm just going
to you know kind of ignore it until you
give me a new design or whatever instead
I don't think that's developers only man
I think we all can say that yeah like
from social people to managers everybody
think it's something they don't want to
interpret there
and ultimately I mean it's it's your job
like it's it's my responsibility to be
able to work with somebody because
that's the way that they that's the way
their brain works right my brain works
differently and we have to work together
to bridge that gap there's there's a
missing piece there that we have to
understand you know and what the
interface is from their feelings to my
code thank you so much for for sitting
with us for this long may I just have
one more question for you you have an
episode where you talk about your tools
I think it's called what I'm using
lately or what I'm you know what I'm
using lately and but when you open the
episode you start by saying that you
shouldn't get caught up in fussing with
your tools too much or worrying about
them in what what way is it bad to get
you know so excited and talk about your
tools a lot and like compare you know
tooling when is that about so I recently
actually wrote about this as well and
and when I wrote about it I mentioned
the blacksmith right so for a hundreds
of years the blacksmiths tool set
doesn't change hardly at all if you look
at the blacksmiths tool set from like
the 1500s and then the 16 and 1700s
they're almost gonna be identical it's
very difficult to tell you know which
era a blacksmith tool set came from
because they they found tools that
worked and there was no reason to change
those tools now obviously sometimes
there comes along something like the
Industrial Revolution obviously that
changes things significantly to the
point where blacksmiths tooling is
basically like a thing of the past now
but for a very long period of time those
tools did their job and they did them
well so the idea is to be a craftsman
you do have to know your tools very very
well but if you're constantly changing
tools if you're constantly shifting from
one set to the next it's it's difficult
to master any one thing because by the
time you've almost gotten to know one
tool if you're changing to another one
well you have a whole new set of
constructs to learn so there's a massive
gap in knowledge that you're gonna have
to kind of bridge that gap again
isn't there a fear of becoming outdated
you know I would say so there's a fear
of it and and it's a legitimate fear and
I don't think that this is where
development becomes hard right because
you look at github though github is the
source for most projects where they keep
their open source code it's pretty I
think it's the most popular you know
source code repository in the world I
would imagine so so github is running an
old version of rails right now and you
would think that that's almost hypocrisy
right like the the place that holds all
the code is behind there they're not
caught up yet with everyone else and the
truth is they're their platform is
working great for me and it's probably
working great for you and they're
extremely successful using a tool that
is outdated so my challenge to you is
consider whether the reason why you're
cut you're becoming outdated why you
feel outdated or why you're fearing
being outdated is just because other
people are telling you so rather than
you're looking at the toolset and saying
well this doesn't do the thing that I
need it to do if if your tool set can do
the thing that you need it to do that's
ultimately the definition of a tool well
you're putting me out of a job John my
job is to teach people new things no
just kidding um that's really really
insightful I think that we can get
caught up in trying to understand like
the latest thing and have an opinion on
it instead of just getting really good
at the thing that is the most useful to
us in the long term that's interesting
well salut
thank you so much for stopping by or in
this case staying up really late for us
I appreciate it so much and I know
everybody that watches this also does
can you tell us where to find your show
yeah absolutely it's it's on iTunes so
if you search develop
tea it's also if you're on your phone
and you go to the podcasts app it's
gonna be in the top charts in technology
hopefully for a while just say yeah you
know what it's gonna state so it's it
should be there if you if you forget it
just hopefully you can browse and find
it pretty easily but developer t.com is
also a very easy way it has the iTunes
link it has an RSS feed it has a Twitter
account which is also at developer tea
and so those are the best place that's
it man thank you so much for stopping by
is there anything else you want to say
no I think I think this shows great and
I'm really excited to be on it so thank
you thank you very much
all right everybody thank you very much
