got a question this week from Scott mag
look sorry if i butchered your name bro
the scott asks are there any websites
you go to for CSS inspiration great
question thanks for asking it depends on
what you mean by CSS inspiration if you
mean like a gallery type of site or you
can go and see what people are doing
with CSS and be inspired by their
designs there are plenty of places like
that and it's cool to see what they're
doing with these languages that we all
use and how they use it to meet their
needs so there are a few websites that
you can look at you just like Google CSS
gallery and you'll get hundreds of them
but i like the CSS design awards and i
like psyched inspire now i don't really
go to these kind of sites as often as I
possibly could or should probably
because I'm usually does busy making
stuff and that's how I learn most of my
CSS which leads to the other part a
possible answer the question is for csn
spiration where do you go to learn the
actual technical skills so if you want
to go to place where people are talking
about the code itself take a really long
look at everything that Chris koya does
CSS tricks calm is like instrumental for
learning pretty much everything from
basics to intermediate to advanced not
only CSS but like all kinds of things
for front-end web development and Chris
coiour also runs with a few other guys a
site called code pen dial and that's
like a place where people will kind of
make a CSS and HTML and JavaScript
experiments and display them for
everybody to see it's really cool
there's a lot of craziness going on over
there and you can like really be amazed
by what these guys are doing also I
subscribe to a few really good news
letters of CSS weekly web design weekly
and a few others like that oh and do not
forget time panas net / KHOU drops that
is incredible these I don't even know
who it is but this person or people make
some fantastic usable
code snippets and examples on how to
like really make really stylish features
for your web sites in HTML CSS and
JavaScript and they're fantastic and
innovative and just bleeding edge
bleeding edge cool so thanks for the
question I hope that was a good answer
if any of you guys have any other
questions please leave them in the
comments of any of these videos I
definitely respond in line to like I
think most of every comment that I've
gotten so far and if it's interesting
enough and I want to surface it to the
rest of everybody who watches the
channel I'll mention your comment in the
short video like this and try to give a
give a video answer to it thanks for
watching and subscribing and supporting
everything that I'm doing here I really
