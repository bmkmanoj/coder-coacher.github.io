video series I call design and code my
personal website in 12 hours
yeah so YouTube isn't the only thing I
do
last week we built out the notes section
which is a newsletter that I send out
every Thursday this week we're going to
be building the podcast section every
Tuesday I release a podcast episode with
my friend Lois
it's called late nights with trav and
Lois let's get started
okay so what we're doing today is going
to be the last official section I'm so
excited the last official section of the
twelve hours write two sections actually
but here we go
so here's what I've done so far I've
created a the sections
- podcast Jade and that's what I'm
typing in right now in the Jade files
you can see that right there and then
I've also included this into the index
file right here right there section
podcast and that's on line 18
I've created a home but underscore home
- podcasts ass and I've imported into
asset CSS main dot s CSS and that's
going to be it right there so I created
the files and imported them into their
parent directories now we're just going
to start creating so let's look at I'm
gonna get rid of this alright section
podcast yeah alright let's look at what
we have to work with so again we're
going to use flex and flex center and
make the first one because it's gonna be
the full width called - - and inside of
that we're gonna have the the paragraph
which is going to be a home lead and
it's gonna in the text inside of home
lead is dot dot dot and podcasting with
friends
period see what we got podcasting with
friends why is that not centered flex
it's not centered because it should be
flexing - - Center not flex - Center got
the class wrong you got to get the class
right now it's centered okay
instead of doing the mark up like I
usually do I want to get the Styles
right first or at least just start this
now so I'll say section dot podcast and
I just want to get that background:url
was the wrong
image and it's like BG when there's a
podcast I don't know what it is let's
see where is image and it's a podcast -
BG podcast
- BD JPEG and background sighs okay I
want to make that a subsidiary okay back
on image background size cover and
position Center
that is how you get the background on
there so immediately I noticed that my
text is all the wrong color whitened
okay and podcasting with friends let's
look at our design like nearly there
already
okay so I have inside of the column two
stretching across I have two two more
columns but they're not like in the grid
you know they're not like Center columns
like before so I'll use a custom a
custom element or I could just float
everything to know what we're gonna do
let's go back into our markup and inside
of column two we're gonna have a podcast
content and then inside of podcast
content in our first column will have
the podcast thumb and that'll just be
the image this image source equals slash
assets images podcast
- thumb dot jpg I think it's a JPEG it's
a pink and then the next column is going
to be a podcast text
in which we will put all the text so
there's gonna be a few different bits of
data in there there's gonna be the date
there's gonna be the title and there's
gonna be the player so the date is easy
it's gonna be whatever date is gonna be
order title so I'll just use whatever's
there so let's say 20 January 2015 and
now the question might be a chav 'lose
talks Wharram
and so the question might be hey trav
why are you hard coding this and not
pulling it in via like an API or RSS
feed and get the the recent one I could
be that but I think I want to focus on
specific episodes I'm not always you
know the most recent one isn't always my
the best one to show off what the
podcast is about maybe there's a podcast
like if I want somebody to learn about
the podcast for the first time what
episode do I want them to know about for
that experience one episode that really
captures the spirit of the podcast
itself where maybe the most recent
episode is like very specific unto
itself you know and then the player so
for the player we're gonna go over to my
podcast host called simple cast this
full process designer podcast let me
show you the statistics just quickly I
don't know if I have to edit this out
but the most popular podcast we've ever
done is the full process designer so
I'll just grab that one full process
designer and I'll click the share button
and then I get an embeddable little
thing and I want it to be the light
theme right or it's gonna be the dark
theme on top of almost who at consistent
all right so this should give us an
embeddable audio player we will just
plug it in V right there
save see we got
oh I wanted the light theme I guess okay
so how does this stack up with what
we're trying to accomplish well first of
all my image is wrong where's my pod why
don't up with a cast in all these thum
thum thum okay sorry okay here's the
correct image how is that stacking up to
what we want pretty okay how did it get
on the same line as as its Flex let's
see here
this all needs to be inside of column
two that's why it's all over there
mmm inside of column two better okay now
I need to make two columns out of the
podcast content so let's take this class
go here and say flex no not notice they
flex a display flex great and then
what's the name of the image podcast
thumb margin right there's gonna be 20
pixels fantastic this is looking good
already maybe more than 20 what is it
that's 40 it's like 30 yeah 30 nice okay
and then we have date title and player
play looks fine why is this nuts
so inside podcast content these elements
are not stretching let's see oh um
podcast text on podcast text to stretch
stretch out because it's not filling the
container in its in watch so podcast
containers right there pack out content
they have the thumb and then the text
but it's issued stretch on to stretch so
flex just put one there we go that's
good date looks good already I think
that the size of the text is fine and so
probably don't need any adjustments
there title font size I think it's gonna
be 18 maybe bigger
yeah bigger what is it here it's 30
it's a lot bigger
oh yeah that's good in the line height
there should be one point two margin
bottom is 20
ooh I could not have designed something
more perfect that's amazing
okay so uh what's the title of it a full
process designer and what's the
publication date July 21st
beautiful I'm thinking that I want the
the player to always be at the bottom
that's how it is no design right yeah
it just makes for better lines okay so
let's take that what is it podcast text
and turn it into display flex and we're
gonna say Direction content text
Direction flex direction flex die rekt
you'll column and justify content space
between
there you go
yeah like it all right now the next is
pretty simple we just have these two
big beautiful buttons BBB beautiful
buttons we want to put that in a whole
nother flex section so say flex dot now
don't flex dot and then so a flex class
and then also flex Center two dashes and
column - one and this will be a home CTA
and then I'll also save a class website
class web and the text inside is web
site and then there's another column Oh
home CTA need to put the URL of the
website it's actually I know the URL
right now HTTP trav and Louis calm and
iTunes I tubes I don't know the URL I'll
get that later and the second class of
your iTunes now the reason I put the
second class on these things do this is
needs to be in another column on its own
okay
now the reason I put the second class on
them would become apparent in just a
moment
all right the the classes are far are
thusly home
CTA it doesn't even need that just do
our web
color white and background is whatever
this is cool and then what was going on
I tunes background is what that boom
okay and then there just needs to be it
just needs to be some just needs to be
some margin oh it's not not like this
not like this podcast content
yeah podcast content needs the margin
margin bomb 20 holla
hashtag dude hey hey wait wait hey
before we get started I just wanted to
leave a note here at the top of the show
in the course of the show we discuss a
concept called the full process designer
and I was so excited about this idea
during and after our discussion that
later on that night I went cliffhanger
for more you not to go and listen to
that on the website or on travandliz
calm but anyway
this is exciting because that section is
done now we're not gonna stop the hour
here in the next video we're gonna do
this very last section which is doesn't
even doesn't even need its own hour it's
just basically an email in the bottom
there so that's gonna be in the next
video we'll do that in two minutes over

patreon community since it started a

show so
