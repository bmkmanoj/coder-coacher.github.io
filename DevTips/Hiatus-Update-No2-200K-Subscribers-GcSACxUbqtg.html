and support that I've received
throughout this project over the past
few years I haven't a kind of a
challenge at the end of this video and
kind of talk about a few other things
but first I wanted to kind of recognize
and and pause on a few ideas that were
found in the comments of the last video
that I made so if you haven't already
the last video that I made was hiatus
update number one in which I talked
about my relationship with video gaming
and what had been going on recently and
how I found that relationship to be
unfulfilled and what I did to kind of
change it and become more proactive in
the way that I approach the things that
I do with this time that I've gained
since I went on hiatus so there was a
lot of great comments on that video and
most of them were encouraging and
wonderful but one of them really kind of
made me stop in my tracks and look deep
into what I'm doing and cause me to ask
those questions that definitely should
be asked from time to time so a YouTube
user ember cord left this comment on
that last video and I want to read
through it with you and stop and kind of
interject my commentary on this comment
regarding my video about video game
addiction and overcoming it in 1:1 my
attempt to overcome it this is the
comment and record says you have not
understood this fully as someone with an
eating disorder
body dysmorphia and a history of gaming
addiction I can without a doubt say that
addiction is only a symptom
if you develop addicted behavior then
you have a need for the
your addiction is compensating for
something your thought process with
willpower this is again referring to the
comments I made in that video last a few
weeks ago your thought process with the
willpower is not entirely wrong but it's
the wrong time to implement it because
in that mindset your addiction is the
foe that you need you need to defeat it
with power and with strength you're
already setting yourself up for failure
with this because if you fall back into
it this addiction habit
it will mean that according to your own
criteria you were not strong enough and
your willpower was not sufficient even
though that is the reason so M record
here says a few things I think are
really good number one I agree with this
idea that most addictive behavior is is
an attempt to fulfill a need that's
being currently unmet so there's a
videogame sized hole somewhere in Travis
and and I don't know how to fill it and
so I fill it in with video games and you
know Netflix and things like that is the
theory and and and this this warning
here that if I proclaim through sheer
force of will that I can overcome
addiction and others can do to the the
fallacy there is that when not if but
when failure comes I get a moment of
weakness and buy a new Xbox or download
a game on my PC or whatever or my phone
at that moment because I've put so much
focus so much so much as writing on the
idea of willpower and ego
being strong because so much is writing
there the minute that I have a false
step it will all come crashing down and
the thing that will crush is me because
I built that are all all around me being
a strong person this is the warning for
EM record continuing on this might even
work for you because you are essentially
replacing your addiction with another
addiction work the only difference is
that one addiction is prey as to what
the other addiction is frowned upon but
your mental health doesn't care too much
about this if you make yourself addicted
to your craft your ego will be satisfied
because you're doing something and yet
actually you are not okay I'm pause
there um I really respect this idea that
I'm not actually curing my addiction and
and through willpower I'm stopping it I
don't I agree like that's not what's
happening
I am redirecting right redirecting my
compulsive obsessive behavior and I'm
not like the light switch kind of a
seedy kind of person I'm the I'm the
person that when I get triggered when I
get when I tripped on something this is
not the right when I spin out on an idea
or a concept it's all I think about it's
always read about probably watch YouTube
videos about it's all I want to talk to
other people about and and yeah in the
past few months I've been I've been
going from concept to concept and in
discussing those people who are close to
me well know exactly what I'm talking
about there there is some some big
issues to me personally that I've just
been really really circling around for
the past few months and and I think that
you know taking myself away from the
distraction that this type of obsessive
activity of that is complete distraction
like video games
enables me to kind of focus in on things
that I feel are more worth my time and
more worth my obsessive attention
towards the end ember chord says that if
you make yourself addicted to your craft
your ego is satisfied because your codes
doing something you feel productive and
I do not believe that movement equates
effectiveness but I understand what
you're saying and the accusation yet I'm
actually not so I let's continue on
addiction always means compensation if
you force yourself out of an addiction
which is sometimes needed then it will
take on another form the addiction will
take on another form unless you take
that opportunity to find out what you're
trying to compensate for so true only a
fractional amount of humans has the
power to force change by willpower and
that's backed by research the rest of us
have to facilitate it from what I've
seen so far the behavior you are showing
this is speaking to me directly through
my videos and through other things I am
recording may have seen you're
incredibly driven by imposter syndrome
and projecting ideas of the version of
yourself that you linked with a form of
happiness ok I'm going to stop there -
there's so there's a lot there ok
the idea of addiction as compensation
completely agree like I said there was a
video game sighs hole and that's kind of
a tongue-in-cheek way of saying that
like I recognize that I am currently an
incomplete person I don't think that I
have every answer I know that I'm
constantly like I'm constantly searching
and questioning and I spin out on a lot
of different things and and those things
tend to be the things I'm obsessive
about
I don't know that there can be that
piece that just makes me whole and in
fact if it is out there what I don't
know that it would be a good thing to
have who would want to be a complete
person who would we heard the phrase
satisfaction is the death of desire I
want to be driven like I I enjoy trying
and struggling and I enjoy attempt
attempting new things and attempting old
things and trying to become a better and
and failure is a big part of that and I
don't think that a complete person
strives that's a different topic but
here's what I wanted to focus in on then
toward the end the accusation you are
incredibly driven by imposter syndrome
yeah yes and yeah we've talked about
that a lot especially on my podcast
I did a whole episode on imposter
syndrome in fact I spoke to the lady her
name is rose forget her whole name but
she is the psychologist whom in the 70s
coined the term impostor phenomenon
because it's not actually a syndrome but
yeah you know I deal with impostor
syndrome quite a lot and I like I know
that but I there's this other activation
here of projecting ideas of a version of
yourself that you linked with a form of
happiness and I think we all kind of do
that right I mean I so two thoughts here
first thing I really acknowledge that I
don't come on to YouTube and unload my
frequent existential crises on you guys
that's not what you're here for so it's
not even what I'm here for I I do go
through them I do I have I know darkness
very well
but that doesn't mean that I'm
completely dark and in fact I prefer to
bring the part of me that is uplifting
and humorous and light-hearted to the
people that I - you guys - the people
who I care about the second part is that
I don't think that I project anything
other than what I think is real I don't
project how I don't force happiness and
this kind of like I'm Travis kind of
attitude I I would like to think that
this the the Travis that I project onto
this channel is nothing short of
authentic and that doesn't mean it's the
complete picture but the moments the
vignettes of my personality that you do
see I believe are completely honest
let's continue one record says but this
talking about my imposter syndrome and
the projection of happiness but this is
not where contempt comes from bear in
mind that I'm not trying to attack you
or shame you or anything like that in it
and I don't think that you are but I
think that you are doing the same thing
again so your thought process might be
something like this no I am stronger
than this I can overcome this I have
willpower therefore I am a strong person
that can defeat this addiction I am
gonna be the person that overcame
addiction through willpower I will be
the person that will put the amount of
time into the addiction into work I will
love this because I don't have to feel
bad about not working and then clothing
of the core says I don't expect an
answer I don't expect this will change
anything but if you will see this and a
part of yourself might understand it and
react accordingly good luck
I really I really appreciate the time
and thought that you put into this I
know that like you can read you can read
a youtube comment even
long one in like a minute or two but but
the time it takes to craft and to think
this stuff out it doesn't doesn't come
that fast and so I appreciate your your
effort and it makes me feel that you
care and I what that's nice I mean not
not many people have strangers that care
so deeply about them and then I feel
very strongly about that and about the
about the sentiment that I feel conveyed
in this in this comment and many others
too I mean this is not the only comment
that kind of said these types of things
but it is the most comprehensive version
of those comments so I I just want to
end this discussion about addiction by
saying a few things number one I'm not
even sure that the level of
obsessiveness that I experienced is
considered addiction I mean I wasn't you
know turning tricks on the corner to pay
for a video game or or even lying to
anybody you know or hiding anything and
that that's not what qualifies something
as an addictive person I understand that
but it was only disruptive in my life in
as much as it was blocking me from
becoming the person that I enjoy being
and striving to become since I've
stopped and it's been since I made that
video I think four or six weeks since I
made that video and it has taken me that
long because I just like when I made
that video I had sold my xbox like just
a day or two previous I think ok it's
all cloudy now but it has taken me this
long up until this point to to to gear
up again
I feel currently like like I'm there
this is where I want to be this is how I
want to feel I've been doing certain
activities since I've sold my xbox I've
been sketching and painting a lot
more and I've been working on learning
after-effects which is something I've
always been wanting to do but never feel
like I found the time but now that I
have cut out video games I have my time
back and I've also been doing a lot of
music producing beats and and also
playing guitar and just singing and
enjoying myself and the things I love
about these activities is that I'm not
I'm not making something and then
publishing it to the world to to get
that kind of like how M record refer to
it as like you know fulfilling this um
this need for acceptance and praise
we talked recently on my podcast that I
have one of my top like the top love
language that I have this is like
language love languages the way that you
express and would like to feel
appreciation and love from others the
top way that I do that is by words of
affirmation so the people who are close
to me my wife and friends family they
all know that that the way that I
express my love to them is to compliment
and to to share verbal affirmation and
affection and and this is this is you
know when I have like a really nice
comment on YouTube or if somebody sends
me a nice email
I want Lyle it lights me up like there's
a big shot of you know dopamine just
surging right through when I read nice
things about myself but the things that
I've been doing lately I've not been
sharing they're just they've just been
mine and I've been holding them very
close and this has awakened in me such a
thrill of feeling creative artistic even
and that is something that I've not felt
in a very long time and I I I'm just so
excited that it's back like I did
it's been a long winding road this this
hiatus but I feel like I'm going where I
wanted to be going when I needed to take
that is so that's the update I want to
give another channel update and this is
kind of like a kind of a challenge I
mentioned earlier in the video so I am
ready to kind of do an inventory on dev
tips and find out look look deep inside
of myself really and look deep inside of
what has been going on for the past
while and and decide what I want it to
be and I think that I would like to
invite you a dear watcher dear dev tips
tur if you feel like you would like a
part of dev tips if you would like to be
a host of the show even I want to send
you a challenge make a tutorial make a
video that you think would be
appropriate for dev tips that matches
the the tone the voice that the
character the the content type of what
dev tips has grown to be and and send me
a link and it and I'll be you know
critical and I'll be discerning but if
there's like really somebody out there
who can do dev tips I think there's a
real possibility I would handle hand
this channel over you know work
something out so that's the challenge
like I I'm ready to move on not away but
to not not not a way not forever but but
to evolve yeah let's say evolve I'm
ready to huh
anyhow thank you so much for watching I
am so I'm so fortunate to be surrounded
with incredible people who care about me
and who write long thought-out comments
like this and I hope I hope that we
continue to have these types of Congress
that will increase my ability to fulfill
my greatest measure of happiness and
that's all I offer you take care keep on
hackings
