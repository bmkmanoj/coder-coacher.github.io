dev tips this is our 4.3 in this series
design and code my personal website in
12 hours in the last video I mentioned
that you should download these files
from github and I was about to create a
repo and upload it myself and I realized
I should be doing this with you guys so
that's what we're gonna do right now so
let's get into it today's video is all
about setting up a repository on github
so the first thing you want to do is go
and start a github comm account right
here I'm in the dev tips account but I
actually want to start this repo in the
Travis Neilson account you can see that
I'm a member of a few organizations work
and dev tips and I have my own personal
stuff so after you have your own github
comm account we're gonna go to Mac
github.com
to get the macintosh app there's also
windows github.com but i'm on a mac so
we're gonna do this just click this big
blue button here and download github for
mac it's gonna take you through a few
setup steps they're really simple and
easy just like logging in with your
account that you previously made but we
have that done here now in the sidebar
is a list of all the repositories that
you have connected with your local
machine and the the server on github.com
but i don't have one so what we want to
do is start one right now with our
newest code that we just got finished
setting up so i'm gonna click this plus
button and there's three options i can
create a new repository locally i can
clone one from from the internet and
that's fun to do and then finally i can
add one this is to find some files that
we've already exist locally and get them
ready to be pushed up to github.com so
that's what i want to choose right now
because i've already started on my code
so I'm gonna go to choose and find the
code that we've just been working on on
desktop designing code that's my folder
oh I just you know I actually I just
realized something something kind of
important so there's this idea with
getta they just take everything that's
in that folder and just push it up
online and that includes stuff that you
probably don't want on in your your code
repository things that are used in a
system to create folders and like
invisible files and stuff like that so
right before I start pushing all this
stuff into my repo I want to show you
something let me show you what I mean I
want to grab my project file and drag it
down to my text editor and when I look
in the sidebar here I can see invisible
files that are not normally viewable in
a regular finder things like da store
the esta story is a file that the
operating system will use to kind of
keep track of your folder structure it's
important for the operating system but
it's not important for my project so I
want to use a special file called dot
get ignore and it's right here now in
this file are just is basically a list
of things that I want get to ignore when
it pushes my project up to up to the
cloud on github.com and it's been
started right now but I want to fill it
out and a great way to do that is go to
get ignored I oh and this is great you
can just like write OS X we're using
Jekyll we're using Jade no matches there
SAS and you click generate and it will
it will generate a text file that's just
you can just copy and paste that into
your get ignore file and it will add all
the things that you don't want stored in
your github repo for example hmm
here's that da store file these
different things that for the OS X and
just stuff you don't really want so SAS
cache and SAS map so these are all
really good to have I'm gonna save that
and exit out here and now I'm gonna go
back into my github application and add
my project to the repository list here
on the left so I'm going to choose the
folder from the desktop and open it
create and add repository is the blue
button here and what this does is it
creates a local repository on my machine
it's not up on github comm yet and I can
go through and take
look here's my hello file here are my
other files
here's that goat file that we worked
pretty hard on and I see all these it's
the all these lines are green and all
these pluses that means these are all
new lines they have been added this
application will keep track of all the
changes we make line by line and now
that we see that this is what we want we
want to check all of these files here
make sure they're all selected and for
our summary we're gonna create a commit
right now so in the summary box on the
right initial commit and commit to
master master is the branch that we're
going to be using right now and branches
are mmm something we'll have to pay
attention for for this project but it's
something we definitely will learn about
later when we do a git series so now
that I have the commitment made and it's
right here it's logged here as a commit
I want to send this commit up into the
cloud I want to send it to github and
I'm gonna do that with this publish
button right here so what we're gonna do
now is create this repository up on the
cloud we have a name for it and a
description description is gonna say the
new version of my personal website and
the account I as I showed you before I
have a few different organizations that
I belong to on github but this is going
to be under my personal account Travis
Nielsen and gonna push that repository
straight up so while that's being
uploaded now let's go to github.com and
check out my account I should have a new
repository created called design and
code and it's just as easy as that so if
you wanted to check out the code you
have a few options the first thing you
can do is go to the repo at github.com /
Travis Nielsen / design - code and go
over here to the sidebar on the right
and click download zip and you just get
the whole repository in its most current
form downloaded to your downloads folder
an alternate way to do that is to clone
the repo to your desktop using the
button right here and what this will do
is it will actually
open the application that we just
downloaded and set up everything you
just start downloading it to the place
that you choose in that application
another way you could do this is to fork
the repo yourself and what that will do
is this will create on github.com under
your own account of a copy of this
repository and then from there you can
clone it or download it and change it
and those changes will be saved to your
own account and not mine and that's a
really great way if you want to create a
version of this on your own and keep
track of it there and one other feature
that github has because it tracks all
your changes you can actually go into
this commit tab right here and we only
have one commit so far but you can
choose any commit that you want as they
appear here in and choose that as a
starting place for your download alright
I hope that was helpful just a really
quick video to get you guys all on track
with me on github my name is Travis this
is dev tips keep on hacking this is the
end of the video this is the part where
I talk about my patrons these are the
wonderful generous people who make this
video possible as patrons they enjoy
special perks like the dev tips patreon
podcast or getting videos early or extra
bonus videos things like that if you are
interested in being a patron check out
patreon calm down
here's something that somebody recently
said about their membership in the dev
tips patreon community sounds fun huh
take a look check it out and take care
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
