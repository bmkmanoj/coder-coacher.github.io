you're watching deaf tips the video that
we're going to be watching today is is
about switching tools without switching
from sketch to XD it's going to be like
kind of like a guide and in a series is
called getting started with Adobe XD
shout out to our friends over at Adobe
for sponsoring this series ah so before
we get too far along I want to talk
about really who I'm intending this
video for this is for people who are you
know exploring their tools want to try
XD out but they're not sure where to
start this is for people who are used to
working in sketch and they have a
certain way of things and they're
worried like I don't want I don't want
to disrupt my workflow but I'm very
curious about what it what Adobe has
cooking over there I want to try
something new so I'm going to try to
show you how the concepts that you're
used to in sketch translate into XD what
are the similarities and differences and
how they kind of line up conceptually so
this is not a comparison video or even
an argument for XD although in the
course of this discussion you know I'll
be making comparisons but just borscht
for like context you know and
understanding I think sketch is a good
app I have I have a friend who uses
sketch this is a guide for people who
are interested in how XD and sketch
relate to each other conceptually so
first let's talk about the similarities
between the two if I think back to when
I first started using sketch and when
that came out and what kind of what did
I like about it really it came down to
to a few things um I had been mu I had
moved from using Photoshop and
illustrator and so especially versus
Photoshop the the big difference there
was that we're now using vector-based
drawing tools right and what that gives
you is is resolution independence
meaning that I could design at 1x and
export it to X or 3x or I could zoom in
really close in and move things pixel by
pixel and still have that not those nice
crisp lines that are just so fun to work
with that was really really fresh to me
really exciting to me because um
had never experienced something like
that to that point not only could I
export it at any size that I want I
could export artboards themselves or
even elements single elements within the
artboards so I'm really excited to see
how those concepts have made their way
into XD that were still resolution
independent that we're still exporting
it at any you know scale that you like
and that and that you can export not
only artboards but single elements and
groups you just need to select a group
and hit command e and then you're
exporting that group it's really simple
another big thing for me when i switch
to sketch was to see how fast it was and
i'm not just talking about launching the
app and i'm not just talking about
opening a document i'm talking about
that the app was kind of i felt like it
was designed for me as a designer to
work faster and by that I mean that
there was an emphasis placed on the
inspector using real numbers to
manipulate the position or dimensions of
things and I felt that not only did my
work get faster but it was more precise
and I had a little bit more control over
the elements on the page in addition to
that I felt like I was being encouraged
by the app to iterate quicker and what I
mean by that is that I would just drag
an artboard over duplicate it and then
make a quick iteration and then have a
two-up of the idea and explore and make
a third and fourth and fifth and not
lose any of the pace that I was that I
was designing with and all of those
features the resolution independence the
exporting the speed they're still alive
and well inside XD and in a lot of ways
improved right iterated upon from what
XD learned from the success and kind of
shortcomings of sketch now before we get
into really the meat of this discussion
I want to kind of acknowledge that even
though this is a video intended to help
people switch from sketch and to explore
XD I will fully admit that sketch is a
feature rich and in a lot of ways more
mature product so one thing to keep in
mind is that XD may seem more
bare-bones
a good example of that is that you know
for the longest time XD had no layers
there was no layers panel and something
that is you know a really heavy part of
sketches UI now XD XD has layers now and
actually prefer to work without it's
collapsible but there may be things that
you come across now and then as you
explore XD that are not there really
that you might be used to in sketch
maybe they are represented completely
differently or maybe they just don't
exist like for example symbols and we
can get into that in another way but
they're just like treated completely
different XD so now we talked about
similarities and I think those
similarities are really really core to
the whole experience of creating in
these types of applications I want to
talk about you know the difference is
that you may see and we'll talk about
these differences in terms of like
killer features right and I mentioned
earlier that one of the killer features
of sketch and also XD is speed and I
still think that it's like the most
important thing about these type of
applications like how fast can you
create how fast can you design well so I
mentioned that speed is something that
they have in common and yes they are
both faster than Photoshop and
illustrator but XD is even faster than
Sketch let me show you what I mean by
that I'm going to open up this document
this is the iOS 10 sticker sheet from
Facebook and you can see that as i zoom
in and pan and move around sketch sketch
chokes a little bit and it will wait to
fill in the blocks after it has a moment
to process where XD is just smoother and
it just feels a lot quicker and snappier
and those I don't even know like like
empirically I can't say that that
snappiness makes you a better designer
or a faster designer but it makes it
makes you feel more comfortable it makes
me feel like this is a little bit more
of a solid piece of software if you know
what I mean and speed is so important in
this particular tool I need a tool that
can move literally as fast as I can
think I've had moments where you know
I've designed things
collaborators while you know while
screen sharing over video chat while
like while they described their vision
and their ideas and I've been creating
while they've been discussing things and
then I'll interrupt in like hey what do
you guys think of these four options and
and to be able to do that it makes you
like a design hero in a lot of ways
that's it's really like the pinnacle of
being like the cool designer is to like
whip something up while people are
actually discussing the idea so let's
talk about this key feature in XD called
the repeat grid this was like the thing
that when XD launched it made me really
excited and turned a lot of heads and
like what is that how does it work it's
very smart you can literally create an
element and drag out duplications of it
quickly determine the spacing between
them and edit elements inside each of
the duplications independently you can
edit the text and and imagery
independently of each iteration and
Schedule II has nothing like this they
have this plug-in from envision which is
called craft and it has a duplicate or
built inside of it but the power of the
repeat grid in XD is that it updates
live so even after you duplicate you can
move things around and if you make a
font bigger it gets bigger and all of
them if you change the color it changes
everywhere and that is powerful because
you can iterate over a whole list of
things or a whole grid of things in a
way that would take a lot of different
adjustments in in sketch and sometimes
just a quick tip I use it as a really
fast cropping tool let's talk about
symbols symbols is something that sketch
and xD both have and in a lot of the
ways the symbols in sketch are more
mature for example you can have symbol
overrides and nested symbols and things
like that there is a there is a simple
page kind of idea so where if you double
click into a symbol on sketch it takes
you to another view like a like an
isolation mode where you have to edit it
and then click out of that mode and and
then make sure that it's
what you wanted to it to look like that
the color is right or the placing is
right income in in in the context of
your composition so in XD it's nice
because that is all kind of like
simplified in that symbols are done in
line when you make an edit on a symbol
right there it just goes kind of
everywhere that instances of the symbols
are they're all edited and kind of like
reflect those changes together and you
don't have to go into an isolation mode
another way to like think about symbols
is to consider that repeat grid like
this is a type of symbol really that
you're moving that you're repeating this
element and editing them individually so
symbols will get more robust I've been
talking to the XD guys and they're
they're pretty excited about what's
going to happen in the future but as it
stands right now at the recording of
this video the the symbol power of
sketch is a little bit more advanced
then this is what I'm talking about
those things when you're switching over
to to make sure that you understand that
like we are talking about an evolving
piece of software that's iterating
quickly in fact since it's been released
that's had a new update every single
month and one thing that we want to talk
about and it's important part of XD is
is prototyping now this can be achieved
through sketch but it's achieved through
a series of plugins and third-party X
but XD has live updating of your
prototype even even mirrored to your
phone and what's more is that when
you're creating this prototype and
interacting with it you can you can
press record and create little movies of
you interacting with your prototype and
send those on to people you can share
these prototypes to people and that's a
big part of XD is that you share
straight from the application and you
send somebody a link that you create
within it and after they get that share
link they can click through they can
experience the prototype and they can
actually make comments and give you
feedback right inside of the prototype
experience where that's not possible at
all with sketch you to achieve something
like that you would have to use envision
which is a third-party app or something
like it so that's really cool that
they're trying they're trying a lot
to to bring the whole the whole cycle
right now we're introducing feedback and
so we're bringing like this iteration
cycle all into one into an app
experience and that's pretty cool that
they're going this way and the last
thing we have to talk about it and this
is where you might notice a big Delta
between sketch and XD is is the the
ecosystem of plugins right so sketch is
pretty extensible there's a lot of
there's a lot of plugins there's a big
supporting development community around
Sketch
and when you go to XT you'll notice that
currently there's nothing like that and
you depending on how you view the
plugins and sketch
maybe you there's that you know that
plug-in that you cannot live without and
that will make it very hard to switch or
maybe you just don't like the pain of
updating the app and having all of your
plugins break but currently there are no
there are no extensions there are no
plugins in XD however I'm talking to the
developers at Adobe and they say that is
something that's on the roadmap and
they're very excited about it and one of
the things that I like about the way
that they're developing XD is that
they're taking their time with certain
things they don't want to just recreate
which is what's been done before but
they want to do it in a very thoughtful
way and you can see that in the way that
they execute it on layers you can I'm
not going to go through it but take a
deeper look there they did it
differently and I think they did it
really well but so I'm so expecting
something similar when plugins actually
come about me I've never been I've never
been a big fan of plugins so it's not
really a killer you know a killer issue
for me but it might be for you and
that's something to consider when you're
considering switching alright my friends
I hope that this video has given you an
idea of what to expect if you're to toy
with the idea of switching from your
current tool sketch to Adobe XD and the
thing you have to keep in mind is like
you don't have to switch your whole a
you know workflow you can still do
projects and sketch you can still do
projects in XD just just open it up and
look around in fact
if you really want to understand what
the what the deltas are what the
differences are where the similarities
are between your current tool and nxd
the best way to do that is just download
it and open it up and start messing with
it and the nice thing about XD being a
public kind of iterative product that
Adobe's like you know rapidly iterating
on is that you become versed in the
product as it is and you know as it
updates it's just kind of incremental
and so you learn everything as it
updates that's kind of like what I
recommend for people who want to learn
code learn it and then keep along with
it as it goes up that's that's how I
kept track of you know that's how I did
Photoshop for 10 years right I just
learned it at Photoshop version 6 and
then by the time was version like 30 or
something like it was just normal for me
I understood almost every aspect of that
application so this is nothing what I
plan on doing follow XD as it updates
and gets better and better and better I
use it professionally at work I love it
and I hope that you enjoy what you find
as you explore those options too happy
switching we'll see you next video
and keep on hacking again I want to
thank Adobe for sponsoring these series
of videos and I want to thank the
patrons of the channel for always
supporting the work that we do here at
dev tips and I want to thank you
beautiful being such a cool guy viewer
like subscribe and all that junk I'll
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
