want to step through the creative
process with you guys and take you
through the journey of what it's like to
create one of my email notes lately and
so today let's do some hand lettering as
a part of the email newsletter there is
a quote which I want to kind of convert
into a graphic that's shareable I make
these shareable graphics inside of each
of the notes so if people are inspired
by the things that I'm writing they can
push them along to their friends and
people that are in their social network
so the quote tip from today is find what
you love and let it kill you this is a
quote that's probably incorrectly
attributed to the poet Charles Bukowski
so uh what we're going to do is we're
going to try some hand lettering I
bought this this brush pen last week and
there we are it's really fun it's just
it's just an ink pen that has a brush
nib on it it's just like a basically
imagine it's an India ink brush paint
brush inside of a pen
I've been messing around this with this
brush for the past week or so and it's
made its way already into a few of the
things that I published for example this
podcast cover image right here I tweeted
out this graphic here which is just a
fun exercise and we're going to do
something similar to that right now so
the first part in our journey of this
creative exercise is to make a plan so
we're just gonna we're going to put the
brush pen aside right now and we're
going to start with this this is a
pencil just a regular clicky clicky
pencil nothing special about it and
we're going to explore a few layout
ideas and they probably see me do
something similar in both the design and
code my personal website series and how
to build a responsive website from start
to finish in both of those series I
start out with sketching and sketching
like no matter what you're doing even if
you like you're just even if you're
creating music a sketch is just a low
fidelity prototype it's just a rendering
of an idea and that will help you and
guide you through the struggle of
creating the high fidelity things later
on and that the the goal of the sketch
is to create a few explorations quickly
so that you can find a good idea fast so
with that in mind I'm going to switch
over to my hands and we're going to
start sketching a few compositions of
the phrase find what you love and let it
kill you so here's my paper and I'm just
going to I'm just going to divide it
into just six quick section sections
alright pretty easy so each of these six
squadrons roughly represents you know a
sheet of paper or the workspace that I'm
going to have for my final illustration
and I can I can just make quick six
quick you know ideas here for the
composition so the phrase is find what
you love and let it kill you so let me
just start up here and write out the
phrase find what you love and let it
kill you
okay now I've written out the phrase not
because this is going to be a part of my
conversation composition is kind of
outside but it's the reference for the
material and when I'm looking at this
phrase I can see that there's a few
important you know suddenly there's
there's a hierarchy of ideas here write
some words are more important than
others in here so I'm just going to
underline the important words love is
going to be an important word and kill
you kill it's going to be the two most
important words here love and kill
because these are contrasting ideas and
the contrasting ideas are so important
in this in this turn of the phrase
there's a few other ideas here let's say
you and you are some repetitive ideas
and there's another idea of here is
finding finding something which is like
an active effort on your part and and
letting something which is a passive
effort on your part for it you know to
have a desired outcome so so this is
this is a really great phrase there's
there's so much depth into the way that
this phrase is constructed there's so
many patterns and just just I don't know
I just really love this idea here
finding letting you and you two mirrored
images but in each one they have a
different outcome because one of them is
what you love and the other one is
letting that thing kill you so the
mirror is flipped right there because
well just as I said earlier the the
thing that you're doing is is active
here and the thing that you are doing
here is passive but you're dying here
and you're loving here so I I just can't
say enough how much this fray is just so
beautiful all right so as we've said the
most important keywords here our love
and kill those are the two big ideas
here and then there's a few other
supporting a supporting supporting words
here or two so uh
find and we can also say that the mirror
happens right a right around here so
going to put in a little divide here
between love and and so there's the
mirroring element right there so love is
a huge keyword and kill is a huge queues
keyword and I can actually marry the
idea of kill you together because kill
you is is kind of a phrase even tho
'kill is the big idea kill you is a big
is kind of a good chunk right there so
let's just get working on our
composition after we kind of dissect it
what are the strong points of this
phrase we can kind of get into how do we
build out that phrase into into a good
composition so uh well the obvious thing
is just to say the string of find what
you and then a big l.o.v.e and let it
big ki ll y.o.u right that's probably
the most obvious route right now and you
know the most why oh why oh why are you
the most obvious route is not the is not
bad it's not a bad thing to go the
obvious route but the wonderful thing
about sketching is it's forcing us to
get that idea out of the way and say
okay obviously this is what we want to
be like this is the obvious thing that
would be the first thing that come to
your mind but we now we have to force
our mind to go in six different
directions and that's why sketching is
so great okay so here's another idea we
have this this this first first section
here is fine what you love and then the
mirror happens here this break let it
kill you so let's kind of focus more on
this break this time let's say a big
capital F and then I and II see and also
pay attention that right now I'm not
focusing on my
a penmanship does actually I don't have
great penmanship what I'm doing is
focusing on the construction and
relationship of these words find what
you love and I'm gonna do like a Big E
so that big f and the Big E form to kind
of book ends to this kind of graphic
that we're going to make find what you
love and then I'll do a little basically
just recreating this next block here and
let it kill you so the find and the love
here are making a book ends of the idea
and then kill you is like the kind of
the center of the of the idea I like
that less but that's a good it's good
that we're discovering these things now
I just got to say in this is the middle
of the video I should have said this at
the top you know i'm not i'm not a
letterer that's never been a thing that
i've done before i only bought this
brush pin like a week ago and just been
really excited about it made like I've
gone through a few ink capsules and
that's kind of the only experience I
have but but the experience and the
knowledge of these design principles of
you know doing rough prototypes and
sketching they all you know they all
come into place here all right find and
let let's take let's take this next
opportunity to explore the ideas of
finding and letting so why don't we do a
big f again find find what you love
find what you big big find then this
would be like a little bit more fluid
like calligraphy style find what you
love big love and then and let it a big
K kill you mmm not really happy with
that either this is like a little bit
more like more not thought out it would
you'd see this kind of like every every
word is emphasized out too much of a fan
here let's see how can we say find and
let find what you love what if i had
this is weird here's a weird idea but
like what if i had a big love and then
and then I had kind of like a scratched
out kind of like area and then in the
area was a negative find what you I
don't think this would work with just my
just my tools right here because I don't
have a white brush pen I don't have any
so I'd have to like do something like
compositing and photoshop but this is
interesting so like like like a fine
like a love with scratched out and says
find what you and then I big kill you
and then the same kind of treatment here
below and it says and let it that's an
arrow
I can't really show you this really that
well in the graphic it would be more
like this it would be more like this
I'll show you right down here okay so
just find what you and then that's like
in a imagine this is knock out its
blackest of black scratch graphic and in
white lettering and then it says el oh
vee vee e does that make more sense it's
kind of cool but I don't think that's
going to be really doable because with
the brush panel all it does is give you
black and white it doesn't give you this
layering of knockout I mean unless I
drew nigh don't want that okay okay
let's think about the tool that I have
and it lends itself really well to
calligraphy so what if it's more a more
of a wide block as well so let's say
find what you love and then look at like
some type of some type of graphic
divided maybe it's a heart
and a rule and let it kill you that's
interesting you know what's interesting
is that these two these two key terms of
love and kill you are easily represented
by graphics so you have this heart which
is obviously love but we also have
another graphic here which would be like
a little skull right so I wonder if I
wonder if there's a way to work in work
in these two graphics here maybe we just
put them on the top and bottom okay so
let's take this composition I say I mean
to be honest I still love the obvious
one right it's got a big love got a big
kill you got a little string on top
little string on top it's pretty good so
what if we take that graphic and put it
on top it's a heart and it says find
what you love
and then it and let it kill you and then
there's a little skull anything about
that find what you love and let it kill
you I think that's pretty good I mean
it's just the same thing as this one
except for adding some graphics on it
but as I said like sometimes the obvious
one here is not the worst one what that
did okay even if we look over our
process here starting here going down
like this you can see it not only are we
getting new ideas and looking at new
angles we're crossing things off our
list right this idea wasn't a bad idea
but the execution is pretty poor and
it's not very developed maybe there's
still something there but I'm not going
to follow it now this one here was more
of like I wanted it to feel like a you
know like it something you'd write on a
chalkboard or see kind of something I
don't know like a little bit more
free-flowing didn't really work out this
one is really good idea but the problem
is the tools that I'm using it's not
really good fit for the medium and then
we started it along this idea of using
the graphics and bringing that idea of
the graphics back into our original
layout idea I think it works the best
let's do it let's do something like that
all right so now that we have our
thumbnail like our composition of what
we want to try to do we're going to
spend some time working with just some
some brushing and see what we can kind
of generate in terms of well basically
we're going to do a lot of brushing now
this is the thing that you may not
realize when you see somebody's finished
work is that they don't well there's a
lot of crap that goes into good work so
what I want to do right now is kind of
show you my crap
okay so this is crazy and ridiculous and
not looking good at all and that's fine
you can see that the margins here that
we've kind of like tried to keep our
like way out so this one is way out here
we've got another one right here another
one right here and then another one
right here like I really need to work on
the pacing of these letter forms to get
them all to line up well that was a lot
harder than I thought it would be and
I'm not a fan of the like that kind of
Sarah the Moxie rift like handwriting up
here the all caps writing so let's give
it another try let's just start again
right here on the edge so right now I'm
just practicing the K because I don't
really have a good construction for that
that single letter yet it has a lot of
sharp edges compared to the l which is a
lot of flowing characters so it's gotta
be done right
you
hello
uh-huh where are you okay see in a
minute so I've had a hard time with the
K the K has not been feeling right to me
but I stumbled across this one right
here and it's interesting because this K
is very very quick brush a quick brush
strokes and it informs the rest of the
letter set really well I want to
experiment with that a little bit more
so I'm going to start seeing this is
interesting so I could use it I could do
like a calligraphy and let it right
above it and then and have loved be the
same the same brushes type is this one
pull in another piece of paper here and
use that as the inspiration for the next
few bits I mean let me just practice
kill and love you or no kill you and
love a little bit more like that okay I
think I don't think this is perfect but
I think it has a lot of a lot of good
things going for it some things that are
wrong with it are that this love is
obviously the heaviest thing kill you
has a lot more characters than then for
has three extra characters a whole
nother word
so I need to make it taller even still
but this is really good start I'm really
happy with this idea and that was just a
quite a mess up but um alright let's
just move over here and start again
I think we're getting close though I
think we're getting close let's try
again alright this is it this is the
money do it find what you love and let
it kill you all right is this perfect
it's not is it so late in the morning
that I'm gonna use it anyway it is
alright so we've got the lettering piece
that we're going to do next I'm going to
photograph it and then probably take it
into Photoshop and realign some letters
it looks like my skull is like
off-center a little bit and a few things
that could be better but in general I'm
kind of happy with this and it's just
far too late i need to get this
newsletter out ok so we're out of the
garage back in the house I have this
photo still that we took of the
illustration drag it into Photoshop and
see what we can work with here ok the
first thing I noticed about this
photograph is that it is entirely too
dull right that's ok we can sort that
out so let's make a curves adjustment
here and start clipping in the white
right away here's the curves there
and clipping a black and we're just
going to adjust these curves a little
bit more and more and more until just
start beefing up this contrast so where
it's mostly just white on black and not
have any graze in there not too many
looks pretty good okay so now that we
have this curves layer on top of it
we're just kind of boosting up the
contrast this is just a black and white
image so actually let's let's go and put
a black and white filter on it just we
can make sure that it's there's no
colors going to seep through when we're
doing the final stages ok the next thing
I notice about this so I want to
duplicate the background by hitting
control chase just so we can have like a
like the original is there still the
first thing I notice about this is that
the alignment is off right so this
should kind of like a line up together
but it doesn't it's not too bad except
for kill you is kind of way out there
isn't it so let's put a marquee around
kill you and just press command T and
just transform it down a little bit
right right I'm out of there let's drag
out some guides from our ruler so I'm
impressed commander and get a ruler and
then just drag out from the side to get
some guides ok
it's still a little bit much let's
transform it a little bit more oops I
didn't clip the top there didn't include
the top of that you okay transform it
down a little bit more I hope that's not
too bad and screwing up the scale of
things and you know these are just
little hand lettering so we can do
things like that and it's not going to
be perceivable to the you know to the
viewer now let's take this bottom
graphic and move that around right about
there cinch it up
you
I think that looks pretty good all right
let's get rid of these rules and I'm
going to grab some sampling from the
background and just start painting in
the oh that's pretty bad all right it's
not going to be bright white what I'm
going to do is I'm going to select all
of these areas that have actually want
to make a new layer below these things
and paint it just like with some like
obvious color so i could see so i could
see where the problems are now all these
pink layers I should make that even more
apparent dark red now all this dark red
area are the kind of like background
that resulted in me chopping and moving
around things so I want to clear this up
so I'm going to go to the chopped up
layer and grab all of the red
now I'm going to hit command shift ?
command shift ? by the way is the best
shortcut in every app it just opens help
and help is great because it can search
the menus I use this so much I don't
even know where in the menus these a lot
of these commands are so I'm just going
to type in Phil and there it is
brilliant right so content aware fill
what what content aware fill is going to
do it's going to sample what's around it
and use that to fill it in so why am I
not you're just using bright white
because the image is not bright white
itself it's got its got some greatness
to it the clipping or the the curves
that we did didn't knock out in all of
the gray so let's hit ok and this should
cross your fingers there you go did a
pretty good job of filling it in i think
it made a mistake down here with the
skull but that's nothing we can't clean
up let's grab it with a and L this is
the lasso tool and then come over here
to what's this tool called the patch I
don't know the names of these things ok
mmm patch tool ok that's good that's
good enough turn back on our layer
adjustments and that's pretty good I'm
noticing these big haloing around the
around the skull I don't like it so
let's try to try to get rid of that make
a new layer up of it got my paintbrush
are bigger and softer brush this time
grab the sampling that I do want and
kind of like try to fade in like this
there you go now even if even if the
color is not the same it's going to be
knock it down to fifty percent as well
so I'm not brushing completely or
everything even if these colors don't
match completely it going to be a softer
edge on the transition to the colors in
the background which means they're going
to be less noticeable
okay so here we are the finished graphic
of find what you love and let it kill
you first one group it in the macross
command J duplicate and then press
command e to flatten so now it can turn
off all the work we've done we just have
a flat image here now the next thing I
want to do is go find go find some stock
photography I'm going to go to the
stocks I am and then we can just kind of
go down here on splash is always good
and just find some good like weird kind
of like abstract but meaningful idea
remember the theme is finding what you
love and letting it kill you so so the
theme is death and love see if we can't
find anything in here that kind of like
just the hints at the idea who this is
good but not perfect this is interesting
somebody kind of looking out into the
world it's beautiful but also somber
which kind of is death and love it's
pretty good pretty good you know this
tree is a beautiful nature but also like
it's kind of dead wood it's winter it's
pretty interesting but it's black and
white um let's put a I'm gonna open that
in a new do tab so I can just kind of
keep that as a thumbnail I'll give that
as a bookmark scrolling down well that's
interesting let's bookmark that one as
well I know it's interesting because it
doesn't make sense I don't know what it
is okay so let's take that flat image
here that we just made and then kind of
just drop it right on top here now I'm
going to shrink it down and then we're
going to have to multiply it to get rid
of the white and that's pretty
interesting right because the image
itself is is is beautiful right we've
got the the rays of light piercing
through the top of the water which
symbolizes like life and hope
but also the girl here the model is in a
very I don't know how to say this but
like a morose pose right it looks like
she's being bent in a way that is maybe
uncomfortable maybe there's like some
type of piercing that's kind of
happening right here going this way and
making making your body arch out in a
way that's uncomfortable to her it's
very interesting idea so okay now what
we have here is the is the calligraphy
is black and white but it's black
lettering on top of white background so
using multiply knocks out the white
pretty well here let's use screen which
does the reverse it knocks out the black
and lets the white stand still that's
cool but what I want to do is invert the
colors here and just keep that just to
the black okay so now we have white
lettering on top of does that make sense
why I just did ok so what I did is I
inverted the color so I have white
lettering on black background and then
setting the graphic to screen knocks out
the black and let's what's behind it
show through the black so we have white
lettering on top of this image now I
want to go to this image and do a a
gradient map this might not work that
well let's cancel that let's cancel that
I'm gonna create a new layer on top and
then just fill it with anything it's the
default gray that I had already selected
and double-click go down here to fill
and turn that all the way all the way
down and then go to gradient overlay
okay I already had this purple and pink
created but um purple and pink is an
interesting like kind of hipster ish
kind of like summer feel to it I wonder
if we can change this purple to like a
bluish nice blue here
and then then reverse these make the
blue come from the top there we are so
like the the Sun is giving us the blue
yeah like that make that stronger
they're all the way up so the the blend
mode is overlay outpace the all the way
up to 100 and I have if I don't let's
see if I turn that blend mode off you're
just going to see this is the gradient
that's behind it which actually kinda
looks good on its own let's put the
blend mode to overlay so it's going to
punch up what's behind it a little bit
and then let's make a new layer put it
behind the background and make it black
so if I turn these other layers off you
can see it's just a black background now
the reason I did this is so I could
knock out be a pasty of this a little
bit i'm gonna use my number keys eight
is eighty percent 76 and I'm just kind
of I'm going to tab through these and
what I want to do is showcase the
lettering of course right
and me duplicate the color a little bit
so now those colors are really popping
use the opacity on that a little bit
turn those colors down a little bit okay
so I've got two gradients on top of each
other using an overlay blend mode which
is causing that causing those those
colors to just saturate themselves quite
a bit it's on top of a black-and-white
photograph which if I turn all these
other layers off you can see I've
knocked it down to fifty percent opacity
on black all right so this is the
original that's what I've knocked it
down to hang some gradient adding some
gradient adding the text and then
knocking out the black on of the reverse
color text relative habla okay find what
you love and let it kill you that's
interesting we have I think this is good
alright so I'm going to put this all
into a group and then I'll duplicate it
and explore a little bit more here
number one is the whole thing number two
is you can see her shoulder and head
tilted benek and number three is more
focused on like her hips in her hand and
her legs and at the arc of her body if
I'm going to be honest I'm a fan of
number one the most it's just so weird
and I like how you can see the light
coming in and make you being like the
balance of love and death below life
above depth below I think I'm happy here
now I got to save this out and include
into the email newsletter that I'm doing
now and with a button that says click
here and hopefully if I can what time's
it now for through to the morning
hopefully if I can wrangle this whole
video together and send out the
newsletter by the next hour and a half I
don't know if this is going to happen
but you should be a little to click on
the button share the image and then be
able to watch this video early that's
the plan let's see if it can happen but
I'm going to end the video here and
thanks for being up early in the morning
we've been we've been up and at it since
2 a.m. and that is that true no since
1am and this is this is good this is
good i'm really happy that you're here
with me doing this next step is to
import all the assets and start editing
things in Final Cut so i can get this
video ready to go out in a few hours i
think i'm gonna have to cut the video
here because how am I going to edit what
I'm still recording you know I'm saying
you know glam so anyway keep on hacking
and I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I'll see you next week with more
whatever's by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
