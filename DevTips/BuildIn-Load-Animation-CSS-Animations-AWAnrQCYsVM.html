everywhere that you look it's all dev
tips all of it ah this is the last video
in the CSS animation series I know what
you mean right but we've looked at
spinners menus modal's
we've looked at a lot of stuff and today
we're going to talk about how to animate
a page how to build a page do animation
build in something like this you see
that that cool stuff they're doing there
the page builds as it loads and it's
kind of fun right so we're going to be
doing that now everywhere here we are in
code pen again isn't that fantastic that
means you can go right to wherever this
code pen is and see all the code for
yourself there is a link in the
description below but before you go and
running off and diving in the deep end
why don't we just go look at the the
mark-up together right okay so first of
all this is Jade and if you want to see
what Jade looks like when it's written
in HTML you can just go compile view the
compiled HTML here in this will show you
basically we have a like a container I
closed it a container and a bunch of div
items here okay so that's what kind of
this is here we're saying we want 19 of
these objects and there's 19 of these
squares here and they're all different
shapes and sizes and you can see in the
CSS section how we accomplish that these
things are basically the frame here's
the grid and then this is the item these
are the items here and then I went
through and did my old one two three
four and all the way through nineteen
and these are all URLs of some dribble
posts if your see you know like you like
that squid or that dog or something here
and you think oh I want to know where
this lemon came from go over here and
find the one and then you know just do a
search for that or whatever on dribble
and you'll be able to find out who and
where and whatever um so all credit goes
to the perspective creators of this art
I'm just using it as something nicer to
look at then squared great boxes now to
get the different size
is I did like weird little you know
equations with the end child and
randomly not randomly but like I you
know try to make it feel random the
different heights so we have some of
them are 50 pixels some of them are 120
and some of them are 300 pixels tall but
it kind of all works out to make this
nice kind of like looking thing and then
I have an area down here where we're
going to do our work today and where
we're going to start animating these
things and then in this JavaScript
section I am using jQuery masonry to
make the grid all masonry like and
that's kind of like the the run through
of that's kind of the run through of
this you know the code that we have here
so what do we want to do let's start off
in the JavaScript so the whole point of
this episode is to kind of look at like
how can we when someone comes to our
page like build the page or make it
animate in or make it have like a
surprise a wonderful pleasant moment
when they first come to the website so
what I want to do is I want to animate
each one of these objects and you can
think of this as like a portfolio or
something and again all credit goes to
the artists of these individual pieces
because they are beautiful I just didn't
want to look at great boxes we could
have we could have so what we want to do
is want to animate each of these in one
at a time and to animate that in one at
a time we're going to trigger them by
adding a class to each element
individually one at a time got it
so it's gonna be pretty fun we're going
to use some JavaScript to do that adding
that class one at a time and we're gonna
do it with some good old JQ some good
old jQuery a taim item item is the name
of each one of these squares there there
each class item and we're going to use a
good old fashioned jquery function
called each now what what each does is
it says for each item that is in this
jQuery object so there should be 19 of
these items run this function
times okay what function you're saying
this one rear you didn't see this one
there that's the one I wanted to run
nineteen times okay so this function I
can't type and speak come on how do I
get a caps lock in here okay yeah okay
that that function nineteen times and to
catalog the number of the loop that
you're on you're going to put an eye
right here this is going to be short for
iterator it's going to be a variable
okay so what we need to do is we need to
write the thing that we want to happen
nineteen times which is finally again
find those items so dollar quote dot
item and again there's nineteen of them
so we need to narrow them down so I say
EQ so this is jQuery equals which will
narrow down the selection of nineteen
because every time you do this right
here this whole jQuery object is
selecting all 19 of those items and this
one will narrow down that selection to
just one of them which number you want
to use this eye right here because
that's the placeholder for the number of
the iteration that you're on and that
comes from right there okay so if it's
through the fourth loop this number will
be four and we'll say choose the fourth
one with me this is going to be there's
going to be that's like the magic sauce
basically right there what do we want to
do we want to add a class Cass class of
I think I said is visible is visible add
that class now we don't want all these
functions right here to fire at the same
time so we're going to do a set time out
and a set time out is a is a way that we
can tell JavaScript to wait a little bit
before we run the next thing right and
then put in another this function that
will fire automatically and going to cut
that all right so now we're going to
wrap the thing that we wrote which
selects the item and adds the class in
an anonymous function so and also we
have to say how long should we wait
let's say 200 mmm
seconds for starters times I there's
that letter again there's that
placeholder again I that is a that is a
number of what iterator you're on so if
you're on number zero then this is going
to be like don't wait at all because two
hundred times zero is zero and the point
is that every time you're going to go to
the next one and next one it's going to
wait an additional 200 milliseconds
that's the whole point of this iterator
right here and set timeout function 200
that that all looks pretty good so let's
do a hmm okay so you're not seeing
anything happen over here because the is
visible class class may be added to
those things but it doesn't make any
sense
so we need to go over here and say well
so what what happens when a is is
visible and to just show you what I mean
I'm going to put like a quick border
bottom five pixels solid red on the is
visible class now these all see how to
get a border one at a time after this
when this page is starting to refresh
okay
let me hit a thing here and make this
one at a time and they're numbered so
you can see them happening you can
follow like the red border going down
here so this red border is kind of an
example of that these things are getting
the class is visible one at a time every
200 seconds 200 milliseconds the next
one is getting its class now I have an
animation a style already set to this
class and I have the keyword items
waiting 600 milliseconds but each one of
these is having two most excellent so
200 milliseconds with an ease in and
forwards so I'm going to set each item
to a pace adizero
okay and when I add the class is Vittel
is visible let's animate these things in
with some keyframes okay at key for
ramas items with a capital I don't know
why let's say zero percent is going to
be that's not a zero zero percent is
going to be opacity what zero right
and then how do we animate this thing in
whoa whoa whoa okay so that's a quick
way to do a quick fade in but like come
on let's be ridiculous now let's just go
back how can we make this stupid crazy
weird stupid stupid like honestly some
of these things that I do with you guys
I would never like do in a real setting
because they're too gratuitous but it's
just like the whole point of this whole
series is to learn how to do this stuff
go big and go silly so that you can have
some like ideas in your toolbox of what
you could possibly do and I don't
recommend that you do all the things
that we do I think I think we're going
to too crazy in this series like
animation should be like done subtly and
with purpose but it's fun so let's just
do stuff all right why don't we do a
little bit of like transform of course
and go classic scale and we'll start it
at 0.3 like small and they'll have to
zoom up right around right how about a
rotate X 90 degrees so the flip up wow
wow wow
X I didn't expect the X let's do the Y
so it's like this okay but it feels like
I'm kind of like hitting the wall how
about um how about we do mm how about
like 70% and then transform you know if
I look like I'm sweating because I'm
recording this in the middle of the day
I usually record it like in the middle
of the night but I need to go I'm gonna
go on a date with my wife tonight I'm
very excited about that but I need to
get this done first so rotate why let's
say what am I trying to do right now
okay so why don't we make the scale go
1.4 so it's popping up and going back
whoa whoa whoa that's too fast that's
too fast slow let's go back to 600 mmm
it's mmm that feels really weird why are
you taking so long oh because from 0% to
70% on remaining at rotation 9b so let's
take that off oh that's fun it's kind of
like jumping out and landing quite
nicely I wonder if I wonder if 90
percent can be like do another transform
and make it go like oh I like that like
like a bounce there we go like see how
when they hit the the z space that's
supposed to feel like the backboard they
go hmm it kind of bounce let me show you
with it show that again boom so they in
my opinion they fly up and they take too
long how about this going to 60% ah this
is fun I really like this one
alright if this were any other day I'd
stop it right there but you know what
why don't we just like make another one
why don't we change this to items 2 and
make a new keyframe set let's bring
these guys in in a totally different way
items 2 because I have great naming
mm-hmm
items to okay we're going to start with
0 at not $0 0% this is and why don't we
do all right all right how about this
yes I'm do bringing it with a fade of
course that's what I've been doing
that's they're already faded out 10
percent 100 percent come on Oh pasted e1
okay classic opacity fade in good stuff
can't go wrong with a fade in
let's do height at
come on high at 0% right here just start
so now they're like falling in do they
look like they're pausing a little bit
how do i refresh this thing I guess I
have to edit some code here line a code
to make it refresh code been it looks
like they're like coming in and then
scooting down is that right these I
wonder if it's the padding on see how
the two is like floating in the middle
of the air here that's because there's
like some padding around this element
and that's kind of up here up here up
here where are you padding 20 pixels so
let's go down to this transform keyframe
and say padding:0 pixels that feels a
lot more fluid you see us less choppy
with the introduction of each element
and it's cool because you can see the
number also float by how much oh that
again huh isn't that fun all right
that's it for today can you believe it
we finished that is it for the CSS
animations series right and I think
we've learned some pretty valuable
lessons mainly that CSS is pretty cool
I'd like to thank the patrons of this
channel if you think that getting these
videos early having a dev tips chat and
being a part of the community would be
interesting to you visit patreon.com
slash dev tips and learn more about the
community we have around the channel
next week we're going to have a guest
youtube video tutorial from ran who does
the youtube channel called flex and he's
going to be showing us web flow and he's
going to be showing us how he uses this
authoring tool this front-end authoring
tool
to make his websites and we also
discussed the place that these kind of
tools have in the web development
economy now some people might see these
web development authoring tools website
authoring tools and they get scared like
why am i learning Web Design if there's
a tool that can do it too well oh we're
talking about that next week it's
actually a pretty good discussion and
that will happen after he spends a few
minutes to show us how to use this tool
until then be excellent to each other
and keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
