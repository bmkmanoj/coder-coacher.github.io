up with other designers and developers
in the area and it's really fun we get
to hang out enjoy each other's company
well the other night was one of those
nights and I brought my camera along and
was able to ask them a few questions now
I spoke to six talented and creative
people and I asked them all the same
question which is what do you wish
someone told you when you started out as
a young creator so now let me roll that
tape for you and then afterwards I'll
share a few of my own ideas I hope you
enjoy so the best advice I wish I find
I'm actually advice and diskettes which
is just do it do the best you can and
apologize so my name is Michael and when
I first started I wish someone told me
to really focus on the UX gonna first
started all I cared about was making it
look pretty awesome colors awesome
layout to make it look nice but I wish
if I could go back in time I'll tell
myself to really care about the user
experience to the product and how users
really interacted with hi I'm polymerase
cannons
what I wish someone told me when I
started out was to go with my guide it's
very actually reliable and also it's ok
to say no he actually should say no I'm
Jeff I do not so I don't know what
someone who should have told me a CEO
but I know what someone should have told
my first designers that I hired and the
major difference was that Rick had some
senior designers come in from other
companies like we were doing a deal with
UserVoice I'm their designer came in and
he had this swagger of confidence I
don't think he was saying anything much
more magical than our designer who look
we ended up hiring who was Super Junior
was she was straight out of college he
was like six years into its game but he
had this swagger of confidence that it's
like he was kind of mesmerizing you just
believe whatever he said about design he
would speak with authority yeah style
about the way that he presented is it
now is uh it's analogies and his stories
of the users that he had dealt with so
just speak more confidence than you
think you have and you'll come off as an
older more experienced designer
hi my name is Michael I think being
creative means not waiting for
inspiration strike you need to
constantly be making and making and
making and when you're creating things
they're not always going to be amazing
especially not in the first second or
third try and it's gonna take you a
while but eventually the more and more
that you create the more naturally
inclined you'll be to make good things
so being creative is sort of something
that comes just with time and experience
focus on the fundamentals through
designing typography white space don't
get caught up by glitz just focus on the
fundamentals and at the end of the day
that's all people are looking for
something so they can use now I've been
thinking long and hard about this same
question and I have a few messages that
I would give to myself is he a creator
the first one is that you should steal
often and liberally from everything
around you you see we grow up in an
environment where using other people's
work has looked down upon
we call it plagiarism called theft we
demonize it in a lot of different ways
and there are costly punishments we're
not creating original work in your early
life you know in my opinion this is so
fundamentally backwards it's restrictive
on your ability to even understand the
true nature of creation and I'm going to
let you in on a little secret
in the professional world everybody
steals and the people who steal the most
are the most successful and the most
talented Pablo Picasso said great
artists steal
and I know what you're thinking you
think that this may be some like New Age
Silicon Valley Steve Jobs mumbo jumbo
but that's but that's not what I'm
no I am talking about the ability to
accept within yourself that the things
that you are going to produce are
reliant upon the things that have come
before you to borrow from the entire
library of human achievement and to
combine disparate elements in new ways
is the essential catalyst of creation
and this is what I mean by stealing
don't think and I'm talking to myself as
a young creator
do not think that everything that you
make has to be completely original
because it will not be and you will end
up a frustrated old fool who never gave
anything to the world now the second
piece of advice that I would give to
that wee little Travis is to collaborate
more now to collaborate is to steal but
with the added bonus of getting to work
with the person that you're stealing
from when you collaborate with somebody
not only do you get to use their ideas
and their talents and their genius but
you also get to you their audience
everybody in this world has a voice some
of these voices are small and nobody
really listens to them some of these
voices are young and they just haven't
yet been found some of these voices are
big and loud and command the attention
of incredible audiences who are just
waiting for foaming-at-the-mouth to
listen to just about anything that these
people have to say the only thing more
powerful in this world than a voice is
two voices and three and four and a
whole chorus of voices all singing the
same thing that is really the only way
to be heard so when you collaborate with
someone you're not only stealing what
they have to offer in terms of creative
input but you're adding your voices
together
you're building audiences together and
you're making your message more
pronounced refined and grant and this is
probably even more important than being
good at creation in the last piece of
advice that I would share that you
Travis it's just to appreciate
everything we live in the first point in
human history where the tools of
creation are so democratized that
anybody with a few hundred bucks can go
run out and buy a laptop and a few
software packages and begin a career
that was exclusive only a few decades
ago I am so appreciative of the people
who have worked hard to make my creative
life possible mentors bosses people that
have just done their work and inspired
me to work hard as well these people
teach me that I can be control in my
life I'm appreciative of the support
that I get from my family and my friends
and the people that I collaborate with
and the people that I steal from to the
people who watch these videos and take
what I'm saying seriously who can make a
better life for themselves so the people
who give me a voice thank you well
that's it for tonight guys take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
