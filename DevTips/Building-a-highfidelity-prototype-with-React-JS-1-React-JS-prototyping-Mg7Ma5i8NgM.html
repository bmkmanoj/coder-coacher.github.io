series where we build a high fidelity
prototype from start to finish using
react j/s without knowing anything about
create what's the song he makes it's
just uh okay let's go geek - hey how you
doing it's like what sir
that's a song that says dude okay so we
are not Travis I am Matthias uh on the
Internet I'm known as mpj I normally run
a YouTube channel called fun fun
function you can check it out by
clicking there I have been a software
developer for 13 years give or take up
until recently when I started to get
really serious about youtubing I used to
work in Spotify I'm David on the
internet known as data David I'm an
analyst
I'm not primarily a coder I do cold
sort of sequel queries and stuff and I
used to be a web designer so everyday
where is Travis yes where's Travis and
so Travis is on what is hi a hiatus
several videos she's not yeah when we
were hostess before you refer to it as
vacation at Google thing is he he is
kind of feeling guilty that there's no
content on the channel
while he's gone so he asked us to fill
in for him a little bit what we're gonna
do here it's very different from what I
usually do on fun fun function which is
a nice segue into the fact that we are
not building a complete product we are
building a high fidelity prototype
because we think that that could be very
useful to to you as a designer you're
limited by wireframes and balsamic and
envision clickable images want to build
something real so when you show it to a
stakeholder they can actually use it and
understand your entire idea and what you
want to build as a real product
eventually okay so what is the benefits
of doing what we are going to do in this
series - devil's project compared to a
like a balsamic or
in addition prototype what we're
building is actually working you will be
able to authenticate with serve external
services we will use Spotify but you
could use Facebook or your Google
Account or whatever it will be just like
a real app and if your company and your
back-end developers expose their
services in this way like a loss API
which is very common you will be able to
use the actual data that from your users
so when you show your prototype to a
stakeholder they will see their stuff in
your prototype instead of just some mock
data that you created we are going to
try to show you the spirit of doing
things in in real life so it's not gonna
be this paved tutorial path where
everything is successful all the time
and it's probably going to if you are
going to try to follow along it's
probably not going to be our path that
you're following it's gonna probably
gonna be your path we will give you the
option to follow along at your pace
through our commits on github and
looking at our deployments of the actual
app enos different steps the format of
these videos is going to be very they're
gonna be long long yes and the reason
for that is that we want to show you the
whole process of building these things
with mistakes and all like if we find
ourselves staring at a documentation for
20 minutes in silence then we're gonna
edit that out but otherwise we're going
to leave almost all of the stuff in as
we said before we're going to build this
high fidelity prototype from start to
finish without anything installed
anything written anything so we're going
to begin by doing some sketches
like in slowly note and Indiana to need
for the next up and then we're going to
get cyclist and then we're going to be
sure to different basic how to code then
we are going to deploy the same skeleton
to uh internet sneezing Tohoku and after
that was going to create some places a
little to your ideas and for my API
that's kind of a placeholder for and the
thing that's totally when you do it when
you do I build toy's on it'll do you
feed your company you can get your
customer base and after that we're going
to uh this is finite which is going to
be second wife's new for the feel most
familiar if you know CFS and then we're
going to authentic victory logging so
here you can get access to depends on
the actual route pulling actual data
from a foot backyard and finally we
don't trade and more advanced abrogate
companies and which naturally I decided
to do some trying to let me use the API
and get some data on and do some like
basic crunching of the day yeah maybe
might have been total length of your
favorites or something something that
shows you in the next video we'll talk
about why we're using react Jes as a
framework for building this prototype
I'm gonna put it over my head here so
the idea without episode is to
understand why we are using react and so
it's not gonna be a lot of action it's
gonna be out selling react to you why
rap is good for this and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
