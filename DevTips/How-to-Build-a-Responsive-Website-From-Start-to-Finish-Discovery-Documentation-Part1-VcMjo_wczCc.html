Travis today is the first video in a
series in which we take a project took
from the beginning all the way to the
end every step of the way we're going to
be doing things today is the video on
ideation and discovery we're going to be
learning who our product is for and
we're going to be thinking about the
things that we can do to best meet their
needs okay so let's get started before
we can do anything
before we start sketching our ideas or
even thinking about how anything look in
terms of layout and features we want to
answer a few basic important questions
okay I'm gonna use this mind mapping
tool to help me answer these questions
with you guys so the title of this mind
node is questions now the first question
with any project is you have to answer
to this question who is the owner and
then after that it's important to answer
the question of who is the audience if
you can answer these two questions
within ecommons during a great start but
that's not about it not how it ends once
you know who the involved parties are
you have to think about what's important
to them okay what features are important
to me and that's for the owner but also
consider the audience what features are
important to them now these may seem
like basic questions but in order to
answer them we have to exercise our
empathy which is really really important
in web design and development we have to
put ourselves in the shoes of the people
that we're designing for if we don't do
that we're going to design the wrong
thing in the wrong way every time okay
so we have to think about who is the
owner and who is the audience let's just
stash these questions over there and
create a new one this project is going
to be a simple portfolio site
okay and let's answer these questions
who is the owner well the owner is in
this case the artist now that could be a
photographer designer it could be a
developer in all of these cases this is
a person creating art that they're
trying to show if they are an artist now
the main audience of this website not
the only audience but the main audience
and you want to cater to the main
audience is going to be the client or
the potential clients right okay okay so
let's first put ourselves in the shoes
of the artist what does the artist
really need to have on his portfolio
site his or her portfolio site well the
first thing is going to be a showcase of
their work a gallery of some type after
that they're going to definitely need a
contact oh a way for people to reach out
to them this is the purpose of a
portfolio site to show you my work and
then let's do business together it's
very very common for artists because
there's such expressive individuals to
want to inject a lot of their
personality into their portfolio site in
fact they inject a lot of personality
into the very work that they do so it
makes a lot of sense that they would
want to showcase not only that
executables the things that they deliver
but also themselves because when you're
working with somebody to create
something when you're collaborating with
a client it's important that they
understand who you are and how you
approach things and a little bit about
your personality so I want to have a
kind of a section on there that in some
way showcases the personality of the
artist now that can be you know common
use cases or headshots or like an
illustration of your face or something
or a quotes from someone you admire
oftentimes it's end up in it's like a
little blurb like an about me blurb and
then you know oftentimes you do like
some type of like a like a skills like
explaining in no uncertain terms what my
skills are
kind of like a CV or something like that
you know now when you have your own
portfolio site there's a lot of extra
things you can do oftentimes you'll see
people have like a blog attached to it
or they'll have like their Instagram
feed attached to it or something like
that but I think that you want to make
it you know in most cases as streamlined
and focus for your desired outcome as
possible so we're not going to add any
of the extra frills at least at this
point I'm not thinking it's important to
the artist this is somebody who has some
work they want to show it off and they
want to get more work okay okay now
let's exercise a little bit more empathy
and put ourselves in this in the in the
shoes of the client if you're shopping
around for a designer or a photographer
or developer or an artist what are the
things that you're going to be looking
for first okay the first thing if I'm a
client I'm going to look for is the work
do they do good work is this something
that I want to buy secondly I want to
know how to contact them and a
personality will come into it when
you're deciding or so let's move that up
because personality will come into it
when you're deciding if you do want to
contact them and there's also a few
other things you know it's such a big
decision for a client to try to reach
out and make that initial contact and we
can discuss this later but sometimes I
see these websites where you go in the
landing pages a button that says contact
me or like a form field that you can
fill out to send your email address I'm
not sure if those I'd like to see you
know some analytics on it but I'm not
sure that those are very effective I
know for me personally when I go to a
new web site I'm not going to sign up
for their service then instant I'm
hitting their home page I'm gonna look
at their products and look at their
features I'm gonna investigate their
pricing structures you know like is this
going to be a good relationship long
term with this company or person anyhow
that's just a side tension what I think
would be a good idea for clients to be
able to see are
some some proof some social proof or
evidence from your past clients that
working with you was a good idea in a
pleasurable experience for them so this
is often in the form of testimonials and
I think there's another thing and it may
or may not be expressed in the final
design of the site but we still want to
in this stage we want to express our
empathy and we want to explore the ideas
that we have concerning what we want
what we think the client would want to
see so I know from personal experiences
the clients are very interested on
return of their investment in you right
so ROI that could mean they would want
to see your pricing that could mean they
would want to see what types of
deliverables they are going to get now
you'll see this a lot on on
photographers a you know like a wedding
photographer or something on their web
sites they'll have you know different
packages you know for this this level
the the bronze package you just get like
a DVD with your photos on it with this
silver package you get three prints and
whatever in for the gold package you get
a frame and like a movie and like I
don't know whatever but deliverables are
important if you can explain things to
to your potential client and make it
really rock solid in their mind what
they're getting themselves and to their
a lot likely they're a lot more likely
to be able to feel comfortable with
reaching out and in and contacting you
for further discussion now we talked
about work and and sometimes work is
just a few screenshots of the things
that you've done just to get help people
understand a few ideas sometimes if you
want to go deeper you can talk about
case studies now hey studies are really
really useful to somebody who's making
that business decision of should they
hire you or not now when we look over
this list we can see that there are a
lot of items that
our repeated okay now this is not a bad
thing this is actually a really good
thing in the ideal situation the lists
are exactly the same and the end all of
the stakeholders are aligned with what
they're trying to accomplish this is not
always the case in fact it's very rarely
the case but the more alignment the
better right you want the artist to want
the same thing as their client you can
have a better product that way I think
this is good for now what we want to do
mainly in this stage is understand who
are the stakeholders in the project and
what their needs are so if you're the
owner or the artist you want to
understand well as the creator I want to
understand them what their needs are
they want to express themselves a lot
you know if you are the client and put
my feet in their shoes and walk around a
bit I realized that I'm looking for
information that will help me make a
business decision namely should I hire
this artist or not so I have these two
these two personas or these two
stakeholders in this project and I want
to make sure that the product that I end
up with is going to meet the needs of
both of them after I have these ideas I
need to organize myself around the ideas
it's not just it's not enough to have
these things mapped out in your mind we
have to mold these ideas into an
executable form okay and so for that
like nearly every project that I do I
use an application over here and it's a
web application called Trello Trello is
free to use and it is awesome so these
are all like here's here's how I
organize dev tips the channel I have all
these ideas and I move them over into
this you know column to schedule these
ones I'm currently working on these are
ones that I've shot and stuff this one
actually was just published already and
these are the ones that I published in
this quarter so this is this is a way to
track
aggression in the different stages of
the project right so let me return back
here I want to create a new board I'm
going to call this portfolio and the
portfolio so every board in Trello these
are they kind of use these metaphors of
this blue thing is the board these are
lists and I think these things are
called cards right okay so this every
board starts off with in and kind of in
a kind of to do fashion but that's I
want to reorganize the way that this
works so I want to say that these are
going to be out my ideas and they're
going to they're going to be like
features and okay and this will be the
where I start capturing things and then
I want to say that this will be the
design column this will be the
development column and I'll create a new
one to say it's complete okay so let's
start loading in this first list with
our ideas and features referring back to
the the ideas that we generated when we
were using empathy okay so the first
thing we want to capture is the fact
that we want to have a showcase or a
gallery okay and after that we want to
make sure we got that contact and want
to capture my personality and the client
is going to want those testimonials
they're also going to want to see some
return on investment and I'm not exactly
sure how that's going to execute now for
the contact I only go in there and I can
make different I can still explore my
ideas while I meet while I'm organizing
myself so I definitely want to have in
the contact section some social media
contacts so I'm going to make a list
here of the social media things the item
social media items that I think are
important for the artist to have so I'm
gonna start with dribble B hands they're
going to want LinkedIn if this is a
business site if you're a developer
maybe you want some colored pen or
github and Twitter of course and then
not really Facebook most people look at
Facebook it's like a more of a personal
thing okay and then also there's other
ways um you know non social or
non-public I guess I don't know how's
the other and that would be like a
direct email and then a lot of people
prefer web forms which sends email okay
cool so there's a lot of different
options of how somebody would contact
this artist let's take a look at
personality how would this artists
express their personality and how would
the client prefer to understand them
headshots uh having quotes about me
blurb and representing my skills and
kind of like a CV fashion alright looks
good testimonials this is good you can
write like little descriptions in here
like a note and it uses markdown so on
note I think there should be three and
then you got this long note here so
anyway Trello is really awesome and as I
develop these things and design them I
can just mark them off and take them
into the next category by moving one of
these cards over into the next list
and in you know sometimes I can be
spread quite a bit over it depending on
depending on what I'm working on so
we're going to be using Trello quite
extensively in this project to track our
progress and to make sure that we stay
within the the bounds or the rails or
you know we don't kind of go out of
scope with our with our work and our
features ok that's it for this video and
you'll notice that all we really did was
think right if you are expecting us to
do some designing or coding and you're
kind of let down and you're sad by that
that's good that's good because I want
you to really understand that a large
part of this job is just thinking and
planning and organizing right the actual
execution is is like maybe like 20% of
the actual job so I'm purposefully not
executing on any deliverables today to
illustrate the point that the most
important work that we do on any project
will be done early on in the planning
stages this is real work this is what
will set you apart from your peers and
your competitors the ability to make a
solid reasonable plan before you jump
blindly into trying to make things is a
sign of maturity you don't need to use
the same tools that I use you don't even
need to think about it in the same way
that I do but you do need to think about
you need to have a plan if you don't
have a plan you don't have a destination
and you can never arrive okay next week
we're going to put this plan into action
and start thinking about how these needs
and features translate themselves into a
UI we're going to do some sketching some
wire framing and some actual visual
design if you enjoyed this video if you
learn something from this video please
like it and share it and all that kind
of you to be stuff and most of all you
know just leave a comment below I I you
know subscribing and sharing is good but
I like to hear from you I really I'm
really interested in what your your
thoughts are what your opinions are what
is your process for organizing yourself
what is your process of discovery I'd
like to know leave a comment down below
thank you so much for watching and I'll
talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
