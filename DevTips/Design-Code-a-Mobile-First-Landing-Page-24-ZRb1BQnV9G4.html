with you but I spent the last two hours
making this video and we're speeding it
up now if that makes sense so I'm
commenting on a real-time I'm washing
the speed up version with you so I guess
let's just start I mean this is
happening so fast oh my gosh okay I
started with the logo sampled the colors
switch the colors the logo is now black
on yellow and like with a slanty
background behind a hero hero image
which is actually going to be a video
and I chose this video for a few reasons
number one it's an interesting video
people are talking about giving advice
to themselves number two it has the
colors that I'm looking for the milk has
the colors that I'm looking for or
yellow and black and okay then we're
just jumping into the About section
which I renamed to what is dev tips so
remember this is going to be at dev tips
show calm and so what is depth tips I
don't know so I kind of renamed him
about Me section if you will - what is
depth herbs and I have a thumbnail of my
face that I use for my newsletters which
I kind of like is like you know put it
up like that kind of show enough of the
beard but but it will you know whatever
works
now I'm messing with these thumbnails so
I'm having a section called popular
episode so I'm trying messing with these
thumbnails and make like a cascading or
a lineup or something like that but
ultimate ultimate Lee but ultimately it
kind of doesn't work and I end up just
doing a list of popular episodes and so
you'll see me switching right back to
youtube I'm just grabbing titles from
and I ordered I'm looking at my videos
ordered by popularity I'm just grabbing
like the most popular titles and I'll
just say okay they'll so just be like
the section will just be a list of links
and now I'm going into the jquery
section this is kind of
one of the reasons why this website
exists so I can have this this place to
talk about the courses but keep in mind
that this is the main website so even
though that I'm talking about the jQuery
course that's not so this page really
exists in case someone goes to the root
I want everybody to go at the moment to
dev tips show calm slash jQuery course
or something whatever it is and this
this whole design is necessary because
what if somebody doesn't do /j caring
for jQuery course so next is the patreon
community a patreon is awesome and
everybody that is a patient getting a
shout out right now because quitting so
fast what else can I do so I grabbed
these icons I use these icons in the
ending of video a lot of the time
remember spacing them out using
different methods to align them I think
you know drawing rectangles is the
rectangle tool you know it is like one
of the most commonly used tool maybe cuz
it's easy just to use it to create to do
measurements or to draw out out-like
guides and alignments like things to a
rectangle anyway so this is the the
strongest gosh we're past the jquery now
i'm passing even patreon this is the
this is the footer okay so just a few
links late nights podcast email notes
and travis nielsen calm so that's kind
of how the the homepage looks when it's
on mobile I did 360 wide and in the
second I did the second version of the
homepage mobile here or not the homepage
mobile I did a second version of the
homepage and it's kind of interesting
that how easy mobile design can
translate into a full web page you just
extend the backgrounds it's like a
shortcut like I didn't really want to
think too hard about making a like a
desktop version of the site I just
changed them I just need to extended the
background palette colors and it kind of
looks like how it looks deck a desktop
fish but this second version that I did
I wanted to like go in and rethink the
way that the header works because that
that video was just too big for me
so let's gone now ok so this is going to
be actually the the landing page so now
we're talking about jQuery the first
thing I did was change the top color to
jQuery colors if you go to jQuery comm
you'll see this exact blue being used in
I wanted to use those blue to hearken
hearken octave the word out to you know
to be reminiscent of what's on jQuery
comm so now I'm just trying to find a
SVG as SVG got messed up so hard of
jQuery is logo but that's okay all I
wanted was the icon which I don't even
know what it is like a bunch of cones or
a weird like Devo hat or something
jQuery it's like concentric circles
anyway writing is a really important
part of design being able to construct a
good sentence is necessary for somebody
who who is supposed to be a good
communicator right design is about
communication I recently took a workshop
slash course from Sean West who I think
is an amazing market here and Sean
talked about creating landing pages
actually I wish I could show this to him
but we had this kind of moment where he
was looking at landing pages of you know
people who were in the workshop that
this one you know of course it was ready
I'm just designing it now anyway Sean
talked a lot about you know really great
breakdowns of how to use writing in your
marketing communication to express ideas
to generate interest to create need
really for your products and so I tried
to follow the tactics as good as I could
remember I didn't take great notes in
the workshop but it was just so fast so
much so fast jump shot has a great a
great amount of
their wages anyway so um Irie Irie align
the the slant of the header with this
one now that the videos not behind it I
realized that this light was too too
drastic so I softened it a little bit
and then transferred it back to the
yellow to make them the same and now
after it's like those bullet points that
you saw up above it with the icons those
are like features of the course and then
here in this section that I'm working on
right now I want to say okay you're
interested in the course but that's an
intermediate slash advanced course go
back to the beginning and get familiar
with jQuery and those things are for
free and those are the three videos that
I'm going to be making in the next three
weeks that I talked about in the
beginning of this video so um here's a
section about dev tips you know like
what it is what would Travis like sit
but it's in the frame I'm framing it as
Travis because Travis is because the
teacher of this course so it's not about
dev tips making videos with the Travis
making videos a little a little bit
different so and on the bottom of this
jQuery landing page we have another form
so there's two forms on this page so as
one at the top in case people it was
ready to go and one of the bottom one
case in case that took them a long time
to be convinced and I want to chance
that they would you know scroll up on
their own and sign up what rule and I
wanna ask them again just go for the ask
that's the important part so this next
part is the Thank You page that we're
working on right now and the Thank You
pages after they've already signed up
they're gonna see this and I'm thinking
what's on a thank-you page well I can
have those videos that are like go check
out those other you know three videos
learn jQuery in 15 minutes and then also
below that I have a really strong call
to action for the patreon community so I
mean the patient community really aligns
well with the jQuery courses because
people who want to learn jQuery are
people who are interested in their you
know in their
professional abilities right and these
are the same people that are patrons of
the channel the community is great for
meeting new people learning new things
and like generating those community
those connections that are just going to
last you your whole career and that's
why I think it's a good match for being
on the banking page thank you for
signing up here's something else that
would be of value to so here is the menu
for the navigation there's the three
lines at the top and I was like okay
well unless three lines at the menu that
slides out can go back to the homepage
go see the videos on YouTube for free go
to the patron and go to the jQuery page
so that's all I think yeah so that's it
that's day one it's 3:15 in the morning
right now and I was able to like work
out the user flows like where the user
is coming from what do they want do some
quick sketches and from those sketches
create high fidelity mock-ups I was also
able to record it all and then go back
and do the voice-over for you so that's
super fun we're on the next day I want
to get like all the coding done so I'll
probably do another speed speed thing
with you okay good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
