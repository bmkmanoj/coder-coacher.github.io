my name is Travis and this is a hiatus
episode I'm just going to talk about
where I've been for the past little
while and what I've been learning and
going through and hopefully you know
give a hint or something about what's
going to be coming up for deaf tips in
the future
ah the last video I made in 2016 was a
video or I gave my my annual report and
I said goodbye and I haven't made a
video at all this year it's been nearly
three months now and if you caught that
last video you may have have seen
something kind of somber that what
you're watching there was was as a
person who was just tired and and kind
of done this is the first time in my
life I've really really experienced
burnout I've been distracted before I've
like left things undone before but I've
never consciously walked away from
something that was working and so I want
to tell you like what that's been like
for anybody who's had like a really
demanding project or a consuming job or
relationship and and they suddenly
stopped interfacing with that thing and
stopped caring about it thinking about
it and working on it and for it all of a
sudden this this incredible vacuum opens
up in your in your ability to I mean
it's in your time right and your ability
to focus in in the amount of compassion
that you have available all of a sudden
is more and and and I've been I've been
learning so much about myself and about
about the world around me in which I've
been operating where
where it I don't know I don't want to go
too deep I recorded this video like four
times in it and before I even get past
the intro with ten minutes but let me
just say that it has been transformative
and hiatus titles will do you something
good I think although I still don't know
how to record a good video anyway let me
I want to talk about a few things and I
want to end I want to end with some
lessons I learned so I talked about that
vacuum a little bit and I I'm not like I
used to how do I say this okay so I'm
not too excited to talk about what
happened when I left or at least one of
the things that happened when I left I I
have a pretty obsessive personality and
when that's focused and directed it is
one of my best attribute but the problem
with that like wild vacuum is that I
didn't prepare for it enough I didn't
anticipate the strength of that that
vacuum and I was sucked in to doing
things that were not replenishing that
were not good for me and let me let me
just kind of like stop beating around
the bush I played a lot of video games
when I was go past two months almost
every day for a few hours and I would
come home from work do do my family time
you know didn't didn't break any
relationships up or anything like that
but like hang out oh the kids put them
to bed kiss them goodnight and then come
down here where I record videos and just
play video games until like 2:00 in the
morning and and it was just such a waste
of time and I would get excited because
you know video games and gaming is built
built on the idea that the
aimes perpetuate themselves playing the
games perpetuates themselves they're
addictive they're intended to be this
way they're designed to be addictive by
people who know what they're doing I
don't want to diminish what that's like
so the story is that I every nearly
every day would come down and play video
games and just kind of get sucked in and
then would look around me and I have a
list of hiatus projects that I want to
do while I'm away from making YouTube
and nothing was getting done you know
and and it was really really in a lot of
ways damaging to my self-identity to my
confidence to the person that that I
want to be the story I want to tell
about myself was being destroyed by it
by this and I had this moment of clarity
and I was at work and I was like I was
like you know I it's not good for me I
need the strength to stop and so I
quickly when that triggered I quickly
jumped on on YouTube and I looked up
video gaming addiction and I I saw a few
people a few people that I already or
watched their other videos you know and
and they're they're talking about their
own experience and how they overcame it
and I said yeah that that's what I want
and here's here's kind of like the
experience that I really wanted to grasp
onto there are moments in your life
where you have a higher like your
willpower is just a little bit higher
and it's those moments where you need to
grasp on and just hold on for dear life
and and make any commitments you can
during that period right and just hold
on to those so what I did it was like
during those like few minutes of real
power that just suddenly sprang on me
and a desire that I had to overcome this
thing that was really dragging me down
for a month I went on Craigslist and
listed my video game system
and my TV and everything I sold it all
in a matter of two days but it was that
moment right that moment where I could
have just been like um I want to do that
but it'll happen later because I want to
get my XP to the next whatever so anyway
yeah I sold the Xbox and the TV every I
mean I had the thing right did reach
everything sold it all in and then two
days later I am taking the boxes on the
projects that I really wanted to do the
hiatus projects that I had done so I
dated Travis Nielson calm but something
that I've been wanting to do for years
and all it took was me to get sucked up
into like some addictive behavior and
then free myself and then the website
happens I've also been updating my
design portfolio a lot lately and I'm
very proud of them very excited about it
and and that's not the immunise these
are things that I've been wanting to do
for a very long time and yeah anyway
that's that's what I've been that's my
hiatus update there's so much more I
want to talk about but the video is
getting long it's already too long and
thank you for watching it up into this
point you're awesome and I think if I do
more I hate this updates it will become
easier to come back officially to
YouTube I'm not back yet and I hope I
hope that when I do it will be it will
be a journey full of balance and an
intentionality and and enjoyment so
alright that's it keep on hacking and if
you if you kind of gotten sidetracked
from the things you want to hack on
start hacking let this be the moment of
your high willpower you know just grab
onto that story I told and say yeah
that's that's the way I want to be right
now so I'll talk to you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
