deficits channel might look cynical look
at this picture
what's up everybody this is Travis and
this is ramp from flux Block on YouTube
now Ren has a vlog and he's a designer
and he gets a lot of questions he's like
you know how do I design this how I code
this and he uses web flow a lot but he
doesn't do a lot of tutorials he said
want to do it to toe for your channel
I'm like I would love for you to make
videos for my channel that would be
great so what we're gonna do right now
Rad's gonna run through his flow on
taking his designs from visuals to
actual working web components using web
flow right all right let's get started
so I found this cool design over at
Tribble and I'm gonna try to develop it
using web flow but without writing any
of the code but I'm gonna have it all
developed with all the code with all the
CSS with all the interactions so start
off um I have a new project here on web
flow which doesn't have anything on it
but as you can see the background is a
body element and over here I can see
what elements I have currently I only
have the body so I'm gonna give it a
background just to kind of have a
similar background to what we have in
this file so this one is gray I'm gonna
take the color here from Photoshop and
I'm gonna create a new style I'm gonna
call it body and the only thing I'm
gonna do here is gonna give it a
background color of this color so now we
have a light bright light gray
background and now I want to position
this element right in the center of the
screen so I'm gonna create a wrapper so
even though I don't have to write code I
still need to understand the logic of
how HTML and CSS works so I'm gonna
create here a wrapper element and
I'll set the body to 100% I'll also set
the wrapper to 100% and 100% and invest
rapper I'm gonna put a div which will be
this kind of window that we have we're
gonna call it a window and let's see in
Photoshop how big it is so I'm gonna
kind of roughly measure it it's around
six hundred thirty wide on four hundred
so I'm going to define it as 630 on four
hundred and because I want to position
it right in the center I'm gonna give
the wrapper here display of flex with
center so now we have the window here
I'm gonna give the window white back
from so you can see it we have this
window here right centered at the screen
now we have also round corner here and a
little bit of shadow so I'm gonna do
that I'm gonna give it let's see three
maybe five five pixels of corner radius
that looks nice
I'm gonna also give it a box shadow I'm
gonna do that black and gonna blur it a
little bit and take the opacity down a
little bit so now about we have this
window and just just to show you off
where we're heading if when I want to
export this I'm gonna have all the HTML
here and all the CSS ready and I didn't
really have to code this I could just
play around and I can just export this
so I can upload it or keep the back end
development whatever I want let's see if
I want to split this into half I can do
that in two ways
but uh let's do that by just putting too
deep inside that window and I also give
this window display setting up flex will
put them both on side to side and let's
see how do I do that
okay I'm gonna give them I'm gonna call
them flex
child both of them flex child perhaps
I'm building this wrong but I'm not a
super developer so I'm not sure about
that huh I'm just gonna give both of
them 50% of white yeah that turned out
to work pretty fine I'm really is
actually really interested okay so this
one I'm gonna this is the background
image so I'm gonna this one I'm gonna
give it another style and let's call
that image and I'm gonna give it a
background image of I'm gonna upload an
image let's see of just a car that I've
found here and for it to look nice I'm
gonna say I'm gonna give it a property
of cover and you're gonna Center it or
you know what it looks better like this
and I want it to be darken a little bit
so I'm gonna give it a color overlay
yeah that looks much better
all right what's a color overlay yes
what is how do they do that yeah like
what does it mean in the code um let's
see I mean image they just gave it uh
how do they do that I don't know we can
ask for the code and check it later
because this is you see this is just a
snippet of the CSS okay we're not seeing
everything but we can do that
for the later looks interesting yeah all
right I'm gonna throw a logo here the
red blue logo over this image I can also
define it as a high DPI that means that
will kind of double down the size for it
to look good on retina but it also it's
it's too big anyway so I can just say
let's see how that looks in 200 yeah
maybe even 117 all right now that looks
good and what other elements do we have
here so we have the logo actually it's
much smaller it's around one 120 the
logo so let me resize that to 120 and
then we have a bottom
right so I'm gonna drop in a button and
for them to be centered the way that I'm
seeing them here I'm just gonna give the
the Flex child image a display setting
of Flex I'm gonna do them this way this
way and this way but BAM and it's done
all right I'm gay I want to I want to
give this logo here a little bit of
margin so I'm gonna give it call it Red
Bull logo I'm gonna give it a margin and
let's see how the button is styled so it
actually says create an account so let's
write that create and count it doesn't
have a background let's call that button
it's kinda have it does have a blurry
effect which I'm not sure can you do
that with CSS or it's just Photoshop you
can do it with CSS but it won't it's not
very number Ewell's okay I'm not gonna
do that I'm gonna give it a background
image of kind of almost white just aren
t white yeah that's a good book and I'm
gonna do like lots of radius so that it
would yeah and I'm gonna give it a
stroke of one white pixel that's that's
how it looks almost let's do the
background black so it will kind of make
them a bit more readable yeah I'm gonna
give it a bit more padding on the right
so yeah that looks nice now the nice
thing about it is that I can already
create the interaction here I can change
this the state of the button to hover
and then create how I want this to look
when it's over so let's say with that
when it's over it's completely white the
background is white and the text gets
black right so I go back here so now I
have this simple really simple hover
interaction but if I want to animate it
which I do that's also super
simple I just go to the transition here
I'm saying it's 350 milliseconds and I'm
not gonna even bother to look for the
property I'm just gonna say all
properties and then I check out this
smooth animation that's nice
alright so that's done
alright why are you laughing Travis
because I went cause like how long we've
been doing this like two or three
minutes yeah this one they're taking me
like 30 minutes that's what I'm saying
that's what I'm saying that's why I do
that oh my gosh alright so let's see how
we do that first of all it's let's do
that let's give this style of form and
kind of do the background the background
kind of has a gradient right so I'm
gonna copy the collar here and let's
give this a gradient background so I can
choose here gradient I'm gonna drop here
the collar let's let's take the darker
color now
all right and I do want it kind of in an
angle that's probably the right angle
like this you know it's good no it looks
good
all right so okay how would we do that
probably I would have to kind of put
this one as an element this one this one
and this one is an element so the first
one I don't really have to yeah let's
see what happens if I just drop a title
like I would say I want this to be an h1
right so I'm gonna drop an h1 here sign
up all right let's call it sign up sign
up let's call this h1
now font we didn't talk about fonts I
have an an okay selection of fonts here
but I can actually bring in any Google
font and I can actually also upload any
font I want so it's pretty nice yeah
all right so what I want to do is give
it a bit more margin on top I'm gonna
have to create the divider on the bottom
so it's not a fully white white pixel I
don't know let's just go with a random
color here of white with not so strong
capacity that looks decent I'm gonna
give it padding and I'm gonna give it a
little bit of padding to the right you
know what I also want to space the
letters a little bit I think that looks
better
all right but let's remember how much
padding we gave like let's do it like 25
so we can be consistent all right so the
next thing that we want to bring in is a
form right so to do that I'm gonna bring
in a form we have here a form element
that I can also define how it
Caves and everything alright let's see
so the first one is email and the second
one is passwords so let's let's move
them around because we have email on top
and this will be the password so but the
one more thing that we want to do is we
want to bring in those images how would
we do that would you would you okay I
have to I guess put those two in an
element right inside a div or something
like that so I would put it put in a big
block which I'll call it like form
element form block and we need two of
them so that's two of them enough to put
the email plate form elements okay I
don't want yeah I want the form block to
be inside the form wrapper so that web
flow will know this is a part of the
form right what I'm looking at right now
is the structure of the page so these
are all the elements that we have in the
page kind of like the HTML structure
this is the Dom yeah this is the Dom I
didn't even know that word exists so
yeah so let's put this text field in the
form block and the text field in the
form block and then where's the other
form block right here and then so I just
nested them inside all right so now I
can say that this form block I need to
edit an image into it the icon right I
can also drop it right here where I need
it inside the structure so here I have
this kind of let's say a person icon
let's make it really small
sixteen maybe maybe 25 25 is okay I
guess how would you do that
let's call it icon should I just float
it left not sure about those things but
I can float them left and I can give it
go back to the photo shop or the so it's
left of both the label and my yeah so
the label input should be in a wrap and
then this should be on the left of it
okay so another deep inside of it right
mm-hmm
I can actually also if I do if I give it
a text field I can hack it even though I
know it's not probably the right way to
build it mm-hmm if I do this see that's
a nasty hack you shouldn't do that if
you want to build proper websites the
hack was this was a block element and so
it went all the way uh-huh
but now I defined it as you know inner
Inlet oh my god I gave it whip so now
when I gave padding here like margins
here mm-hmm
I kind of did it like this all right
that doesn't look too bad
but uh no something here is doesn't work
well because I want to push them I want
to push it okay yeah yeah that's good
that's good so let's see the email
address should be white kind of white
whitish let's call this label label and
say this is uh let's do it uppercase
actually I can do that with a style
style uppercase nice white with some
kind of an opacity no I'm sorry
white call it white and opacity make it
super small
all right that looks cool in here we
need to make this kind of transparent we
don't even want to see the text field so
textbook should have no background color
and text can be white if you type it in
and no I don't want any borders so when
I let's see that boy it works I don't
know why it's great but it does work but
it has inner padding left padding here
which I don't want because I want this
to a line so perhaps the text is is
white when you type it oh yeah I see
yeah so what you're seeing is the
placeholders yeah which I'm not sure if
I can style it can you spell it you can
with CSS let's see if your let's see if
your web flow from do it if my web flow
could do that you know what I would do I
would like Google that I would like the
web form and see what happens when you
do that change form placer let's see
their forms are actually I always find
the answer there might be the answer
that you can you mean web flow doesn't
support this in you ride but you can add
this to the custom code so the great
thing here that you can add custom code
wherever you want either right here to
the page where I have a page setting I
can add it to the page custom code in
the head tag or the body tag so if there
are features which they didn't build yet
and you can just doesn't stop here it
doesn't stop me there's still too far
because maybe this why is this lines is
so far the text field yeah your text
field is just kind of big yeah I guess
but you know what I can do I can do that
that's nasty right you didn't do that
that's like illegal but it's not I mean
you know
it is it's pretty happy but yeah like I
do happy things with code so yeah all
right so the last thing we need to do is
to give that this whole text tax form
block that we call give it a style but I
want this to be the same as this I'm
just gonna copy the line that I did here
and do that okay see if it's too far
away because this guy has a lots of
padding here
Oh No so who else
this guy has padding and margin yeah the
nice thing is that you can visually see
it you know so that's really nice
he'll I don't want to create that again
I'm just gonna copy and paste how did
you do that oh you're leaving the block
okay yeah form block go p8 yeah bye
can't you just like cop can't you just
like apply the same classes to another
element yeah I can't but that would take
a lot of time how would be yeah much
easier to just right here right password
and these and then new elements will
have the same classes anyway that's yeah
how because they just oh yeah I can just
bring in another icon and I think if I'm
not sure but I I think that this for
Melanie yeah I can define it as a
password yeah I see that's nice okay
we're almost there I think I see that
the original design okay so we need a
sign-up button
what there's like space between the
space between them you're right we need
two space between them let's take the
form block let's give it yes I have a
problem
I'm a Damus take the top line she'd
probably be styling out of the signup
form but of the yeah of the form block
so let's remove that let's add that
right here to the top one
knack create a lot of trouble but now it
looks good mm-hmm so I'm wondering
should I copy this style to the bottom
here I called it button let's see what
happens if I do that I give this button
submit let's change this sign up sign up
and no it doesn't look that good but has
a lot of properties I think that it has
a lot of the properties so it'll be just
easier to add another style to it so I'm
just gonna say site signup button
I'm just gonna push it a little bit I'm
gonna change the color here to white
with an opacity of course that looks
okay what else do we have here for gap
password so that's easy that that's just
an a link then I'll put here I'm not
gonna connect it anywhere but this is
where I can link it outside or a
different page at web flow or a
different section of the page then I'm
gonna call it inline my just give it a
little margin make it white don't want
the underlined and of course I can
create you know overstate so what do you
want it to be when it's over huh do you
want to change color
no just really put underline underline
okay thanks man
oh yeah no I got mine in the line no you
got your underline and everything works
oh this doesn't look very good on over
so let's change let's give that a
different color
let's do that black for example okay so
give it a black background and a black
and a white text let's do a yellow text
now that doesn't look just wanted to do
something with the Red Bull trend but
yeah that looks nice
yeah it looks super nice so basically we
finished that and if I wanted to I could
now make it responsive but just changing
here that how that looks I can create
different queries for different you know
devices and that would be super easy I
would just go to mobile
change the styling for it to be awesome
and then that work and what I want to
export it let's just expert it to see
how the code really looks so we can
really see if it's legit and how they
create some stuff so we have here the
yeah so here's the code HTML CSS image
assets and a little bit of JavaScript
which one do you want to check out the
CSS how they created it
yeah so let's look at these documents
here we have dev tips to slash web flow
dot CSS yeah so basically that's a CSS
right there that you wrote so yeah what
what were the other things that came
with it actually what let's look at this
image here's where they did this is
right here background image yeah this is
how they did that over overlay yeah he
did a linear gradient over it is that
legit well yeah because actually
background image yeah so so you might
think that when you're placing that
image you're placing an actual image
element but you're not you're placing a
div with a background image no this is
actually the way I chose to do that I
hope I put that okay put it so you know
that it was a background yeah yeah
that's how I defined it the icons I
didn't do that
in this case I defined it as a
background image oh I didn't I didn't
follow that okay so that's why I was
surprised like how did they make an
image like they just like little bustier
yeah or something
no I defined it as a background minute
that means a lot more sense okay so uh
yeah basically
let's do I just want to show a little
bit of let's do an an interaction or an
animation for this just do to make it
okay let's to explore the possibilities
here so I can for example let's take the
whole window that we have here I can
reduce its opacity for example or I can
just check this out I can create
interactions here I'm going to create a
new one I'm gonna call it window appear
all right an initial appearance okwait
I'm gonna choose this window because I
want it to be applied to it right mm-hmm
so apply this to it and now initial
appearance so I want I'm gonna make an
effect when the page loads it's gonna
appear so initial appearance I'm gonna
make it I'm gonna move it a little bit
so I'm gonna add a transform I'm gonna
move it down a little bit right I'm
gonna scale it let's say 50% on both
alright and I'm gonna reduce the opacity
mm-hmm okay so now I'm gonna he's gonna
ask me what trigger do I want and this
one I want it to be on boat but I create
can create some other interactions
there's a song load I'm gonna say that
what I wanted to happen
I want the opacity back to 100% and I
want to transfer that transform because
we're not gonna do anything
it's gonna say move to origin right so
and I'm gonna define how long this takes
so just to make this interesting let's
make it 1,000 so it will take some time
so that we can watch this let's preview
this
that did not go let's let's see what
okay it did work as planned right it did
not work as planned so I don't know why
sometimes it works in something let's
see what happens if we export this as a
new page it does not work that sucks
that's normal though I mean that's an
that's normal development you know like
this yeah let's do that again let's
let's not do initial did you did you
scale via the after or I don't know
you're calling it there's initial and
there's the other thing right I'm gonna
remove the initial completely but I'm
just gonna define this in the in the
styling I'm gonna say I don't want this
and I don't want any opacity let's just
test this out okay so now this works
right
it just gives up the opacity back so
let's select it and just do the
transform here add this transform let's
do not yeah let's take it down a little
bit and scale it to point seven seven
all right so now let's preview it yeah
it does work so now on page load it does
this small little animation so that's
nice and that was pretty easy right now
and obviously you can do much more
complicated stuff you just want to
demonstrate that we're currently working
using this tool to really create a whole
a whole product with it so obviously you
can't publish the product like this but
it this completely does the the
front-end for us so that we have this
prospero the new tool that were working
on so we can have here the whole tool
the whole interface with the buttons
that we have in icons and all the
interactions that we have we can
planet right here x4 the code and then
my developer can take it and just build
you know the back end the interaction
what happens with the database and
everything but it does really make our
workflow super super fast
all right thanks ran for that like run
through that was a fast run through it's
interesting like as a as a person who
codes a lot and someone who teaches code
on YouTube I'm sure I'm gonna go tons of
comments down below like oh no this is
my job is gone now there's no future for
me but I'm gonna respond the way that I
respond with when some people talk when
designers tell me that they're afraid to
lose their their job is nobody's lose
their job right that's a fear right you
see something like this and you think
how could this that this is gonna take
my job away but I think it's exactly the
opposite with it's the other way around
right we're living in a time where
design and development are just blowing
up and we have more platforms more
opportunities that County is just
growing in somebody's always gonna have
to push the boundaries and do custom
work and do thinking outside the box
that no platform can do so that's a nice
you know quick you know quick way to do
things but you always have to know how
things work and understand them and kind
of know how to do that yourself if you
want to do something custom and just the
other day I was ranting about the fact
that I don't really code deeply that I
can get some beautiful interaction stuff
so I don't think nobody is gonna lose
their job they're always trying new
things pushing themselves
design and development this is the
golden age for us you know in general I
look at it like these things have a
place and usually there are places to
follow innovation so this real designers
I'm seeing a real I mean listening like
good designers good developers are gonna
pave new paths they're gonna invent new
things are gonna innovate
I hope you don't want to learn web
design so that you can do what's already
been done I hope that's not your goal
because if it is then yeah you probably
google it you don't know but but these
things follow you understand I'm saying
they follow innovation they don't
believe it right and that's the
important distinction that Iran is
making here is that if you can
understand that they follow innovation
then you can actually use them - that's
like a jet pack for you so you can get
way out of hand and will push you
forward this stuff is probably actually
what I'm gonna look into this a little
bit more I've never used it before
because I'm so busy thinking of new
tutorials the thing a lot of time to
look at this but this has been like an
interesting kind of you know 30 minutes
for me thank you for doing this and
showing us but that's good I'm happy it
was really helpful for me so I hate I
hope it will be helpful for you and
everybody else yeah so so just a word
about Randa he has a YouTube channel
here on YouTube and it's called flux and
he does daily weekday vlogs and ran as a
designer here in Tel Aviv he talks about
all kinds of things just from what it's
like to live here what it's like to be a
professional designer and also he dives
deep into the ideas that propel creative
people forward so check that out and
we'll see you guys next Monday here on
dev tips notice I keep on Becky
keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
