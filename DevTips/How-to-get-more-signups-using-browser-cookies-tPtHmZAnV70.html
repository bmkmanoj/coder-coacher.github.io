Internet has the same ultimate goal to
get people to take action now that may
take the form of getting someone to sign
up for your newsletter that may mean you
want them to buy something whatever it
is you need to help them to achieve this
goal by giving them a strong
call-to-action ah today I want to
discuss an idea I had now I'm certain
I'm not the first one who ever thought
is but since implementing it on my own
website I've seen really good results
let me show you what I mean sometimes
you go to a website and you get hit in
the face with up with a pop-up a prompt
to sign up or a big advertisement right
away now how effective is that do you
ever click on these if you're anything
like me you tend to hit the close button
and run it so what I've done on my own
site is to let users browse around a bit
get to know me and what I'm about and
then give them the fast pitch so the use
case is this step one they come to my
home page step two they navigate to an
internal page and they see what's going
on in there eventually they're going to
navigate back to the home page for step
three when I introduce a modal to them
that prompts them to sign up for the
newsletter pretty simple right
the hope is now that they have taken
some time and gotten to know my brand
and I've given them value by letting
them read a nice article or something I
can them prompt them to perform the
action the reason that I built the
website in the first place now this is
not the ultimate solution and it's not
going to change your life but it will
give your users a better experience and
enable them to be more willing to engage
with your brand to achieve this feature
I use JavaScript to put a cookie in
their browser at each step of the use
case that I outlined earlier and I
update this cookie continually until
they reach step 3 when they either sign
up or close that modal I then complete
the cookie and they never have to see
that modal again
let me show you how it's done okay I
made this really fake banjo website here
that's trying to you know sell you a
revolutionary banjo and I have two pages
here this is the index page and if you
click this learn more button you're
gonna get to an article page basically
it's not the home page and I have on the
index page the body has a class of a
home and that's kind of important
that'll come in to come in to play a
little later the in the page page
what does it's called the inner page
right Oh actually has a class of inner
page this one does not have a class of
home and that's the important thing
about it so if you go back to the home
page by clicking the logo of the banjo
store we're gonna get back to the home
page and what else oh yes we have a
modal on this page that's currently
hidden let me see down here we have a
sign up modal and if I add the class is
open then it will add there we go it'll
add this signed up modal here which has
an email signup forms you can prompt
your viewers to learn more about your
company or maybe this is to buy your
book or to buy a banjo in this case or
you know whatever it is this is like a
more heavy-handed way of getting
prompting them to complete whatever
action or maybe it's to remind them to
do something before they leave or some
the sign out or something like that but
anyway we have this little modal that
will show up if the class is open is on
it if it's not then it won't show up it
must be a regular normal web page so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna use a
cookie to check if they're on this page
and if they've been to any other pages
and if they're back on this page then
pop that modal and here's how we do that
we're gonna go to this plug-in of jQuery
called jQuery cookie and it's really
easy I just downloaded this script here
actually I just copied and pasted it let
me show you my directory tree
into a file that's in my j/s folder
called jQuery Kuki and I just copied and
pasted it actually if you pay attention
to the documentation here it explains
that the master branch is not the most
update so you might want to view the
documentation for the latest branch of
1.41 that's the one that I grabbed so
make a note of that and then the usage
instructions are it's really quite
straightforward that this plug-in does
the heavy lifting for us so all I need
for my demonstration here is my markup
in which case I have included jQuery and
then I've included this cookie and then
I have also a script
it's my functions it's just like you
know this is empty JavaScript file which
I'm going to be writing in tonight okay
so the first thing we want to do
let me just map out when I write
JavaScript I like to map out the logic
or at least the steps that bit that the
JavaScript needs to walk through in
order to accomplish my goal so let's
just do a quick a quick walk through the
first thing I want the user to do is
visit home the second thing is a visit
inner page and then the third thing is
when they and they can visit many pages
it doesn't matter how many so even they
can go logout or go home or go to
another website but when they come back
to home visit home again
modal that's what I want to happen so in
order to do that I have to set up a
cookie all right so to create a cookie
session it's just like this you're gonna
create you just a dollar dot cookie and
then in quotes the cookie comma and then
the value of the cookie so a cookie is a
key and value pair so we're gonna name
what the cookie is and then the you know
like like these are socks and I have
three socks kind of like
three socks who has three socks anyway
um so I'll say a dollar dot cookie
friend and I'll call this cookie scene
because I'm tracking which pages they've
seen and I'm gonna give it a value of
step one right because this as soon as
they visit the home page and that's what
we're kind of focusing on here we're
gonna name that cookie step one they've
they've done step one and I want to use
this expires as well and the path so
what expires does is it says how long is
this cookie gonna sit around for and
this is in days and then the path says
make it valid you know in a subdirectory
or across the entire site so if I add
this it's gonna last for seven days
across the entire site and so I want to
do that too I need to call them out
right after step one though alright and
I don't want to philosopher seven days
over the last for a bit longer than that
like a few months 120 days across the
whole entire site that looks like a good
cookie tasty tasty cookie alright so
they come to our home page and they get
marked by the seen cookie as step one
now we want to put that into a
conditional statement and we want to
give this cookie to them only if they're
on the home page right so I'll say if if
the if the body of the HTML document has
a class of home then do this and give
them that cookie but what happens if you
come to the home and it's the second
time you come to the home you don't want
to do revert it back to step one so
we'll say if the class if the body has a
class of home and the cookie of scene
right that's our name of our cookie
basically does not exist
was a bang right in front of it so
that'll say not cookie scene so it
doesn't have no cookie on it so far and
the body has a class of home only two
hands yeah the cookies not seen
console.log here and inside that
console.log will will ask for the cookie
and print out what the cookie is all
right let's go to our console and take a
look all right well the thing about
cookies right is that you have to kind
of if you're gonna be working with cake
cookies it's best to use an incognito
browser because each time you go to it
it's gonna it's gonna accept your cookie
and maybe you guys know a better way
around this but I haven't found it okay
so let's see what we got okay so um what
happened now was just as review said if
we go to a home page and the body has a
class of home and there's no cookie then
take a cookie called scene and label it
as step one and then in the console take
write out what the cookie of scene is
and we have a console log of step one
right here so this was successful in the
body okay so if they visit home do that
that's good that's what we wanted now
let's say if they visit the inner pages
we want to take that cookie and replace
the the string step one with step two
because they've completed the first step
which is visit the home page and now
they're on the step the second step
which is visit in a page I want to label
it a step two
and again I'll expire it later on
I'll use this same console message here
to check our work but I want to put this
this cookie statement again in a
conditional will say if if what we want
to say if the cookie has step 1 right if
it has no cookie or some other cookie
for seeing we don't want this to work so
we want to say if the dollar cookie
dollar doc ya seen is equal to the
string of step 1 and you know we're
concerned with where in the website they
are we don't want them to be on the home
page so we want to go over here to body
home the way that we looked at the body
to see if it was the body and we want to
make sure that it's just put a bang in
front of it so it's not the body okay so
let me read this to you again if you go
to this page and the cookie of scene has
step 1 and the page and the body of this
page does not have a class of home then
do the following
take that cookie and replace step 1 with
step 2 and expire in 120 days and then
we can log the cookie to make sure we're
on step 2 so let's save that okay it
saved and we're gonna go to page 2 and
check out our console down here below
page 2
step 2 perfect so now we've locked that
we're in step 2 now we want to say
what's gonna happen if they come home
and we'll start with the if statement
this time if similar to the first
beginning here if dollar dot cookie
scene
is equal to at this point it should be
step 2 right because they've gone to the
second page and they're coming back if
it's step 2 and we're now on the home
page so it's gonna be what we had yeah
and the body has a class of home page
then we'll do the following we're going
to find the element that has a class of
signup modal and we're going to add the
class not ask the class add the class of
is open that will basically pop that
modal and then just for a good measure
we can check our cookie again but it but
we're not really free assigned the
cookie name right so after we check this
cookie it should still say step 2
let's save and then we're gonna go back
to that home page right now and it
should pop a modal and in our console
log it should say step 2
well let's take a look pop the modal and
step 2 brilliant that's exactly what we
wanted to happen I really like this and
the third thing we want to do is concern
ourselves with closing the modal okay so
now the modal is open and they either
submit or they click this button and
this is in our markup this is called
it's a class of clothes right little X
right there okay so let's say in the
let's say you sign up modal dot close if
they click it this will happen
these functions will go down the first
thing we want to do is just close that
modal so it's going to be the reverse of
this statement here and we'll say
instead of add the class we're gonna be
just saying remove the class and then
what we want to do is take that cookie
we are you cookie right here and take it
away from step two let's rename it from
step two do something a little more
definitive like complete and what that
does is it lets us know I mean it
assigns the cookie as completely it
doesn't remove the cookie and why that's
important is because if that cookie was
removed the next time they come to the
home page we'll just start this all over
again right cookie is there's no cookie
of seen so this leaves the cookie there
as complete and if it is if there is a
cookie of seen defined when they come to
the home page later on it won't start
the whole process over again so let's
save that there okay we've got the modal
got step two we're gonna close the modal
and it should first of all remove and
then the second thing is we should see a
console log here oh no we need to get
our console longer okay now we have a
console one statement all right we're
going to close this modal and it should
disappear and then in the console we
should see the word complete being
replacing a step two all right there
yeah complete good so let's check that
again open it incognito window then I
pasted in the home page URL let's open
our console here so we can check our
statements so we've arrived on the home
page or in step one click learn more or
at step two in this article page this is
an e page that's not the home page or at
least any page that
whose body does not have a class of home
returned to the homepage popped a modal
we can fill this out and click Submit or
click the X and then we have a complete
down here that's exactly what we wanted
