it's just the best that I can do but one
of those certainly is true ah today we
are going to look at CSS flexbox
essentials I'm going to take you through
the ideas yes the properties and values
that you will need to create layouts
with flexbox when this video is done you
will be sufficiently prepared to use
flexbox in your layouts as a bonus check
out this video here in which we put our
learnings to use and build some small UI
elements using our flexbox skills all
right now let's begin ok I'm using code
pen in this exercise and I usually use
sass and Jade in my videos because they
are awesome but this time I thought
maybe I'll just try using vanilla HTML
and CSS to make it a little bit more
accessible for people who are you know
this is the first time they're watching
my videos so if you see me leaving off
brackets or semicolons that's why I
don't ever write them usually also you
should be aware that I am using in these
code examples autoprefixer which takes
care of cross browser compatibility see
flexbox is still a little bit of a dicey
thing so if in your production code you
need to support ie9 you might not want
to be using flexbox okay what is flexbox
this is what mdn the Mozilla developer
Network has to say about it
the css3 flexible box or flex box is a
layout mode providing for the
arrangement of elements on a page such
that the elements behave predictably
when the page layout must accommodate
different screen sizes and display
different devices for many applications
the flexible box model provides an
improvement over the block model in that
it does not use floats nor does the Flex
containers margins collapse with the
margins of its contents to get all that
I'm not sure if that's super clear on
what it is but let me kind of explain
that and walk you through that what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to go up
to that definition here in the markup
and I'm going to put a class hide so
you're gone all right
now in these next few examples I'm going
to be reusing this box but when you go
back and look at this code pen go and
have the code pin and link down in the
description below I'm going to have all
of the examples listed one after another
so that you can easily step through them
without having to destroy and rewrite
the code every time but I'm just going
to be destroying and rewriting it as we
work through this what you should really
understand about this structure here is
that I have a div which is a class of
parent and I've set its border to like
this coral color it's like an orange II
red color and padding of zero I don't
know what padding of zero is there that
doesn't make sense it's normally
padding:0 okay so I just basically I
just gave it a five pixel border all
that all that this parent has at the
epoch per moment by default is a five
pixel border next is the item and
there's five items in there and they're
numbered one through five in the content
of the item they have a height and a
margin just kind of styles that you can
see right here now you'll notice that by
default these are just divs right so
they're block level elements which mean
that each of these blue guys right here
are these blue items because they're a
block level element they cause the next
element to be on its
new line right that's what block level
elements do if you're not familiar with
the different type display types please
check out my video and the html5 basics
that I did like two years ago I think I
in now I think that's the one where I
draw on my face so maybe that might be
entertaining for you click a link right
there now that we've seen this HTML I'm
just going to get rid of it but you can
remember what it's like later on let's
take a moment to remember what Mozilla
said about flexbox that it's a display
property right so currently we know that
our displays are block levels and if we
want to change this into a flexbox
layout we have to change that display
property to flex so that's literally
what we're going to do we're going to
identify the parent and say display
flex now we're dealing with flexbox it's
just that easy all you have to say is
display flex done okay so we have a
display flex here now keep in mind that
this is being Auto prefixed so if your
target browser is Mozilla or WebKit you
may want to prefix that and let me show
you what I mean in code pen if I click
this little eyeball you can see that the
the autoprefixer is doing this work so
this is the rendered CSS and this is
actually what I'm writing right here so
so don't be fooled this is this is all
browser compliant but in ideally you'd
be writing just some something as simple
as display flex now on the right here
you can see the results of display flex
these these item boxes here are no
longer causing each other to go into a
new line they're kind of stacked up in a
row and they each have five pixels of
margin so if I go into item that margin
gets gets kind of sucked in so what I
want to do um just we can see this a
little bit better I'll take that margin
put it back on to the the items and I'll
give it a width I'll to finance with
with you're going to say 50 pixels okay
so from here there's tons and tons of
things we can do with the display flex
property it's actually a very flexible
display model and so I'm just going to
step you through a lot of the things we
can do right now all right now notice
that the numbers here are one two three
four five four are our items and I can
take the Flex direction and say row
reverse now they're lining up all the
way to the right and they're kept there
kind of starting at that number one two
three four five so this is a way to
reverse the stack of items that you're
that are in your your flex box parent
right but this is notice how this is
affecting the children though the
itself right the red box is not really
doing anything different it's still
holding its children but the children
are being reversed right there in a row
we can actually say instead of being
there so the default of this property is
row we can say that we don't want it to
euro we can be in a column and they'll
stand up from top to bottom we can
actually say I think we can do column
reverse - yeah
now they're starting at the five
actually is starting at the bottom
working our way backwards right so now
like already right off the bat compared
to display block we have so much like
flexibility I keep on that's kind of
describing it with its own so we have so
much so many options in just the way
that we're ordering and organizing the
way that these things flow right so
that's called flex direction the next
property is let's say flex wrap and by
default it's going to be no rep right
and let me show you so that doesn't look
any normal but if I take these widths
and I say instead of 50 pixels I say 50%
see what happen there by default I mean
just get flex no rep just so you're not
confused by that by default the the
maximum width of a container or sorry an
item inside of the parent if the parent
is flexed is I don't how you define this
the maximum width is the maximum width
it can have even if it's set to
something higher so like if I set this
width to 500 pixels it's still going to
be 1/5 of the the space available to it
right because it's constrained by its
parent a flex parent doesn't let his
children outside
I'm normally naturally without being
that being overwritten and also the
children of a flex parent are all in one
row all the time ever unless you go up
here and you say flex rap-rap now these
500 pixels these 50% errs these guys can
wrap them and change that to 30% so you
can see that they are in deaf indeed
wrapping right so they're just getting
they're just taking up as much space as
you tell them to and if they are too
many of their just rep that's that is
the beauty of flex wrap you can also
wrap reverse I think yeah see we're
starting at the bottom left there and
going in this way and then the top so
that's wrap reverse next I want to show
you one of my very favorite ones I don't
take this whip back down to 50 pixels I
happen to use I just kind of I just end
up using this next one a lot but it's
called justify content the default is
called flex start and that's nothing
surprising that's what you see right
there not startle start that's what you
see that's just when it starts in the
beginning of the Flex box and moves
moves out you can make that flex end to
where we're not leading with one and
working our way back like we did with
when we did the row reverse when we did
flex direction but now we're just taking
the whole content and just sliding it
over towards butting up on the right and
we do that with flex in so it's at the
end of the Flex container there's also
something simple like Center now a
little bit ago we did a video about
centering HTML or centering with CSS and
that was a lot of fun but I didn't even
talk about flex at all maybe because I
forgot maybe because I wanted to save it
for this video
you decide but anyways centering in in a
flex box is really really simple it's
just justify
content center and that's how you can
Center horizontally and each of the
items and so we flat we we centered one
thing in that video but here you Center
whole groups of things right the whole
group moves to the center and they're
all and they're all centered okay at
here are a few interesting ones this one
is called space between space between
justify is the content it takes the
first one and puts it all the way the
left and last one last one all the way
to the right and makes the space between
them all equidistant and the last
property available for justified content
is very similar to space between it's
called space around and instead of
throwing the first all the way to the
left and the last all the way to the
right
it actually takes those how do you say
this so the space between one and two
here half of that is on the on the right
on the left of one and on the right of
five right so if you can imagine that
each each item has the same amount of
margin and the ones on the on the right
and the left just kind of get you know
half of what's in between so this is a
this is a better way of making things
not look like whoa stretch but all
things like kind of centered equally
it's nice I like I used this one quite a
lot actually from my layouts alright for
this next one I want to make the parent
a height a little bit taller I'll say
height um
200 pixels semicolon forgot a 7-hour and
I told you I would alright height 200
pixels now we want to say we're going to
do another property called align items
now looms
okay now aligned items it deals with not
where it is on the right and left well
everything have been doing here you know
like basically the x axis aligned items
deals with the y axis you have a 200
pixels tall parent
and we're going to align items of course
the the default properties when they're
all at the top and that's called flex
start like that can you guess what the
lining into the bottom is it's very
similar to what we just looked at with
justified content its flexed end flex
and we'll take them all the way to the
bottom when you're dealing with aligned
items remember aligned items is the
y-axis and justify content is the this
one the x-axis
okay so flex and we how so have Center
which you might have guessed also and
then this one which is lots of fun
stretch oh I think I have a height to
find on these guys yes
so if I take off the height it will will
stretch so that stretch I mean take put
it back to 50 and then this last one is
called baseline and it's a little bit
harder to describe when we have only
actually I can do this I can do this
item let's say here say item n child
number three and we'll say to you font
size 30 pixels okay now you see what
happened just there let me make that
even more let's say 80 pixels okay you
see what's going on right here
the that they're all aligned to the
baseline they all share a baseline so
yeah that two lines up with the three
lines of the four even though the three
is massively larger than the others all
the items are aligned to the baseline
just like the property says cool huh the
next one I want to show you is called a
lion content and it's very similar to
justify content it hasn't moved things
in groups but there is a subtle
difference in that this applies to the
content the items when they wrap
right let me show you what I mean we
have currently 50 pixel items widths and
they don't wrap they they just make a
half of a row at the top and if I put a
lion content Center nothing will happen
it won't move it won't look any
different okay this is probably one of
the most confusing one so pay attention
right here nothing will happen if I make
the width 20% oops not 25 $28 side 20%
it's still not rapping
in fact 10% it's still not rapping if I
add the property that we talked about
previously called flex rap actually I
want to add that right here and say rap
now when I put them on 20% they will rap
and the group will be moved to the
center do you see how that happened let
me comment a lion center out so this is
what you would see a distributed
distribution the default by the way of
this is is actually is actually this
stretch and the reason that you didn't
see that right away is because I have
the D I have the height labeled as 50%
so now taking off the height so they
wolf the height will flex and they're
going to they're gonna do the default
for aligned content which is stretched
so if if something wraps it's going to
stretch actually the you don't even need
to have any wrapping or anything but if
you have no height labeled see I had the
height label the whole time that's why
they were like little boxes up at the
top but if you don't label the height or
define the height rather the boxes will
stretch all the way to the top the
aligned content default is stretch so if
I go back and I say flex content wrap a
lion content stretch there's other ones
right we looked at Center you can send
to them you can say a flex start
and they log group up to the top you
could say flex end and they'll group
down to the bottom and you can also do
the other ones we've seen which are
spaced around and spaced be tween and
those don't actually but in that case if
you're going to do space around you need
to have a defined height knots lace
space you need to have a defined height
and if you're going to do that and then
that also defining the height also opens
up a space between for you to okay so
there the top in the bottom depending on
on what they with the rap right okay so
so aligned content is on the is on the
WHI now we've been looking at the
different properties and how they affect
the X and the y right but remember the
first property that we just did and that
one was called flex direction it imagine
flex direction changing the X and the y
and now these properties like a align
content that we did it wouldn't do well
may align it to the vertical here it
would align to the center because our
flex direction would change let me show
you that flex Direction reverse nope
that's not what I want I want to call
them team
one two three space between four five
it's not it's not tilting the content
right I wouldn't mean that it to imply
that it was going to tilt the content on
its side
I meant that it would tilt the way you
distribute the space in flexbox so
there's a lot of nuance involved with
flexbox but it's a really powerful tool
especially when we've been been working
with floats and clears and like inline
blocks and you know blocks for the for
the longest time now we have these
really really intricate tools such as
flexbox but that is not all so all these
things that we've looked at so far are
have been applied to the parent of the
items we haven't really changed the
items themselves let's look at some of
the properties that a child a direct
child of a display Flex element can have
the first one is something called order
so if I go item and let's do an F
selector let's grab the second one so
this is the one that should be labeled
as number two is it's the second and the
dom and we will just give it an order
and then a number so you can choose
number one and you see what happens the
the number the order of the display not
the Dom because the Dom is still the
normal isn't how it was right but the
order of the display of these items has
been changed number two has been moved
all the way to the back well the back
why we said number one why would it go
to the back well the back the reason I
went to the back is because the other
ones have not a declared order if you
declare an order if you declare a number
it's greater than one they would go
behind it let me show you an example of
that so here we have
and child let's pull that up number
three and I'm going to give it order
number two now you see how three is
behind two right here and these little
blue boxes what happened is that if you
can imagine the the items that are not
declared as an order they're kind of
like this group they're here there's
zero well let's just say they're zero
maybe they're actually supposed to be
there and if you declare an order it
will go one or two or and so on and so
on if you do negative one you go in
front of zero see how two is back in
front now because they put a negative
number on it so in this way you can
manipulate the order of things you can
also let's say you let's say you can put
two you can put the same order on two
elements and they will kind of default
into their rows and let's make another
one of these here
let's take number five and put it as
order number three number five goes at
the end so the two and three are in
order one five is out is in order
sorry two and three are in order to five
is in order three so you see two things
can have the same order so just think of
these as groups not literal single
objects group nut no group declared is 0
I am I talking about this too much I'm
just like figuring out on my own too
right now but the idea is if you don't
declare an order it's in group zero if
you do declare it in order it's in the
group of whatever number you declared it
it can be positive or negative numbers
negative numbers are in front positive
positive numbers are behind because zero
right okay let's just let's move on the
next property I want to show you is
to get rid of 50 pixels the next
property I want to show you is something
that will distribute the width we want
to call it
flex Gro not collects grow what are you
doing that's ridiculous flex grow the
default is the default is zero but if
you put one you can have it
everything stretch out equally so flex
grow is an interesting is an interesting
is an interesting kind of thing
one of the harder things that I'm still
trying to use and understand pretty well
but the idea is you can control the
ratio of how much each one of these
individually will grow so if they're all
labeled as one right here and I take the
second one and tell it to flex grow up
flex extra flex grow to it'll be twice
the size flex three as well will be like
that if I could take item number Sam
remember four and make it grow flex one
counter all flex one flex eight it will
distribute it out out according to the
ratio that we chose right there's also a
property called flex shrink which is the
opposite of grow actually wait so it
doesn't make things grow it it enables
the ability to shrink if necessary right
so let me show you what I mean so let's
grab the nth child to in say flex shrink
three I don't know and do we see
anything changing we do not because
there is enough space here to
accommodate for each of these five
elements having 50 pixels in width but
if I change this to let's say 150 we
notice that that that we're normally
Salemi okay now we see that the the
distribute the Flex kind of like
district distribution of widths is
happening again and they're all equal
in with even though they're not 150
there as much as they can be
before the Flex container will will keep
them in but flex rink enables one of
them to shrink see how the two got
smaller
that's flex rink and the last one of
this kind of group that goes on to the
children the items here is called Flex
basis right flex flex
basis basis so weird word if you say it
enough basis basis base like bassist but
like base basis all your bases bassist
basis basis what flex basis does is it
sets a starting place before the element
begins to flex or shrink so it's kinda
it's kind of like setting the width so
let's say a flex basis for the element 2
here is 39 oh x3 9 pixels 39 and you can
see it's kind of like setting the width
a little bit but it's not because if the
Flex Direction is column you can see
that it's still impacting the 2 as it's
39 pixel let me make it even smaller
let's say you know 13 19 pixels whatever
19 pixels the Flex basis is not the
width because when I change the
direction of the flow the Flex Direction
the Flex basis became this standard for
the height so it's it's a little bit
more flexible than width and height it
it's cut but it acts kind of like those
it's the basis before it's begins to
grow or flex very confusing to me maybe
you guys can make it more clear to me in
the comments what this thing does
but that's available to it and now
there's a shorthand for flex all these
flex grows flex shrink and flex basis
and it's just called flex flex flesh
flex and you would do that like flex
number you would say 2 3 and
30 pixels that's not 23 use a to 330
pixels and the last property I want to
show you is something called a lion self
which is really really interesting so
let's take these let's make this flex
direction go back to row alright and
let's say we want to take that second
item again and align self a lion self we
know we know about the the default which
is flex start let's make it flex end and
this no longer needs to be a hundred
pixels tall okay so what happened there
is it got sent to the bottom of the
parent right it's got aligned to the end
of the Flex when you're talking about
alignments not justification right cool
and it's doing it by itself it's note
we're no longer looking at the group
this is just one item in the group which
is pretty useful now the the different
properties there are flex and their
center there's you know you can do flex
start like we've seen already that's
like the default and you can also do
stretch which is not working because why
is it not working
that's what snoring because there is a
defined height but as soon as I turn
that high off
flexstretch would let it just assume as
much space as it needed within the
content now keep in mind that these are
all Auto if if all of these were high
Auto they would you know be stretching
down or in other words if I took the
high off here I oughta just resets that
that's what I was doing it doesn't need
to be high auto just that there's no
height declared I'm just talking now
cool I think that's all that I wanted to
show you we are done here you are now
sufficiently prepared to make a layout
in flexbox you should watch this next
video where we use all these ideas to
lay out some pretty internet stuff if
you enjoyed this video please consider
subscribing because I put out a new
video every Monday and you can watch all
of those too
in the meantime keep on hacking
alright let's shut it down shut it down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
