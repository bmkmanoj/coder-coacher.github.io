in a series I call design and code my
personal website in 12 hours we've been
working on the mentoring section for the
past few videos and today is gonna be
the last one we're gonna make sure that
this design looks great on a mobile
device let's not take up too much time
you happy
here we go so there's one last thing we
need to do to make this like the best
and that is cater to mobile right now
this strategy is completely desktop
appropriate and watch what happens when
I shrink this thing down down to mobile
so click on the mobile thing here and
refresh look at our mobile strategy so
far
keep on hacking works the homeworks
scrolling down this is kind of beat up I
guess it kind of works down here at the
side but that's that's not really what
we want it to look like right well he's
not centered these need to be centered
let's go back to I just noticed this
right now the the they lead the home -
lead class when it's mobile needs to be
centered its left aligned right now so
let's just quickly fix that with home
dot sass and that's go down the
typography section outdent mm-hmm so
right now this media query is only on
the out dent let's just put it to
everything and then we'll say home lead
and then out then then did okay home
lead home lead I want you to be
text-align:center thank you that looks
better on both counts okay that's that
was just a little side note all right
now so what we want to do is figure out
what should be happening right here
oh and why is there to wait what was
that
why did you see the two balloons are
popped uh why I'll tell you why that
happened
that happened because that happened
because this bit right here mmm
this happened after a hit already like
clicked a different one how do we stop
that from happening
well I'll tell you how we stop that from
happening set timeout we do this we say
if okay if dot face no if jquery object
if jquery object dot face come on come
on there we go
dot has class of what is called it has
bubble open
then then do that
and do the intentions correctly okay so
you might be saying if if it has it then
do it well I don't want it I want to do
the negative of that so I want to put a
bang in front of the of the statement
okay so now it says if there's already
one of these phases that has bubble open
don't put the bubble on the third one
right so let's try this now ah no it's
working
yeah fantastic okay that happened and
then I fixed it done so what are we
gonna do about these we're gonna do
about this here's what I think that I
would like I would like these phases
that go vertically I would like them to
go horizontally across you just tap tap
them across horizontally and in the
bubble would show up so what okay so
let's go into the sass to take care of
that and we'll just go down here to the
very bottom and we'll just start hacking
away at a media query and we know that
our special media query is at max width
of 640 pixels and we know that because
that is the two columns plus all their
margins any smaller than that and then
this is where the bidness happens okay
the first thing we have to worry about
is these faces face and I don't want
them to be vertically anymore I want
them to be horizontal so I need to stack
them horizontally so instead of making
them block elements I'll call them
display:inline-block elements and that
way let's just see inline block where
did they go
seriously where'd they go
there is way up there they turn off the
overflow so I can see where they all
went
okay okay there's why are these oh
because of the negative on faces all
right remember that its parent has let's
see let's put new margins on there zero
is going to start with zero okay
you
Oh wild so check it out
the top oh this is crazy so so the
remember the vertical math and all that
stuff that that ended up putting
everything down to 230 down here which
is interesting because it's actually a
pretty good height it's actually a
pretty good height for for what I'm
trying to do I want the bubble above the
faces I want the faces all in line like
that so that's pretty interesting let's
put the face you want a margin left of
was it 35 pixels yeah and I need the
faces to have the the box needs to be
width the width needs to be that 115
pixels times however many faces there
are in this case there are six okay
so it's gonna be wider that's good let's
get that balloon to be bottom 100
percent and then margin bottom you know
10 pixels oh it's not called the balloon
it's called bubble and then let's see
left
the reason I put it at 300 is because
that's gonna be like you know kind of
like if I have it let's see
iPhone 5 it's 320 pixels wide I still
need to get these faces faces face it is
no margin left foot all them let's put
that marsh on the right okay
dude didn't didn't do to bump up the
butt and get the the margin left zero
okay now that that balloon is like you
know on the left so if I click these
other ones it's not gonna be where I
want it to be it's not gonna be a little
it's not gonna rule thinking about this
I have two more things that I want to do
number one I want to scoot these things
off to the left when I click on the
second face I want to scoot the whole
thing off to the left and then the
balloon is actually showing up where I
want it to be in relation to its parent
right let me show you how to do a media
query in in JavaScript we have this
click function here am entering bubble
click mentoring bubble click it should
be face clicks we're clicking on faces
not bubbles whatever if you click on the
face this is what happens now let's take
this the result of the click right and
and put it in if if the jQuery object
window width so we're gonna measure the
window basically it's just like a media
query that you're used to in CSS but
it's in JavaScript we're gonna take the
width and say if the width is bigger
than that magical number of 640 then if
it's bigger than do this stuff that we
haven't
in about mm-hmm
else so if it doesn't have you know if
it's smaller than 640 we want to be
doing that mobile magic jQuery right
here and that means if let's see what do
we want to be we just want to scoot it
to the left instead of scoot it to the
top right so let's do some let's do some
query in here to get some variables
we'll say face left similar to this
right but we're just going to get the
left and then we'll do some left math or
rather in keeping with the theme instead
of vert we call it Horace Mann because
I'm so good at naming things all right
so this will be positioned to the left
and this will be face left - 230 is that
right left math will be no no no won't
be that crazy
it'll just be we'll just start with zero
and then we'll - left math right all
right so if that's true then we're going
to take let's see I mean well the first
thing we need to let's go back to the
CSS I wanna say faces top was it - 30
pixels no no yeah what
oh you know what screwing me up is this
whole like rising up from the bottom
thing that it did here a scroll top
scroll window scroll Scroll scroll this
one right here yes yours well Adil
launched that one so why don't we say if
that's true and it's bigger right so
here's the if your scroll mentor section
offset top so if you scroll down and
we're going to move it around if that's
true and it's also not in a mobile view
then do the whole you know launched kind
of thing ah cool man alright so now
nothing's happening but that's what we
want let's go back to our functions I
didn't want all the faces to jump up
like that so what I've got to do is
write some functions now for the clicks
because I have it Ellison else nothing
we want to take the same idea of this
one the face find the parent click top
except for this time we're doing the
left and want to do hores math that's
the worst name ever whore is Matt whore
is math means horizontal not the other
thing you're thinking alright let's try
it out sucks didn't work
why console click the parent hores math
is not defined or is math Oh
and needs a high okay okay let's do it
now let's do it now
good well I don't know how to overcome
that but anyway looks good this is just
the just the exact movement I wanted
except for you know that same problem of
when you first refresh your first click
is just snaps right to it instead of
moves the same problem is it should be
defined here as left zero pixels now
when we start it again
it should move yeah from the very
beginning ok cool now it's correct two
functions and start popping that balloon
you know so go to the parent and move it
the thing that you clicked this again
add class right Oh basically these
things this same thing this same thing
if it's that same thing we don't need it
to be in the if/else statement but I
just want to save see if it's the right
thing so let's just try this first same
thing same thing okay that's the same
thing so we don't need it in the it felt
statement so let's move it outside of
the if/else X and just put it right
below and then move it out of this one
because we want the bubble of you pop in
either way all this if else is doing is
saying if it's you know this side of the
window then move it this way and if it's
smaller or bigger move it that way
that's kind of what it's saying so oops
d what is d save
good-o my life that's weird okay so we
have this situation of it's it's kind of
like the narrow use case of somebody's
clicking around here and then they move
their wind browser in and you're gonna
be like oh actually that really worked
out this is the first one but like what
if it's like the third one and then they
move in and you're like wait it is again
that's too tall and it's just something
wrong right what we need to do is have
like an ultimate reset of everything so
like if you move it around and you snap
into the slim-jim
nope if you snap it into the right place
or you hit that media query then move it
to the start place for that platform
move it out move it into the right place
for that
right for desktop so here's how we're
gonna do this we're gonna go down the
bottom we're gonna make a new function
and this function starts with looking at
the window and the handler is called
resize and so that's saying like
whenever you resize the window basically
like this like this thing this function
is going to start firing this function
is gonna start firing and what's going
to be happening well let's put that
media query in here because when it when
that because when that function fires
you know we want to see what we want to
be checking them the media query yeah if
it's this way then we want to just kind
of like load okay here's we're gonna do
it's gonna simplify things instead of
like looking in different areas and
sections and stuff we're just gonna make
a we're just going to make a little
block of code a function that we will
call right here and it's going to be
like the the go to start point for each
of the states right so this is gonna be
like mentoring wide start you got it
good and then we'll say if it's not that
meaning else or else meaning it's not
that go to mentoring narrow okay those
are the two functions definitively that
will define the start state of each of
the things alright so let's start with
mentoring narrow just because we've been
looking at that right now
so function function mentoring narrow
start it's gonna look something like
this
what do I want it to look like when it's
narrow well I know that I want the faces
to have some certain CSS properties like
like if if we're over here in the in the
desktop version and they're clicking
around like that the left and the the
top is getting all you know like
specified to other things so what we
want to do is basically just reset that
stuff to you know what I want them to be
so top I want it to be zero pixels and
same with left actually combat
zero pixels let's see if this is right
so I have this like bubble popped out up
here let's move it in boom
I don't want it to be top zero only 2:00
2:30 I think you know what I mean
I think you know I think you know why I
- yep but also I want the first one
there's another function in here of
faces let's say there's CSS okay so
after the CSS will say first add the
class of let's move this don't get my
anyway add class of was it like has
bubble open and siblings let's move this
down a little bit on one line and
siblings remove class this same thing
all right so if here's a perfect case in
the desktop view this last one mary has
the bubble but as I squeeze it in I want
it to reset to it the bubble will be on
the first person and everything will be
positioned right let's try it
ooh almost
oh here's why I said faces first it is
not faces first it should be it should
be face first
okay let's try that again so take it out
here JavaScript refresh meri and squeeze
it in here we are 640 boom yeah LJ LJ's
got it going on and beginning oh yeah
thought it is doing it again or
something Joey that's exactly what I
want so that's the mentoring narrow
start let's talk about copy and paste
then mentoring wide start what wide
start okay so I want faces to be op 0
left 0 that's true and then face I want
not the first to add class but it's
going to be the third so nth child 3
like this alright so we'll move some
let's click Andrew squeeze it in and it
should be LJ
all right LJ click Andrew again squeeze
it out and it should be Kimberly down to
LJ Bennett Joey is out and you
- Kimberly alright everything seems to
be acting just as I want it which is
great alright wouldn't you want
everything to be acting just as you want
it one problem I'm noticing now is that
if I get to the end of these scrolling
things if I get to Mary's face I can't
get back right then the format just
won't allow it after refresh and that's
just silly
why is the blue never pop why is a
balloon never pop why does a balloon
never pop Amanda nervous chart oh that's
just if you if you move in the thing but
if oh goodness I'm glad I noticed this
okay so on your phone you can't control
the width it's just it just is the width
and this would never pop a balloon so we
need to handle the use case of this
right here how does the balloon
naturally pop so that's gonna be with
the W scroll right here so what this
line 42 is saying if the mentoring
section offset top is 500 so this is
like you know we're talking about the
scroll and the width is 640 why did I
want the width to be 640 because face
add class lunged launched seems
reasonable what is launched to do
they're just top zero okay okay will do
will do this will nest an if if and
we'll just move this media query down
there
there you go if that happens here and
there we are okay else okay so this is
gonna be happening if it's not 6:40 if
it's if it's if it's smaller than now we
want to basically run this one just code
right right let me check on that again
if I could open this mobile view and
it's six it's lower than 640 scrolling
down scrolling down and that pops up
good that's what I want you that's
really that's really what I wanted
okay last thing is if I get to Mary's
face here I can't get back to read the
other one so I want to create another
button right here and this button is
gonna be a little bit different it's
just gonna be an Li with with it's just
like a back button right the back
buttons gonna look a little bit
different so but it's still a face face
and back button it's just gonna be like
oh I have this um SVG already set it
sorted out to looks like right here oh
you can't see it it's like an it's like
an ankle it's an icon I'll show you I
should I mean a background image I want
to be white with the URL image here of
back icon dot SVG and I want to be
centered and no repeat I need to make it
a face not just back button so that way
it can have those attributes like it
excise and dimension as well and then so
that's that's the background right there
so let me get the faces whit okay so you
need to be x seven now because there's
seven of you not just six and let's take
this background and save back around
sighs you see how this icons all just
like too big I want it to be you know a
lot smaller let's say 15 pixels wide
like twenty six pixels tall yeah there
we go
so now we go over here we got this
button that'll take us back but if it's
on the vertical here I don't want it to
show so I'll say display:none here and
then over here on face and back button
just bleh inline-block
you need to show up there we are okay so
the back button what do want the back
button to do let's go into our functions
and we say click click click click click
when we click on something here it's a
face from right if this thing that you
clicked on
has a class of back button then do
something else
do what you already do alright so we
need to find what that something is that
something is Oh
it's basically this you start no here
you go narrow start right I see you got
so mentoring now click one two three
back button oh man why is the narrow
start not pop the balloon why is that
oh I know why because this right here is
like telling me to add the or I bet you
that yeah has level open is on the back
button class let's say this it has class
back button so if if it's if if none of
these faces have bubble open and this
thing is bang it's not the back button
then do this thing otherwise do let let
this be the thing right I hope this
works
here we are married
the line 22 now is saying that after you
put that narrow start class on the first
one that I told you to take the one you
just clicked on and do that so that's
why right here the back button has has
bubbled up in class on it we could do
this I'm getting tired so I'm like
writing like weird code right now
alright that worked so let's say we have
Andrew quote and hit the back button and
then goes a minute okay this could
probably be better code what I mean
probably it definitely could be a better
code but it's done you know and it's
late so we're going to stop it there I'm
happy with the functionality it looks
and acts fantastic I couldn't be more
happy with this section and I'm looking
forward to get into the next session
thanks for watching
ah isn't that wonderful see look at that
looks fantastic I'm so excited about
this and I love wrapping up a long video
so tune in next week on Monday when we
start our eight and until then keep on
hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
