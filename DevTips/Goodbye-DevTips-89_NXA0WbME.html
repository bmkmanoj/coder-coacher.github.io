like this hi I've missed you so this
video is a really difficult one to make
and there's no sense in kind of dancing
around the issue you've likely already
read the title before clicking on the
thumbnail I'm I'm leaving Deb dibs
that's that's the news I'm leaving dev
tips for the past year I've sat on the
sidelines debating on what to do I mean
I love I love YouTube I love I love dev
tips I love the interactions with
everyone I love all of the impact that
dev tips has on the lives of a lot of
people and the interactions that I've
had with some of you in real life and
online and have been have been amazing
you know and and not not everybody gets
to have this experience not everybody
gets to build something that becomes
this big literally millions of people
have seen my work on this channel
and to me that that's amazing that is
amazing and it and it's even more rare
when you get to make something like this
and it and it lives on past your
involvement and this is why I'm so happy
to tell you that that dev tips will not
be shutting down the guest host that you
guys have seen on the channel lately mpj
and David have agreed to take on a full
ownership of the channel and and I can't
think of a better team to keep dev tips
alive they really do embody the spirit
of what I've been trying to make this
whole time I mean they certainly are
qualified in terms of like technical
knowledge but more than that they they
just display that that encouragement and
the friendliness and fun and in the
heart of what makes dev tips special so
I'm gonna say goodbye now I have an
interview that I want to share with you
right now I'm gonna cut to that it's a
mean and nephew Jay and David talking
about what their vision is for the
channel coming up in you know trust me
it only gets better from here question
you guys have been uploading for a few
videos now to the dev tips Channel how's
that going for you
really really well we've been sort of
amazed with the reception that we had
this idea of building the react app from
start to finish just like this high
fidelity prototype and we didn't really
know what the audience would think about
that but they have really really enjoyed
it yeah everyone but a few where's
Travis yeah well you know it's funny man
like my wife is watching your series and
she never watched any of my stuff but
she's like she's like oh I want to know
react so she's watching me yeah but the
idea with the series was to like see how
does how do Houser does we work with the
dev tips audience do they even like us
do we can we produce something that dev
tips orience likes totally I mean that's
some of the reasons like that I asked
you guys to start a guest posting on dev
tips is because not only are you like
obviously in control of the content you
know what you're talking about but
there's a certain cadence and kind of
kind of attitude that you guys carry
pretty well and I think it's a really
great fit for what dev tips is what it
has been in like what the audience has
come to expect from from the kind of a
brand but I want to know also about your
other channel fun fun function why did
you start that channel and what kind of
like what what did you set out as to be
like your difference between everything
else that existed at the time so I have
a background in video production and
theater and I felt like I had kind of
plateaued a little bit as a programmer
so I wanted to do something that could
like fuse those two skills together and
then eventually I ended up the a YouTube
channel would be a really great fit I
started that one of the things like one
of the I really I think that you had
been going with dev tips for about
almost a year when I started out that
tips was of course like the dominant
channel which was like my it was kind of
like my to be honest I kind of construed
you a little bit like an enemy in my
head my jealousy like this guy it's so
good I wanna like kill him like because
it was it was exactly what I wanted to
do like all the other channels were
basically like oh people doing like
boring tutorials like screen recordings
but you really made a show out of it
mm-hmm Agence because that's one of the
core things that I really want to do I
wanted fun for function to be a show
like a weekly show that you can tune
into to like make you feel good about
programming on Monday night not
necessarily like this database of
tutorials like but you I build up over
time that people search for and then
leave but something that you can
actually follow and like reliably get
something some nugget every every week
yeah I remember the first video that I
watched a fun fun function that made me
understand what you're going for so not
the first video I watched of it but the
first one that I really caught the
vision of it and you're just like
walking around a park in the cold do you
remember this one and you're talking it
finds a quarry in one of those walking's
he finds a quarry oh I just remember it
was really cold and you were talking
about being inspired or something like
that
Oh motivate the motivation one yeah yeah
it was actually a video the this
interesting backstory to that one is
that I I actually was about to do the
very thing I talked about earlier like
actually optimizing for what video would
get me a lot of views mm-hmm like the
search engine to thing and look what
people search for on YouTube and it was
long at some ESX thing like oh that
would get me a lot of views and like my
motivation just dropped through the
floor I just was not able to do to do it
and then I guess okay I have to make a
video so I'll make a video about how I
cannot make a video that's always good
it's like singing a song about how you
want to write a good song or something
like that so what have you learned from
doing fun fun function all this time
that will inform how you want to kind of
start working with dev tips there's a
lot of when you you wrote a piece of
text and when we during our
conversations and you said that you used
actually three words that are extremely
close to what I define the channel we
haven't talked about how I define a
channel both you still like managed to
pick it up mm-hmm
and it's you use the term anchor
instrument friendliness and fun and I
use encouraging personal and fun so
encouraging is I accidentally dropped
this quote a couple of months back where
I said that feeling of confusion is your
friend it means you're learning like
very fun function is very focused around
around growth and oh yeah they're only
so much like producing results in the
moment and I think that really I that's
one of the things that we I we share
with dead tips mm-hmm
it's yeah and then personal like there
is this concept that floated around in
the developer community for like it was
big especially big a couple of years ago
that was the 10x programmer which is
this the idea of this program and that
is
ten times better than and the average
and I really really hate that term it's
absolutely disgusting because great
software is built by great teams and not
great programmers and we have enough
impostor syndrome as it is without
unrealistic like that like it's
about it's about feeling good about
where you are and like being focused on
growth and being focused on making the
people around you grow so yeah we show a
lot of mistakes on video I don't edit
out my mistakes I don't like I could
make a perfect video where don't make
any perfect mistake and then people
wouldn't comment like ah why are you so
bad at typing I know I want it to be
that way I want to show like the floors
finally fun it's it's very important to
programming something programming is
something that you do for such a long
time and like it's something it shares
with a lot of creative crafts of course
but stamina is very important like a lot
more important than like being smart so
you have to like find ways to stay
excited about programming constantly and
like find ways like how can we find joy
in this constantly for years and years
and years mm-hmm and that is I think
that that's that's signifies the three
concepts of fun per function like
encouragement personality and fun
personal fun encouragement personality
and fun that that's really I mean that
exactly is what I see in in fun fun
function and what I really am hoping you
guys continue on as you work with dev
tips as well this is that's really great
I want to talk about the audience for a
second of dev tips what can they
what can the long-term viewers of dev
tips expect in this next kind of what is
it leg next chapter of dev tips when
when you guys are taking over as host of
the channel we're hoping that so at
Phantom function we've sort of it has
grown into sort of our community and we
hope to embrace that with dev tips that
if you're watching dev tips you would
feel like you're a member of this
community and you will be able to reach
out for help or like that the community
will help each other out
just yeah try to build a community and
that's something we matthias have done
previously like in our careers that's
awesome
building a community is really important
to be able to do that we can't promise
anything but that's our goal yes that we
hope to have an audience that feels like
they influence and drive the direction
of the channel mm-hmm so what you're
gonna see a lot of coming up is not
necessarily more of the content of what
we just produced and what we do put is
in this channel that was more of an
experiment you're going to see more oh
the Sun is coming up more experiments
Ike we're going to try out a lot of
different formats a lot of different
types of content and really listen to
the feedback of the audience and see
what resonates with people and listen to
the comments and see like okay this is
an interesting idea we'll try that so we
don't have too much of a firm idea other
than that we want to create a community
and have a high degree of interaction
with the audience what's really exciting
and I know that I'll be tuning in to you
know keep tabs on what's going on even
though I won't be in front of the camera
anymore I want to thank you guys for
your time getting up this early and I'm
hanging out with me I've had such a
pleasure in knowing you so far and I
think this is like a really really great
move for dev tips in general so again
thanks for you know accepting my request
to to come and be the host of the show
so much we honor like we are really
humbled yes really humbling to be able
to keep on the work that you create what
you created and just like push it
forward and making it even better and so
so so this is it
I don't really know how to say goodbye
other than if you want to keep the
conversation going or just say hi I'll
still be making youtube content on my
personal channel Travis Nielsen but
it'll be a lot more personal it's not
going to be coding tutorials necessarily
or probably ever at all but but yeah
come come say hello and just kind of
like I don't I think I need to upload
something first but yeah and then on the
on Instagram I've been uploading kind of
kind of actively anyway if if this is
has been I mean you know what I don't
even know I don't know how to say
goodbye I'm just gonna kind of float off
the screen that's kind of you to be you
to be exit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
