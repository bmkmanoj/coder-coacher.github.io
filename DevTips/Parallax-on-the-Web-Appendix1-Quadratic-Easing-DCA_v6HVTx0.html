it will give you some context to what
you're about to see but in short this
video is from Marcel he tells us how he
achieved the quadratic easing that he
did for the parallax on the web series
so take it away Marcel we're going to be
adding some easing on these blog posts
here because right now when we come down
they come in and they stop really
suddenly and here's how we're going to
add the easing here's the old code and
as you can see we are just translating
in the X direction of whatever scroll
distance you scroll down so the easing
is linear or no easing at all so for
every pixel you scroll down the element
will come in one pixel to the right so
I'm going to close this and save this
file with my changes so what I've done
is I've made a function called posts and
I've just passed in the scroll distance
I've also set two variables right in the
root here so posts top and window height
and the post top is just basically the
top of the posts here so the blog post
element and the window height is
obviously the window height and then
what I'm doing is I'm doing some math
here so now it's got quadratic easing so
if i refresh this you can see that when
they come in they slow down and stop
slowly like that to better understand
what's going on here I've made this
graph where this red line is linear
easing and X is the distance you scroll
and Y is the distance from its final
resting place
the distance of the final out of the
element from its final resting place and
I've just selected 300 pixels as the
place I want the element to end up but
obviously it's different in our example
here but just for this graph I've chosen
300 pixels and now this is with the
quadratic easing so we can see the 300
pixels right here and the key is this
power of 2 and this basically just
flattens out the graph if I get rid of
that
it's like saying 1 in front it's gonna
be really narrow way too narrow so I've
just chosen that as a nice way to make
it a little bit flatter so it comes in
more slowly if you want to make it
coming faster you can just bump it up a
bit so maybe like that or if you want to
make it come in more slowly lower it a
bit but I I like this it works pretty
well so now let's get on to the code the
first thing we need to do is determine
the elements final resting place and
that's the place here where it's zero
pixels away from where it needs to end
up and that was at 300 in this example
but the way I determine that is using
the position of the top of the posts
which is here and then I subtract 1/8 of
the window height so when you get about
here it should stop and that's about 1/8
of the height of my window that it has a
bit of padding here the next variable I
defined is this offset which is the
distance away from the final resting
place the element should be at any given
time and now we do a little bit of math
to see if the distance you've scrolled
or X is less or greater than the place
you want to end up because if we look
back at our graph once the quadratic
function
reaches zero it starts to go up again
and we don't want that we wanted to just
come down here and stop stay where it
should end up so we say that if it's
less than the goal so on this side of
300 well wherever it will be it should
be equal to math.min which means take
these two numbers and whichever ones
lower will be what it's equal to and the
reason we do this is because we don't
want them going too far away so we just
wanted them to we just want to keep them
a little bit off-screen not go crazy far
out and then we use this function we had
before it's just written in JavaScript
and if it's greater than the goal we'll
just make it equal to zero so if it's
way over here for example it will just
be zero not up here the next thing we do
is we just grab both of these outside
post elements so 1 &amp;amp; 2 or 1 &amp;amp; 3 rather
and we set the one on the left to be
translate minus this number and the one
on the right to be positive that number
and again we make them go down a bit and
we just use this point to to make them
come in diagonally and we get this
really nice easing effect
thanks to ourselves we're explaining
that to us so well and thank you for
watching and until next time keep on
hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
