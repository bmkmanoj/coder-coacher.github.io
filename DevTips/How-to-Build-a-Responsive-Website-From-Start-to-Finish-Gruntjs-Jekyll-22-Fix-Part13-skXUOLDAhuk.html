dev tips ricardo appassionato and he is
a really big contributor actually to the
to the artist theme that we've been
working on for the past few months
say hello Ricardo hire ah so the reason
that this is a special episode is
because we have been kind of dealing
with a frustrating topic behind the
scenes and that is that jekyll updated a
few things that we were relying on and
kind of as a result broke the build
though you're working on so let me show
you what we have here if you're looking
at my screen you can see the artist
theme right here and you can't see this
Ricardo but I'm just showing them my
screen and then everything looks good
and let me show you on my console Jekyll
actually having quickly Jekyll ok Jekyll
a /v we can see that I'm running version
2.0 point 3 now I'm going to update that
to a pseudo gem install Jekyll
so now we're updated to Jekyll 2.2 I'll
run Jekyll again and when i refresh my
browser there are some issues namely
this background image is not - seen here
and neither is the avatar here now the
reason for this is because we were
reusing this really awesome data file to
define the background image and the logo
and also the avatar right here on line
25 and then again on the logo on 9 and
10 and now the new version of Jekyll
doesn't respect that it doesn't allow us
to to take these variables inside of
Jekyll and put them into our sats they
stop doing that and I went on the forums
and yes they been a longer support the
conversion right so you have a you have
a second syntax inside the sauce and our
liquid syntax inside the sauce but the
big diamond that previously a compiled
that's liquid the syntax inside the
sauce file no longer exists right so for
the past like maybe three or four weeks
I've been asking everybody to don't
update their Jekyll stay with version
2.0 point three until we can circle back
and get this taken care of and that's
what we're doing today so this is like
been a weight on my shoulders for like
the past nearly a month and I'm just I'm
just ready to get it off of my shoulders
and so Ricardo it has been working with
me on this and he has a really really
brilliant work around and and then I'm
going to share another alternative
option and then we'll talk about how
that how we're going to move forward so
Ricardo would you explain to everybody
the workaround that you've devised a
magical it with the grant Jassim good
grant yes yes yes okay with the grantor
I talked that
if we live the liquid inside assassin
and we we use ground to compile that
sauce in CSS okay mm-hmm we uses streams
in SACEM so if we use triangle the
liquid the syntax inside salsa will be
compiled in CSS but it isn't converted
because there is an ahkam there is no
compilation that is done with jackal so
we create a CSS file with the liquid
nested inside after we whipped in our
CSS file and after that with Jackie we
compile that CSS file our global CSS
file with the nest the liquid that will
compile it in our actually with the the
content inside the all set instead of
the Yama okay this is how it works right
here you can see that mmm some parts are
in some chunks of the fire the the
really liquid syntax here that is nested
inside and it is not compiled yet and at
the start of the file way there is the
front matter
when it compiles that violet through
Jack you add a liquid syntax you will be
compiled short juice here with here we
obtain the unit to our log right and
that's it you show us how to install
grant oh yes I'll let me show you my
desktop so my forked repository at my
master and here you have all the shut up
with grant and when I clone it to my
desktop and I have here a through and
Piana
okay which is a ready solid because ER
is a prerequisite of jakab m inside the
project folder you see a package dot
JSON and we can find it here so with
that note packet my a and gamma lots of
all the dependency and in my case there
is a grantor and also all the tasks that
I use in my grandfather cloning a very
positive all straight in it to your back
support to you or wherever you want to
show if you run npm install okay sheesh
find the defected objection and lordship
hellos up all the dependency so actually
it is downloading a grantor and we'll
show the other stuff all other tasks see
you write npm install and it will find
any package.json in and download the
dependencies yes that's gone
in your party in your project you have
to have only one package about Jason
it's a diesel net yeah that was good and
so with my grant file now before I say
right thank you sir and WV and now I can
grant serve and actually it starts a
server and also it is watching changes
in my files it will create us a server
which points to a my my port a 9000 and
after that a he hey grant is still
watching for changing in my project
mm-hmm so for now if I go to local
Lobster
it's like a flood upset my and my
project as you can see here okay and if
I make a change
I know in wardship anywhere I know I add
a line if I save actually a grant with
will be notified about the change and it
will compile all over me all right
that's good that's good that way you can
keep those variables stored in the data
settings yeah mo yeah that's what this
whole thing is about cool well yeah I
think that's a very viable solution I
want to do another one as well with the
rest of the dev tips ideas and I want to
do where we put the variables back into
the SAS and I'll maintain that one in
what we want to do is
want to have your branch be the
destination for the grunt version of the
artist theme is that right yes okay that
sounds like a good plan
awesome cool thanks for your time
Ricardo is there anything else you
wanted to say um
it's uh I don't know
I know pressure it both laugh so much
tool to be here with you is like a live
a live video with you a live preview so
it's so cool I mean is it's cool to know
that you are in another side of the
world and I'm turn Italy you are he
better and I think near San Francisco I
don't know yeah so you just woke up
right like it's six o'clock in the
morning where you're at yeah yes yes
yeah I'm so yeah I'm about to go to bed
so thank you so much for rolling out of
bed early for us this morning and to
really appreciate not only just showing
up on the show today but also the a lot
of the work that you're putting into the
artists theme and the help that you're
giving to everybody through your
experience with grunt it's really
awesome I really appreciate it
in surprise Reforma all right really
all right well have a good rest of the
day and I'm gonna I'm gonna go go to
take a nap myself okay we just saw
Ricardo's a process and he is going to
be kind of maintaining that that
approach to things and I'm going to
simplify things a little bit and revert
back to the approach of having the the
images and paths defined in the style
sheets and the content like the
paragraphs and skills contained in the
settings yeah well I'll show you what
I'm doing right now before I go to bed
so right here I have
the current artists theme as rendered by
Jeckle 2.2 and we're noticing that the
big hero image and my avatar are not
showing up now they are defined in my
settings yeah Mille and their to find a
such logo background image and then down
here travitt are so I want to kind of
comment these out and any Emily do that
with a pound symbol and I'll make a line
here to say that the logo and background
image are defined in the
all da sass document
and then I want us to have that similar
message to the Avatar here
okay and then I'm going to go over to
that all dots ass and this is the
settings that has already been set up
and right now we're trying to pull it in
from that yam well I'm going to fix that
by just putting the paths to the various
logos and images directly in here so
this is going to be logo dot SVG this is
going to be Hiro BG hero I think dot
JPEG and this is going to be traveied
tar dot JPEG all right and then let's
refresh here and see what yet the travel
tar is back and the header is not but
the logos fine
did I have that name wrong let's go back
to my settings
it was Hiro back on that background Hiro
okay Hiro - BG save and refresh and
refresh and afresh not dog what am i
doing it's jpg okay
now refresh okay cool so we are in good
game right now everything is looking
fantastic and wonderful again with the
current version of Jekyll 2.2 so this is
all fixed and finally we can move along
I'm so happy about that
thanks everybody for watching this video
it's a short one I know but also I have
a treat for you I made another video for
PHP academy' which you can find in the
link of the description of this video
here but today is such a great video
because we're finally updated and
running with Jekyll 2.2 such a weight
off my shoulders I suggest that you
check out the branch of the artist name
that Ricardo maintains a link again is
in the description below if you want to
see grunt in action this main branch
will not be using run but
keep it simple by keeping the variables
in the sass like I just showed you if
you liked this video please share with
your friend if you are new to dev tips
please subscribe because we do a new
video every Monday now this is a special
video to me because it's the one of the
first ones where we've had a contributor
on the channel to talk about the things
that they're doing on dev tips and the
way that they're helping you guys as
viewers out who are interested in in
this project as it develops so it's
pretty cool to me now also I have
another few videos coming up hopefully
shorter ones to just kind of catch up on
this backlog of pull requests that I
have because I kind of ignored
everything until we were done with the
work section and now that we're done I
want to show more of the cool things
that you guys as a community are
contributing and I'll have those coming
up hopefully in the middle of the week
or early next week so that's it for this
video everybody remember to keep on
hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
