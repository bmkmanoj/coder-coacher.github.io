skeleton of the react app you're
watching them tips with guest hosts mpj
and David alright
last time we we were about to install
create react app which is a tool that
allows us to create react app it creates
a skeleton for you and you do that by
installing calling npm install - g which
means global where don't worry about
what that means for now and writing
create react app and if you just hit
enter that should hopefully install this
thing magic going on
yes exactly so you just downloads that
from NPM and now it is installed and I
think that it should be usable right now
good idea is to have this directory for
all your code I have a directory that I
call code temp so you can just go CD
which stands for change directory to
code temp and then we create our our
application so if we just type create
react app like that yeah exactly and
then space and then the name of the app
better playlists' cool so it will do
stuff don't worry too much about this it
will they simply create a skeleton for
us for a react app because the react app
is a modern react app is quite a bit of
components involved it's it's not
terribly complicated but what create
react app will offer you is a nice
starter set up alright so here we are
happy hacking obsessed that sounds good
yeah exactly it gives us a few
instructions here it says npm start
started developing
server okay so do that let's see what
happens so I have to go into the
directory and there I hit NPM start yeah
all right so this kicks up a browser and
we should see our react app now cool you
can use any text editor you like really
yes yeah
I prefer Visual Studio code which you
can install by us googling Visual Studio
code the code part is important because
it's a special version of Visual Studio
but you can use atom or sublime text or
any kind of editor that you prefer but
we're gonna use code so on the left hand
side here we see our little project it
has has some files let's just walk
through what the files are actually node
modules that is the directory which
contains all the installed installed
node modules and as you see there are a
lot of them even just from the start so
create react app uses quite a bit of
them and this is why we need the bundler
in order to package these and minimize
them otherwise the your application will
end up with an enormous amount of
requests the public directory is for
files that we want to directly directly
serve basically known code item stuff
like that and the SRC is our actual app
it stands for source
I believe the gates ignore is we're
going to talk about git later which is a
version control system but with the gate
ignore contains is stuff that we don't
want to have checked into version
control don't worry too much if you
don't understand what that is we'll talk
about that later and then there is the
package package of JSON package JSON
don't worry about packaged up locked up
JSON for now
package JSON years from this perspective
you can view it as a list of the
dependents
is that the project has which is they my
dependencies I mean the NPM modules that
we are using so you see here that there
are react and react dome and react
scripts listed under dependencies we are
probably at some point going to pull in
pull in some more dependencies but yeah
just to give you an idea about what
package drop JSON is and the readme is
just some information about files so
should we try to edit this in some way
yes exactly
so yes go into the project here and find
some place where that stuff is defined
okay in the app GIS here is here some
code we see the text welcome to react
here just change that to something else
like that yeah and I just save it yeah
and it should live update automatically
yes it did
so this is also one of the nice parts
that create react app gives you over
fiddling around and creating this this
application skeleton on your own it
gives you this live reloading thing
which will just update while you're
editing and that is very very nice to
have you can do that yourself of course
but this gives you all of that good
stuff
packaged in a nice format it should also
be noted that create react app is
provided by Facebook themselves who are
building react which means that a lot of
people use this so it's very well
documented very well tested and very
Google Bowl so you can always when
you've run into problems with it you can
generally Google those problems so the
first thing I notice is that we're in
the app js5 and here's something that
looks like JavaScript and it's mixed
with HTML what we're seeing here is JSX
which can be kind of simplified into I
think you can think of it as HTML and
JavaScript and CSS mixed this is
something that takes some time to get
emotionally used to because it was an
era in web development that we are
slowly moving away
from that I grew up with as well where
it was mixing HTML and JavaScript and
CSS that was against the law
you like punishable by death react does
away with that we won't be delving too
much into why you there's a lot of
reading and a lot of Reese could
reasoning behind that but we won't won't
spend time with it in for our intensive
purposes you either have to choose to
just accept it or go to go do some
reading on why they've done that design
decision this gives us the benefits of
for instance if you see here the logo
here we can just this is imported from
an SVG we and we can just use it
straight here it will also allow allow
us to use variables inside of inside of
our HTML let's call it hello and then
name and by the way as you see here this
is a feature of great react up that as I
type here it will automatically
recompile and it will give me very very
nice nice error messages in the browser
so it gives you this very nice
development flow so it sets unexpected
use of name and that is because I'm
using a variable that doesn't exist
which I can define here I'm gonna call
it name so you might be used to using
var here for variables in modern
JavaScript you use let's instead of what
bar we are gonna call that David and
it's hopefully going to recompile now
and no yes come on we compile no no no
okay now it's recompile did not you
don't have to use that in this oh yeah
yeah yeah I'm being very templating
exactly
there's no dollar sign you just use
templates
it's not a template line it is not a
template language it is just a place
where you can put JavaScript so the
these curly brackets they allow you to
put any JavaScript in between so this is
not
yes X is not really templating it's not
a templating language it is very it is
just JavaScript and HTML there are some
subtle differences in JSX such as the
fact that you you say class name instead
of class for CSS classes but apart from
that and a few other very minor things
what you see is going to be just
JavaScript and HTML there's no special
templating syntax or plug-in structure
or anything like that which you will see
in in handlebars or other templating
language is just HTML and JavaScript
another thing that is strange in JSX is
that we use inline Styles a lot which is
another thing that is often referred to
as illegal as hell in web development
circles so this style inline style this
is probably what you have seen and what
your you're used to but in react you
don't do it this way instead you pass
objects to the style to the style
attribute so if you watch on the line
above you see that we are we are passing
an object a logo then in logo variable
so what you've done now is that you have
created a space for for some JavaScript
with the curly brackets but inside the
curly brackets you have not written
valid JavaScript oh so I have to add an
object exactly so it's there are more
once again curly exactly so this is
again just normal JavaScript oh yeah so
it's like the first set of of Curly's
they start saying oh this is a space for
javascript and then the next curly
brackets or defining that this is now a
JavaScript object and I
don't have the variable greens precisely
and I'll just make something up here
it's not green yeah no it's very dark
[Laughter]
yeah yeah all right
I'm colorblind anyways doesn't matter
all right so let's do some JavaScript
here I just change that very the
variable name green to color instead
color yeah cool so yeah that makes a bit
more sense I'm gonna show you a pretty
neat trick because in in you see on line
13 here that we now have this kind of
unnecessary assignment it is like okay
the color is color it's it just that's
not it's very repetitive yeah it seems
like to me that the computer should be
able to figure that out on its own and
it actually can so you can just remove
the colon colon here and the other color
this yeah exactly
oops and it will still work oh because
it figures out that is within the style
attribute so the value there is a color
and thus it will just create CSS color
of it yeah exactly
okay let's play around a little bit with
this just to show that this is just
normal JavaScript let's pull this out
yeah sure so here we'll have the object
and I just moved the object here yeah
you can call that uh let's call that
header style instead of color yeah yeah
cool and just to show that the the color
green that is just a normal JavaScript
dollar object let's call that let's add
some other property as well make it
italic or something
and how do I write that I have no idea
just type some some CSS that you know
font size 50 pixels yes
reloading okay wow that looks so pretty
beautiful again this is hard to deal
with for some web developers because
they have been told for years and years
and years that this is bad it has been
drilled into them but this is actually
fantastic because as you see here we are
using javascript in place of where we
would need a completely new language for
instance this in C it is not possible to
in CSS CSS does not have variables but
javascript has variables so we are just
we are just pulling in green here as a
variable we don't need less or any
special CSS transpiling thingamabob
we're just using javascript and HTML and
CSS if you look at line 5 here we see a
little bit of a hint that this is a
component that we talked a little bit
about components before and this is
something that we are going to see a lot
about lot more about in the next episode
yeah because in the next episode we will
actually implement the sketch we drew
here and we will start to code things up
so see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
