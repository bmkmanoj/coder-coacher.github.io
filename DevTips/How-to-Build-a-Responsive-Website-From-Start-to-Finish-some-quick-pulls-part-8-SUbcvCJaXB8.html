ha I was just watching this guy on
YouTube I want to give you this quick
video today about the things that are
going on in the github repo people are
still submitting poll requests and
things are getting awesome more than
ever I wanted to reserve next Monday's
video to get started really on the
portfolio section of the site like if we
don't get to it we'll never get to it
so we're just going to start next Monday
on the portfolio section whether there
are more pull requests or not but in the
meantime or just want to share a really
quick pull request or two with you guys
right now to highlight some of the
awesome things that are happening in the
dev tips community and the cool things
you guys are doing with the project as
it is where we are on the dev tips
github page and we're going to go into
the artist theme repo now for the artist
theme we have two outstanding pull
requests one of them is called omit the
protocol portion so here in the CSS I
request a a font for L from google fonts
and I put HTTP in front of the forward
slash and this pull request just takes
that HTTP away his comment is but this
will prevent a mixed content issues and
result in minor file size savings quite
quite minor naturally and then kinging
123 pipes and and says when you're
running it on local server it helps out
a little bit so this pull request is
from me crow B me crow B so that's a
great commit and I don't have any
problem with accepting that and for the
second commit here Buddha has basically
gone into my bedroom and cleaned it up
and did my laundry when I wasn't looking
so it looks like I had a bunch of cruft
mean useless code left over from all the
changes we've had lately and he claimed
kind of cleans it up for me
right here this document logo HTML was
useless because we had switched over to
using an SVG and we have also there was
a weird CSS thing that put in an S right
here after 305 300 so that wasn't
working now and then also the background
pink M the M got stuck on there somehow
but we don't want pink either anyway so
cleans up this line cleans up this line
quite a little bit gets rid of this face
as I change my face but thrid of the
alternative background here see it this
commit is just a bunch of cleaning up
and deleting old things and kind of just
keep in keeping with keeping house quite
messy thing all except that commit to so
this is again just a really quick video
to show you guys appreciation Buddha and
micro-b and for everybody who commented
on these commits and for everybody who's
forking and starting actually while I
have you let me show you this we have
these 15 people or have starred the
artist 8 which means that they are
following it for changes and they're
definitely keeping tabs on the project
that we're all doing so that's really
cool to me
the people who are watching this and
starring it and forking it and kind of
keeping tabs you guys are going to know
about the updates before the videos drop
on Monday because I'm updating the
github account as soon as I'm done
coding and so that's I know I just want
to say thanks to everybody who's doing
that and look forward to the video on
Monday in which we start coding at that
portfolio section I'm really excited
about that
all right guys talk to you soon keep on
hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
