is the last video of the three for today
it's actually Monday morning right now I
hope to get these videos all edited put
together and sent out at my usual
schedule at Monday at 8 o'clock so I
only have a few hours to get them all
ready and this is it's pretty fun but
right now we're going to jump in and do
another narration of the the coding that
I've been doing for the past two days of
the landing pages and home pages of dev
tips show calm ah as I start there the
first thing that I'm going to be doing
is trying to get that big splash of
color across the top of the header the
first thing I do is export a yellow SVG
which is which makes sense because that
was how I did it in the design in when I
was using sketch but it quickly changed
that idea instead of doing a yellow SVG
to doing a white SVG at the bottom that
we cut off a yellow div that way I could
I could quickly change or grow or shrink
the size of the background now I ended
up not using an SVG at all that happens
later on when I realized that the way it
scales is not what I want but right here
in the video it's an SVG and there's a
video on top of it as kind of like a
video header and I've also placed the
logo and the little three bars for the
other menu now what you see here in the
layout on the top left I have the code
I'm using atom code editor and you're
going to have to like maybe make this
fullscreen to see all the details of the
press pause a lot or something to see
how I'm writing a code but I'm using my
project setup is I'm using Jade for the
code templating and like using the
includes and and markup from Jade and
then on the bottom left this is actually
the sketch file some referencing the
design as I'm building and on the other
on the the whole half of the right is
the is the is the resulting code now I'm
using code kit to power the auto refresh
and the you know Jade compiling in the
SAS compiling I'm starting with the the
dev tips starter kit and I removed a lot
of junk that you didn't see already
before I started recording and but it's
basically the dev tip starter kit and
going in there I switched the font from
fire to Roboto and a few other things so
this videos moving along quite quickly
um so in so I have done I'm in like the
third or fourth section now I've done
the about dev tips I've done the listing
of videos and I'm I'm a little unsure
about the design of a listing of those
videos I think that I'm gonna have to go
in like later on it and maybe spruce up
the design add those thumbnails do
whatever
right now I'm designing the the module
that's the jQuery course sign-in page
including the form now I have to give a
big shout out to Timo super Husain
Tyrell and a few other people that
helped me to get the form sending the
way I wanted it to especially because in
the next page as you saw there's like
those two forms on the same page and
they're like sending each other's each
other's inputs for a while so you know
and that's the nice thing like I had I
was having this problem like stressed
out about it so I just go on to the dev
tips chat and I'm like hey what do you
guys think about this am i doing this
right and
you know they're just so lovely and
helpful that's the nice thing about
having a great resource like the dev
tips community chat though you just go
in there and have them be like oh you
know you should actually rewrite it this
way and help you to optimize things
great resource so I want to give a shout
out to those people who help me right
now I'm looking at Jade and looking at
never way to to write what am i doing
actually oh right now I'm doing the
second page so see now I have a blue
header it was important to me to make
sure that the header is versatile enough
depending on what page you're on so on
the home page where the header is the
yellow color is going to be bigger so
the video can sit on top of it and then
on this one you see how though the blue
is going up and down and trying to get
it just right that I want it to be
different between the pages the pages
because the blue is going to look look a
little differently right now I'm still
using that SVG white as the angle and
it's like having a problem when it gets
bigger it looks bigger when it's bigger
eventually I switch it to a big div that
I rotating you'll see that in a little
bit but in this portion here I have
those two forms and on the jQuery page
so this is the pic the blue kind of page
that we're looking at right now is is
what's the oil it's a dev tip show.com
slash jQuery course and that's going to
be the landing page so that it's
different than the home page the home
page is a multi-purpose kind of
catch-all what is dev tips how does it
work here a few examples but the landing
page is very specific it's this is what
you're here for this is the benefits of
this corpse that I'm trying to sell
and here we go so the thumbnails that I
have here are pretty fun I have them in
a box and there's three of the children
in the box mmm and I'm aligning the
first one to the top right or top left
second one the line to the middle and
third one to the top or the bottom right
and okay now this this portion here that
I'm in I'm trying to design a different
layout for what it looks like when
you're on a desktop because I thought
this image way too big as I showed you
in the design I'm still not too happy
with it I mean like with the current
design it looks a lot like what the
sketch design was but I think that I can
do a little bit better of a job when I
get to the code in the next few days
like after I upload this video I'll
probably be tweaking all this a lot a
lot especially like those thumbnails
right like they're supposed to be a
representational overs videos that I'm
going to be making this week and
publishing next Monday all right
starting next Monday and but I don't
have those videos yet and so I'm have to
figure something out maybe I'll make
like a really short video right now but
it's like oh um you should wait for them
or something I don't know right now in
the video I'm making the the menu
it's a slide-out menu there's a little
mini of the top left and then you click
it it kind of like slides out and then
there's like the four or five options
home go to YouTube go watch the videos
jQuery course and the last one is the
patron go to learn more about becoming a
patron joining the community and um each
of them got a unique icon and
you know what these these mic right here
I'm making a unique patron icon patreon
icon and sizing it right export
exporting it as an SVG I wanted
everything to be SVG so it's like nice
and crisp and looks really good with
your arm like a retina or using the damn
or whatever so all those are placed and
I'm just making sure that the menu works
in both mobile and desktop versions and
it looks like we're done now so what's
what's cool is that it's all coated up
and ready to go i coated up the form so
they would send and actually populate a
google spreadsheet just super convenient
for me because then I can decide how I
want to go about it and I can easily get
like a read on who signed up and how
many people there are and like what kind
of you know whatever so all that code is
is now it's wrapped up and it's
published at that if at Deb tips show
calm and the code repository itself is
on github as well there's a link in the
description of the three videos that
you're watching today so you can go to
that github and see all the code that I
did today that you just watched you can
also get a copy of the sketch file that
I use to design the layout of everything
and keep an eye on it for the next few
days maybe next week or two because I'll
be like adjusting and editing the design
of this webpage the whole while but it
looks like we're done with these three
videos for today
they is quite an exciting weekend and I
hope that we all learn something or at
least it was entertaining so thank you
so much for watching if you're
interested in any of the things that
we've been talking a lot about for these
videos for example the the code the
jQuery course that we're going to be
doing the way it's going to work is I'm
going to make three videos in the next
three weeks titled learn jQuery in 15
minutes and those are going to be free
on YouTube and for everybody in this
course that I'm designing this landing
page for is going to be a more advanced
course where we're going to be diving
into specific projects not just jQuery
principles and how to how to understand
it but more like how to use it you know
on a project that you would use for your
clients and you get to keep those
projects and use them and you have the
full license to do whatever the heck you
want with them those are the courses
that I'm building and going to be
marketing for for sale also if you're
interested in in the dev tips community
we have an awesome community of people
who are just eager and willing to learn
in to help and just to be friends like
not only not only are they a great
resource for like if you can't figure
out how to do XYZ but also like if you
just need somebody to talk to about real
life issues or just hang out and share
cat gifts I mean we have a live
community a live chat room that's going
on 24/7 and we have monthly live hangout
that I host and then also there's a
community driven hangout that usually
happens about once a week which is
pretty cool a lot of other perks as well
thank you guys for your your watching
these videos it's super awesome that you
do that have a happy Monday I'll see you
in about four or five hours</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
