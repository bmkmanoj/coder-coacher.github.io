deaf kids wanting to make a really quick
video to say thanks for watching
yesterday's video it was really long and
what I actually want to do is get your
feedback on that video it was a half an
hour long video and talked about coding
a responsive HTML template so the thing
that I'm working on mentally emotionally
is it it's just such a long video and it
was wondering anything kind of if you
get stuck through with it if you liked
it that long some of you have commented
already did that it was fine Chris
dizzle MP shift and lucky boy Sunday
thank you so much for your encouragement
really appreciate that stuff but for you
guys who don't normally comment or
things i want to know what you thought
if you don't use the comment use hanging
out wash that's cool but your opinion
matters to me as well yes maybe leave a
comment if you don't know what I'm
talking about there's a there's a video
here that describes some of the
principles involved in making a
responsive HTML template and and there's
also a video which in which I code from
scratch the HTML required for this email
so if you don't know what I'm talking
about check those out this one's a half
hour long this one's like four minutes
and I'm still working on my approach to
this type of a video but i think that i
will continue to make a little bit more
long-form ones and show you guys how I
approach things and actually see me code
a lot of what I've been doing has been
teaching you principles which is
important but i think i'm going to go
over practical skills with you a lot
more in the near future yeah thank you
so much for watching and i really want
to know what your opinions are on the
subject please leave a comment
down below here guys will talk to you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
