is deficits you're watching video 5.2 in
a series I call I was figuring to call
it it's called design and code my
personal website in 12 hours so this is
5.2 ah
in the first hour we use Jade and SAS to
build up this header here on the side of
the design now we're going to return to
that same design and make sure that this
this works across all devices making it
responsive sounds simple enough right
let's get into it
I want to make this header responsive
okay as a sidebar header we have to be
really really careful to take care of it
you know when it comes to time to look
at this design on different smaller
devices so what I want to do is when the
browser shrinks in I want this header
header not to be a vertical strip but a
horizontal strip across the top with the
disclosable navigation this navigation
won't fit in a bar across the top okay
so let's get started with that how do we
do that
first I'm going to go into my home dot
SAS okay so this display wrap is keeping
it display flex which means that's
what's giving us our columns so we need
to choose a width that would be
appropriate to break at now I'm thinking
about my columns here as I go back to my
design these columns are 300 pixels wide
they have 20 pixels in the middle and
then there's 300 pixels wide again so
this hold two columns is 620 wide and
then we have an additional 135 so the
max width that our design needs to be to
accommodate the design that we've set
forth you know and we'll probably put
another 10 pixels on the side here so
that'll be 10 that will be 10 that will
be 640 plus 135 which is 775 so we need
to make something happen when the
browser gets 775 wide or smaller than 77
why so we go to home wrap and we'll say
Media will use a media query here max
with equals 7/7 five pixels wide
something is going to happen well we
want to take this this display flex and
say display:block and that will cancel
out the columns let's save that and put
this in inspection mode go put it on
mobile mode and then we'll shrink this
up past seven seven five here is seven
seven five okay that kind of worked we
have the design I mean the header
collapsed which is good but we still
have like the what's it called the
header positioner whatever I called it
which is keeping everything fixed to the
left so we need to go into our header
dots as get that header position and
take care of that so I'm just going to
go to the bottom to this all of this
code of the header cuz there's a lot of
things I want to change and I'll say at
media max width of seven seven five
pixels alright what's going to happen
below seven seven five pixels well the
first selector we need to take care of
its home wrap header and the home wrap
header currently has a defined width of
135 pixels wide but it needs to be
completely as white as it can be so
we'll reset that with two auto there now
it goes across all the way across the
top see that white bar there good I will
place some padding on the top and bottom
and then but not on the right and left
it was 30 now let's put it at 20 so now
that we have that set let's take care of
this positioner what was it called again
header position positioner and instead
of position fix it needs to be
positioned relative was that the right
name oh not position
it's position okay relative now the
whole navigation can be inside of that
instead of fixed to the viewport will
reset all of these dimensions right so
top zero right this is it Auto yeah
bottom auto left auto and we wish we're
still flexing everything right so
everything is flexed in columns so we
want to tink that flex direction and
just change into rows so now the
navigation is next to the logo and
that's what we want good good good and
then we can vertically align these
things we're using our flex box by
saying align items
Center the other thing I want to do is
really get rid of these things right get
rid of this navigation get rid of that
email link so I'll go into here and say
dot site nav and dot email link
display:none okay why do I have this
that's three T is bottom auto okay
that's why so the reason it was not
positioned right is because the bottom
was not being overridden and it was
still 30 pixels from the bottom but now
being positioned is relative it was just
scooting it all up okay so now it's
positioned relative and all of the top
bottom and left's are reset everything
is just kind of normal right here but I
think that this logo is a little big so
let's go to logo now remember that we
set the height of the logo and that
constrained that concerning to at 80
pixels tall so let's just kind of
a something smaller sixty pixels maybe
45 remember this has got to look good on
a phone let me show you what a phone
looks like here's iPhone five right so
if it's if it's going to be 80 again
that's going to be too big on a phone so
let's go to 45 look nice I think
okay cool now I want to have over here a
menu icon kind of but we can have the
icon ready so we just make it on our own
so we'll go into the header got Jade and
just add a new element right under that
the email link called mobile nav and
it's just the toggle right once you
click this element you'll be able to
check out the navigation for the mobile
site let's think here so let's go now we
have a save we have an element okay now
let's go back into our header document
and start thinking about how this mobile
nav will look so I'll say mobile nav
toggle that we called it mobile nav
toggle I want it to be like those three
lines right so let's say the width we 50
pixels and the height we're going to
focus on that center line to first is a
two pixels and the back ground ground
background should be three three three
okay okay okay width is 50 that doesn't
look like 50 does it
Oh because it's display flex but the
width of this menu or the header header
position needs to be because I remember
I sized the second okay so with remember
right I put the 135 on the position the
header - position element because I
couldn't figure out why I was jumping
out so we need to overwrite that with -
to be auto as well okay that's a little
odd
so Tien is in the middle and that now
the reason this is jumping out into the
middle is because the the width is not
being constrained so I'll go up into the
normal logo and I'll just say max width
so we want it to get smaller if it needs
to we'll say that's that original
dimensions of 135 okay cool
so now we have the we're going to see
here logo is 135 and the mobile yeah 50
pixels okay
that's what I wanted I want this line to
be 50 pixels let's go where is that okay
50 pixels and I'll say margin right on
it move it away from the left or the
right edge about 20 pixels looks good
okay now I want to UM have three lines
here I put some and well I just realized
something
if I do a high of two pixels the targets
only going to be those two pixels so let
me know I want to be like a span in
there or something like that okay and I
want to be the whole size so width and
height is going to be 50 pixels and the
back ground want to see it so let's make
it pink okay so that's what we want
50 by 50 move it away from the side
so I so I was making the whole thing
talk to pixels tall that was the problem
I need the target area for your finger
to be bigger than two pixels right
you'll never hit that with your fat
finger so let's put a span inside of
this here in that span will be
display:block that span and span before
and span after all right so the content
will allow the span to to LA the
before-and-afters to exist as visual
elements in the DOM and display block
height and background we're all set okay
so there's there should be like six
pixels right here at the top and I need
to distribute these elements across so
let's go over to mmm
needs to be in the center we can just
make this display flex line items Center
yep that's what I'm okay so a line item
center display flex and those are
centered so okay now I have to move the
lines of away from each other so I'll
make them opposition relative and then
span before you can get a top of 10
pixels and span after and get a bottom
of 10 pixels oh space here
aha so now we have those three lines but
they're uneven and weird
are you uneven and weird I'm going to
move it up two pixels to accommodate for
its own dimension because it's too pixel
tall so it was like it didn't look right
is it does it still look right here let
me trim this pink off
where are you pink it looks pretty good
is that good enough let's say 15 pixels
and that would make this 17 pixels right
that looks better that looks better
where's that pink that was good okay so
somebody will click on that and let's
see our other navigation Oh
so it's still here so we need to turn
this off mobile nav toggle needs to be
by default display:none
and then when we go into this what's it
called into the media query home wrap
header display block
I put it display flex all right so just
take this off I guess and then not
display:block down here but display flex
okay so let's shrink this up and see if
our mobile nav shows up there it is
that's a good size right good good size
for a mobile nav and we need to put on
our mobile nap toggle we'll need a
cursor:pointer let's do some cool
animations I think when we're hovering
over it so this will be fun when we're
on our site and however I want this span
to be background to be transparent right
there we go okay so what we wanted to
see was honor to see that little dude
disappear and we can take the other one
all right now we want to we have the
we're saying when we're targeting over
the mobile nav target take the
before-and-after of the span and do
something to them and I want to
transform them so transform
- origin Center and a transform rotate
let's say 45 degree degrees save yep
that's what we wanted so I want to form
an X so I have to go in there and say oh
yeah it is rotated 45 degrees that's
cool but also I need to the top to be
now zero so before we use bottom here
let's use
top and just say negative 17 now okay
now they're just right up next to each
other but I want to rotate this other
one here rotate it the other way around
rotate it negative 45 degrees boom like
that what do you say we put some ma put
some transition on it so the transition
all over 0.3 seconds and ease in out
that's cool you guys like that that's
cool I like it if I did before here
maybe it would kind of come from the
other side okay so that's a good
navigation there now I have to make a
navigation actually that will be a
mobile nav right cuz I remember I hid
the other one and the reason I hid it is
because it was causing my header to grow
and I don't want my header to grow I
want an AB to kind of like either show
up somewhere else or I don't haven't
really planned up kind of just working
through it right now because you see
that I designed for a design for a kind
of a desktop view not a mobile view so
I'm kind of making this other stuff but
stuff up as I go
which is fine nothing wrong with that
but we just have to make ideas happen
right now
so let's go in the header Jade like
above the header right cuz I don't want
it to be inside the header and I want to
be mobile Neve and then I'll say is open
because I want to change the state that
would mobile mobile open so this is open
class will change the state
of its visibility right because we want
to start it being hidden and then and
then when somebody clicks on this
navigation menu icon here it will it
will show you a it will show you the
mobile nav right so let's decide what
the mobile Navia is well the mobile nav
is basically just a same thing as this
so let's X let's copy that go above
mobile nav and create a mix in the mix
in is called nav content now why did I
do that
I did that so I could have one central
place to change the content of the nav
and it's similar to like an import right
or a partial I want to have one place to
change so if later on I'm like oh oh I
don't want to about here and change it
here it will show up here and where did
I take that from so plus plus nav
content I hope that worked at okay so
the nav content is still there aren't
you yeah and then I want the nav content
also to show up in the mobile nav so
let's save that let the let the page
refresh and then when we okay when we go
to mobile
okay the nav content is still there
because I don't have it turned off by
default right so I the mobile nav is
what it's called so let's go into the
header again I have a mobile net argyll
here's going to be our mobile nav and
it's not inside the header right it is
inside the home wrap maybe I'll just
intent these things
so that I can put the mobile nav inside
of the head wrap okay so I'm going to
indent these all and that's how you nest
with SAS love it if this was scss I've
been futzing with these nested brackets
for years because they get so cluttery
okay so in the home wrap I have this
thing called mobile nav very similar to
the the desktop now it'll be like a
style list list - style none margin:0
padding:0 okay and also I want it to be
display:none yeah and then if we're on
media so if we're if the mobile nav is
available when I say mobile nav is open
is open then display block we should
meet all those conditions right now
oh no so when it goes to mobile and our
nav is open do I have it is open oh I'm
indented Oh see it's wrong inventions
okay so do the same thing that it did
above there okay now there we go okay so
I get that specificity right son now
let's style how this navigation should
look when it's visible so we're going to
do that right here the Allies which
don't need to be indented can be text
aligned
Center I like it and then margin my
bottom 10 pixels very similar to what we
had in the other one but it's centered
and a little bit different so the mobile
nav will be positioned absolute and the
width be 100% okay and background white
and let's move that down from the top
padding I'll say it let's move it
30 pixels from the top it doesn't matter
right and left and then just add 20
pixels on the bottom because we already
have margin on the bottom of the UL or
the Allies so that looks good now they
might be saying I go it looks like it's
just inside of the header but it's not
it's not and what that means is that we
can get rid of the easier like in an
animated way and it won't kind of screw
up so if this was by the way if this was
in the header remember how we centered
then the logo and the navigation there
we did it with display flex so these
would be aligned item Center they would
they would the whole header would grow
we don't want that even though it looks
kind of like visually like oh the header
just grew that's fine if it looks like
that but the effect of having that logo
in that navigation toggle still there
and not moving that's what we want oh I
just realized that hover is the wrong
thing here we don't want it to hover we
want it to be and class of is
open yeah it was fine to do however
while we were kind of like developing it
so we can quickly see what it would look
like but own this is what we don't want
this to be turned into an X on hover no
no no we want it to turn into X when
everything is open and it will just turn
into an X you click on it and then it
will turn back into the three lines not
on however so is open is a class that
will put on it with JavaScript later on
when the navigation actually gets open
it ok so now we need to bring this
mobile now down in up and kind of why I
just want to flex slide in from the top
so what we'll do is we go to the mobile
nav at the top and say transform
translate Y Capital y negative 100% and
that will just make it go up right like
it's kind of off the canvas right there
and then transition transition is the
animation we want it to say all over the
course of 0.3 seconds left 3 seconds and
E is in out now that means we have to
put the ending state in is open so I be
trans form translate y 0% see how it
just scoot it on down there on down the
path that's what we want so let's go
into our header Jade remove is open I'm
pretty happy with the design of it I
think that we need to work on the
functionality of it later on out I don't
need to worry about it right now
probably when I do the click and it
Scrolls to then I'll also do the click
and it'll open it and stuff all at once
but right now we're good we did a
navigation we did a menu what is this
thing called the header which does on
the side and then when you scroll
past certain specific dimensions for the
design that we built which is the two
columns plus each other plus some
margins plus the sidebar and it will
turn from a side header to a top header
with a navigation here that cool
animates into an X and the navigation
can come down from the top that's all
built in structured and styled we need
to make it functional later on but right
now it's done I really like the way that
turned out all right
so in the next part of this hour we're
going to make a grid for the rest of the
design using flexbox so tune in for that
and now for the end of the video what I
plug other things I'm doing and ask you
