as I mentioned in the introduction we're
working off of a wireframe and I have
that right here it's just a little
thumbnail it's not even very big that I
can blow up and inspect all the nuances
which I think maybe is a nice thing
because I don't want to get bogged down
in the details I just really want to and
I just really want to explore the
bootstrap grid now you may have tuned in
on last Friday and if you're watching
this video a long time from now check
out this video that you see a thumbnail
for over there somewhere and in that
video I discuss Jade do you even Jade
bro I thought that was made me laugh
anyway um I discuss Jade Jade is a
templating language that we're using to
build our markup now I'm again I found
out about it yesterday I'm so excited or
the night before are so excited about it
that I made a video on on a Friday which
is not common for me usually I'm posting
on Mondays and Mondays nearly only but
this was so exciting I couldn't I just
made this quick 20 minutes planation of
what I found and what I plan to use it
for so I'm going to use Jade in this
video right here I'm going to see it a
little bit deeper because I'm going to
be actually putting it through the
ringer as we make this layout instead of
just explaining a few basic principles
of it so that's exciting too and how I'm
going to use Jade is I'm using code kit
code kit is a application for the Mac
there's also pre pros which will do this
as well and pre pros is for the Mac and
for Windows I put this project here in
code Kay IRAs only two files there's an
index Jade and then code kit will will
crunch that index Jade and output a
index.html so let me show you exactly
what I mean and see where it says hello
here in this container and it says hello
here in this div I'm going to change
that to was
that and then when I save it it'll input
that content into that div right there
and we're just got new content now and
we have a simpler way to do that here on
the left and the output is on the right
so instead of just showing you the
inputs and outputs what I'm going to be
doing now is I'm going to clear this
body tags here and I'm going to start
fresh and I'm going to build a
completely new layout I'm going to build
this thumbnail into a full layout using
the bootstrap grid and adding to it a
little bit with my own CSS where needed
but hopefully as as minimally as
possible because I just want to explore
bootstrap for you guys and with you guys
I have already imported the this link
here which is a stylesheet to bootstrap
and I did that in the video that was
that came out on Friday and now I'm just
I'm just ready to go I'm a little bit
nervous I'm excited let me save here now
we're gonna have an empty body on the
right now when you're using code kit
code kit can also not only render your
files and new but it can it can do a
live reloading kind of session it's
really cool so I'm going to press this
preview button here on code kit and it's
going to open up a new window and notice
the name is my iMac a local host kind of
thing it's basically creating a server
similar to what you would see at the
local host and 5757 so this is all I can
auto refresh as soon as I type in my
codes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
