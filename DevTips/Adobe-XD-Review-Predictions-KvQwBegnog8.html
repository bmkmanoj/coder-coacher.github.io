your beautiful faces in theory you know
cuz I'm looking at a camera lens right
now ah before we start I want to thank
everyone who tuned in to Adobe's live
stream this week and blew up the chat on
Twitch some of the jokes and memes that
popped up were epic like the camera in
the lazer whales which made their way
into other streams also we had three
days of UX content all hours of the day
it was fun some tense but it was fun I
had my camera with me the whole time so
I'll be putting together a vlog video
and show you guys what goes on behind
the scenes there it's all good stuff so
I spent so much time on and off the
camera working on those presentations
that I totally neglected to make a
regular video for Monday so I went to
the dev tips chat and I said hey I need
some ideas for a quick video on Monday I
have nothing my mind is mush right now
and they said talk about Adobe XD it's a
hot topic right now and we want to know
your real thoughts on the app so that's
what this is and that's what I want to
do I want to kind of summarize the
opinions that have been seeing on the
internet the past few days and give you
my own unbiased opinion and then give
you some advice on how you should
approach new applications like this in a
world where there is a new app every day
do we need to stop and learn everything
should you rearrange your workflows just
yet and just what is the best tactic for
switching to something like this finally
I want to give you some of my opinions
about the future of XD and the emergent
marketplace of experience and
prototyping of design tools how is that
for a preamble this is my microphone
let's get into it so just to catch you
up last week Adobe released its
application that was codenamed project
comment the actual release name is Adobe
experience design or Adobe XD now
they're planning on everyone just
calling it XD the overall opinion on the
Internet is that the name comet is just
a way better name it's expressive it
feels fast and impactful which is really
representational of the application
itself the app feels fast and like you
know the internet also thinks that XD is
a bad name because experience design is
a discipline not a piece of software
it's like I don't know if QuickBooks was
called a
counting can you imagine that hey you do
Texas yeah oh yeah I used accounting
it's kind of weird right it has like a
weird like feel in your mouth so not
only is experience design a weird name
for an application in general I think
the name is kind of misleading it's
graphic software and I believe that
experience design is not exclusive to
people that make pictures but to
everyone that's involved in the user or
the customer experience from the
receptionist that greets you and you
walk into the business to the sales
person that helps you find the solution
to your problem or you know the person
on the other side of the phone call at
the the call center is just as much an
experienced designer as the person who
laid out the interface some kind of
really tired of hearing the phrase UI /
UX like like it's one thing UI UX just
kind of bundled in together with like
one word of a job description it's it I
don't know I'm just ranting but it's
kind of lazy you know what I mean just
like not only is it lazy it's freaking
it's inaccurate and we as an industry
are just doing ourselves a big
disservice by talking like that so so
yeah I don't really like the name when I
first heard it I was confused and then
quickly after that I was annoyed so
that's just the name I you know let's
talk quickly and summarize the reactions
of the internet people and just throw my
own spin on that pile of opinions that
you have likely already heard most the
responses are either it's cool but it's
not ready for primetime or it sucks I'm
not going to use it I'm going to stick
with X or yeah my take on Adobe XD I
think it's fantastic I really love it I
acknowledge that it's not a production
ready app there are some glaring
omissions from the tool sets and a lot
of them are in the typography category
like being able to set line Heights or
character specific styles like if you
have a paragraph that is like
font-weight regular you can't just bold
one word and there are other things too
like gradients and layers that are
missing a lot of people want the layers
panel but you know I think is kind of
good that Adobe is dragging its feet on
a layers panel I personally would want a
better solution to that kind of archaic
paradigm to me the sketch layers panel
kind of feels like a hindrance every
time I have to use it I just hate using
it
and I think that I think that
illustrators layer pannel is like kind
of like the closest to the right idea
but I'd like to see like the next level
of that you know maybe just I'd like a
like a dynamic group inspector that
shows up only when you double-click
inside a group I like the way the
illustrator handles groups like the
isolation mode is pretty sweet anyway
yes there are a lot of missing pieces to
the puzzle but all the people talking
about those things are really missing
one important thing and that is that
this feels like for the first time we're
looking at the right puzzle right so let
me explain Photoshop was my web design
tool for years and most of the people
that have been doing this for more than
like three years can tell you the exact
same story this was a tool designed for
photographers
it's a photo editing tool there were a
few of us who used illustrator as a
website design tool and that shift
happened kind of around the same time
that Apple popularize the high density
displays with their retina iPhones now
illustrators seem like a really good
answer because it's a
resolution-independent vector-based
drawing tool so like designing it 2x was
kind of the same thing as designing at
1x was it just made sense and in recent
years there's been a big competitor of
adobe of course I'm talking about sketch
but under the same lens of thinking
about what it's for we see that sketch
is just another appropriated tool sketch
started out as a competitor to
illustrator it was a simple vector
drawing tool the name sketch makes its
intention obvious it wasn't until sketch
twos dot something that the makers of
sketch realized that they they stumbled
upon an unsatisfied market and kind of
started to develop specifically for UI
designers and then with sketch 3 it
became for the first time a real threat
to Adobe's kind of stranglehold on the
UI design market now I'm a recent
switcher to sketch it wasn't until I
started working at Google a few months
ago that I was kind of forced to learn
it really well everyone in the office
uses it so adapter diet and now that
I've really committed to learning sketch
I gotta say
I get it right I like it it's really
good but ask anyone who's been using it
for a while it's been a long and winding
road the updates are kind of often iffy
and things break all the time and it
still relies on a few outdated models of
thinking but what it did do that I loved
was to scare Adobe it showed them that
they needed to really dig in and
understand a market that they assumed
that they understood and now we have a
new product on the horizon from Adobe we
get comet or Adobe XD as it's now called
XD's biggest asset right now is speed
this thing was built from the ground up
to be fast and if you think about an
interaction designers workflow the
number one thing that we really need is
actually speed it's such an obvious
feature that we don't even give it much
attention because we just assume it
should be there but we definitely notice
when it's not XD is fast and stable look
at this this example I have right here I
have 200 artboards open at one time and
XD feels like it's not even flinching
it's just smooth and rock-solid I'm
zooming in and panning quickly
everything seems to be just humming
along fine comparatively Skitch feels
kind of delicate here are the same 200
artboards open up on sketch and it
chokes a bit right the artboards take a
little bit to render it's not like it's
unusable but I'm just saying the project
managers that Adobe mentioned to me that
the reason XD has taken so long to come
to market is because they spent a lot of
time working on getting the rendering
engine right and they wanted it to be a
solid foundation for everything else
they built but now that that's complete
they can work faster bring us the tools
that we want and perfecting the ones
that we have they promise that we can
expect monthly feature releases so let's
talk about my future predictions okay so
given that the future is anyone's game
it always is but I have a few thoughts
on how this might play out and I'm gonna
start with a bit of history actually so
once upon a time in the 90s there was
this company called quark quark made a
piece of software called quark Express
some of you guys may know this story
quark Express was a page layout program
designers would use it to layout
multi-page documents
like books and magazines and brochures
and like all that Adobe also made a page
layout program called page maker it was
not really popular and at one point
court express held ninety-five percent
of the market can you believe that they
were basically printing money and at one
point the CEO of cork actually stated an
intention to purchase Adobe apparently
that made the Adobe executives mad and
as a response they launched a new
application called InDesign InDesign was
a direct competitor of quark they
launched and then quickly iterated they
gave free copies to print designers and
like ask them what they thought and they
listened to the feedback they made and
they made InDesign better very quickly
these days no one uses quark faster than
anybody could have guessed at the time
InDesign stormed the market and made it
so that quark was nothing more than a
distant memory on a side note when I was
researching for this for this video some
people were mentioning that it feels
like the roles have been reversed and
the InDesign is not innovating as
quickly as it used to when it was
fighting to be number one and now that
quark is back with a 2015 edition it
might get a little interesting anyway
you can kind of see history repeating
itself here there's a competitor sketch
and it's in some ways stealing market
share and in other ways it's defining it
keep in mind that US UI designers have
never really had our own software we've
hacked photography and drawing apps to
make them work for our needs but look at
Adobe's response they create a new
product they give it away to their
audience and solicit feedback they're
promising monthly iteration cycles they
want to pull an InDesign on sketch and I
say let them I just want better products
competition is healthy the more they try
to out-innovate each other the more the
community benefits so now my point of
view finally I think XD is cool a lot of
the innovations are really intuitive
adobe has done a great job with it I'm
extremely excited to watch it grow I'm
advice is to download it and to spend a
few hours getting to know it and you
know kind of get really comfortable with
it and then just move on with your life
it's actually really easy software to
learn because it's so feature bear it's
a preview product so just learn it and
then just like incrementally check in
every month or so when the updates come
out to see what they got cooking it's
always easier to follow updates on a
product than to learn new software from
scratch that's just truth so will I
change my workflow I don't know it
really depends on whatever everyone at
my team at Google is using because we
kind of jump into each other's files a
lot so but for my personal work yeah
why not I mean I really like it and for
whatever lacks in features I've been
able to find my way around those faults
until they update except the one thing
the missing line-height control that
really throws me off but but I did see
you know I was looking at the laptop of
one of the project managers while I was
at the Adobe offices and she had a
line-height tool in her version so I'm
thinking it's not that far off so this
has been my unbiased review of Adobe XD
I really like it I'm flattered and I'm a
thrilled that they asked me to be a part
of their launch they are really cool
group of people everyone that I met was
really nice and helpful I recorded a
bunch of stuff while I was visiting even
when we went out like after the show to
the bars and we went dancing I'll be
editing a vlog together this week so
look for that soon thank you so much for
watching this review and whether you
choose XD or sketch or you don't care
keep on hacking so did you guys like the
handheld microphone thing do ya you they
like command me wanna go home day me say
day me say day me say day me sir day yo
they let go man you wanna go
Cammisa tally man tally me banana
daylight come and me Wan go home day me
say day me say day me say day me say day
