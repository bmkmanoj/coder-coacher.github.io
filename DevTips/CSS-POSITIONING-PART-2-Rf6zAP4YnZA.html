video what's up everybody this is the
video to in the CSS positioning part 2
is a two video series okay
not even a series much it's just two
videos about it so in the first video we
looked at static and relative
positioning and that was relatively easy
to understand it's nothing too heavy
right there but today we're going to be
talking about absolute and fixed
positioning so let's jump into the code
I am just as a refresh my Dom looks like
this I have a paragraph and in that
paragraph I have a span around one of
these words and I called that word over
the class of me this div is called dad
because it was my parent element and
this div is called granddad because it's
it's another ancestor element okay let's
look at absolute positioning okay so I'm
gonna leave the background on there pink
so we can see what I'm doing okay see
I'm here I'm then annette test i am
going to make my position absolute and
now when I do this imma save and look
what happened my all the words just
compacted right on touch aren't right
onto each other right there and what
happened is when you take an element and
declare that it's absolutely positioned
element it is just like the effects of
it in terms of its dimensions are ripped
outside of the Dom the other elements
around it flow as if it's not F is as if
it was not there and also let me change
the background pink so you can see it
better it notice that it is on top of
its brother's right in terms of those
things that are all rounded little float
if they've just collapsed right under it
but it's on top is because it's
absolutely positioned now I did not yet
declare a directional statement a
directional property so we know that by
default it's Auto but let me show you
top
zero pixels and save we can see here
that me the pink element has jumped all
the way to the top of the window now why
did that happen well because when you
declare a directional property on a
absolutely positioned element it will be
positioned relative to its nearest
parent with a declared position
statement now we don't have one of those
so if you do not have or is if there is
none it will be declared relative to the
Dom the the document right so in this
case I saw I told it top zero that means
it's going to be no pixels from the top
it's pretty easy watch left a left 10 C
10 pixels from the left that makes a lot
of sense now I'm gonna go in here and
I'm going to grab my dad element
actually let me take I'm gonna go to dad
and I go to grandad grand and padding 50
pixels and back what I can't spell okay
um there you go I made my granddad 50
pixels of padding and a light blue
background so you could see what's going
on here I'm going to make granddad
position:relative and as soon as I do
that we can see that the absolutely
position child me I become relatively
positioned to are absolutely positioned
relative to the nearest parent that has
a declared position whether it's
relative absolute or fixed not static
because static is the default so it's
basically like not declaring anything so
if I go to my dad here
and I tell him to be positioned oops
caps lock a la div okay
look at that happen now it's jumped from
granddad who's still positioned relative
to my dad who is now positioned relative
and that is important to note that it's
your nearest ancestor right so if dad's
position relative and granddad is not
going to be granddad it's going to be
dad because he's closest to me in terms
of my ancestry that's cool let me show
you a few other things if I go to me
again and I say I already know that I'm
top zero in left 10 if I go right what's
gonna happen if I declare myself both
left and right 10 pixels boom goes all
the way across I'm going to move take
position away from dad so you can have a
better view of this look at that I'm 10
pixels from the left and I'm stretched
so I'm 10 pixels from the right and put
bottom on here to bottom of 10 and you
can see it's just stretching them out so
it's an interesting thing that you can
actually stretch out elements instead of
just saying even instead of declaring
their height and width you can use an
absolute absolute statement along with
the directional statements to kind of
stretch an element out to where it's
just like like a canvas right stretching
enough to cover and fulfill the
dimensions of its nearest positioned
declared ancestor in this case granddad
weird right cool okay so next I want to
talk about fixed position elements I'm
gonna make another element here just
down here do and I must style it in line
I know you're probably like I'm still oh
you're such an idiot but I don't care
watch a top M mm nope not top height and
give background
all right lime is fine do lime and with
five pixels anything okay all right now
what I've done is I've just made a
really tall div so that I can scroll
that's really all I've done so that's
why it's pretty good what I did in
length it's just weird like one-off kind
of thing and don't judge me okay you can
judge me I don't really care so here's
what we got going on we got a really
tall div so I can scroll I'm gonna go
into here and we go to me and I change
my positioning from absolute to fix yeah
whoa and take all these took all the
directions off too so it's similar to
the absolutely positioned element the
fixed element collapse causes the it
causes the things around it to collapse
as if you had no dimension no high or
width so when I make it fixed notice
that the other elements go right under
it as well it's kind of pulled out of
the of the flow of the Dom and even more
than absolute in that we can elect the
the whole restaurant will just scroll
right past it and again notice if
siblings that collapse under it they're
not on top of it they're below it
because the fixed element gets the it
gets on top it's just on time now notice
that I have grandad is positioned
relative right so if it were similar to
the absolutely positioned elements that
rule there me I would end up if I
declared top ten or I'll do top zero if
I declare top zero if it was similar to
the absolute positioning statements I
would go right next to granddad like we
saw with with absolute positioning let
me show you this I'm right at the top of
the page now the reason for that is that
if a fixed position element will never
respect any of its parents ever it's
always positioned fixed relative to the
document window okay not even the Dom
not even the body or the HTML element
talking about the window and that's a
really big distinction to make now
because of that we can just scroll on
past it now what's interesting is when I
did not declare a directional property
it just floated it just floated where it
was and didn't really move and this is
kind of how we do like those menus like
a shopping cart where you scroll in it
it's just is still staying there or
watch this I can do top:0 left:0 pixel
ride zero pixels and high sixty pixels
and look at that I got I got a fixed
header and everything floats on under it
and it's like my little go and all that
cool stuff that's how you do website
tricks hmm like those website tricks
okay so that's it for the position of
property there's other things to be
aware of like you can have inherited or
initial and another new one that will be
coming up is going to be actually that's
the display I was thinking of I was
thinking about flexbox that's display
property so that's positioning in a
nutshell in two videos about about ten
minutes each or so uh I hope this is
good for you guys I hope that you
understand something from this and
whatever and hope you have a fun time
please show your friends or share it on
your social networks this one guy shared
a video of mine on the Google+ and it
was really cool a lot of people found
the video and it was helpful to a lot
but when it really made me happy so if
you found this explanation of crap uh
beneficial
please share it with everybody that you
know including your mom or I will and
that might just be awkward so love you
much bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
