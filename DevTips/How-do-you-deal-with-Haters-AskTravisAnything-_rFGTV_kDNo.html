this next question comes from jose Fred
myint myint free mant sorry Jose I know
that I messed your name up oh this is
Jay Jay he goes by jay jay says I
started my youtube channel two months
ago and i already have haters what's the
best way to deal with them ignore them
tell them i love you or just say thank
you thanks Jeff thanks Jay listen man I
watched a few of your videos Jay and
they're good and they're fun and they're
entertaining and even more than that
they're helpful and you're helping
people to live out their dreams and
that's really what motivates me for dev
tips in a lot of ways but let's get back
to haters dev tips has by order of scale
compared to all of my peers a
significant portion fewer of haters than
anyone else per capita dev tips has like
way more lovers than anything else and
how did that come about well number one
is when i when i was able to i responded
to every single comment in every single
comment i responded to with positivity
if somebody was negative i would just
laugh with them you know if so it was
like hot look at dick I'd has no hair
like we I genetically I have no hair
thanks no cool um you know like that guy
he messed up on the thing like oh thanks
for the recommendation thanks for the
suggestion thanks for the feedback right
I appreciate that it will help me to be
better in the future the reason why
people troll the wisdom the reason why
people are negative on the Internet is
because they don't have empathy and they
don't believe that anybody real is
sitting on the other side of the screen
they think that you are an object so
they just kind of make these demands
they make these criticisms they just
kind of say hurtful things and the thing
is
you are a person so how do you give them
that empathy well you have to be real to
them so answering a comment for example
is only one way but it's a good way it
says look here i am i'm a real thing i'm
a real human I'm a real entity with
feelings and thoughts and opinions and
hopes and dreams and desires and now
here I am when they get a response from
you they're often surprised because how
often on the internet 'does anybody
respond to trolls very very few because
the common wisdom is not to respond but
but you know what Jose Jay hug your
haters man hug your haters show them
that you're a real person show them love
don't get defensive right they're human
too and they'll in turn show you love
really quickly here is here's a real
life example do you guys remember um
Adam Adam did the javascript tutorials I
think he did two videos for dev tips I
like Adam and he's a really smart guy
and I asked him to do some videos and as
I was reviewing the videos we were
talking about it I said you know Adam
you're a different person than I am and
I present in a certain way and you
present in an entirely different way and
sometimes people come to this channel
because of the way that I present and so
you might hear some feedback on that
topic how you present and what you're
saying and whether or not you're doing a
good job what I want you to do is show
up in the comments section and answer
every comment that you can and be
positive whether their comments are
positive or negative if they say a
negative comment just say hey thanks for
your feedback I'm really trying to learn
how to do this and this will be and your
feedback is very helpful so maybe I'll
try I'll try to implement those feedback
points you know later on my next time
and then and I mean I took screenshots
of this stuff it's so great negative
feedback Adams positive reply positive
positive comment from the first person
they just people turn on a dime they
realize that you're a human being who
has a respect for them and all of a
sudden because people are not respected
online nobody respects each other they
don't they don't expect you to return
with feed with a respectful reply they
just expect flames you know and so when
you do show them that stuff they don't
necessarily know what to do and they
kind of like oh this guy's a human so
that's my my advice to you Jay is hug
your haters thanks for asking a question
man keep on hacking you just watch ask
Travis anything if you have a question
for me then send a tweet to at dev tips
show and hashtag it with ask Travis
anything thanks for watching to check
out the other questions on the playlist
