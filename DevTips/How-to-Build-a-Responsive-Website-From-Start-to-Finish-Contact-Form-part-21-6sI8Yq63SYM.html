nearly last episode of this series we've
been we've been doing this for three
months the the first you believe that
the first episode of this series was
uploaded three months ago and here we
are and we are so close to being done in
the last episode we did a quick job of
getting those icon fonts set up we have
options for different kind of social
networks that you could be on easy to
plug them in and make more icons lineup
in that row easy to plug in your email
address to and it's all controlled
through the settings menu today we're
going to create this forum which is
going to be sent now keep in mind that
this isn't this is the unusual thing you
may not see it very often on a website
that's a static website right it's not
built on PHP it's not built on Rails or
another kind of language that can speak
to servers it's just plain static HTML
that you can throw up on ss3 hosting for
example and if you know there's no way
for it to talk to a server so having a
forum on it is a little unconventional
but there's a really really great option
for that let me show you how that works
we're going to run over to this really
awesome service called forms dot braced
IO
now brace is a company that will allow
you to host your website on their
servers and they also generate static
things and the static websites and they
use a Dropbox I don't know I don't host
with with brace I've never done one web
site with them but maybe in the future
because this service is pretty awesome
to help their own customers and free to
use for everybody
they have a service called forms dot
brace do and the idea is like hey send
your regular HTML form off to us we'll
process it for you and send it off to
your email address so you don't have to
do any PHP scripting you don't have to
like kind of host this anywhere it could
still be a flat file static generated
site like we've been building this whole
time and formed brain
I Oh we'll take care of it for us and
you can't believe how simple it is the
first thing you do is grab this little
code right here copy and I'm going to
paste that right into my my body or my
section
okay now I'll tell you what each of
these kind of tags are for so the form
right here action sends it to form Bracy
oh and right here instead of your email
I want to put well I want to put my
email right so that's going to be site
dot data dot settings
email is that right where's that
settings email yeah so whatever email
you've included in this in the site
section as your email this form is going
to shoot it off automatically to that
website and that's done right here by
forms brace to i/o slash whatever email
you did input and cool so we have a text
input you can put your name this reply
to the reply to input is if you know if
I get an email from somebody and I reply
to it in my email address this is going
to handle that reply to so it's going to
send it back to the person who filled
out the form on your website and then we
have a submit button right here so this
is a very basic form to save it and
refresh it on my site right here by the
way I change the website that he mailed
to my YouTube registered email address
and it's really long so I so I did some
you know responsive web design here and
kind of shrunk it up where it's
appropriate anyway so let's refresh and
see this is my form this is my contact
form right here this one is name so
input Travis and we're going to test it
out for the first time so when you
create this form on your website you put
your own email address here and step one
is to put the you know like we did a
really good step one step two is to go
to
the website like we're doing right here
and actually fill out the form it
submitted for the first time right now
what that will do I think is it will
send me as a host of the email address
the host of the forum like a like a
registration kind of letter right like a
welcome kind of letter let's see what
happens
name okay that was Travis and email I
won't put my email it should send to my
dev tips address so let's send it and
see what happens
forum should post make sure your forum
has the method post attribute that's
fair I wonder why their example didn't
have that on there so we're gonna go
back to our foam form input method post
and now it hopefully that'll be better
all right refresh I fill that out again
Travis and my email address now hit send
and so we get ok confirm my email
address we've sent a link to my email to
prevent spam you'll have it to confirm
the email before things start working so
they sent it to my dev tips and I got a
email from brace forms thanks for using
brace forms I'm going to confirm just
like that okay we are good to go
it's set from site localhost though so
I'll probably need to run it again once
it gets on the server but that's fine
we're done and so let me send another
form from here I'll send it from Travis
Travis no standard email send alright
form submitted successfully return to
original site check my email here let's
see if we got that email email new
submissions
hey there's someone just so named and
reply to email address here okay so
let's do another one I want to put a in
my code I want to put a text area so
what our design calls for and a name
we'll call this message right and
refresh okay Travis Travis
Neilson and hey there buddy
let's do codes send and then I get this
success message here and then Travis
gets a new message huh that works
fantastic and if I want to reply to him
I'll just replied to him right here
fantastic now we've got a fully
functional form we just have to make it
look good and make it look so people
want to fill it out and give us their
contact information okay so the first
thing I look at when I see this form is
I see the form itself as the container
and then I can see the different various
types of inputs and stuff so I want to
set all these guys up with a label
your name okay yeah this is the this is
what I want for each of these I'll have
a label and this one will say your email
and the message one will say tell me
about your project yeah it looks good
and then I'll have the send so it'll be
here here and here
cool so that is our markup now we just
have to set the styles so we have this
section is going to be caught well just
there like one form on this website form
you are going to be a width of 463
that's weird max width is 500 no 450
and your margins are zero pixels from
the top Auto from the left and right and
let's go with 50 pixels from the bottom
good looks good now each of these labels
inside is going to be a block level
element so display block and this span
inside the level label is going to be
also a block so that it can be on top of
the actual input refresh okay looking
good looking good and the text here is
looking pretty much how I want it to
look I want to put about 20 pixels of
margin below each label is it 10 or 20
yeah 20 okay and looks good looks good
okay now the two of these labels here
are going to be in the group here so
let's call this div class info group
because it's like contact info
you
you
okay so the contact info group I
actually want I want the labels that are
inside of there to be the width of 50%
no I don't 4548 with a margin right of
2% because two and 48 equals 50 and I
want to float these left see we got
there yeah that's good that's good
now all of the all the inputs here and
input and text area and have border of
two pixels solid and accent color this
is two pixels
three three pixels ah three pixels good
all right em and a width of 100% right
2% is too small let's say here nope
let's do let's not do margin let's do
with 50 and padding right 10 pixels and
also we're going to say the box border
box of box size right is border box so
that the margin will not be a foot the
flip oh well we have also to do
box-sizing border box on the actual text
area let's see what we get there there
we are that's what I wanted but now we
have 10 pixels right here unaccounted
for so label I'll say and M child 1
you're padding right we'll be fine and
in child - come here come here okay and
then in child - we'll be patting left
five so they can like distribute that 10
pixel margin between them ah there we
are
wait on you label 1000 I'm going to get
rid of that now there we go so now it
goes all the way to the edge of that box
that's great let's put some padding on
this ten pixels and let's get that focus
and focus that's called outline:none
but we do want to do something for our
focus and that is going to be our border
color will be accent light so we're not
going to have this blue thing around it
but hopefully our border color will
lighten up for us to show the work we're
focused okay good
this looks great this looks great
I think this could be a bit taller
height be 10 M yeah looks good and now
the last thing is the send button and we
do that by saying type submit' so we'll
say text area input um well just right
here
type equals submit we will say to you
sir your background should be accent
color and your color should be white
refresh okay okay
nearly there we need you to be bigger as
well
much bigger so font size mmm
18 I think good good
add text transform uppercase and we'll
do I want to get you to align to the
right to class submit rap
so I put it in a rap so I could align it
to the right so right here's a good
place to then you'll say submit wrap
text align right and then we want to
make the width of this guy be 33% just a
third of the thing there we go that's
what we wanted
oh why did the focus only not work on
this oh you right there
these probably want to move up here
that's good
okay now the focus should work on both
of them turn to light color cool all
right
that is looking good Oh ten pixels
between them there you go that's a
little bit better a little bit more
breathing room and a send send will say
and hover back breath
Otis a light yeah excellently the border
should still be dark that's cool awesome
and we're done okay before we end this
video let's go back to our Trello board
and check on our progress so we in our
last video we sorted out the
testimonials and in this video we've
developed out the contact section and
that so it looks like we're done but we
have a few more things to do one of the
things that I saw that I wanted to do
actually outputs and development one of
the things I wanted to do was make the
header responsive it's not exactly
responsive right now and the second
thing I wanted to do was set the site up
on our server we're going to spend the
next two videos doing these two tasks
and then we're going to consider this
series complete and we may return to it
to do a new type of lessons and new
aspects but moreover it's going to be
generally complete and then we can move
on to other awesome things so we'll see
you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
