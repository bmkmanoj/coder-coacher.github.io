tips I got a quick tip for you I was
just having a conversation with Cameron
in the comment section of the last video
I did we're talking about SAS and he
mentioned that the output of his SAS was
indented the looked looks nested and I
didn't really ask him if he had a
problem with that or not but it's true
you do get an output in several
different ways so I wanted to show you
how you can control the output CSS and a
few different options that SAS gives you
so let's take a look here this is the
SAS lang website or the SAS website is
called SAS - Lang comm you can jump into
the documentation from the main
navigation here scroll down on the
bottom of this nav on the right and look
at output style we have nested style and
this is what is what Cameron was talking
about and we have expanded style which
is similar except for the the children
the children selectors are not nested
under the parents they're just
everything on the same level except for
looks like there's two hard returns here
then we have compact style with a whole
declaration and the whole declaration
that the selectors and values and
properties and values will all be on one
line and then the last one is compressed
where everything like every single
selector everything is on one line now
let me show you what that looks like so
we have here this is just a regular
indented sass style sheet and right now
it's currently outputting to the
indented or sorry the I think it's
called the nested flavor
yeah they do a video call it nested so
now it's outputting to the nested flavor
let me show you with code kit that's
really easy to control you just click on
the this dials about CSS or sass and you
can select the output style to expand it
and compile and then look at that
everything's expanded they're no longer
nested under each other like we saw
before and you can do compact and that's
what that looks like
slimming down the file size we're down
to 16 lines here and then compressed
could be down to one line all the styles
on one line now the reasons that is
useful is every line that you can save
in your code is one less line that the
computer has to read so the computer
does go line by line so the idea is you
cram all on one line it's less overhead
for the computer to process now it's
also less readable for humans and if
somebody's inspecting your code maybe
that's a problem for them although you
know with code inspectors these days on
on the browsers it's not really an issue
because you're never looking quietly
quite apt to code unless you are but
you're often looking at like a computed
output or a representation of the dome
and the Styles attached to those Dom
nodes so not really an issue but while
we're at let me show you a few other
things the output style can be whatever
you choose but this is interesting
SAS also lets you have debug info now
this is really good if you are checking
your output CSS in the browser but you
have lots of concatenated Styles like
you're using the import a lot you have
like I work I said I had over 140 sass
sheets that all compiled into one file
well if I have an error or like a weird
style in one of them and I'm looking at
the out the code output how am I gonna
find that one line of code in all those
140 documents well I can turn this debug
info on I can turn in just the line
number selectors
and when I look at the output stylist I
can see the reference documents so
evening the line number and the document
of the of the SAS code that originated
this next block of code now this is all
comes from one so it'll all be it'll all
reference the same document of SAS style
but if you have hundreds of originating
SAS documents this is quite helpful I
use it quite a lot and then the last
interesting option here in code kit is
that you can run bliss on the CSS file
now if your code if your output code has
more than 400 or sorry 4,000 lines on it
older versions of some browsers will
will get tripped up on that so what
blessed will do was it will divide the
output CSS after it gets to that certain
number so this is just a really quick
response to Cameron's comment and maybe
helps to clear these things out so this
is all done with code kit they can also
be done with commands if you're using
SAS in the command line and I'm assuming
other pre-processing applications can do
these things as well because these are
standard inside of sacs it's not code
kit specific they just give us the UI to
make it a little bit easier for us who
don't want to use the command line
alright well that's it for today thanks
a lot Cameron for the question and
hopefully this was helpful and we'll
talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
