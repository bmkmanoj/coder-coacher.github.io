isn't it beautiful the guy down there on
the beach can see em it's an amazing
world we live in
it's just so beautiful anyway so so it's
6:30 in the morning right now I think
and I've been up since 4:00 and I think
maybe I haven't been at the campground
since then thought I saw wolf but it was
actually a big dog so I've been like
editing video on my iPad to published
next week and it's been fun but it's
been like super campy campy I smell like
campfire and my clothes are all dirty
and I'm hungry but look at that right
it's amazing
all right I got the first question here
this is from a Maximilian Lloyd
Maximilian asks how can I find a good
mentor what's better a mentor you means
like in real life or online a great
question Maximilian actually this is a
question that we get kind of a lot and
for that one I want to bring in my
podcast co-host 'lose Montoya kilos
don't we're gonna fall off this clip on
records illusion okay so um we did a
podcast about this it was like one of
our very first ones and we gave a lot of
advice all uh I'll put a link to that
episode of the podcast in the video
description and also there was a there's
a an email new notes letter note thing
that I wrote about being a good
candidate for a mentor to want you right
and that was all about bringing value to
your potential mentor so that that way
that they would be you be a part of
their process not an annoyance to them
yeah what's your perspective on finding
a good mentor in and what about being in
person versus online okay okay in person
you kind of need a well if you know them
that's easy if you know the people and
you're like close friends with them then
it's easier to say hey and just I just
don't really ask him to be a mentor I
like bring value to them if we can if
you just ask him questions like every
once in a while you can organic
conversation about the topic so that's
the easiest is if you know them if you
know that person in person but you're
not that close with them I think it's
harder than if it's harder than finding
someone online it's harder to find
someone in person I think it's harder to
entreat them as mentor they're like they
are online know if you know them in
person but you're not
like you need you need a mutual friend
to connect you guys and not just like it
she's gonna reach out to me but you
don't know also I'd say that they're not
mutually exclusive you know you can't
have one at the expense of the other you
can have both or many of both right yeah
so find a few online find a few that you
know yeah and they can mentor you in
different things some can mentor you on
business relationships some can mentor
you on being a good salesperson about
being a better designer or a better
developer yeah there's a lot of
different things to learn and like you
know even things that are outside of
your you know business focus like if you
want to learn woodworking or if you want
to learn you know finance like these are
all really good things to learn and
you'll you'll always bring them in
somehow into your vocation yeah but you
can find a lot of different mentors in a
lot of different ways and offer for good
yeah I like these are they're not
mutually exclusive yeah so go where they
are and communicating they're done
alright this next one's from Brian
Chavez Brian shabbos asks what inspires
you that's that's both a really easy
question and a really hard freaking
question right so I'm here on like this
really really beautiful beach on this
this amazing beautifully day an
amazingly beautiful day and like the
waves of crashing I've been listening to
them all night as I slept three hours
and it's just it's just been a really
awesome experience because I'm usually
like you know in the office all day or I
think if I'm not literally literally at
the computer like 70% of my day normally
so to be out here and to just like see
the difference and to see that contrast
is inspiring
is it gonna cause me to make a different
type of work probably not but it will
cause me to appreciate more things and
the more diverse things that I can
appreciate and understand the more
diverse of a creator overall I can be
you know there might be something that
happens as we're walking along this
Beach today that will come up and in
like a in in a note later on or in
another podcast or something and that
and that's very inspiring but now my
main work that I do being a designer a
front-end developer what inspires that
um mostly mostly it's probably probably
closest here still mostly it's problems
problems inspire solutions that's really
really what it comes down to if you can
define the problem better than anything
else better than anybody else you will
definitely have a better solution than
everybody else right if you don't know
what the problem is
I want a website I want an e store or
whatever that's such a big problem
you're not going to really have a
dynamic and and provocative solution so
to make good work because we're in them
we're in the business of solving
problems
is to understand the problem right okay
now just about design and cool things
you know like maybe what inspires me to
make a new tutorial on dev tips I mean
honestly I just surf the net as much as
you guys do right and honestly a lot of
it comes from you guys you guys request
things a lot there are some things that
have been on my list for a very long
time because you keep on requesting them
and that's inspiring I want it I want to
do this for you guys just as much as I
get out of it right
so to summarize there are many different
kinds of inspirations some will directly
impact your work and some will open you
up to new possibilities the via the
posture that you can have of being open
to possibilities is isn't it it is an
exceptional ability exceptional
attribute to have and I would recommend
it to anyone so the the high fluffy one
it is everything inspires you the the
grounded and direct answer is probable
inspire their own answer done
it's once from Adam Rasheed and he says
you have any advice for teen developers
and designers trying to get into the
industry Adam I I loved fit you're a
teenager and trying to get into the
industry desk the first thing is wow
that's awesome when I was a teenager I
had no clue what I was gonna do with my
life and although I was doing web and
dev back then I had no idea that it
could be a that it could be a job right
I could get paid to do it
so first of all that's the first step
being aware of like a goal and seeking
advice and having those questions on how
to achieve the goal is definitely the
first step for anyone whether they're a
teenager or not I mean this goes this
goes for everyone now the interesting
thing about being a teenager and wanting
to get into the industry is that you
have a unique privileged maybe a unique
situation wherein you are not completely
responsible for your own welfare yet
what I mean by that is it's possible I'm
not saying this is for you I don't know
what your situation is but it's possible
that you live at your parents house or
or a guardian it's also possible that
you don't need to buy your food every
day and it's paid for if that's the
situation then then you have a leg up on
everybody who has to provide for
themselves while studying to move into
the career that they want to write you
can you can you can just like study all
day and try to level up as much as you
can and that's that's an interesting
advantage that you have over people who
don't share that same situation the
other biggest asset you have on your
side is time and it's related to the
first but it but you have so many years
ahead of you and starting now is so wise
in that it would give you so much of an
advantage now here now here's the thing
I don't mean to to talk
poorly about young creators you've given
a gift in in that everybody expects so
little of so little of you and and this
is like an awesome time to just get as
much experience and you have so much
grace given to you right like it's all
of the mistakes that you're going to
make you're going to make are forgivable
because you don't have the experience
and that's okay what your goal is right
now is to get that experience you have
the drive you have the determination you
have the direction you've shown that by
by showing up by asking the right
questions by talking and looking for
mentorship all this kind of stuff that's
right the right directions what you need
is time and experience and that will
come with just by just making things I
was just telling Carlos that I think
that it's a really it's a scary but a
really good idea one of these days I'm
going to show with one of these vlogs
just go over my really old work and it's
just crap it's just just utter garbage
and I think if you guys see that it'll
make you feel a lot better about maybe
the the frustrations that you have about
your own work I know that if someone
showed me that stuff of theirs and I you
know I perceive that they're doing all
right I would feel a lot better too
anyway I'm gonna leave that there
thank you so much for the question and
we're done with this one
okay this last question comes from
Anthony pin zone Anthony asks what are
your hobbies outside of design and
YouTube world Anthony you're gonna be
really really disappointed with this
answer because I used to have hobbies I
used to be a guy that did things and
then and then YouTube came and now I
don't have any hobbies I used to draw I
used to make music I used to like you
know paint I used to do woodworking
sometimes you know like just like a
normal human being this varied
experience but the thing is is that
slowly as I invested my interest and
ability into one specific thing making
videos and in writing and and I'm
speaking with people you know my my
hobby is a kind of consolidated
themselves so it's kind of like
everything I do now is focused on one
thing which is like developing content
for for one of my creative outlets
whether it be YouTube whether it be my
podcast with Carlos or like my notes or
my podcast for my patrons or creating
applications or you know or work or
whatever like all of those things are
kind of hobbies and they all kind of
follow a path to to one place which is
creative output now I'm not sure that
that's healthy I'm not sure that that's
a good idea
but it gives me a lot of happiness and
it gives me a even more happiness to
find that the things that I'm doing for
example I got an email the other day
when I mean and this is not an unusual
occurrence but just that just happened
yesterday an email a deaf tipster
telling me that they got a new job and
it wasn't of course it wasn't because of
me but they said that I that the work
that I've been doing played a big part
in the technical skills that they needed
to acquire that job but also the
motivation and inspiration to go out
there and get it and
I can't tell you how that makes me feel
like it's it is the best thing and if
all of my if all of my hobbies and all
of my free time are spent between my
occupation my work my employers needs
my family's needs and your guys needs
and and it and it actually is worth
while I'm fine with that
on my we're currently redoing my website
but on my old site which is currently
live right now there's a there's a a
motto or a phrase and it says something
like I just want to make something great
before I die and I've been living with
that motto for for the past like five
years that that's what I thought about
like what it what is what do I really
want I just want to make something great
I think that that this is it I think
that me being a conduit to help other
people to realize what their goals are
and to bring joy into their life whether
it be through my employer through my
family or through you through you guys
that's what I want I also play guitar
I'm not good but it's fun that's it that
was the last question that I have I just
posted on Twitter like a few hours ago
you know doing a vlog this weekend if
you guys have any questions let me
answer them and those those are some
fantastic questions and so thank you for
giving them if you have any questions
that you'd like to see I like to play
maybe four maybe we can do a thing for
each of these vlogs we do a question or
two I like that it's fun so if you have
any questions leave them in the comments
down below of this video I will get to
them again but look at this amazing
world I'm out here I'm behind the screen
all day long every day and I never see
this stuff and then we can do you're
like what am i doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
