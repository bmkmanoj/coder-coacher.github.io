I call design and code my personal
website in 12 hours today we're doing
the contact section this is the last
episode in which we'll be doing any
coding and I am just so excited let's
just get straight into it what's up this
is the last little bit and then the
whole thing is done we might do another
video or something to do like a recap of
whatever but you know what's up we are
done coding after this next little bit
not completely done forever and ever and
ever and ever and ever but for this
series we can like put it to bed okay
let's take a look at what we're doing
right now we have in our website a lot
of sections at the very end we have this
big red block with an email address in
it people want to contact me they just
email me and for you know actually
gotten a lot of emails lately from
everybody it's really hard to answer
everyone so if you do email me just give
me time I'll try to get back to you
anyway but here we are the email I'm
calling this the footer hits this is
like an aggressively big email address
at the foot of the website so I'm just
calling it a footer so as in every other
episode I've done a few things to begin
I've created a jade file and put that in
Jade files and this one is called
section footer Jade and I included it
into index.html and you can see right
here below we have all those columns and
that extra height of 2000 let's just get
let's get rid of these columns right now
and then we get rid of those 2000 later
and then I've created a home - footer
SAS and included that into the main as
CSS okay so what are we gonna do well I
let's see that's the markup let's just
start calling it footer now let's call
it section floater call it footer just
call it
it's called footer
footer you're gonna be a big in red and
inside of you is gonna be an anchor tag
with our half equals mail to Travis
Nielson nope at gmail.com and that's my
email address and that text is gonna be
the same that should be all we need for
the markup for this whole section just a
little little email a little little
little little email address all right so
what was the class oh it's just a footer
mm-hmm no it's not gonna be footer it
some class of home footer it can be a
footer it but he's gonna be a home class
at home for because I'm not gonna let
that footer be across you know every
page home footer and what's up with you
home footer well first we need the color
so let's go back to photoshop grab that
color back around that red color nice
red and the color is gonna be white and
also the anchor is gonna have a color of
white
boom hmm let's say text no you know what
you know what you know what you know
what
move I want the whole thing to be button
so I don't want the background I don't
know I don't want that stuff there
I want them you know I mean like I do
one that color though
where's that color sorry let me get rid
of this stuff I'm thinking that I want
the button I want all this red to
actually be the button the big clickable
thing is gonna be the red so I'll say
background on that thing on that on this
anchor is there so that means it needs
to be to display and block and its width
used to be 100 cent and its height how
should we make this big should make it
big with padding or with height or width
line height why night how do you good
wine high it's gonna be like three
text-align
Center now this is all a button
look a big old button Big O button let's
get the font size 60 60 pixels 60 and is
it like weight light font weight 300 I
don't think we have the light weight
from Google mmm I guess you'll just be
regular I guess you'll just be not oh I
don't want to import a whole font just
for one word do I know I don't but I
want that line height to be like six yo
yeah that's better
and let's say and cover the back ground
is gonna be this similar to this in fact
we'll take it and we'll say darken and
this is a sass function here darken that
to you know like like 3% darken it that
much see if that's a good idea
needs more darky 8%
that's good but we should have a
transition 300 milliseconds and ease in
I would not fast enough
mm 150 okay we still have all this space
at the bottom and that comes from this
right there so let's get rid of that and
now our design should hug the bottom oh
my goodness look at this big beautiful
website I'm so happy right now I feel
like oh I feel like months and months of
work is coming to an end do you guys

let's head over to big trav let him take
care of that clothes thank you so much

mean I can't tell you how excited I am
to be done I started producing this show
in January and different things have
pushed it back and back so getting it
done doing this last episode is such a
weight off of my shoulders
I feel like I I can breathe differently
and I didn't even know that I was being
crushed by this weight anyway I can't
even tell you how happy I am in this
