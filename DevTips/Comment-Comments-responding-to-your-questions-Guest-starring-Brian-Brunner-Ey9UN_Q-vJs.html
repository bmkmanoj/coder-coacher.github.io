Brian is a guest on the show I'm so
excited to have him I tried to get him
on for so long and he's finally agreed
to be here so we are so lucky and today
is also a very special episode because
this this episode is purely it's just
responses to questions questions that
have been tweeted out to a dev tips
Twitter and dev tips at depth in show
tweeter and also questions that have
been left in the comments thank you I
think you've been trying to get beyond
here really six months an hour yeah
that's nice yeah that's right so it's
like a it's like a milestone yeah have
you expect everybody if I may finally
bother being lost right a little bit
about Brian I met Brian about a year ago
a little one that when we our first day
of work and it turned out dessert we had
the first day together right yeah yeah
and we both showed up and it was just
like hey they're like okay filled the
website we didn't like him that weekend
we go yeah it was it was two days
article had to go on TechCrunch like
three days later and get published that
was our first task so that's the
velocity relationship since then so but
brian has recently left our company that
I still work at and you're doing some I
don't even know what you're doing it's a
startup
I'm working on with friend back from the
school yeah working for yourself yep
it's really exciting
that's um exciting so what I like like
what's your day-to-day work I wake up at
11:00 and I hang out with my cats all
day in code that's this might give it
sure they gave you hmm
the chemistry where the cat shirt I wore
that that's my bedtime sure so we're
just gonna jump into questions then and
well I'm so
it's like so fun that you're here okay
the first question comes from Xtina
fighters what is the difference between
JavaScript Java and jQuery I actually
don't know so javascript is what you use
in a browser when you want to make
interactive websites it's the
programming languages that the Internet
is built on Java is like a backend
language and the reason JavaScript is
called that is because Java was really
popular back in like the late 80s early
90s
Johnny didn't drink what Java the
program is the programming language is
popular in the eighties eighties and
nineties yeah and JavaScript just named
itself that because it kind of wanted to
pay back off popularity interests so
what would you use Java for so Java you
would use for a ton of different things
you can use Java to build the backend
for your website you can use Java
development database it's just a really
big open-ended programming language
whereas JavaScript is just for the
browser just for the it well that's not
even true anymore because you can do
JavaScript on your back-end and it's
pretty much I'm rambling now yeah it's
very versatile so what about jQuery
jQuery is just a library on top of
JavaScript that makes it easier to work
with you don't have to write as much
code or really know as much about
JavaScript to still really be effective
with it what's like though what's like
the primary thing or the first thing
that you would want to learn when
learning jQuery so jQuery lets you
select different elements on the page in
the Dom and it has a really cool syntax
for doing that it's basically just CSS
selectors so learning how to leverage
that is probably what you want to learn
first absolutely yeah so great answers
this guy knows Tobi Hodkinson poky says
I'd like some help with areas of my site
that I can update within the browser gig
dates etc I'm sick of the other guys not
being able to update the gig list
Thanks so it sounds like he made some
type of CMS or some type of yeah so
maybe you wanted to use WordPress if you
just have a blog and just like have one
post that you update all the time you
could just use Google
it's not something you need to show to
people who are like coming to your gigs
if it's just like an internal list that
would be a really simple way to solve it
you don't even have to do any coding or
anything fancy but yeah if you're if
it's something you showed up people
probably just throw up a wordpress site
and haven't done one right I'm also I'm
also looking at the context clues of
your question and it looks like the user
like musicians and there are some tools
built specifically for musicians I'm not
a musician myself that perform so but
one of them I know is Bandcamp that's a
thing we can put your tour dates on it
quick show dates on and you can always
use MySpace so okay that's good all
right let's move on this next question
is from said Hans Seb says how do you
get started with SAS or scss that's
that's all you can design things I yeah
still can do SAS structure correct yeah
this is this is kind of my wheelhouse I
forced everybody to adopt it at work
yeah and I think at least I'm happy so
everybody else yeah that's the important
thing what that you're happy I'm happy
yeah and that's at the other end of the
party so to get started with SAS word or
SCSS I would recommend watching the
videos that I've done on saps and scss
and you can click on his face because
that will take you to the video the main
video may use my face you can also click
on my face to understand the basic
there's two videos so this one will take
you to how to use SAS and SPSS in the
fundamental ways look like the top
things that I use it for in this video
my face video will take you to
understanding what a preprocessor is in
the context of the web and CSS in
general cool okay I hope you enjoy those
let's move on gaming Unitas says I'm a
15 year old boy how would you advise me
to get clients as a freelance web
designer yes so when was the last time
you were 15
how old am i ten years yeah
it's like half my life ago scary in here
you're truly two pence I'm not
exaggerating I do have some kids okay so
a little bit of gray I've been
cultivating that I want to I want to be
salt and pepper
I know if you're a 15 year old boy how
would you go about getting plants for
your reason its Web so I know it gives
I'm actually done freelancing I really
happen
my gut instinct would be to use cement
in like work or no I'm not really yeah
cool my gut instinct would be to get on
something like oDesk or some other place
where they hire freelancers and probably
not sell off that your 15 year old boys
that even if you're really really good
that's going to turn some people away I
just build up a really great portfolio
and show that to people and have that
it's sort of the face of what you're
doing yeah that's interesting
this is that this is one of the first
times in the history of the world where
you can you can hide your age you can be
a 15 year old human boy or girl and
actually play ball with adults in a
professional world so it's like give the
really interesting opportunity but there
will be some biases against somebody who
doesn't and not because we really don't
see it's because of experience right
yeah so we said there would be some type
of hesitancy bias against somebody
without experience and you know is this
person gonna follow through can I trust
that they you know are not gonna go hang
out their friends and do the work that
they're signing up what kind of thing
like that I know when I was - you
couldn't trust me that's that's for sure
see so I'm speaking for experience
hopefully I'm not offending your
sensibilities but um but having said
that letting that kind of groundwork you
would go about it just as if you were a
little bit overboard a little bit more
experienced mainly of working up to
build a big portfolio doing some stuff
that you know even for free just to get
your feet wet and understand
what a client process is like in length
you know like but the way you started
the question was that you're a 15 year
old and that seems to be what you're
focusing on and so I guess really our
our biggest recommendation would be just
don't focus on that at all
don't mention it ever anywhere and then
when you get to be you know 18 20 years
old then you could be like hey I have
young but I have all of this experience
and that that would be impressive
because experience is really the name of
the game even I mean I want to give this
same advice to somebody who is who's my
age but hasn't yet started working in a
professional realm I would say yeah
don't talk about what you what your
limitations are or what your worries or
hang-ups are talk about what your
strengths are and and do and get
experience get a lot of experience make
stuff for yourself make stuff for your
friends for your friends grandmother who
is doing a family Union whatever it is
you know like do something for like pro
bono for like Reza's
school yeah yeah that might be able
telling of your age that's true yeah
whatever night anyhow there's a lot of
people who who won't work for free
that's that's for sure and if you do it
in Indy in the perspective of I'm
helping you out in exchange for
experience you know I'm not just giving
away my services for free because you
have to respect your service is a value
but you're exchanging it for something
very valuable also namely experience
let's move on here's a question from
Scott what industry sites and blogs
do you read regularly for programming I
really like hacker news it's kind of hit
or miss that can sometimes be stuff that
it's nothing to do with programming like
social issues and whatever but in this
are important but they're not related to
the industry I guess but it really
services a lot of good content or on
programming and a lot of good content
around design there's definitely other
more intensive things that I read that I
guess are more programming oriented or
- like high scalability if you want to
get into writing really intense back in
system that's a blog yeah myspace will
be high scalability calm okay but that's
not design oriented so I don't know the
question is yeah the question is when
you read yeah for sure
I would say that's like couple of the
big ones there's like others there's a
handful other things yeah all right one
day it's like of like a religious wrote
text to me that like they're read and
read and read it every time there was a
new thing and also like always go back
because it's really searchable this CSS
- trixx comment it's read my Chris Koya
it's been going for a few years strong
and it's not only a CSS if I mean it's
HTML and JavaScript it's all that
front-end goodness that we'd like to
talk about here on dev tips but really
well laid out and really really like
well explained there there's this one
article in particular on on flexbox oh
yeah I referenced like 20 times a week
I'm like I can't do that again or what
is that better than an actual
documentation way better yeah Mozilla
it's it's so good and and yeah
everything is better than actual dr. B
actually I actually really like it's not
necessarily a blog but I really like
going on code pen and just seeing what
people are doing is they're really cool
stuff that people do kind of relatable
examples just a bit of trivia content is
also a product of Chris coiour
who does history I thought that would
make a lot of sense yeah we just like
reverence the same guy at work both see
different things
yeah Copeman is fantastic mm-hmm
dev tips but no Travis is a third person
I have a coke thing but it's in some of
the early episodes what I'm explaining
code early I'm sad I've published pens -
code ends so that you guys could have
like those references but since then and
this is kind of an announcement that
don't migrate away that we have a dev
tips organization on get up so all of
the code this episode no go tell and on
github explorer they show like the top
things from that day which is another
thank piggyback off you again there we
go another good recommendation okay cool
all right let's move on here's the
technical question about me giri's how
do you target desktop tablet and mobile
screens with meteors it's pretty
technical week this is a bad question to
ask me because I'm pretty mad about that
is it yeah yours about your site is
responsive your new company my my extent
amusing like media queries is just using
Twitter bootstrap and sizes so that's a
really easy way to do it if you want to
actually make a responsive site
correctly it's just looking up I mean
different devices have different media
queries that are gonna target them and
it's just either knowing that from
experience or finding it online just
figuring out yeah
there's no real good hard and fast rule
I mean certainly devices like we said
are gonna have like fix dimensions like
I know that for like an iPad it's gonna
be 768 why yeah so I want to make sure
that when that browser width hit 768
things are gonna line up good so a lot
of people put the media queries like the
breakpoint at 768 it's my preference to
put it a little offset from about that
so that when it hits it's gonna look
good but things are still flexing inside
of is a whole big topic but the idea is
understand what target a width um the
devices you're targeting and and work
out from there one good approach is to
have just general like three sides
that's like small and medium and large I
think that's yeah that's how to extract
that news Jeff does yeah right so that's
what I would say about media queries
understand the devices and work out from
there and we actually had a really good
video with Louis in there in the studio
and we talked about media creation you
can go to small large or Waters's anyway
watch the video it's on it's beep right
between our faces now it's on my frosty
drink click the frosty drink to have the
media committee query
video okay this one is from Benjamin
carrier he says hi I'm a student
attending University next year and I
want to work as a UX designer I've seen
your videos and they are really great
and I really like the fact that you get
to great design in the whole program
thing I've been accepted in industrial
design and in software engineering but I
don't know which would help me to
achieve my goal what do you suggest
oh man that is very open-ended that kind
of depends on the departments at your
University so where am I going where I
went to school we had a whole track
within computer science that was focused
on human-computer interaction how people
use computers so if where you're going
to school actually has that in their
software engineering that would be
really cool maybe your industrial design
major has some track that's more
software engineering focused - or like
if they do any hardware maybe they have
programming classes that you can take it
kind of just depends on how you can
twist each individual major because they
both are very relevant if your goal is
to be a UX designer would you say to be
out out set industrial design it's
different I mean not really because
you're like your iPod has user
experience yeah definitely you can tell
I have no idea what you guys you want
I hate me go to school no no do it do go
to school if that's what I think I think
that yeah like starting out with
statement of I wanna be a UX designer is
the right thing to do deciding up from
what it is that you want to do and then
look at both of those courses yeah and
like you were saying you like it depends
on the school and the tracks they have
windows
if you got accepted into both it'd be
really cool both that'd be awesome
oh no yeah man this is a hard luck
decision but it's not too hard to
remember like you from graduated school
with like a an English major and do
awesome program you know what I mean
like it's not about necessarily I go to
school and be an awesome designer you
could not go to school well these are
all options it is less about in my
opinion anyway and I have a really
skewed opinion of things because I've
been nothing into college but it is in
my opinion is less about where you went
and who you were topped by or the
accreditation or how much you spent in
college but it's more about like
everyday are you trying to learn in in
like are you like thirsty for more and
that's kind of like it I mean just two
things just uh you know if you're
watching things on on YouTube like this
and then that shows that you are thirsty
and I definitely got more knowledge and
more real-world experience by doing
things outside of school and doing side
projects while I was in college so like
even if you make the wrong choice now
you can still do what you want you just
can still you know achieve your goals
yeah yeah man best of luck to you and
you know talk to your advisers somebody
could yeah better okay this is the last
no it's not this is the second last
question it's from playboy city can you
talk about workflow the first things you
do and what you need to know when you
start a new project for example what
questions you need to ask or like do you
start in Photoshop or you need to know
the content etc okay so how do you use
to do good start with a new project so
when I start a new project I usually
just like immediately start coding cuz
that's the fastest way I can get to
something that it's the fastest way you
can get to whatever is in my head
actually like see it and visualize it
and interact with it but I think it
depends on like whatever tool you're
most comfortable with like for you I
think it would probably be mocking it up
in like Photoshop
HTML just to see how it feels and see
what it looks like it's just kind of I
guess for each person it's going to
depend like what specific take they have
on their process yeah but for me I look
how they should start code you just
start coding yeah that's what I do
that's a really that's a really
applicable advice because like you know
where your strengths are that's where
you can make the best decisions and that
says a lot I would have taken it even a
further step back you're not saying what
you're saying is wrong but the first
thing I would do is like try to do those
like discovery kind of things like who
was the audience of this thing sure
actually yeah like what are the business
goals of the person or yourself or
whoever's you know inspiring or paying
for this project and like like answering
those really key questions well will
direct your decisions later on I give
you make those really important
decisions yeah now when you're coding
you don't just say like actually the
audience is not who I thought it was and
that actually made it you may make that
decision the audience is for X and then
when you're coding three months thinker
though they were wrong figure out a TI
exactly right yeah that's true that's
okay but as long as you like have an
understanding for at least a thesis
along the way like you're gonna you're
gonna make the decisions that you're
gonna make are gonna be a lot easier to
do so like like for example is my
audience like young hip tech-savvy high
schoolers I'm gonna I'm gonna be able to
do like a lot of things that you
wouldn't be able to do for like a
retirement brochure or website you know
what I mean yeah so yeah so defining the
audience and then like typically my
workflow goes like that after I do that
like I would think about the UX not the
UI in the US how does somebody approach
this product and I use a tool called
mind node and it helps me map things out
it's a mind mapping tool and I think
about like what type of things should
the first experience be when they arrive
at the homepage how do they enter
it what what are the navigation options
where do they go from there how do they
get to those other sections of the
website if it's a website and and that's
like even before I'm thinking of the the
structure the composition layer of the
page I'm just thinking of how do people
approach the work yeah and and then
after that I would just get out a pencil
sketch to draw stuff yeah it's faster
sketching mock-ups is definitely like
again I write code but I think if you're
wanting to do things in the same way
that's not stupid and not where you're
going to throw out a ton of work later
it's really good to either Sketch up
your your layouts or even use something
like balsamic to actually sort of do it
on a computer to have it a little bit
more flexible yeah I mean the sketches
that I do are like on napkins a lot of
the times even in the office yeah I'll
be talking to like a product manager and
I'll pull out a napkin like like
literally a Kleenex and I'll have to
sketch on it lightly because it'll bleed
through I'll sketch what I'm thinking
and show it to them like yeah that's
good for I personally don't do
wireframes at all in unless you consider
those sketches why I don't like I'm
really fast in Photoshop so tools like
balsamic and I mean you're good about
talking that's good but personally for
me I just want to with them and I'm
really faster this pencil and I'm really
fast with Photoshop so I just jump the
thing and some people may crucify me for
that but I really don't care
it's what I'm coming to look we just be
your initial statement yeah let's do it
you're comfortable and then and but I
don't like make all of the decisions in
Photoshop Photoshop mock-ups don't need
to be pixel perfect or like have
everything thought out I often will get
like yes this looks good these in
Photoshop these are the assets that I
need the icons or the photographs or
whatever and then when I'm in coding
when I'm coding I'm still deciding about
colors I'm deciding on proportion all
the time I mean I'm like constantly
making decisions as I go but having made
those big decisions in
beginning I have to freedom to the small
and since I go and I'm not stressed out
over a door or overcome by the huge
things that I haven't discovered yet so
that's the basic workflow that I go
through and it sounds like you working
more on cuz I that's like a really like
holistic thing like that's if you're
doing it all on your own but you said
you weren't mostly on projects with
people within school and also you were
camping with people yeah yeah so in that
in that case in somebody who is
responsible for a very specific part go
right to your strengths
yeah yeah cool that's that's a lot of
talking you know what that helps last
question this last question comes from
Hank McCoy and the question is what are
some of the tools that you cannot live
without
listen fun oh yeah yeah yeah it's really
dirty things are up to lately
what tools can't I live without that's a
lame answer the first thing that comes
to my head is chrome like this little
browser is the expensive very very like
claim answer but if you're coding and
doing even you know design with a
complicated tool you're gonna need to be
looking up things like you know how do I
do this in code or you know I have some
really crazy JavaScript that I need to
write has someone already written part
of that for me so I think having a web
browser and really it's not even calm
it's really Google and I'm being able to
use Google effectively it's like a huge
part of being able to cope effectively
at least in my opinion a different route
than I was thinking you're not ago I
thought you're gonna talk about the
Chrome web tools now developer tools no
no now you're talking about just the
ability yes search the internet for
knowledge I think that's totally
undervalued when you're like trying to
code I think any good coder should like
know how to effectively use Google
effectively like go to stack overflow
and find the right answers or whatever
design side they're using as a
that's massively important especially
what you're learning
yeah 90% of the time other people have
figured out the problem that you're
trying to figure out yeah no reason to
figure it out it's bigger problems
together
I would like piggyback on that and say
that they actually Chrome developer
tools really cool actually
Safari updated there's it looks really
great for this so much club well or beat
is this but like just like it's just
because it's like I love opening the
inspector and tabbing through different
values like hype right I'll just go this
shift tab up and seem like does this
element look big or small and can't do
that anymore and so far be able to
actually enter the specific number to
hit enter
yeah you can't have a chrome dev torso
nice I love it being able to or not as
pretty as support like a change in
problem RVT even like changing hard to
be one of the RGB CMYK and HSL yeah on
colors it's huge yeah that's a really
good one switch over to HSL find a
different cue again and export it or not
exported bit switch it back over to it's
pretty cool I didn't think it looks like
what what do you use so I'm fairly
boring I just use the terminal code
editor help them if I actually wanted to
be doing things correctly or
occasionally like I'll mess with github
Adam dial or sublime text they're both
pretty nice but I just invested too much
time learning them and it kind of rover
me to use anything else people they use
them really look yeah but it's got like
a kind of a learning curve on it doesn't
it it makes when you first learn them
you have to make sure to turn turn the
like terminal alarm sounds off because
vim is a great way to just sit there and
as you hit keys your terminal is just
going to make tons of noise noise yeah
yeah yeah really yeah vim is great for
doing that because you're going to be
typing things and you're not going to be
in a right editing mode because there's
multiple editing modes
them of course so you're gonna be typing
the amount of thing the users on those
boards yeah that's our nest right okay
um boom okay cool yeah what about like I
don't know anything like the freaks out
but here I go and I used dimensions it's
a Chrome extension where you can you
open up the Chrome extension that you
put your URL of a project you're working
on inside of it and you can really
easily easily like snap it around at
different presets and Heights and widths
for like doing responsive code that's
really cool so I like for doing Ajax
requests and testing API is if you're
building back-end code I like using
postman just lets you really easily
issue Ajax requests from your browser
without having to write JavaScript so
you can kind of test different api's see
how they work like see what different
parameters do it's a really easy way
what all of the things you say are way
over my head
yes now what you're just gonna you're
going to delete every single hotness set
up every channel is basically I'm doing
this video alone I'm sure it's gonna be
useful to somebody whatever the hell you
said just consulted me a minor repeated
like random cafe when I need brain
noises and cafe noises at the same time
what is it it's raining cafe it's what
the name it gives you like white noise
but it's it gives you two little on/off
buttons and two sliders to adjust the
volume and it has how much cafe noise
you want and how much training does he
want
that's really what I really need to
focus I don't want to listen to music
yeah interesting yeah yeah that was the
other one I was gonna say it would be
like Spotify or iTunes really happy
music is so important especially in the
office setting or video is Jeff
you had headphones yes big tool that
you'll share phones are not only good to
still listen to music or rain samus ring
cafe sounds but they're also good to
like make people go away cuz if you have
a big huge set of headphones on and
people walk over to you throw less
likely to plug you yeah you just think
it's just ignore they get a noise can't
sleep I tasted headphones off slowly
yeah and like look at them like what
