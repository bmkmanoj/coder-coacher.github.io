feel like we're bringing this
relationship to a whole new level we
should get a puppy together ah in this
video we're going to look at another
type of parallax that I refer to in the
first video of this series
parallax on the web in this video we're
going to cover something that I called
landing elements this is when as you
scroll down the page things move in and
appear and they land in the right spot
on your layout we've been working on
this project a clothing store website
let's continue on and make some product
thumbnails that move in and land one by
one as you scroll down the page like
that you can find the files I usually
create this example on github there is a
link in the description below this is
the third video in the parallax series
let's get into it we're picking up
exactly where we left off last week
and I have the project open up
everything I mean if you're watching
video 2 video this is going to be a
really smooth seamless transition so
we've got the parallaxing header right
here and if you again if you haven't
seen how we built this I went through
every step of the code check that video
out the previous video we did it last
week all right what we're going to do
now is we're going to add some store
elements below the clothing store so
let's go back to our index file and we
have the content here and this is where
we're going to be working in mostly
under this paragraph here I'm going to
put another HR that's a horizontal rule
and then we'll just make a bar across
there yeah so we're going to create a
grid of images that people can you know
see there see our clothing line remember
this is a clothing store Blackbird
clothes so let's create that grid and
this would be called this sectional
called clothes pics or something as I
explained in the video last week we're
using skeleton framework so it does come
with this little handy dandy little grid
so in I'll enable the grid by typing out
row and then I just want to name this
row compared to any other row that you
might see of an image - row because it's
going to fill of images and this grid is
going to be comprised of
figure elements and those figure
elements are going to be called columns
this is these are skeleton classes
columns and one we want there to be four
columns sorry we want there to be three
columns and skeletons this is a twelve
column grid so you know four goes into
12 three times so if we put columns for
meaning that this column is four units
wide we'll have three of them after
we're done with that so we need the
image to show up and the image is going
to be source equals I have these models
here these images of beautiful people
wearing beautiful clothes and I got them
from Zara calm and don't tell them I
stole their images for this for this
example tutorial so the source will be
images model 1 - jpg not - JPEG dot jpg
silly pants okay so there's our model
right there and we need how many of
these do we need we need three of them
across ok and let's change up the model
so this would be number two and this
will be number three okay there's a grid
of three models and we want to repeat
this these three rows we want to repeat
this row three times as well now get you
guys back into position here
okay now we have a grid of nine models
cool so let's jump into our layout sass
now here's we have the base styles from
before we have the parallax styles that
we did in the last video and under that
list just we'll just say model grid I
guess so looking at the model grid I can
see that we have a nice what is this
like 20 20 pixels of padding a little
bit more even pixels of padding between
the images and I would like that for the
bottom so I'll say what did we call this
thing again pick something pick clothes
picks clothes picks clothes - pigs and
we want to look at the figures inside
figure and the figure will have a that
margin margin bottom let's add 20 pixels
there okay looks good and we want to
make these figures position relative now
I think that we've got the grid set up
nicely how we like it
I want to animate them in overtime let's
see how we're going to do that let's
jump into our functions and now we're
already listening to a window scroll
event which is good let's say if let's
get let's get with this right here this
is going to get weird the window scroll
so that's the number that of the our
position of our window scroll rights
like when we scroll down it says how how
far have we scrolled so if that number
is bigger than this next number so
alright pay attention right here so
we're going to look at from an element
in the Dom called clothes pics clothes
pics - pics pic clothes clothes pics
look at the element in the Dom okay so
find that and we'll see offset and how
far is offset from the top
so right here we're saying look at look
at how far close pics is from the top of
the of the Dom and let me Shh okay we'll
have an if and I'll fire a you know I
said I'm a nervous Nellie if I do a
console.log and the last one we did was
we just said hi all right let's look in
the console all right oh oh it's offset
not off it off set so when I'm looking
at this this design my console log of
the message hi is not firing until the
top of this this div called close picks
gets to the top of the window as soon as
it hits it's going to start firing that
high message okay so now that we have a
delayed a delayed kind of like trigger
we can use that to say okay these things
these images these models are now in
view let's animate them in okay so what
we're going to do is we're going to take
a look at these close pics whose pics
and the figure that are in them right
and we'll say each so what this is going
to do is going to iterate over each one
we have nine of them and this is going
to select each of them individually and
start doing some functions so this says
anything that's inside of this happens
to every one of these each is ever
happens to every one of these figures in
order right and because javascript is so
fast it'll seem to us likely just happen
all at once and that's fine let me show
you right now so what I want to happen
is to grab these close picks right
figure
and an add a class of is showing so
let's go to our element centered BOM
header no section content article close
picks and here's a few of the figures so
these have a class of column 4 and when
I scroll to the right position they
should all get they the class of is
showing and there they go is showing
fantastic ok that's exactly what I
wanted to do so now let's manipulate the
CSS to kind of bring about this kind of
animated in gesture okay so let's say
when the figure has a class and is
showing we want what we want the opacity
is going to be 1 meaning that when it's
not is showing will say opacity is 0 so
we're going to fade it in and cut in in
opacity and also we're going to say
trans form translate let's say translate
X just so we can have just that one
property 0 pixels so translate 0 pixels
means that we're going to start it
somewhere else I will just say like
negative 20 pixels let's move it in and
fade it in when it when it happens
something's wrong here
we got the is showing what's the problem
here let's see the function I'm adding
the class with a dot in front of it
dummy
okay so let's try it again scroll down
and when the close picks hit the top
these guys should fade in okay that was
actually quite abrupt what I need to do
is go what I need to do is add some
trans trans musician
everything's trans transition is going
to be all zero point three seconds and
ease in out cool now let's try it again
we'll scroll down uh-huh
see them you see you see you see they
just fell in from the left one of them
to come in from the right but they kind
of do it all at once right they kind of
all just move in at once as a grid we
can make it to where they move in one at
a time and we'll do that by saying we'll
use this iteration of each and we'll use
a set timeout function and right here
and they got to put an eye in there to
count each one
okay so set timeout each one of these
will happen and then but we want to
count them right so we'll say EQ which
means like look at the index and find
the right one and we'll use that by eye
okay so this is a that I did that a
little fast that make sense was
happening will say don't don't do
anything until a certain time happens
and this is the number that we get from
which one we're iterating on and we'll
say find the number of the one that
we're on after the set timeout and and
add the class now after the set timeout
is done we want to wait how long 150
seconds times the iterator which is I
plus 1 and then we need to close our
brackets okay so that should be
basically they should all they should
all animate in after 150 milliseconds of
each other does that happen it didn't
happen what's happening here
undefined 23
oh I need to define the eye that's
coming from the each here okay now we I
put that I in the wrong spot not on this
function it's on this function which
counts the iteration the iteration goes
to account each one that it should be
selecting of the figures when the set
timeout occurs and a set timeout should
be off offset for each one at 150
milliseconds plus whatever number it's
on
so like number two would be 300
milliseconds and that's how they come in
one by one so let's refresh this scroll
down a little bit trigger that little
thing and there we are coming in each
one at a time
scroll down okay now the big problem
with this is that the animation does not
get triggered until like the boxes at
the top of the screen but look at this
all this white space why would anybody
scroll all the way down there there's no
reason to anybody would actually scroll
down that way if there's no content
there so we want to trigger this
animation like kind of like right around
like there you know like kind of kind of
a lot earlier so that's going to happen
right here when we set off set top let's
say offset top minus 500 and that will
move it down so look when it's 500
pixels from the top it'll start moving
in and that's okay but you can never
like really be sure how tall somebody's
browser is so if they're using a really
short browser like this is 500 pixels
going to be enough yeah maybe but let's
be a little bit more smart about it so
instead of saying like giving it a hard
number we'll say why don't you find out
how big the window is and it will do it
by the same window height and then take
that and divide it by two actually
that'll be a hundred percent of the
height to 1.5 so it'll be like the
middle of the screen so this should
happens when the yeah
and now too much 1.2 good good ok so the
animation is not going to be triggered
triggered until these guys are one other
20% into the space good I like that now
no matter where the the box is like if
you want to put some content above it or
something you know like it'll happen
when it's when the container of clothes
picks is 20 percent within the the
viewport of the browser I like it I like
it now this is just one way to create
this effect and I like these kind of
things because there's just so many
creative ways to get it done this video
