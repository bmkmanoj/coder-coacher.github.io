now welcome to our 10.1 in a video
series I call design and code my
personal website in 12 hours after this
we only have two hours left I hope we
can do it all in time we got a lot to do
ah just a review from what we did last
week the vine right above in the design
behind me and then what we're doing this
week is this right here right here on
the left is the drill section and right
here on the right is the behance section
now these are two kind of design
portfolio sites that I am most active on
however not completely I could I don't
think I've updated anyone any one of
them like this year but if I wanted to
show my work this would be how I would
do it and let's just get started as with
the other videos I need to start this
one by creating the files that we're
going to be working in I might speed
this part of the video up just for fun
leet okay so as a review we've added a
home dash design sass file and included
it into our main dot s CSS file we've
also created a section - design Jade
included it into our index dot HTML so
we're ready to begin coding so the first
thing we're doing is we're just looking
in this section
- design Jade and we noticed that
because we duplicated it from the
columns Jade it has a bunch of columns
in it and those columns are reflected
already in our design because we're
using gulp and it auto updates so let's
identify the column structure that we
want to utilize for this section so
let's go back to our design and check it
out so what we want here are two kind of
halfway this is unique and that we're
splitting the design basically in half
for different two different backgrounds
so I would like to use the the called -
50 on there and then also notice that
inside of the call - 50 we want centered
elements
things similar to something you know we
haven't exactly done something like this
yet probably the most similar to this
right here where it's in a 50 and then
in in a centered as well probably
similar to the article section the most
but if there's gonna be different in a
key way okay so let's go to the 50s and
duel to start there and this is what I'm
talking about this last one here so get
rid of the other ones and we're gonna
say flex flex Center yes and then flex
or call 50 flex flex Center that's
correct
and then a call one inside of it that's
that's correct on both accounts because
we want both of these columns to
basically be the same thing so I'll just
copy these classes and put it onto this
flex 50 that all looks good let's save
the design and see how that looks in
terms of our grid yeah so we have let's
pull up our inspector and show you we
have two columns that are floating
inside of a 50% wide situation and then
they're inside of the this section all
right let's just start with filling out
these sections with content in our code
or just going to delete the lorem here
because that's not what we're doing we
actually want to fill up if we look at
the design again we have two headlines
updating dribble and then the other one
is an behan so I'm gonna copy this one
and we're gonna put that in this
paragraph but it's gonna be called a
what's that class a home lead home lead
and then it's gonna called updating
dribble in a similar fashion this next
one is going to be called and behance
okay cool and then they're gonna have a
right under that some you know boxes and
then right under that we're gonna have
the call to action so that's a and then
the ref because it's an anchor tag and
then we're gonna call it home CTA and
the first one is see more on drivel
one two three three B's and then we're
gonna do that again
for see more on behance cool we should
have two headlines and then under them
to call to actions in this renders okay
that looks good next let's fill in the
content of the actual thumbnails let's
go back to the design to show you what I
mean
here are there are thumbnails here and
these are from dribble and from Behance
and I've already got a bunch selected
and if I go into my images you'll see
this green means I added them recently
and it has not been merged yet that's
the cool thing about Adam is that it
keeps track of your github commits so
all the green that you see in the
sidebar is added and the the orange or
yellow or whatever that is is edited and
then the grey is untouched so that's
just a little tidbit for you but anyway
I have all these thumbnails of projects
that I'm going to be adding into the
design I've already extracted them from
Behance and from dribble and so we need
to place them so when I place them I'm
gonna be doing there they're all gonna
be links right so I'm call it an anchor
tag and I'll just call that like design
image link and in the link I'll actually
put the image itself image' SRC equals
and then the source of it which if we go
back to our tree is going to be in
assets
/ image / design - image - image and
then you know whatever they are so the
first one in dribble would be like drib
- one dot jpg save let's see what
happens here on our code there you go
midlife crisis okay so the image shows
up and it's fantastic the only thing we
need to remember is that we need to get
the the anchor we need to get the URL
for every like place it needs to go to
if they want to see this you know the
real project on B Hance or honourable
they're gonna go there so we need that
link and then we need the the thing
right here and that's all going to be
the same so so since we're gonna have
all these projects and there's six
projects for each for dribble and for
Behance let's abstract that code chunk
right there and put it in a mixin so
that we can easily replicate and
duplicate well just write the word mix
in and give it a name I'll call it
design image and that should be fine for
now and I'll show you how to extend that
in a second but we have this mixin
called design image and we're just gonna
bump the code block under because
remember jada is all about nesting
properly and indenting so I'm gonna bump
that code under the mix in and now it's
a part of the mix in so how to call that
mixing in I'm gonna go + design - image
looking good so if I save it and wait
for it to refresh there should be no
significant changes let's see
because all I did was just abstract that
code block and call it in once but as I
said there's gonna be six there's gonna
be six of these design blocks these
thumbnail blocks for each
one of these things called like
portfolio sites so here let's just
quickly throw those in here two three
four five six and then I'm gonna do the
same for the hands okay great
now let's spend some time with this mix
in going back and making it so it's easy
to enter the right content so we don't
want all of these thumbnails to be this
midlifecrisis design we want them all to
be you know the the various ones that
they should be the ones that i've
selected before i started this video how
we're gonna do that the few things that
do change are number one the link so in
our mix in we put a paren after the name
of the mix in and we can start defining
things the first thing we want to define
is the link the second thing we want to
define is with the actual images so
we're gonna put IMG so well let's go
find the link where the link needs to be
and put hash curly brace curly brace
that's the real curly input link and
then let's go to the source we know that
all of them are gonna be in this folder
but we don't know what their name is and
we don't know what their extension is
there some pings in there so we'll put
hash Curly's not-p hash curlies and IMG
now to pull in those arguments from the
mixin into each one of these instances
of the mix in we have to do the same
behind it so we're gonna make a paren
and then in the order that we defined
them in the mixin we're gonna say what
the you know what the values are for
those arguments and the first one is the
link so I have found my clipboard in
quotations I'm going to put the link
there and then I'm gonna do a comma and
then the next and the next argument is
the image name and that one's gonna be
drib - 1 dot jpg JPEG okay let's save
that out now what should happen when
this refreshes all of those images of
the midlifecrisis should disappear
only one should be available yes because
all these URLs are now broken because
they're not defined in the subsequent
mix-ins down below great so I'm gonna
take a minute and probably make this go
really fast so that I can quickly fill
in just like the boring stuff the URLs
and the of the the links and then the
source for the images so be with you in
one second okay I lied about changing
all the URLs I don't really care right
now I'll do that later but what I wanted
to show you is the images themselves so
I have all the the correct URLs and all
the images have have changed I think all
the images are pretty good right now the
only thing we have to do that we haven't
done yet is actually to name this
section so I'm just gonna call this
section design saved
okay now let's head over to the styles
and we're going to start with section
dot design and there's a lot we need to
do for these styles to make them look
right let's go back to our design and
reference them so these these images are
two up side by side and you know we've
got colors in the background and got
this background pattern and everything
so let's just start with the let's start
with the images because those are kind
of like the most annoying bit when
they're not right so so what we called
them right was design image link and we
want them to be side-by-side like I said
so we're gonna float them left and in
order to fit its floated left they need
to be with 50% because that won't oh do
you see what happened look at this okay
so we floated the images left and then
we've said width 50 and remember the
design image link is a ref it's an
anchor tag which is which can't take
dimension on it because it's a an inline
element and because of that see this
text how it floated up on the on the
right of it that's because that's
because this image is floated left so
text
you know naturally wraps around floated
alliances is they actually the use case
of the you know float that's kind of
funny I didn't expect that because I
wasn't thinking about it if I was
thinking about it I would have said
display this play the block Oh
again there I am with death okay there
we go now we have the images that are
50% wide and oh so this is interesting
the the containers of the images are 50%
see this but look at the one next to it
all right there if there are like these
little squares but at the same time the
images that are inside of the containers
are sticking out so what we want to say
is design image link if there's an image
inside of that we'll say max width is
100% and that will shrink the whole
thing down to the what they should be
like more yeah that's good that's good
now you see this this this drop shadow
it's going all the way up to this whole
block because these these are still
floating left and that the button
container is floating all the way up to
the top let me show you if I hover over
home CTA it's this whole thing so we
need to do a clear fix right after this
last one so let's go into our section
here and add a new file or add a new
line and we'll say div actually just do
class CF I guess for clear fix class CF
okay and in the section design we need a
new element here called class C F and in
that we'll say clear not clear fix clear
both there we go that fixed it and we
want to add a little bit of margin to
the top of that just muffle R at it
because you'll notice in the design the
there's needs to be a little bit of love
right there
so save
oh not margin top margin bottom there we
go okay that's good for now let's go
back to this these links here you see
the gap below the images here that's
because the images themselves are still
in line block so let's change their
display type to to block and we should
get it tight yeah nice and tight now
that they're nice and tight we can be
more predictable about how we're gonna
you know display because we do want
looking at the design we do want a
little gap between them and actually a
border and a drop shadow let's do that
let's describe this in it with code
right here so that the border looks like
maybe like two pixels solid white and we
have this drop shadow which is like a
box shadow looks to be it looks to be
about the same style of the of the
button itself let's just quickly open
the button sass and just grab this line
here cheating
I know but okay cool
now because we added the border on it
let's not stop there let's not stop
there let's go say let's say border drop
shot a drop shadow and then want to add
some margin between them too so margin
like five pixels all the way around top
bottom left right okay now because we
added these new dimensions and the width
is 50% it's gonna start wrapping down
because you can't fit this element which
is 50% of the width plus two pixels
border plus five pixels margin into one
line so we need to go up to the width 50
percent and then compensate by doing a
calc putting it in a paren we want to
say 50% minus two borders on each side
of two so it's 4 plus 10 so 14 so the 10
comes from
the 10 comes from the two margins on
each side left and right so let's save
that and then we go there we are
so that's all looking phantasm ish then
hmm I do not like how this headline is
rapping I do not like it one bit I do
not like it with a fox or in a box so
I'm actually going to go in and override
this size of this headline and possibly
even the call to action sighs - and
while I'm at it it should be centered so
a section design make a new line for a
home lead that's what that line is and
we'll say text-align:center that's good
and then wit font size let's just say
with 30 yeah 30 130 ok 30 is good I it's
fine with me I'm fine with that
I'm fine I'm fine with you guys don't
worry don't worry 30 is good and we also
want to do the same kind of thing to the
home dot CTA or - CTA and change its
font size 24 pixels there it just gives
it a little bit better balance the
string of you know see moron dribble
it's a little long and this this
balances out it out a little bit better
now let's make the difference between
these sections really stand out so let's
go back to our markup get rid of button
sass go back to our markup each one of
these columns has you know its own
design so I'll just put a you know on
the column 50 dot B hands cool so now I
can call it here in the
design I'll say dribble your back ground
color it should be dribble color which I
know is EA 4c 89 I know that because I'm
crazy oh look at this our home lead
needs to be at color white actually all
of it needs to be color white there we
go alright so you got the background
color there we also have a background
image that I haven't shown you guys yet
so the background image in the design is
this map which is just like a design
like a topography map you know you like
a map of elevations and stuff I just
thought it was just an interesting
design has no real you know value or
meaning to it it's just it's just
decoration which is fine sometimes so
let's get that I have that extracted
already and it's gonna be called URL
assets image design BG pink cool and I
think it's okay if it kind of repeats
itself I could do it better
make the lines connect a little bit
better but anyway we'll talk about that
later maybe so let's say position put in
the center and repeat is repeat is
happening about default okay and next
let's add some padding let's just say 50
on the top and bottom and zero on the
left and right good mmm
think we're gonna do the same thing for
the Behance section except for we'll
just override it a little bit right here
so we'll say we'll say and I'm gonna be
hands
so weird selector but I just want to do
a quick override background color and be
Hans's color is pound one seven have it
written down here six nine FF it's a
blue cool where's that CTA okay here at
home CTA will say color want to add the
B hats pink or the dribble pink and then
let's make an exception for B hands as
well here and we'll say color I'm gonna
get that blue
okay now the CTA is nice in blue pink
blue good good the only other thing
that's busted right now is the padding
on the section right here is 50 pixels
which we just removed here padding:0
pixels and then because we added it to
the dribble and the and the what's it
called the hands section internally we
don't need it wrapped around through the
you know the wrapper
what's when I here section why is it not
I'm gonna inspect this section and look
at it
okay the padding is getting applied and
then it's getting overwritten because
instead of just section design its home
sections and then design alright I'll
just make a little bit of a stronger
selector say home sections design put
that padding over there that should win
looking fantastic
looking fantastic let's check out how
this works out on mobile go down down
down there we are and pinch it in and
pinching pinching sidebar goes away
looks good pinching pinching what's
happening now
updating dribble this is interesting
okay so we're still two up which is good
we have this situation where the
thumbnail is because I said max with
where I said right here I said max with
so it's not going beyond its natural
size which is like 200 pixels or
something so if I say width and say even
if you're 200 pixels wide go further
it should just grow to fill its spot
maybe a little bit blurry images but you
know such as life that worked okay let's
bring it back down looking good looking
good
right about there is as small as it
would go the links are not repping the
headline is not wrapping I think I like
it right there but what if we did more
tuning tomorrow for the exciting
conclusion but before you click off I
want to tell you how much I love my
patrons in there a wonderful world where
people like this exist
patrons support the show by pledging a
few dollars for one episode a week and
the money goes entirely back into the
show so I've been able to purchase
things like that green screen that makes
a little traffic possible and the GoPro
in which I do the bullet for the vlogs
it is really awesome but patients also
receive other benefits I share with them
videos a few days early and we recently
started patron led hangouts where we've
been discussing Jade and SAS and also
WordPress recently and you can see that
past episodes of those hangouts on a
playlist on the dev tips channel page
find out more about becoming a patron
yourself at patreon.com slash dev tips
and I'll see you tomorrow for ten point
two and until then keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
