and space are no longer what do you
think they are and the lots of physics
no longer bind us to this plane of
rational being is just Depp dibs
ah this is our seven point one in a
series I call design and code my
personal website in twelve hours today
we're going to dive right into the
mentoring section now this section
turned out to be a little bit more
complicated than I had planned mostly
due to the way that I handled the
testimonials section and then made that
work on mobile but those are covered in
the next few days in our 7.2 and 7.3
today we're going to do the markup and
style for this section so let's get into
it
let's start by looking at our Photoshop
file and taking a look at what we're
going to be building today so we've
already built the introduction or the
hero shot and the YouTube section today
we're gonna be building this mentor ting
section so a little word about mentoring
awhile ago I thought you know wouldn't
it be nice to have just like one-on-one
conversations with people and so I gave
out I think it was 20 or so free
mentoring sessions where you know
they're just phone calls between 15 20
minutes and just talked with people
about what they're going through maybe
some insights that I've had along the
way and they turned out to be really
really good I really enjoyed them and so
did the people that I had conversations
with they seemed to enjoy them so what I
did is I just I asked them to you know
give a testimonial in return and then I
would start to build up this kind of
idea that it's something that I could
possibly do so so this is the mentoring
section and what I have here is very
similar to the sections above it right
there is that there's the lead paragraph
here and then there's a call to action
similar there is a lead paragraph right
here just four words in this case and
there is a call to action the background
here is a telephone it's actually funny
this this photograph
is I called Louis my podcast co-host and
then I put the phone down and waited for
him to answer it and then I took a
picture of him and then I just kind of
hung up on him
because I just needed the photograph I
didn't want to talk to him he was like
why did you why did you call me what did
you call me anyway so what I have here
is a bunch of faces in the first column
and then the the lead paragraph in the
second and I wanted to think you know
this would be like a something that
people could you know click on one of
these faces and then a new paragraph
would show up or a new like testimonial
bubble would show up and and I don't
really have a clear idea of how the the
interactions will happen um all I was
thinking that it would just be like a
kind of like a you know kind of like a
carousel or something like that maybe
it'd be yeah anyway so we're gonna get
to that when we won't get to it so but
right now let's get started these are
two columns that are centered together
we don't them to float away like they do
in the YouTube section so the the best
thing to do right now is just to create
the file so let's go in here to our Jade
files like we do and create a new file
and we're going to call this one
mentoring section mentoring mentoring
dot Jade and that's gonna be our first
file that we're gonna be working with
today let's go into that the columns
file and grab these first eight lines
these are the columns that we want right
there reflects Center two columns we
already talked about what that means in
the other videos and now that we have
the section mentoring Jade we need to
open up our we need to open up our index
and add the section mentoring to the
index file so it'll show up after the
YouTube so our mentoring and then it
should show up here but it will look
like just another column set right here
okay so let's go into mentoring
and not say sectioned other thing but
call it mentoring okay and now we need
to go in and create some sim sass it's
going to sections and create new file
call it underscore mentoring dot sass
how are we labeling the other ones Oh
none of these are the ones have
underscores well let's fix that
just real quick I'll fast forward this
you
we're gonna add home dot mentoring and
then we're gonna go into section mentor
and say section mentoring I'm gonna say
a back ground pink and I just do this
just to make sure that all of the pieces
are connected so if I hit save here on
right here this these two paragraphs
will turn pink say if something's wrong
what could it be
okay I need to start my server again
something something broke something
broke my server Oh mentorian okay so the
thing that's broken is that didn't name
this correctly so look at all these
other sections they have home -
mentoring needs to be renamed to home -
mentoring then save and now I have a
pink two columns everything is connected
everything is awesome we have a section
- mentoring Jade and a home - mentoring
SAS and that is that's exactly what we
want okay so we've turned it pink we
validated that this works and get rid of
that let's look at the Photoshop file
and see what we're supposed to be
building the first thing is easy enough
just that background right back ground
image we have it here is the image
mentoring BG this thing so URL min
touring - BG dot is it probably JPEG
can't remember and let's give it a say
okay there we are and we need to just do
some size here
cover and position Center just your
standard fare so far okay now let's look
at these first two columns we're gonna
have the second column here be the one
with the the lead and stuff let's just
open up let's open up YouTube section
YouTube Jade basically this stuff is
what I want to just duplicate really
quickly and close that out okay and it's
going to be right here
okay cool that looks good this content
of it is going to be a little bit
different it's going to be called
mentoring people like you and the CTA is
going to call schedule a call and I
don't have a link for that yet I need to
build that internal page so we'll just
leave it blank for now and let's grab
some colors so the color of this text is
that and the lead is gonna be white so
color okay that's all white and then
what's this thing called again the home
CTA home CTA color is that with a hash
in front of it cool uh looks looks
really good let's look at our Photoshop
file now we have we have the two columns
here on the Left or all the faces and on
the right are columns but it's pushed
down a fair bit mm-hmm let's worry about
that later so let's fill this first
column with faces get rid of this
paragraph here and you know this would
be a good this would be just a good
unordered list right so ul Haq faces and
then each one of these is going to be a
list with a class of face and the
background of the face is going to be
declared actually in the mark-up the
image of the face is going to be
declared in the markup so I'll say a
background - image
is equal to URL like that and we'll use
HTTP fill and comm slash how big do
these things look like they are here
let's see looks like it's about 80
let's do 80 bit 80 wide and 80 tall
that's for the image and then then we
have to have so like well okay so we
need to have a space for this bubble and
we'll nest that bubble inside of the
face container it'll be a child look at
my beard it's cool we'll do that like
like this how about how about something
like this bubble and inside the bubble
are gonna be the paragraphs and let's
just grab this paragraph here and then
adjacent to that like it's like a
sibling of the the paragraph is gonna be
another element let's say like who is
this from right Nathan Jacobs at this
point okay Nathan Jacobs okay and then
we're gonna do it looks like one two
three four like six of these things I'm
gonna capitalize on Jade
right now Jade has this awesome feature
called mixin and a mix in allows you to
just make repeatable kind of modules
that are like really simple and easy to
use so I'll just cut all this content
right here and go above and say you just
write the word mix in
and all its clothes from face because
each one is a face and then you can have
parameters in there like URLs and names
and stuff and we'll get to that later
but right now I just want to have this
markup being able to be repeated so I
have the mix in face right there and
I'll just say plus face and I'll do that
six times two three four five six now I
should have six faces six paragraphs and
it should work pretty easily okay looks
like looks like it worked right but we
need to do a whole lot of styling to
this to make it work right so let's jump
over to our styling home mentoring sass
file that's what we're talking about and
faces first of all I want to take see
these little these little bullet points
here that's because they're in a list so
I'll just remove that list style it is
none moves the bullets there okay and
then let's take a look at these faces
you know actually first let's just get
rid of let's just get rid of this bubble
and just deal with that later right for
now I want to style just each face so
I'll say dot face and your height is
gonna be we said 80 pixels and your
width will be the same 8 0px and so now
we have some dimension there we just
have a really awesome Phil Murray
looking good but you're looking good
let's take that border radius and make
it 50% make it turn these all into
circles and now I can I can rely on Bill
Murray it feel Murray bill Phil bill I
can rely on his dimension being 88
that's what I asked for specifically but
when I pull in avatars from you know
everybody who gave quotes for like
Twitter or Google+ or wherever I get
them from I can't trust they're gonna be
80 80 so let's make sure to get us a
stranglehold on on the on the background
sizes here I say back ground size
is cover and position be a center that
looks good now they need some space
below them so say margin margin bottom
valve would say 35 pixels below how
about this box shadow and it looks like
on the Photoshop file they have a buck
shadow let me tell you what is for for
offset vertical it's a kind of blur of
eight and an opacity of 40
so that's 0px 4px 8px and RGB a zero
zero zero you go over there zero zero
zero a zero point before and then they
have the back drop shadow great now you
can see in the Photoshop father there's
some space above where this bubble can
kind of like heading into the other
section
so let's what well is there to measure
that really how much space does it need
to have it high 284 so there's 280 - the
the 50 pixels of padding that the the
section gives us is like what - 30 yeah
- 30 so we'll go in here - not home CTA
we're going to your it's called home
lead right and say margin top it's to go
to 50 pixels and that's right here oh I
called these things just lead lead but
they should be homely like what if I
want to use the the class of lead on an
internal page somewhere not on the home
you know so let's scope these
where did I put lead no I got this out
dented here on it's in the in the base
section but this is like these are home
specific files style so I'm going to
take these and move them actually and
move them on to the home section we can
make a little section called the home
the home layout style we can make a
section in that file called typography
and put it all there and I want to
prefix lead with home home lead and then
we can go into all of the Jade's input
home lead and it sounds like a little
pedantic I know but I think it's better
for a lot of reasons let's open the
YouTube dot J dand put home lead there
as well home lead like that and then
about dot Jade and say home lead ok
that's going to be better in the long
run because that lead a concept it's not
gonna sneak into subsequent pages
because its home lead let's tie the
bubble right so go into the bubble and I
will just grab one of the bubbles right
here what I did is I added a long form
HTML amongst all the mix ins that way I
can edit this one specifically because
all of the bubbles are hidden right now
and I want to take one of the one of
these faces and kind of opened the
bubble so here's a face and I'll write a
class of has bubble open yes and then
now I can go into the sass and say
bubble and then write something like
phase has bubble
open and say display:block is either be
displaying blacken house bubble looking
face nope face bubble and then and then
right bubble okay so okay all right so
this the third one has a face okay so
the third face here has a class of has
bubble open and the child bubble has a
display block which is fantastic now we
can style it right the first thing we
need to do obviously it's all it's all
cramped up in the position or sorry the
dimensions of its parent right we need
to release it let's make it
position:absolute so we need to float it
all up up and off to the off to the
right see how in the design here's the
face but it's like kind of off to the
right here so low face bubble
position:absolute and in order to do
that we need to have position relative
on the parent which is face so a
position absolutely we want it to be
pushed to all the way to the right right
so let's take the left and say 100 sent
and that will push it from the left all
the way out like that and then once
we've done that we can put some margin
left and just move it a little bit more
out maybe just another little little 5
pixels right there now the the we want
to move it up as well you see the design
here how the the foundation of the
bubble is in the middle of the face so
what that means is it will go not push
it
although
like we did the left will push it up
halfway and we'll start at the bottom
and move up 50% see that now it's
starting there I'm going up but it's
still maintaining the the the dimensions
of its parent right it's just 80 pixels
wide so let's change that by making this
bubble making this bubble wider we want
to be 300 pixels okay great now it looks
like a usable paragraph it certainly
certainly does and we'll do the obvious
things right like background black okay
not exactly black rgba 0 0 0 0 point 9
yeah and now you can see things from
below it lets say mm point 8 yeah that's
good get a padding of 20 and this is
gonna be fun border-radius
see this one here has on the design
they're really thick border radiuses
right here and then the apex of the
bubble that's pointing to the face is a
little bit smaller so the way you can do
this you can do this all in the like a
what is it like a shortcut not a
shortcut shorthand for the border radius
and you're going to start at the top
left and then you go top right bottom
right bottom left so the top left top
right and bottom right are all gonna be
the same radius of like to 180 pixels
something like this I could have
measured the design but it's my design
so do what I want little watt and then
like three pixels okay
maybe like five pixels maybe these 20s
they're a little bit more like thirties
mm-hmm maybe these 30s are a little bit
more like 40s than we thought
mm-hmm okay and then there's a stroke
around the roof what are these these are
more like 50 there's a there's a stroke
around this thing it's a white stroke
call it border two pixels solid white
boom I'm building for me too much three
ooh baby bear just right good let's move
it a little bit further away from that
from the face so how about ten pixels
yeah I think you're right okay now the
face is this is the the phase is the UL
I need to see you trying to pink for us
you can see what I'm looking at here I'm
noticing that the faces have a problem
and it's similar problem to what we
faced right here where these I wanted in
the design see how these faces go all
the way to the edge of the colored
section area and so do these these
thumbnails now the way we did it with
the thumbnails is to use negative
margins and control the height and we're
gonna do something very similar with
these faces now so to go to the faces
which is remember that's the that's the
unordered list and we'll say faces what
are we gonna say margin negative 50 for
the top and bottom and zero margin for
the right and left and then for the
height we're gonna say we want you to be
calculate this calc this 100%
Plus 100 pixels right because we're 100
each of these top and bottom margins we
need to make up for actual content size
we're the reason we put negative is so
we can overcome the padding that's
inherent to each of these sections that
we put on all the sections by default
and once you've overcome that we have a
really short and small faces ul you yet
unordered list and we want to compensate
for the negative margins by just
stretching that thing out 100% of the
height plus the hundred pixels that it
loses from having negative margins does
that make sense well it should because I
just hit save and that's what it looks
like that's exactly what we wanted to
happen now I can have this kind of I
mean look at it's perfect right
look at how you know this mentoring
section is this a lead words the
headline forget all you forget all my
language right now lalala okay
these words are positioned really well
to work with this balloon why are these
guys off to the right it's faces mmm I
see what you did it was it was a because
it's you L ahead like inferred padding
on there so I'm gonna get rid of it gone
okay earlier I said that only the
bubbles that have this style on of what
was it is open or something has bubble
open why don't I just change that a
little bit to hover so I can show you
what it looks like when you're gonna be
a mousing over all these other ones want
them to show up right pop pop pop pop
pop pop pop pop pop pop oh let's do a
little bit of a like a pop transition
and how are we going to do that so we'll
go down here to the hover in
not be displayed block and display:none
will change that to opacity opacity 1
and change display:none to opacity 0 and
a part of changing something from
opacity 0 to a pasty one is you have to
keep in mind that it's Oh Pacey doesn't
knock it out of a Dom like display:none
des display:none will remove it from the
Dom it will it will still you'll still
be able to click on things if it's even
if its opacity zero you can still
highlight all that text so we have to
use another CSS declaration that makes
that makes the thing unclick Abul and
that's called pointer events none now
that will mean that you cannot click on
it you cannot highlight any of the text
that's in it you can't do anything to it
your mouse doesn't even know that it's
there
so we're gonna transition that to all
like you know over the course of 1.3
seconds or something and it's gonna be
ease in out I'm gonna say that nothing
looks like it changed but now when I
hover over things it won't be just that
like pop it'll be Molokai shroo shroo
shroo
so here's here we go true sure sure
maybe a 1.3 or 0.3 is a bit fast
try to shoo shoo shoo swish swish swish
swish swish swish how about one true
Christian scripture so she just went
really like to better transmission
transmission straight straight straight
straight straight straight straight
straight straight okay I say um how
about how about this we're not only
going to transition the opacity but
we're gonna do trans form
scale and we're gonna take it from zero
and we're gonna make it pop pop pop
trans form scale to one right now it's
gonna go pop because it's a bubble pop
pop tram station transition I like that
but it's popping from the wrong place
right the bubble needs to come up so we
have this transform we have to use
another declaration called trans form -
origin and that we want it where do we
want it to come from we want to come
from the bottom in the left come out
like he's talking like this
so say bottom left are you ready let's
click it let's hover boom everybody
shows really strange dreams rent for so
it's coming from the bottom left like I
want it to looks pretty good but we can
make it look more bubbly so right now
it's just a linear sweat sweat sweat
shirt ring but what if I wanted to be
like chuan-shan
like a I go for a bubble like a huh I
don't I'm sorry I'm not making much
sense right now buddy let me show you
what I mean so if a mouse in here in my
inspector and I find the bubble I can
see that the easy easy now is like the
normal name for things right if I click
that I have a this is in chrome dev
tools I have this really awesome
graphical user interface a way for me to
edit the Bezier curve of the easing
property of this transition you with me
let me show you what I mean
I can grab these little handles right
here and actually make new easing so
instead of it going sure right now to go
swim see a little bubble pop pop pop and
that's just because if you can draw a
box here see this on the draw box there
so you have this top I'm trying to point
to it you see though you see the top
here how it was going out of the box
that means it was actually going to get
bigger than the scale which we said
would be ending at one so it's gonna go
like you know zero start at zero and
it's gonna go up to like 0.2 0.3 to 5
and then like then it's gonna go point 1
and then point 1 point 2 right bigger
than 1 and then back down to right up at
the end of this scale is going to go
it's gonna end at 1 so it's actually
like popping out like this pop-pop what
you can other things like it's like a
look at this one it's gonna go really
fast in the beginning and then really
slow whoo Wow see how's that Wow here's
another version of that it goes really
slow in the in the beginning and then
really fast at the end ha ha
but I like the bounce Dwayne Dwayne
let's do that too much too much bounce
right there let's try to make it a
little bit less but still respect the
bounce that looks good okay
so now that we have that bezzie a we
need to translate that back to our code
of course so let's grab this code right
here the oh wait can I just okay it's
here and grab that copy and go into here
our code where it said ease it out take
that keyword out and literally paste in
that be a cubic Bezier curve now these
are the plot points on the XY that give
us that curve that goes outside save
that and now we got the bounce stretch
right
shrine rush-rush wanna see looks good
looks good right okay here's a problem
these balloons are going outside of the
mentoring section so let's jump on up
back to here the mentoring section and
say over flow hidden Obi and now the
balloons will not pop out and now you'll
say hey but Travis how
I even read these if they popped out
well we're gonna do that with JavaScript
all right well this seems as good a
place as they need to stop and we will
come back tomorrow for our 7.2 we're go
we're gonna be doing all that fancy Java
scripting to make this functional and
what fun that will be if you've enjoyed
