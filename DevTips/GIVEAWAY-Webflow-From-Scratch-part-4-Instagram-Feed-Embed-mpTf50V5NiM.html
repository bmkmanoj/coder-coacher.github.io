web flow tutorial video that we're going
to be doing for a while but this is not
the last web flow we'll be talking about
I actually tomorrow I'm going to be on
the web flow broadcast stream and then
later on this week I'm gonna publish a
tour of the web flow office which is
gonna be really fun
but let's just jump into today's
activities we were continuing on with
the development of the podcast web site
today we're gonna be looking at how to
finish up those last three segments and
that includes importing a importing a
content stream a feed and Instagram feed

just so I can know who to email it to
once I choose the winner alright so
let's get started okay so we've done the
header here in the navigation and the
about the two dudes in the Cantina
section one two and three now
we're gonna jump down here and do this
next section number four want a shirt or
a sticker get one and let's just put a
big old squares and I guess he means
these are screenshots of stickers so
lucky for him I went out and found some
cool dribble shots of stickers and
t-shirts and so forth even though we
don't have any station shirts ready but
we're gonna do it anyway so this is
gonna be a pretty simple one I'm just
gonna go in here again and take that
first one oh cool the scrolls to it when
you click on it that's kind of cool and
I'm going to hold option and drag down
to the bottom and I think that one okay
so we're in the bottom and let's get rid
of this video we don't need it and I'm
gonna get running at one of these pair
get rid of that do we have a button
under these things we don't so we can
get rid of the button and so basically
you guys have a a heading in a paragraph
want a shirt or a sticker question mark
get one and it was before right or for
want a shirt or a sticker get one okay
now these squares the first thing we're
going to do is because I already have
these images here I'm gonna basically
upload them to upload them right here
upload desktop all for done and then now
there were like a grid here I'm gonna go
and grab some columns and put him after
this paragraph and the columns are gonna
be too which is good and then I'm gonna
put a I guess I could just drag these
things in right you I could do this I
could bring a or is an image in like
this image inside right yeah and then
from there like you just like block
things out and stuff like that with the
images why am i hitting that thing go
away there you and then after that you
drop the actual image on top of it I
think oh it didn't delete that I don't
think I did that right let me see
drag the image on top of this thing
replace image no I have no idea
double-click that replace image okay
asset manager the button okay
so it's easier just to drag these things
in but if you wanted to do the replace
let me show you how to do that again so
you can you can block things out with
images if you don't have your images
ready drop an image in there and then
when you're ready you just come back to
it and you know go double click and
replace the image you can upload
straight from there
or go to the asset manager and it just
like highlights over here and I'll click
this sticker good and then the other way
is just to go over to the asset manager
and drag out this banana t-shirt because
you know how we do about bananas
actually don't like bananas so I want to
add a class to the images and we'll say
merge - image that's what the thing is
gonna be and margin bottom 40 that look
normal
no what is this this looks like a POW oh
yeah 20 20 man cool and so I need to put
a clasp on this as merge image and these
guys have merge image to merge image
okay so all four of these remember to
image let's go to tablet and see how
these things block out that's fine and
yeah they so they start snapping into a
single column at the phone horizontal
phone landscape setting and then in yeah
they look good like that cool so
Lois's design had borders around them
they look let me get a measuring here so
people ask me all the time how do I get
this measuring block or actually this is
a hack it's a screenshot that's not
actually for measuring but it does give
you like the little numbers when you're
screenshotting things in in Mac OS X
user press command shift 4 and then
there you go hit spacebar you get this
camera and that screenshot so every
window you're looking at but if you hit
spacebar again you go back to this
little crosshairs and I put the mouse on
that and then I just image drag and
measure how how big this thing isn't
right now it's 10 10 pixels obviously so
let's go back to merge image and the
board there's gonna be width of 10
pixels and gonna pick that purp pick
that / prett they're actually green now
we're gonna do the purple the reason
we're gonna do the purpose
we want to look at this this this class
here of merch image and see kind of how
we're handling that because what we want
to do is get every other merch image oh
that's weird why is it not centered
merch column I'll just do Tech Center
requires a width oh that's interesting
well we just you know do that oh you
know what we actually would be better
than that is if we did two merch image
and said max width was one house a width
is 100% over 24 there now when we
scrunch it or squeeze it it kind of the
image grows to what we want cool so
let's go back to desktop view and they
look good
uh-oh that border that I put it on okay
let's go back let's give the thing about
web flows when you make changes make
sure you're in desktop if they're if
they're supposed to be like changes that
go why do you know so let me get rid of
this border again because this is all
only applying to when it's in this width
now because it's not mobile first it's
like desktop first let me click on the
merge image and then add the borders ten
in the purp
all right and the width merge image
let's make the width 100% there we go so
now when we go into smaller views
they'll actually be what we wanted the
whole time not only in the smaller
because it's desktop first thank you one
forgetting that okay so notice that half
of these are green they alternate so
like basically the evens are green but
we'll just do that another time similar
to how we did these ones here
show up in the design phase anyway oh we
know what we need to do these are
supposed to be the link cuz they're not
links right now if I go in here and I
can not click these these are just
static images so we need to make these
links let's grab a link block so we have
text link here and if you drag this text
link into here it's just gonna be like
this yeah
you can't like stick an image in that
and delete that and then grab a link
block and put it right there and then
grab that image and stick it inside of
the link block so that way the see that
link block right there
now if I put like here I can put you
know Google calm and it'll go to the
site of the store wherever we make that
store whenever we make that store so I
need to put these all in the link box so
grab a link block everyone everyone gets
a link block you get a link block and
you get a link bar down here buddy
grab this banana shirt put it in a link
block so that we can all of them have
you know be a links link bar link yeah
good so that looks pretty done I mean
apart from the from the colors okay so
yeah we make things on Instagram these
headlines just kill you they're so funny
okay so what do we need for this we need
the same thing right
headline paragraph and then like a feed
of a feed of Instagram things so let's
just do what we got right yeah I'm a
whole option and pull it down and click
on it and the headline is yeah we make
things on Instagram okay so five yeah we
didn't make we have we make things on
insta grayham and there's a paragraph
and then basically you just need to get
rid of these
columns there okay the paragraph now how
does web flow import an Instagram feed
truthfully I don't know and I googled it
a little bit
nobody knows so what we're gonna do is I
have prepared this service called juicer
and juicer lets you have one feed for
free and and check that out we did
that's that's a erin Appling hi there
that's me and there's Lois and this is
Helen and she did an awesome part cat
podcast
Andy Guy Kawasaki oh my gosh look at
these two handsome boys okay so let's go
and get the embed in your site script
and copy this I was a press command-c
and then I'm going to go over here to
embed in every art embed and drag it out
put it in paste it save alright this
script will embed will only appear on
the published exported site so this is
probably done I don't know sure but it's
probably done let's publish Blitz
how do you publish Oh so publish
selected it means okay now let's go
check it out make sure that that embed
looks good alright two days in the
cantina scroll down shirt sticker it
looks good and here's our embeds this
looks good I mean it looks it looks okay
it's certainly not the way I would have
designed it oh and there's an ad right
in the middle of my feed oh well I
wonder if and juicer lets me like feed
settings feed style image grid yes tell
me more tell me more
is there patty wait
that's nice but I want classic Oh weird
okay anyway you can basically mess
around with that let me see the image
created okay I wonder if it changes does
it change here if I change out it was so
refresh scroll down part by juic oh it
does immediately it looks a lot better
that way maybe it doesn't I don't know
it doesn't matter um this is not about
juicer this is about web flow so that
was an easy fix for importing you know
feeds on to live though and the next
thing we gotta do is just missus footer
and then we're done we're done with his
website it's so fast what flows fast
okay so we actually already have a
footer I made it down here a while ago
so that I could have a footer to like
just basically bump this up because this
was like as far as I could scroll in
here I was like I like to scroll past
things so here's my footer we need to
make it purple and put a link in it
that's kind of easy so I'll put this can
Taner into it into the footer and in
that container I'll put a I'll put a
text block did I do it right okay I
don't see anything can I type in there
okay well contact is what I wrote it but
it's white let me get that further back
background footer let's make it purp
make it purple and let's put some
padding on this footer what do we got
here about about 50 others do
hold shift so I don't want to hold shift
command Z i'ma hold option so I can do
my top and bottoms at the same time and
we want to do about 50/50 padding OOP
okay contact cool contact is going to be
Travis trav
and lows at gmail.com and this is
actually gonna be a link so let's make
it a link oh good good good good
and let's make it let's give this this
link a name we'll call it footer link
link and we want to give it a color of
yeah that thing oh that looks good okay
cool so contact us or emails what he
said that's fine and I'm not gonna do
that because I don't know cool actually
let's take a look let's take a look
let's publish it again do the publish
button take a look at it she just want
to see what it looks like
you can visit late nights dot web flow
to I oh I think that's live to the
public and come down here and check it
out looks pretty good I like it now I'll
definitely have to fit fix a few you
know links Louis and I need to do a
little bit on this content when you work
on this content a little bit of course
