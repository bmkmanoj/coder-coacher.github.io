Travis and welcome to dev tips ah in
last week's video we looked at my code
editor Adam and in the comments you guys
were really enthusiastic leaving a bunch
of recommendations for other plugins and
packages a ton of great things to read
and check out so if you haven't done
that yet I recommend it it's awesome
also my throat's a little weird but
between you and me yeah but today i want
to share another tool that I use all the
time called code kit I'm going to walk
you through a few features and how to
get started using it and then at the end
of the video I'm going to give you an
opportunity to win a copy for yourself I
have three copies to give away donated
by the creator of code kit Brian Jones
so stick around for that this is the
home page for code kit as you can see
and the tagline is a mac app for cool
people that's funny but not helpful but
later on down the page Bryan describes
his app as like steroids for web
developers simply put code kit is an app
that lets you build websites faster it
compiles all the cutting edge languages
that we use like SAS less stylist
coffeescript and more it live refreshes
your browser's it combines minify TSA's
and syntax checks your JavaScript and it
also optimizes images all this stuff
that really will just speed up your
website and your workflow now there are
other ways to do these same things but
code kids mission is really to take the
pain out of the process right here I'm
just dropping my code project into the
app and you get to work there's no JSON
to configure no settings no command line
nothing else to install or download it
just works and that's so important when
you're trying to move fast what I use
code get for I use code kit for projects
that i want to get done fast most of the
tutorials that i do here on dev tips are
powered by code kit in the background it
runs my jade and mice ass like a champ
and it can give me really helpful error
messages right here when I mess things
up there's nothing there yet but you get
the idea the two features in code kit
that have really come to rely on a lot
are the live reload features and auto
pre fixer that means that I don't ever
have to hit reload on my browser in fact
I don't even have to take focus away
from my editor
I can just see the browser live update
as I save my work and auto prefix er
allows me to not really have to worry
about vendor prefixes things like you
know WebKit box sizing and mosbach
sizing auto prefix are just runs in the
background all I have to do is write bak
sizing like a normal human and code kit
takes care of everything else the last
two projects that I've done for clients
have been pretty big projects and I've
used code kit exclusively and they
turned out really awesome I usually use
code kit for design templates and
prototypes before I move the project
into a CMS like WordPress or Jekyll
there are other features in code kit to
for example Bauer is built right in with
over 7,000 items that you can just
easily install in the app you just run
over here to the assets tab and you have
a list of over 7,000 things that Bauer
gives us to quickly install frameworks
templates and other great code libraries
that make your prototyping and website
building a lot faster checkout code kits
website here for tons and tons of
helpful videos about how this all works
and especially how Bauer works code kit
is awesome i love it and i think that
you'll love it too now let's talk about
how you can win code kit is cool I use
it all the time and I have three
licenses to give away today here is how
you can win first copy will be given
away to a random commenter on this video
I just want you to say hi so if you've
been watching dev tips for a while and
haven't had any reason to say hello now
is your chance the second copy will be
given away to somebody who tweets a link
to this video be sure to mention at dev
tips show so that I can find your tweet
but you don't need to actually follow at
dev tip show to win this but I'm just
saying it's probably a good idea because
a tweet like awesome things like all day
and that's how you can win the second
one the third one is a special copy that
I'm giving only to the patrons of dev
tips patrons just leave a comment in the
comments feed on the video page on
patreon.com and a random patron who
comments will get the last copy of code
kit i have to give away i want to thank
Justin dieter who organized the giveaway
who's a dev tipper and he organized this
giveaway I want to thank Brian Jones for
sponsoring the giveaway itself he is the
developer the creator of code kit
awesome guy the making of this video was
funded by the patrons
of dev tips patrons get videos early and
also bonus videos recently I started
making design critique videos for
patrons who wanted feedback on their
work it's been really fun and we're
getting great feedback on the project
come check us out at patreon.com / dev
tips and guys thank you so much for
watching my videos if this is the first
one you've ever seen my name is Travis I
do a new video every week and until I
see you then keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
