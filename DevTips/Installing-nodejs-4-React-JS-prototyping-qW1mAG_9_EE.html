installing node J ass and we're also
going to talk about what nodejs
is and why we need it for this project
and you're watching dev tips where the
guest hosts mpj and David you mentioned
node what is node
alright so crow has a JavaScript engine
inside of it right yeah I want somebody
did a couple of years ago was to break
that engine out because that is a
separate open-source module made it
possible to use that on your computer
alright so you can basically just run
run JavaScript in your computer or
anything because it's just the v8 engine
separated from a browser and they also
added a couple of io libraries and what
that means is that you can read files
and connect to the network and stuff
like that ok so let's install start what
do I need we're gonna need a browser
because we want to go to node J s go to
org I have a Windows keyboard for Mac
yeah but it's the same as Mac alright so
I'll just search for nodejs
yes cool yep
boom and then there's download for Mac
OS and there's two versions pick the
latest I we're not gonna go into why
there are two versions just don't worry
about it
take care installed installed touch ID
waiting this balloon of death all right
okay yes approve okay and yeah throw it
away all right cool so you can close the
window now and now just open up the
terminal use use spotlight if this is
the first time you're seeing the
terminal it's the command line prompt in
in Mac OS where you can do all kinds of
system things okay so to start using
note I just typed note right yep
and this is now the repple so this is it
now you can type Java Script here and it
will be interpreted it's basically like
the developer console
inside of inside of chrome hahahaha yep
yeah so if you just type 5 plus 5 it
will add that ok so we now have node
installed right you can just go out of
this by ctrl C we also have NPM
installed and NPM is the package manager
that is included for node it's um it's a
JavaScript package manager and what that
means is that you you can pull in all
kinds of helpful packages it's you can
think of it sort of like jQuery plugins
but way more clean and much more
powerful with a much larger wealth of
libraries just open up NPM don't org in
the browser yes so yes you can give us
give people a sense of it
oops yeah exactly this and this is very
standard the national public musicians
site gets lots of traffic from this NPM
you can search for something like I use
this called moment yeah yesterday date
libraries too easy add and remove days
from dates and stuff yeah and this is
just one example there are an insane
amount of packages here and they're
really easy to pull into your
application we're not gonna spend much
time with this it's just so that you
know what the hell NPM is the benefits
of the package manager is obvious but
the it's not clear why we were
installing v8 on the on your computer
why do we need that why can we just use
the browser the main reason is that we
want to do translation and bundling
transformation what is translation as a
developer as a JavaScript developer you
have this issue that JavaScript is this
open standard that all browsers can
interpret what they're doing it in their
own way yes they were doing it in their
own way and in their own generation so
whenever there's new fancy features
added to JavaScript it will take years
and years and years before all the
browser vendors have up
dated those merchants and also rolled it
out to to the users and all the users
have have updated their browsers that is
why we have translation it allows us to
write modern JavaScript but it will
still run on older browsers this second
reason why we use nodejs
when doing front-end development is to
do bundling we talk a little bit about
what nodejs it's a package manager and
it allows you to use packages and you
tend to use a lot of packages and if
each of those packages resulted in a
browser request a network request we
would end up with a lot of requests some
of you know this and some of you don't
but you want to keep the amount of
requests that the browser does to a
reasonable minimum because even though
network connections are or reasonably
fast and we have very fast connections
there is a latency and an overhead for
every request and if we have a lot of
requests that means that we waste a lot
of time for the user so what do you mean
so node is bundling for us yes so
instead of going to the lake and
fetching water in these small buckets
all the time what bundling allows us to
do is to go over there with a huge
tanker truck and get all the water at
the same time a bundler basically
bundles all the components into one big
bowl and deliver start with the browser
and because because of latency issues
that almost always ends up being faster
how do I use NPM all right so you just
type NPM install and then - G because we
are going to install a global package
where don't worry too much about what
that means for now you are going to type
create react app
cliffhanger because that is what we're
going to do in the next episode follow
us now to the next episode where we
install create react app which is this
thing that allows us to create real apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
