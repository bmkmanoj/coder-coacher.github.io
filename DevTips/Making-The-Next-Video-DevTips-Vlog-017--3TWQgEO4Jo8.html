in the morning and I just woke up I went
to bed last night around 12:30 because I
was up late working on this video that
I'm gonna be talking about right now so
this is the progress on the video right
here if you can see it you got a final
cut here and consider can see it why is
it blue last night I recorded the
voiceover for the entire video and
chopped it up in final cut so it's time
dry or at least it should be at least
close you know there would be some
nudging around once I put the actual
video on top of it and then right here I
got a script so this script is going to
be telling me what kind of scenes I need
to record and like what the flow is
going to be so hmm
I don't exactly have it mapped out in my
mind like what the style is going to be
or what jacket is painting what elements
lead to what scenes but that's what I'm
gonna be doing right now so I'm going to
take a piece of paper and doing some
storyboarding and always be mapping out
the key frames and like key scenes and
the things that I don't know yeah I'll
to try and mix it up as I go and then
and then I'll go downstairs to the
garage and we'll start doing something
doing some shooting so let's do
storyboarding right now
so I finished up the the storyboarding
here so it's just it's really quickly
it's just like a bunch of keyframes and
what's going to happen in there and why
did the storyboarding is not so much
because what story I need to tell I mean
I already have like the needs in the
script here but ones that did it because
I need to know what assets to create now
creating access is next step its type of
get get my scissors out and play
construction paper tonight have my
storyboard scissors pin and construction
paper it turns out somebody already got
to my construction paper look at this I
got a guy said vampire was like my
daughter drew it the perils of parenting
he's my city paper
they were all done with creating this
huge mess here next I have to blow these
things if luck back because it's raining
outside and go downstairs - you've
composed the shots
it's 5:30 right now they have been
always done before after work
okay so so what we're going to be doing
now is I have the studio set up I have
some lights and a camera and right here
is like the the art board and I'm gonna
be placing things there I think I'm just
me taking still shots just snapping
photos of different compositions of the
of the characters and the elements that
I created for the past hour and a half
and then I cut out like a kid in grade
school and then after that I'm gonna
take them back and hopefully it'll work
I'll be able to place them to the to the
voice-over that I did last night last
night that I did like maybe four hours
ago so let's just get started
okay so the time the time is 6:30 and I
am finished with with all of this here
it's all done and I photographed
everything or there's no photograph er I
their photograph to everything and now I
need to go upstairs and jump in the
final cut and start arranging and timing
all of the sequences if I'm quiet can
you hear it's raining pretty badly right
now and I need to go to work but I don't
want to ride my bike in the rain it's
the worst and it's cold and wet and gets
mud everywhere so I'm just gonna wait it
out for another hour and at least it
will be lighter out so cars will hit me
less I don't know anyway let's go
upstairs and give this sequence down get
back in the house now I'm loading all of
the photos into okay I took about 90
photographs I have 90 photographs to
make this this whole story actually this
is only half of the video the second
half will come later this week I guessed
it seven o'clock and my son woke up how
are you doing we happy
do you like my movie alright you do you
don't like it I never even read all the
movies in the world of course
so my name is pretty cool right
Oh even your movie still got some work
to do I placed about half of the
photographs I took maybe less and it's
gonna be gonna be a long haul until this
scene is done and that's why half of the
film so I think that total rake down to
make this film we're about let's see
about two hours for the script
about arranging flowers for creating the
elements about another two hours to
place it looks like six hours about six
hours in or maybe like where's mommy
let me sleeping so anyway hey hold on
buddy let me let me end the film this is
this is the end of the vlog and this is
like the creative process for this type
of video that I'm making and it'll be a
while but it will be fun worth it and
thank you so much for joining me on this
in the process thank you thank you thank
you and take care keep on attacking say
keep on hacking okay so you both Hecky
yeah
so I ended up riding my bike to work
brain drain on the seats
things the FAR's anyway I'm all covered
with Brannon my foot has rain on it my
backpack is filled up by the tires but
comes in about ten minutes
hangout and then I think on the bus I'm
going to continue writing the second
half of the episode I mean it's the
authority of written as far as script is
concern
like storyboarding and walking out like
the ideas like visually it's not even
considered for the second half of this
trip
