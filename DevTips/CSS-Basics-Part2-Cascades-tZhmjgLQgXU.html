designers my name is Chuck my name is
Louis taking over this joint okay
everybody this is Louis Lowe's telling
what we're learning today last week we
learned that CSS is the language we use
to give websites they're looking few
homework were CSS it controls layout
colors and just all sorts of styles
that's right today we're going to be
learning today today we're going to
learn about the cash skating part and
cascading style sheets you could do it
okay yeah there is your chance this is
mine there are three main ways that
style sheet will cascade in a website
the first way style sheets cascade is
that one simple style can affect
multiple HTML elements yeah let's say we
have a few paragraph tags in our
document and all of a sudden I changed
my mind and I want to turn all the
paragraph all the Pirates red you can do
this by applying simple style so all of
the elements that match the criteria of
that style rule will be affected by it
it's nice you use the second way that
style sheets cascade is similar to the
first
just a little reversed that is one HTML
tag can be affected by many styles in
different ways
check it all the same time that's right
might consider our read paragraphs there
if we wrote a style later on down in the
style sheet that targeted just that
first paragraph and changed it to 18
pixel font size then we would have a
paragraph that's both red and 18 pixels
cascading see just what I'll tell you
third way the Cascade is what allows us
to use the power of style sheets to
create large-scale websites in this way
we can use one style sheet to affect
many pages across a website or even
multiple websites yeah for example on my
website I have multiple pages and they
all have the same header now we're CSS
it's super easy to achieve this all you
do is you link all your HTML pages to
that same style sheet yeah I mean if you
wanted to you could link that website to
any style sheet across the internet
right why would you do that you can't
you can that's why I see yeah imagine if
you had to click on every paragraph and
make font changes one by one to the
entire website like if you're in
Photoshop so horrible life it's
ridiculous that's why we have the
awesome power of cascading style sheets
we can make radical far-reaching changes
with one simple anecdote
