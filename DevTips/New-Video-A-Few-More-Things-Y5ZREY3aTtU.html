over this holiday weekend it was really
nice to hear from you and you know how
much dev tips means to you the general
sense of gratitude and Thanksgiving in
the last video was really nice it means
a lot to me so thank you for that
ah so today's video is gonna be over on
PHP academy' we're gonna be looking at
the updates to chrome dev tools it's
specifically the device emulator which
make previewing your websites on
different mobile devices really easy and
fun but before you go and check that out
let me shamelessly promote a few things
to you the first thing is that the dev
tips Twitter account has been a lot of
fun lately chatting over there on
Twitter is a little bit different
because the discussion is not tied to
the videos like the comments here are
below so if you want to go back and
forth about kind of anything hit me up
over there the dev tips Twitter handle
is at dev tips show so that's number one
number two I want to let you know that
Louis and I have been very very very
hard at work on a new podcast that is
finally out it's posted on iTunes it's
available to you now please go and find
it the podcast is called late nights
with trav and lo so you can just go to
iTunes and search trav and Louis and it
will show up I told you this would be a
shameless promotional section but please
go check that podcast out it's really
fun Louis and I talked about how to be a
healthy and productive professional in
today's creative economy the first two
episodes went live this weekend go get
it now
go and get it and let us know what you
think tweet to us at trap and Louis
again you can just search in iTunes at
trab and Louis and it'll pop up there
and then also the link of course there
in the description and the last thing is
that I've resurrected the newsletter on
Travis Nielsen comm I'm sending out
quick short notes randomly throughout
the week through the month I don't
and it's just about what I'm thinking
about now what kind of is influencing me
what's driving me to make the new videos
and just kind of like what's been on my
mind lately it's not really important
that you sign up you're not gonna miss
anything but if you just kind of want a
little bit more a little bit more it's
there for you so that's at Travis
Nielsen comm again the link will be in
the description below just sign up for
the newsletter and you'll have a little
bit of Travon your in your inbox you
know it's fun okay that is it
for things we got the PHP academy' video
it's a fun one we got the dev tip show
Twitter we're having a lot of chats over
there we got the podcast that seems
that's go check that out I really really
hope you guys like it we do a new
episode every other week and the first
the first two the first episode is a two
partner and it's about 10 things you can
do to become a more productive self
learner so that's really fun and then
the last thing is the Travis Nielsen
comm email newsletter so this has been
like a ton of shameless self-promotion I
hope you don't mind that I'm just
plugging everything right now but I
didn't I wanted to make a somewhat long
video for you but go check out the
normal one over on PHP academy' all of
these links are in the description down
below
of course the dev tips question of the
week is what direction would you like to
see dev tips go in 2015 that's something
I've been thinking about a lot lately
and I like your input so what would you
like to see from dev tips in the new
year and thank you so much for your
support thank you so much for your
encouragement and your well wishes over
this holiday see you next week and keep
on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
