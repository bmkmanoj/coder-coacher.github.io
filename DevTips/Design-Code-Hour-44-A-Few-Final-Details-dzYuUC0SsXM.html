for point I think for of this section of
getting our stuff settle settled now
here's the backstory video for point 1 2
&amp;amp; 3 were recorded like three months ago
and it's this this weird anyway so so I
was getting ready for VidCon this
weekend I'm gonna be at VidCon when
you're watching this I'm at VidCon and I
was loading my github repo onto a laptop
that I borrowed from work so that I
could work on it there and you know
maybe do some editing or recording when
I'm gone in to Anaheim this weekend
yadda yadda yadda it didn't work I could
like the Jekyll was fine the Jade was
fine but the sass was not compiling I
thought okay why and I went through a
few things and and I could tell you the
long story but the short story and in
Oliver P actually in the comments for
video 4.1 I think when we're talking
about when we're talking about gulp he
pointed this out that because I did that
video so long ago it was actually out of
date with shakey Shane's recently
updated versions shakey Shane okay let
me just redo the comment from Oliver P
Thank You Oliver
Oliver says for me the node modules are
not up to date and the github repo from
shakey Shane maybe we have to update the
package.json file to the following four
using the latest dependencies and then
he wrote this which I'm just gonna grab
and go over to my text editor and open
package dot JSON and he's right look at
my dependencies my gulp SAS is 0.7 what
am I thinking
so I'm updating two two and three okay
and now after I did this I went a long
way around it he's figured it out for me
after I did this my my what's it called
my repo is working now my SAS is
compiling that was so fresh it seemed
like two hours to figure out was going
on but but Oliver Pete
figures out that out right for us so
make sure you guys do that and you know
in if this if this video you're seeing
this like a year later or two months
later or six months later just go in
like find out what the most recent gulps
ass is and just check your dependencies
just check your dependencies bro you
know and make sure they're all
up-to-date and working fine you probably
have a problem if they're not the second
thing is this is number two here I get a
lot of people saying hey where the heck
is the PSD so I didn't include it in the
in the repo trying to cut down on file
size but it should be there so right now
you can watch me I'm taking this PSD and
putting it in the repo and the next time
I sync it to github it will be there for
you guys and the last thing is I was
looking at my work on my phone and I
realized hey my font isn't working the
fonts not working so I went to I was
looking at how I do let's let's look at
let's look at how I do fonts funds okay
so I did this right here where it's like
I was trying to be too smart for Google
and just grabbing their font but but
Google is actually too smart for me and
what they do is they serve up a
different style sheet depending on the
browser that your you're using so if I'm
using like like Firefox or Safari it's
gonna use a different font family source
for like it'll use like a wah for a true
type or OTF or whatever depending on
that so instead of doing all this why
I'm just gonna brand for parent
grandparent BAM I'm just gonna go
where's a browser just gonna go to
google fonts fire sans yep yep I have a
really slow internet when I record these
things because I'm in the garage it's
lonely I've been here for like five
hours recording I have about four hours
recording okay so here we are we've got
the this is the font we want
at the bottom there's a link to open
fire Sam's in Google Fonts that we're
just usability thing I've ever seen but
here we go okay I want normal and italic
and I'm just gonna grab this import here
just I'm gonna it's gonna finally do
what they tell me to do and put it in
there now now I'm gonna ask Google to
give me the correct font file every time
we'd depending on the browser that's
looking at it and that way you know my
mobile phone will have the right font
and and your Mozilla browser will have
the right font and in her Safari and his
Google Chrome and the baby that has the
baby browser and your grandma's browser
will all work with the right font so
thanks Google sorry I tried to get to
smart
and I think fats let me check my notes
let's see dependencies okay that's all I
wanted to say so that's it for video 4.4
I'm having such a happy and fun time and
you guys don't know it but I'm like on
like video 8 right now and it's looking
so good and so fun okay so that's it for
this really quick video take care I love
your stupid face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
