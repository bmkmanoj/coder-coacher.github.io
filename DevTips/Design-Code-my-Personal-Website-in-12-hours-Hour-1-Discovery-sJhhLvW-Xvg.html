we did was one called how to build a
responsive website from start to finish
it was a great experience to create in
front of all of you indeed with all of
you through your interactions in the
comments and your contributions on
github I learned more than I was taught
I'm certain of it and I'm not even being
modest the feedback from that series has
been overwhelming even today it's the
most popular piece of content on this
entire channel so it's a really
intimidating thing to try to compete
with now I want to do something better
but dang that series did really well so
let me take a minute to talk about all
the things that you guys said that you
liked about that series and we'll see if
we can't build upon those same elements
number one you really liked that it was
truly a start-to-finish experience i
didn't skip any steps to speed the video
along and you know as a video creator
that can sometimes be difficult you know
I want my content to be watchable and
sometimes I worried that you guys
wouldn't want to see the boring stuff
but it was actually the boring stuff
that you guys really really connected
with because a lot of other videos had
skipped over those things we were
finally able together to fill all those
little cracks in the knowledge that you
guys said you didn't even know we're
missing number two you liked that it was
a usable project meaning that you could
download the code and follow along and
use it for your own projects for free
and number three
many of you guys said that you liked
that we didn't just go through how to
code different things but we talked
about why we were making those certain
decisions so keeping all these
principles in mind we're going to return
to that idea of creating a responsive
website from start to finish but this
time with one big plot twist this time
we're doing my own personal website I'm
calling this series design and code my
personal website in 12 hours in that
last series we did the discovery
exercise and I do this for every one of
my projects so let's go through that
again
it's important at this stage to avoid
getting caught up in thinking about
design or features or user experience or
even the technology stack what we really
want to be focusing on in the beginning
of the project is making sure that we
understand the project and the way to
properly understand the project is to do
research and to ask your client
questions you always have a client even
if you're an in-house designer your boss
is your client or the person who's
making the request is the client even if
you're designing this website for
yourself you have to treat yourself as
the client now there are two simple
questions you can use to get yourself on
the right path every time the first
question is who is the owner the second
question is very similar who is the
audience now you must respect these
questions if you try to move past these
questions without fully answering them
you will build the wrong thing every
time after identifying both the owner
and the audience you really need to
follow up those two questions by
discovering what is important to each of
them
notice that I'm telling you to discover
what is important to the audience
don't let your client or your project
manager dominate the question of what
content belongs on the homepage it's
your job to find a good place that
satisfies them both a cliche example of
this being unbalanced is a classic
University website right so what does
the university have on their homepage
big beautiful pictures of their
landscaped campus but what are the
students want they want a class schedule
the result the audience gets frustrated
and leaves and the university gets less
applicants to pay for its enormous
landscaping bill you see it needs to
work for both parties and maybe not
always in the way that each party
initially assumed that it would in this
project I get the distinct pleasure of
being the owner
I want my website to correctly reflect
my business what I'm doing now and how I
can be of service to those who are
looking for what I have to offer when I
look at my website now as a quick
criticism of it I don't really get a
clear picture of what the Travis brand
is all about I don't really understand
what Travis does now this design is
three years old and at the time I
created it the only thing I did was
write and design articles for my blog
today things are much different I do
different things more things and I want
to be able to communicate that to my
visitors okay so that's the owner that's
me but what about the audience and their
needs my audience has three main types
of people the first one are students
they're often coming into my website
from another venue and looking to find a
little bit about me and why I do these
things and what are the other sources of
content I'm producing the second
audience type that I get on my website
are kind of people that I would call
promoters now these are like conference
organizers or brand outreach people
marketers or sponsors for shows these
people are usually interests
and how I can benefit their brand and
the third kind of people that visit my
site are what I call perspective
employers these are people who may want
to hire me for either contract work or
full-time employment as this website
kind of serves as a portfolio it's good
to keep those type of people in mind now
the important things to them is grab
this headline put it down here the
important things to them are going to be
that number one it's easy to discover
and how I do my work and I would say
that they should be able to easily
sample other types of content I produce
and then third I would say that they
probably just want to be able to contact
me easy right now if I look back at the
three audience types that I identified I
can notice that these three needs that I
discovered really do work with each one
of them all of them one of these kind of
same things now that we've answered
those two questions those two important
questions we can think of the different
content types that are going to meet the
needs of those audience members that we
identified now let's make a quick list
of the things that could be on this page
that would help them to meet their needs
now we're finally talking about features
now notice that we're not sketching and
we're not wire framing and we're not
designing or coding all we're doing is
making lists and identifying things that
need to be explored so let's jump back
to that first persona the client what
does the client need in terms of
features right now if we jump back to
the website as it is we see that the
features are we have articles the
articles are the main attraction
currently and they have been like the
most outward projection of my creative
efforts for the past three years right
there's over 50 articles here and each
one has been designed specifically to
fit the message of that article so right
now they're the first thing in the
navigation the first thing that will
people will see when they come here but
the problem is that in the past two
years I really pivoted my efforts and
these are not the main thing I do
anymore I've created this YouTube
channel I do mentoring I do vines I do a
podcast a newsletter I still design and
update my portfolios on dribble and
behan sand ice and I actually still do
write these articles also but we could
see that they're less and less of the
main thing that I do the next thing
that's currently here featured is this
notes section now a few weeks ago I made
this as kind of a stopgap solution to
helping people to get on board with my
newsletter efforts and it's supposed to
be just a temporary place for this
newsletter until we go through this
process and next is the work section and
while I still love design and I think of
myself as a designer above everything
else I'm not necessarily trying to
promote my work to the world as a for
hire agent and so this is not
necessarily the biggest part of what I
want my website to be either and lastly
is the biography currently here but I'm
thinking now that I want my story to be
less about the story of my life and more
about the story of the things that I can
do to help other people the value that I
can bring into their lives and that's it
right now if you look kind of a excuse
this really self-indulgent a tour of my
web site but what I'm trying to do is
explain where I am right now and I can
show you how I want to progress things
but as I mentioned a minute ago
I'd like to as the client tell the full
story of the different services and
creative outlets I use to help other
people so the navigation could go
something like this
there could be an about then I want to
talk about YouTube I'd want to talk
about the mentoring that I'm doing
scroll up here I'd also I still really
do love and appreciate these articles
I'd like to showcase the
friends that i've been making and you
know not forget my design work I'd like
to have a place for people could sign up
for my notes which is the email
newsletter that I do and I like to help
people find the the podcast that Lois
and I create every other week and
finally of course the need that's on
every website is the contact but if I as
the client think that this is good then
that's great but that's only half of the
pie right we need to use our empathy and
check these features against the other
personas that we already identified I
need to honestly ask myself if I think
that these things are what my students
and promoters and potential employers
are looking to discover about me looking
over this list I think this would be a
fantastic resource for students maybe
they found my videos on YouTube and by
doing a little bit research they came
here and they sign up for the free notes
that I do and that's great that's
exactly what I want but how about a
promoter I would eventually like to do
some public speaking so it's good that
YouTube is prominent we also have a
podcast here and that's good I wouldn't
say it's perfect for promoters I'm
imagining that they would want to have
the examples of the things I've done
pretty prominently placed on the
homepage
examples of sponsored videos that I've
done or speaking engagements hmm you
know want to put a pin in that because
this audience is is definitely a
secondary you know and potential
employers is also secondary so I'm not
really looking for a new job right now
in fact this is not what I should be
focusing on I don't know maybe I listed
those personas as like a knee-jerk
reaction of a lifelong posture of
thinking that way you know like you
always want a bet
job or you always want more clients see
I'm glad that we're doing this exercise
do you see I'm saying like this is in
real time like as I'm recording this
video I'm thinking through these things
and and you see how I when you really
think through them sometimes your
assumptions can just change now I still
think that there's value in being able
to offer these personas information that
is specifically tailored to them but my
main audience especially in 2015 is you
people who are interested in dev tips
and the podcast and all that kind of
junk maybe if it were pertinent I could
create a secondary URL for these
different personas I've done that in the
past it's worked pretty well very well
actually I'm glad that we went through
the mental effort of the discovery
process I'm more confident now than ever
that I'm building the right thing for
the right person if we had not gone
through this I would have tried to cater
to the wrong person I would have built
the wrong thing in the next video we're
going to take this content strategy that
we just developed now and move it
forward by creating wireframes so we can
really nail down the experience that we
want people to have when they're
visiting our web site and remember you
keep on discovering just using the
