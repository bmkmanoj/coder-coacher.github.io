Travis and sky anything ah today's
question comes from Samuel Samuel says
I'd love to know if you have any tips on
how to handle creative overload by this
I mean that when you are collaborating
to solve a problem how do you get all of
your ideas onto the paper I often feel
that the best ideas pop into my brain
buzz in a split second later the next
idea has taken its place any ideas don't
worry about those ideas that that don't
that don't come if you're having so many
ideas that are flying in like that I
mean get out what you can but don't
worry about those ones that you can't
get out because if there's that much
coming in ya gonna you're gonna wind up
with something but I think a good
exercise for dealing with things that
could potentially produce a lot of these
ideas or whatever in general is working
within constraints constraining what
you're going to be using constraining
aspects of whatever the designer user
interface or whatever concern yourself
to say I'm only going to think about
this one little thing right now or I'm
only going to be I'm only going to be
working on the buttons i'm only going to
be working on this and only have your
mind there don't let it wander yeah
lampshade don't let it wander to all
these different other things like really
embrace that like that focus so focus on
a smaller problem maybe you're biting
off too much and getting distracted by
all the parts yeah secondly i would
recommend to try to optimize your
capturing tool so if you're if you can't
type as fast as you can think maybe sit
your phone down in into voice record and
talk to it while you type or or have
that conversation with your collaborator
yeah find it maybe video might be a good
idea as well set your camera up over
there and then have that conversation
just so you can refer back to it there's
a law so a lot of apps that can you can
take notes and they record while you
take notes and take time stamps and like
Mark the moment and stuff like yeah so
that so that's always also a good idea
maybe also just be less detailed with
your notes so maybe just constrict
yourself instead of like a writing
longhand in a typewriter a typewriter
yeah uh actually saw hipster with a
typewriter and a copy shop the other day
is like may you lug that thing all the
way he's like yeah typey type it away
all my life okay um what I was going to
say is instead of like writing longhand
and a word processor may be just like
constraining your notes to a post it
note and if you remember or watch back
to the videos i did when i was at adobe
we were doing a brainstorming technique
overview that and see exactly what we
did but in short we use post-it notes
and i had a whole post a note for one
idea quickly wrote it out stick it next
idea quickly wrote and don't worry about
trying to flesh them out you're just
trying to capture and then when you go
back and that would be really helpful if
you go back and you have the video
recording of the discussion at the time
but but i think we have to we have to
really good suggestions for you number
one cut your focus of your ideation
sessions down to specific parts of the
problem rather than getting distracted
that was Scott suggestion and mine is to
learn how to optimize your capturing
tools yeah all right thanks Samuel I
really appreciate your question and keep
on hacking and everyone tune in for the
next question that we do oh yeah alright
see you guys you just watch ask Travis
anything if you have a question for me
then send it week two at dev tips show
and hashtag it with ask Travis anything
thanks for watching you can check out
