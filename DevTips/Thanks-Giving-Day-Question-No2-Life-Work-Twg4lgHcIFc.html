fantastic holiday thanks for watching
inducted the other week I uploaded a
video which was a response to a question
I called the advice and crap to young
creators and you guys really responded
well to it some of you left comments and
I really appreciate that I wanted to
respond to one of the comments with this
video actually two to comment videos and
then whatever okay so this is a question
from nil-nil says I would be interested
in knowing how you got into this whole
design and development career I would
also be interested in knowing how you
manage your day-to-day work Nils buddy I
think they're intertwined aren't they
okay so this is like a long question for
me and there's like a lot of different
answers I'm sure there is you know to
anybody if you say tell them your life
story but uh really quickly uh I got
into design and development very early
on I always been like an artistic kind
of kid and when I was in like junior
high school in high school I was in like
a heavy-metal rock and roll band it was
so cool and all the girls loved it but
we needed you know some t-shirts and we
needed like a website and so I have
learned to code websites and I learned
to design t-shirts and posters and CD
album art and things like that and then
other bands were like hey you do that
crap for me and I did for them and then
later on in my laughs I was like oh crap
people will pay me to do this stuff and
so okay so I I grew up in Vegas I worked
in Vegas for a long time doing freelance
work on the side and then eventually I
just I quit my job and I said I I will
do this or I will
starve and there was there was a few
months where there was no food in the
refrigerator and that was like a really
crazy but thankfully I had you know
support system so my wife was working
and and and was able to start generating
like some freelance money income coming
in that was fun
oh the interesting year and then
eventually I got to working with a an
advertising agency in Las Vegas and I
was one of the early designers there and
I built a team up there and became a
creative director over three or four
years there and then I got invited to
come out and interview in Oakland with
an advertising agency slash development
house that does websites for like really
big entertainment acts like Bon Jovi and
Janet Jackson and The Killers like I
worked on like tons of really cool stuff
and I met some of the smartest and most
talented people in design and
development ever there they're still
there awesome guys miss you a lot so if
you guys watch this I still think about
you guys all the time and happy happy
turkey and then after that I I moved
down into Silicon Valley where I started
working with startups so my first
startup I was with little like a year
and two made a few things and eventually
got purchased by Groupon and then I
interviewed around with a few different
places and
I found this place called tubular labs
where I currently work and we make
actually that's how I got introduced
with the whole YouTube thing is the
tubular labs is an analytics platform
for YouTube content creators and I get
to do a lot of stuff there I get to
design and do a lot of front-end
development and and that's just kind of
how I got into it so but one thing of
know is that and I mentioned this a few
times maybe but every job offer some
that I've taken some that I've not taken
there's always a direct result of my
self-initiated work so I have a blog
that I run at Travis Nielsen comm and I
do art directed posts there which we're
cool for a while but not cool anymore
but I still do them to really get a lot
out of it for myself and then and then
just like you know personal projects
those are always the catalyst of people
contacting me for to work with them and
I'll never stop creating them
self-initiated projects this YouTube
channel itself is probably one of the
largest undertakings that I've done in a
long time it's consistently needing
updating every every week every video is
just a lot of work but it's it's really
rewarding and I'm making these cool
relationships with you guys and you know
and I like to talk so it gives me back
and I learned how to edit video and make
motion graphics and that that's cool so
yeah anyway so the other part of the
question was
knowing how I manage my day and work
that's an interesting question I'm
assuming you mean like how do I manage
the work-life balance and well let me
just run through my day today it was a
really interesting day because I
couldn't sleep this morning I woke up at
like 4:00 and I couldn't go back to
sleep so like around 5:00 or so I just
went to work I walked to the train so I
got to work this morning
like around 6:30 and I stayed there
until like 5:30 in the walk home so I
get home like around 6:30 and you know
hang out with the kids and the family
and put the kids to bed around 8:00 and
then it's deb tips so i'll be doing this
tonight until like i'm midnight or so so
it's pretty hectic there's a lot of a
lot of demand for my work that i put a
lot of pressure on myself because i
think that it's only in the in that
high-pressure situation that crucible
where my really good work comes out and
i'm a firm believer in if you want to
stand tall and go to work you have to
shove a mountain of crap under you in
order to make the good work rise rise
now I don't know if that metaphor quite
works but definitely definitely there's
a lot of crap under the good work that I
do so there's an interesting question
they love like work-life balance and the
that's a hard one and honestly I'm don't
think I'm great at it I possibly work
too much but in a lot of ways it's Who I
am as an identity like I really identify
myself as a creator and if I'm not
thinking about something to create I
have to be doing and if I'm not doing it
after you plant be planning for it or
preparing for it and it was something
early on in my family life like early on
in my marriage that I had a hard time
communicating with my wife and it was
like a point of contention because we
didn't understand it both of us didn't
and but we eventually came to a great
idea that I wouldn't go sneak off and
create stuff when she wasn't looking if
I could have some solid creation time
twice a week at night sometimes it's
more like weekends here or there but but
definitely Tuesday and Thursday every
weekend I have solid don't do not
disturb kind of creation time and that's
really nice because I can get I can get
stuff done during those evenings and
then also the converse is true that on
Mondays and Wednesdays and Fridays I can
really try to set aside those those
things that occupy my mind didn't really
focus on my relationships with my family
and friends I just really value them so
I think it's important to take time away
from work to to nurture them but that
yeah that's so that's my that's how I
manage my day in work Nils thanks for
asking a question hopefully I didn't
ramble too long and you know even if I
did who cares whatever it's my channel
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
