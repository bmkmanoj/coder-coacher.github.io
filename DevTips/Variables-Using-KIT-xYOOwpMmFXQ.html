venue tonight it's a crazy night we're
still doing this I think we're on my
video for now up and kids are still
asleep still solve lonely just kidding
let's do this um we're going to do
another video about code kit just while
we're on a roll I wanna show you how
variables are done and and here we are
looking at the screen here's the home
page we've talked about imports let's
look at variables okay so you do it with
a dollar equals and then later on you do
it okay that makes sense okay so what
I'm doing is I have this so cool trick
teams with variables I have an order
unordered list this is the output okay
here's how I have my document set up and
we can just talk about that first I have
a VARs kit which as we know code kid
don't cook it Schneider running and
dropped it in set up the path directly
ok so VARs kit is outputting d'ivoire
HTML style dots ass it's outputting the
style.css inside of my head my head
times I have a style linking to the CSS
this ass okay so what do I want to do
okay I want to style a big long list of
things like a table or something and
it's so cumbersome to often write out a
whole list by hand so I'm gonna tuck all
those in established on the style this
tuck all those into a variable first
time I style this first entry of a list
do you guys know
youtube character all over age 24 he is
home various i recommend copy image i
recommend you go to his channel he like
draws funny things and he talks with a
British accent so it can't be so bad the
first thing I do is make an image tag
with his avatar that was right 82 and
get his name and go close my age too and
then after that uh maybe his subscriber
Kim
I thought you guys might want like to
follow along as I like actually build
the first thing usually I just skip so
fast over that because like I explained
in my last video I get nervous that you
guys sort of think the coding that I'm
doing this morning but you know it's a
crazy night and magical things can
happen this is michael on me and I get
some nervous about that magical things
could happen so I'm making you guys
watch me code which is the purpose of
this channel yet I've done so little of
it so far well here we are a div class
text container and oh I lost
sping them but then the span when I'll
able to he's had 94,000 subs well that's
pretty good let's see how many videos
did you have doesn't do a count on
YouTube let me get up maybe he has I'm
just making up another span 6 23 videos
um okay let's take a look at what we've
got we have his avatar his name was
channel it how many subs and how many
videos here now I want to style a list
of like a lot of these different ones
but I'm just styling from Brandon so I
don't have to have actually accurate
data in there so let me go and just
style this first entry I'm going my
style dot size first thing we do is just
do a quick reset the asterisk as you
remember it selects everything and then
saying margin 0 in 0 and then when I go
on my body
make it light blue now koat kid is
refreshing my browser alive as we as we
go through this which is pretty pretty
cool can't get any smaller okay um I'm
gonna take this style and then actually
for the UL on us make it smaller at
center so wit will say it's gonna be
good and margin this is the centering
thing trick if you make them if you
define its width and then say its margin
of the left and right is auto then it
will be centered in the page so watch I
was like 50 pixels on top and bottom and
then auto for the whole center so if I
make this 700 you can see that it's it's
centered and give the UL down I don't
need to miss these because there's only
one li that's even going to be out oh
there's only one type of l'a that's on
the page and also I don't need to miss
them but I could easily do that incense
um I'll make the background and say
daddy
10 pixels and board yes now it's cute
see you have around those borders and
then it becomes cute that's just true
it's just good design cute stuff so
let's take is the image there and make
that cute to order fifty percent better
make it this circle that's cool and we
want say wait twenty twenty pixels
that's really small is it that's 20
persons I was expecting it to be much
bigger because I don't know what pixels
are now I was expecting it to be bigger
because of this screen that I'm coding
on it's like a low resolution blown up
really big so you guys can see closely
what I'm doing I'm trying to get that
right under my last few videos maybe
that you know everything is too small
but anyway 30 pixels here and I'm going
to take that was a call text you and
blow at left here's a cool thing with
code kit I'm a really really good mix in
library is included with it so i can
write at at the top include
Burton bit oops oh do you are beyond
import import okay now this is cool
check it out um see that little icon
changed much
all rights there anyway that little icon
that looks like a little drinking glass
that's the IKE that's Bourbons icon
bourbon is a mix in library that code
kit like has built into it Bourbons a
real thing that you can use without code
kit but coke it makes it easy to apply
all to go as the top of a main sass and
import bourbon you know and so instead
of saying height with right there I can
just do sighs 30 you don't need that and
look see where it says I'm like pointing
on the screen look where it says a size
30 if I go to the actual output style
it's going to be heightened with 30
that's a fun mix in okay anyway what was
it talking about left oh the reason I
wanted to put it bird of it bourbon and
nose because I wanted to add this mix
into and clear fix do you see how these
texts here was sticking out of my li box
that's because I floated it left and
parent containers will will wrap up
inside other ideas it'll jump up to a
head of the parent and will act as if
the effects of that floated container
are not is not even there which makes
sense when you think about it but
sometimes it's inconvenient so if i put
a clear fix on the bottom of the parent
container clear fix adds a invisible
element below everything and which will
make the parent rap around oops which
will make that parent rap around or
floated element watch all of your age 24
sticking out and now it's not that's
because i did a clear face and that was
a mix in that's part of bourbon Allah
SAS so exciting hope I'm not going too
long so
okay I'm like I feel like I feel fast
but here we are um also font sands this
because it's cooler there were you uh if
i take that text container see how it's
i wanted to float left but it's still
not it's still not going on the side of
the image there I take a margin left and
make it what it any good icon 30 35 40
oh I don't move I'm doing oh maybe I
should flip the image oh no yeah that's
not good why don't need that merchant
nah but I do but not for the reason of
time I don't need the margin to get
around the images need the margin get
that text away from the image still
margin left maybe a tank pixels and also
I feel like a new bad image does need to
be bigger make it fifty pixels maybe 45
see how fast it is to change the
dimension of the width and height of hat
icon using that mix in instead of having
to change two declarations I'm just
changing this one Nixon in its
outputting quickly and easily for me
yeah it looks pretty nice so let's take
these spans that we have here inside a
tix container in some margin right I
don't expect this to work what it did
work nevermind
Wow see I'm what I'm talking about into
the color too that's much nicer if I had
an icon font I'd throw like it no
subscriber icon or something on there
anyway this looks pretty fun whatever
what I wanted to show you this whole
video but styling was not even part of
the video what I wanted to show you is
how we can take this Li as a repeating
element and throw in a variable with kit
and and style up a lot of them actually
I should have just done it first and
then spelled it the anyway you I want to
see I want to see what it's like to have
a bunch of these elements here so go in
here and start of a variable sorry I was
dollar sign li equals and then oh this
works bang bang and it should there
still people in there okay cool so what
I did there's a long one showing doesn't
nothing looks different but I took that
code through into a variable and I call
that variable once look how easy is now
to have multiple instances of that one
code oh my gosh cool oh look i decided
that i did style it wrong look I need I
really need some need some margin on the
bottom of each of these elements they
look stupid but it up to against each
other like that by us all to dupes 10
pixels ah now that looks so wonderful
but let's say I'm thinking about it
looking at it again and I decide war
matter every other one too what area the
12
should be different color okay here's
what I want every other one the dot txt
come on tanner to load correct yes in
the image to yeah and then text on this
looks silly enough but like the point is
and then that span public space between
each declaration end it on that span we
can pull out that margin left in a head
pro is it mine right 0 pixels and put it
back margin pulled out 10 pixels right
yeah now that looks a lot better it
except for the text containing text
let's smart way to have only that text
container there here's what I would do I
don't know what I'm doing here's a quick
bit to do it right the selector yes but
won't have one of them what I want to do
oh yeah margin right 10 pixels yeah that
looks good this list is way too wide
you'd be like 500 I don't know maybe
like over here there's like a checkbox
or something if you're whatever anyway
the point is that like look at how many
of these instances of this thing that I
can look at inside Oh to connect group
the adage definitely should be styled
differently I can make decisions like
that seeing them all in a group and if I
want to change anything I just run up to
this variable and say oh you know it's
actually all over age 25 they all
quickly change just like that so that is
how code kit works with variables very
cool very useful and I think of run out
of time thanks for tuning in again if
you have any questions leave them below
in the comments and please subscribe to
the channel and guess I'm doing five of
these tonight and I'm really someone
sever you ever once every day this week
and you can subscribe and get them in
your food every day and then have a
video a new video every Monday usually a
lot more loud than this kids are
sleeping right now don't be so picky
talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
