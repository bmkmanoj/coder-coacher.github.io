summary and of course you're watching
depth tips with the well-known guest
hosts mpj and David I'm pretty satisfied
with how this turned out it's it's
really cool I am like I think that we
were all I was about to say that we were
a lot more productive than I anticipated
but the we did exactly what we were sad
yeah we supposed to and of course
everything is available on the MPAA's
better playlist github where you can
check out the commits and you can
replicate the commits yeah
should be by the way just show how you
check out the specific commits yeah so
let's do that
we suck commit yeah see just copy paste
that you just can click this one no yes
yeah copy the full sh a and then back to
the terminal
yep and here and then I just do git
checkout yep that commit exactly
so what's happened here is that it now
changed everything here yep into the
state that it had at the time of these
comments exactly so if you're looking at
the localhost so this is the current
live environment
but if we go to the local host version
we see that this is before we started
adding the styling some of you might
think this is the more beautiful part
and that it turned worse but and how do
I get back to the currents where I'm at
right now
good question yet check out master
perhaps yeah
can we ask you a recap of everything we
done yeah so it's we start
besides intro we talk a little bit about
why we think react.js is good for
prototyping like I hope that this entire
series has showed the power
react and the flexibility of it because
we can do all this with the real data
and when you sign in you will have your
data so that is the amazing part and
also all this stuff I love this
yeah like programming the styling yep
if you don't think that react is awesome
I know there is just nothing we can do
and you can go suck it after that we
sketched out the components we did a
drawing all the pretty much exactly like
we planned
after that we installed nodejs
and then we created reacts they create
react app the thing where like started
everything from we also like when we
installed oh yes we said that we would
demonstrate an NPM module somewhere
along the way we did yeah we use the
query string NPM module all that in and
we also pulled a pull in CSS reset oh
yeah we did
MPM oh poor little CSS an air module
just like that I didn't know you could
do that we are said we just tried it and
then we did our first pushes to github
all these commits we push to github and
we see all the commits here after that
we learned how to deploy to Heroku which
was basically the same thing like once
we have has everything set up we just
pushed commits to Heroku instead of
pushing it to github yeah and it just
magically updated the environments after
that we started populating the
components with some fake data or we
started creating a data structure for
our application we also had an
autocomplete during that episode or
perhaps we it was episode it was a
separate episode I don't remember but we
did autocomplete after that well X it's
not exactly it's not a dynamic filter
it's not no it's sorry we lied it's a
type a head
now it's a sub hard at all then it
started getting tricky because we wanted
to make oh or authentication with
Spotify so we had to create a back-end
server yeah also just published to
Heroku yeah it was that was probably the
episode that we struggled most with and
we ended up doing a template project
that you can use we didn't do that from
the start but we thought that that would
have been way too much detail to do and
I guess that is when you depending on
what you are what kind of prototype
you're building if you're building
within your company that's when you can
ask your developers to help you out to
figure out how to connect yeah I think
with the Irate guys yeah because that
part is going to be very different from
company to company but once we have done
that we started fetching data from the
spotify idea and that is that was a bit
tricky because of the promises I think
that's takes some getting used to it I
still haven't gotten that used to the
promise part of the patches well like
the first part all the data fetcher
oh yeah that's recently straightforward
say like there was just fetch and then
yeah like there was a promising ball but
it was not a ton of tonal complexity
there but then we started doing some
advanced ad mangling and that turned
quite quite into it yeah and that was
because for each playlist that we
fetched a list of playlists and then we
had for each playlist had to fetch that
playlist tracks yep and mesh mash them
together and stuff them into mangle them
into the data structure that we wanted
and of course we could have made this
perhaps a bit simpler if you first has
studied the API and seen the data
structure instead of just trying to
build our own data structure maybe but
on the other hand we could build
everything so that it sort of worked on
the client side without any proper data
yeah it's like I like the idea of
I intentionally wanted us to do that
actually because api's are very often
bad or at least unsuitable for your
purposes it's extremely common that you
have to like beat them into submission
and I think that this was a great
example of doing that they just they're
they're built for the generic case
they're not built for your specific app
this is development that is what
development is making bending reality
the imperfections of the reality into
your to your will
so I think that episode was good from
that perspective even if it was
complicated and in the last episode we
started styling everything and of course
it's not the most beautiful app site of
this commit message making it look
beautiful but hopefully it showed you
what is the whole greatness of react
with having all this in line coding we
put the CSS and we made it programmable
yeah exactly yeah programmable styling
is the I think it's it puts it very
succinctly so we want to thank you for
watching this series and you can check
out in PJ's channel by clicking there's
probably links in the description it's
called fun fun fun yeah
I want to thank Travis for having us
yeah it was great fun you should also
check out David's channel if you are a
Google Analytics first and that's it
that's it Cheers yes
