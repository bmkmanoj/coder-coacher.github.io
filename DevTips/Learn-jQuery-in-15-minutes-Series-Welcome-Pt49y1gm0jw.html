welcome to the video series called learn
jQuery in only 15 minutes ah jQuery is
the most popular JavaScript library that
ever existed seriously it is the most
widely used J's library ever written
period this is a search I did earlier
today on Google Trends you can see that
it absolutely dwarfs the other libraries
both in popularity and longevity I
worked at several companies that have
used backbone and angular heck even the
rails stack that I worked on they still
use jQuery in addition according to
built with com 78% of the top million
websites in the world use jQuery
no other libraries come even close to
that kind of penetration it's a powerful
tool and it really doesn't go out of
style it's been around for over 10 years
and they are only on version 2 which
means that it's really stable software
and everything you learn will not change
the next time you blink so learning
jQuery today is actually a really great
investment now I decided on the name of
these videos before I even created them
so packing everything into just 15
minutes was actually really difficult
but the goal is to deliver a solid
foundation in as condensed amount of
time as possible and I think that the
next few videos that you watch here are
going to set you up for great success in
this welcome video I'm actually going to
walk you through downloading and setting
up your project and in the next video
we'll actually start the timer will
cover selectors and animations and
filters and then in the video after that
we'll cover attributes and classes and
we'll also make a quick and dirty little
image swapper and the third video will
cover Dom traversal and event handlers
and at the end I show you how to make a
little laser light show with your
keyboard it's fun if any of that sounds
complicated don't worry it's really not
and I tried to make my tutorials as
simple and as fun as possible so let's
get started right now okay so to get
started we're going to have to download
jQuery library and install it into our
project after we're done
that I want to show you the first things
we need to do before we can really start
writing jQuery code so to download it
let's go to jQuery comm as we are right
here and we can just click on this
download button and there's a few ways
to do this actually and keep in mind
that there's also a few different
versions of jQuery that you have the
option to choose right now I'm using
jQuery to point to point two this is the
latest and there's also a current
version of jQuery one and we can talk
about the differences another time but
you can download this file directly if I
just click the download and I get the
file right there other ways to use it or
by using package managers like bower
another popular way to do it is by using
a CDN which is a content delivery
network you don't have to download the
file at all you just copy this line and
then go into your your HTML and just
paste it in and then you have jQuery
installed that's an easy way to do it
but you have to have an internet
connection when you're coding so I tend
to actually download the code myself and
then just use a script tag to link it to
my HTML page now you notice them I'm
putting these script tags the last thing
in the document right before the end
body tag right there like the last thing
if I expand this section you see a bunch
of HTML here and then the very last
thing is the script tag now right end
that is another script tag and this one
is a document called learn jQuery j/s
and if I open up my sidebar you can see
here that I've got this file called
learn jQuery and it's a blank file at
the moment this is where we're going to
be typing out the code for this whole
series in learn jQuery ojs and so we
have the order here is important first
it's jQuery and then learn jQuery you
need to include jQuery before what we
write because we're going to be using
what was included right above us okay
that's important and that's installing
jQuery it's pretty simple but it's
important to get it right now let's talk
about a few conventions that we need to
understand before we can start writing
and using jQuery the first one is this
little dollar sign you're going to see
this a lot in the next few videos here
on dev tips when we're going through
learning jQuery and 15min
this dollar sign is kind of shorthand
for the word jQuery you're going to see
it written like this dollar paren and
then like you know an ID or something
and that is exactly the same as writing
jQuery paren ID exactly the same thing
it's just shorter to write jQuery is not
the only library that uses the dollar
sign so there's ways around using but um
you know them together but that's what
that means when you see that dollar that
is a shorthand for jQuery it's it's
jQuery calling the jQuery object and you
don't need to really worry about that
too much just to understand that that
dollar sign is shorthand for jQuery now
another thing to keep in mind is we have
something in jQuery called the document
ready statement right it looks something
like this dollar which means jQuery and
then inside your write document and then
you use a method called ready now
document ready means that everything
that's going to be inside here every
every function that's going to be inside
this ready let me write a function is
going to be acted upon after the
document itself is is ready is loaded
now that doesn't mean after that page is
rendered on the browser it just means
that the Dom is is read by the browser
and it knows what all of the nodes are
the document tree has been parsed
basically okay now now why is that
important let's say and we're going to
learn about selectors in the next lesson
but let's say we want to wanted we want
to identify that that ID and we're using
jQuery and saying hey jQuery read that
document and find this specific ID well
if this hat if this kind of statement
happens out here and the browser is so
fast that it reads through this
JavaScript before it even knows what the
page is there's no way that it can find
that ID in the HTML because it's not
been read yet so what this statement
here does on line one is that says don't
don't fire off this JavaScript contained
in here until the document itself the
Dom has been parsed by the browser and
you'll see this kind of statement here
all the time that you put your code
inside of the document ready now there's
a shortcut to writing the document ready
also which is dollar and then inside
those parentheses you start writing that
function like an anonymous function and
then anything you put inside here will
be the same as this it's basically the
same thing just a little bit shorter
most of the times you'll probably see
that second one because because it's
shorter it doesn't really mean anything
different I personally actually kind of
like to do this one it's a little bit
more expressive and lit it reminds me
exactly what's happening but it doesn't
matter so these two things are important
to keep in mind number one that this
means jquery and number two that this
document ready statement is required for
functions that are going to be happening
to the document itself right we want to
make sure the document is loaded before
we act upon it and that's it you have
those two little nuggets of wisdom and
now we're ready to move on to the other
videos and learn actually how to use
jQuery okay so the timer starts in the
next video see you then you can find all
the code on github the link is in the
video description down below learn
jQuery in 15 minutes learn jQuery and 15
Mirage learn jQuery in 15 minutes large
a great 15 months owned a create 15
minute large I fell a logic really in 15
minutes learn jQuery in 15 minutes
learn jQuery in 15 minutes shoo-shoo
their jQuery 15 minutes
let me take query in 15 minutes
stupid learn jQuery in 15 minutes
learn jQuery in 15 minutes learn jQuery
and learn take what learn jQuery in 15
minutes
learn jQuery in 15 minutes
do the other ones whose I'm not sure
which which one it is learn jQuery 15
minutes learn jQuery in 15 minutes
learn jQuery in 15 minutes
why are so aggressive one on jQuery in
15 minute learn jQuery in 15 minutes
learn jQuery in 15 minutes learn jQuery
in 15 minutes
learn jQuery in 15 minutes learn jQuery
15 minute turn jQuery fifteen Rick okay
here in 15 neck out of here
learn jQuery in 15 minutes
you know I don't know if any of those
are good let's move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
