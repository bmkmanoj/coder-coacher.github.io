features I asked you to tell me what
your favorite atom packages were I read
the comments I counted the likes you
influenced this video so this time if it
sucks it's your fault here are the top 5
atom packages as chosen by you alright
the way this is going to work so I'm
going to present to you the top 5
packages of atom chosen by you guys and
I'm going to read the comment about the
package that was uploaded the most ok so
coming in at number 5 is a comment from
the designer who says I like atom - in
my favourite package is Emmet so let's
look at Emmet we're going to install
packages Emmet M is a tool that coders
used to expand their text it's it's
really simple to use I have a simple
HTML file here I'm going to go in here
and write the word div and then tab when
I tab that it turns into a div wrapped
around and my cursor is on the inside so
I can just start typing hello alright
but it's more powerful than that
not just div and expanded but you can
say div class hello
and then when you expand it it has the
class of hello any so you see the syntax
looks kind of like CSS and expand it and
turns into regular HTML but this you can
actually create pretty complicated
strings here and it will expand into
pretty robust markup so for example
let's say we have an ID of page and
inside of that a child you would use
this brackets to say the child would be
like a div with a class of logo and a
sibling so use a + to say the next thing
is going to be a sibling of what came
before it is going to be an ID of nav
and it's going to be actually let's make
that ID beyond a ul so a ul with an ID
of nav and a child of the nav ID which
is a ul is going to be a li
in Li let's say it's not just going to
be one let's say times fives we want
five allies to the inside of that nav ul
this is getting complicated already
right and in in each side and inside of
each of those allies I want to put an
anchor tag and I want the anchor tags
each to have some text in there so I'm
going to write these curly braces and
we'll say item because the each one is
going to have the word item and then the
number so I'll put this dollar sign the
number of so there's going to be five
right so it's going to go number one two
three four five all right so now that we
have all this like complicated
complicated string written out it's but
it's just one line right and the more
comfortable you get with ml I'm just a
starter I haven't really used it before
but the more comfortable you get with it
the more this type of expression will
become more natural to you but here's
the magic I'm just going to hit tab and
look at that I've got a pretty complex
HTML structure here which is giving me
exactly what I expected I have an ID of
page with a class of logo and a sibling
is an idea of now with L eyes with
anchor tags inside them in the text of
item one two three four and five inside
so uh that's Emmet it can go it can get
pretty pretty expressive I've seen I've
seen developers I went to a meet-up once
and I was watching the ZURB the guys who
made foundation they were they were
giving a preview of what they were
working on when they were working on
foundation six and the dude was just so
fast he created an entire layout he was
using Emmet and he was just so quick
with it so I think that if you wanted to
get quick with Emmet it would be a big
boon in your tool belt as a developer
and it's something that I mean now that
I've installed it you might see it a
little bit more on dev tips so this is a
great recommendation thanks a lot guys
coming in at number four with 13
Rodrigo's comment for terminal plus he
says terminal plus love it not perfect
or too popular but it's awesome
so terminal plus what is that let's go
check it out terminal plus gives us a
little line here at the bottom and I can
hit this little plus button and get a
terminal window the terminal window is
going to be automatically pointed at the
project folder that we're working in so
here it's it's pointed at I'm just using
the dev tips starter kit so it's pointed
at the dev tip starter kit master so
this is interesting let's just throw a
terminal command in here
mkdir make directory and we'll say a
color directory hello and it did it just
created a new directory inside of my M
inside of my project here and depending
on how good you are with the terminal
this could be a lot faster than all
these you know right clicks I've been
doing so let me just what remove the dry
the directory here her new and then it's
gone cool just exactly what you'd expect
I think you can probably do more than
one window as well and that's how you
got like these tabs of windows open and
then if you hit X out here it closes all
the windows cool so it's it's just a
simple terminal window if you're running
Jekyll or if you're running like some
ruby stuff like it would be pretty
pretty convenient to have a terminal
window built into your text editor
rather than having to use it separately
that I like I've been using it so this
is a great recommendation Thank You
Rodrigo coming in at number three with
sixteen votes Lucas says I really like
Adam I installed mini-map so it looks
like sublime text and then like little
bunny ear not not buddy here's one of
those eyeballs or something so let's
take a look at mini-map and what that
does is it creates this little well it's
called a mini-map but I think it's
self-explanatory what it is but it's a
it's a it's a smaller representation of
the structure and markup and like how
its highlighted of the code that you're
working on the code document and this is
interesting if you have a really long
document this can be helpful because
it's smaller easy
to parse what part is like for example I
know this white chunk here is the is the
pretext right it's coded as previous one
know everything in theirs or like oh I
know this nest looks like the one I'm
looking for this is this particular
section so so this is helpful if you
have a lot of large or long documents
this is going to be helpful to navigate
them visually there's also an option
here to move this on to the left if you
like that and back on the right this
looks like sublime text by default
pretty cool thank you very much Lucas
coming in at number two with 18 votes
window face says Travis have you ever
used brackets code editor I've been
using it for a while now and I love it
why did I know that somebody was gonna
say brackets and you know what gets me
is that it's the second most highest
voted comment okay next next got zero
votes this is just an honorable mention
this had zero votes but Romain Roman
Roman Roman Roman Roman but Roman
suggests that we take a look at the
package called Doge so apparently after
I've installed Doge I can go in anywhere
and write the word Doge and there's
gonna there's a little dog a little Doge
dog what I don't know why anybody would
want that installed but it's kind of
funny I don't understand why but that
gets an honorable mention because it's
silly and for number one package voted
on by you guys with 21 votes at the time
of counting is suggested by Dennis and
it's called Adam bootstrap 4 let's go
install that
if you're a user of bootstrap this I can
see this being extremely helpful so what
it does is it adds all of these
expandable what are they one of these
things called snippets to your library
so for example if I write BTN which is a
which is a class in Adam and I hit enter
it's going to it it's going to expand
the text and put my cursor right in the
middle of this button tag now the button
has bootstrap specific classes already
attached so if I have bootstrap
installed in this project or linked up
in CSS these buttons will be meaningful
these classes will be meaningful in this
button will be already styled and this
is this is a small example but like look
it I don't know let's just write grid
and there's an example of how a glitter
it'd would be set up including options
for classes so it wouldn't be you know
call XS SM MDL you just choose one of
these so I want it like large so it's
but it's interesting that they're giving
you the options for the for the classes
so that isn't here's let's try let's try
one let's go back to button and see we
can find a button group like a drop-down
button group Wow look at that
so we expands to like pretty detailed
markup which is exactly what bootstrap
recommends the structure of it and
everything to get those to go those
classes working right away so if you do
use bootstrap a lot which it looks like
a lot of you guys do this is going to be
a pretty valuable extension or a package
to Adam so thanks for that
recommendation Dennis and thank you
everyone who suggested other packages
that maybe they were voted enough those
were awesome too I looked at a lot of
them that you guys said but these are
the top five that you voted for this
will be the last video that I'll be
doing about Adam for a while but I want
to remind you that tomorrow I'll be at
Adobe San Francisco headquarters hosting
a
a two-hour live show on their twitch
channel so visit twitch.tv slash Adobe
I'm going to be teaching you guys about
design thinking and sketching I'm going
to be using their new Adobe comment
application and if we have time for it
I'm going to be doing some coding so
it's going to be a really exciting thing
and I'm really excited to share with you
I need you to be there I need you to
show it because it's live it's not like
this record you watch at any time and
whatever it's like a live show and
there's going to be a comment stream and
I'm going to have somebody there reading
the comments to me so I can interact
live and and they say you know the guy
that I'm speaking that says that it
turns into be more like it
question-and-answer interview show more
than more than anything so if you guys
want to play a part of that if you want
to interact with with Adobe's team and
with me live on the show show up
tomorrow at 10 o'clock in the morning
and that's a Pacific time so GMT minus 8
and I'm just like I'm really I'm like so
I'm nervous about it I have like all
these butterflies I hope it goes really
well and I need you I need you to help
it go really well I really do so I'm
calling in all my favorite show up come
to the come to the live show again as
twitch TV slash Adobe tomorrow 10:00
a.m. be there ok now let's talk about
this this channel um as you know is
supported by the patrons of the channel
right a patron of the channel is
somebody who has thought that the things
that we cover and the things that we do
here on this channel are helpful enough
provide enough value to them and to
other people that they support the show
by donating a dollar amount of their
choice most people most people donate
four dollars per episode and and these
people aside from the warm fuzzies I get
for supporting the show directly they
also they get up get a few perks number
one is that they get to watch the shows
early and they also get extra you know
special videos that normal normal
everyday YouTube Watchers don't get a
scene they also get a podcast episodes
that are special for them and I record
them in send those out they get what
else live live Google Hangouts that we
do once a month and those are pretty
awesome and actually I do them once a
month but the community is doing them
every week on Sunday they're just doing
it by themselves and it's so cool I
can't show up but like they're just
doing it there's a lot of great people
and most of these people meet and
correlate inside of the dev tips chat
which is which is one of the other
benefits of the patrons right so there's
a depth it's chat relationships are
being made I know people are getting
criticisms I mean they're asking for
critiques on their work and friendships
are being forged we post gifts there's
like a bunch of inside jokes that's
anyway it's a lot of fun I'm just
rambling now because I don't have a
script right now making this all up
usually everything I do is scripted
now I'm rambling again okay that's the
end of the video thank you so much for
watching and keep on
keep on hanging I read the comments I
counted the I read the comments I
counted the likes you influenced this
video I read your comments I counted the
likes you influenced this video so this
time if it sucks it's your fault I read
the comments I counted the likes you for
a while but I want you to mm-hmm
thanks for watching this video this will
be the last go away car okay this will
be the last now the button tag has um
these are these are the that was quite a
ramble like my scarf my daughter made it
it's really thin she's five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
