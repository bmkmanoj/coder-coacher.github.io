requested topics in the comments below
today we're looking at internet cat
memes just kidding today we're looking
at parallax ah this will be a multi-part
series this week we're looking at just
what parallax is and what are some more
of the useful and effective examples of
it next week we'll talk about how do we
can build these things using real-life
code examples now the hard thing about
making your video about parallax is
really just getting clear on what
parallax is or in other words what
implementation of parallax do we want to
focus on let me show you what I mean the
phenomena of parallax is a result of
having a perspective in 3d space when
movement is introduced to the
observational experience if I take my
camera here and line up these toys I
stole for my kids I'm creating a
perspective you can see that the objects
in the background appears smaller and
the one in the Midtown larger and the
one in the foreground the largest at the
moment this is not parallax this is
perspective when I pan the camera you
can see that the toys appear to move in
space at different paces the one in the
background slower than the ones closer
to us now this is parallax objects
moving in space at different paces
relative to us the viewer the reason
this effect is so popular is because
it's very true to life by an ocular
beings like us experience this all the
time we use it to understand the world
around us the tell if a car is coming
close or away from us to catch a frisbee
and to tell if our crush is leaning in
for the kiss astronomers use these
parallax principles to measure the
distance between galaxies it's a real
thing and we as real things connect with
it because it is so but here's the rub
these digital surfaces are not real
there are simulated experiences
we faked it and there are a few ways to
do that there are a number of creative
ways to use the principle of parallax to
create an interesting feature on your
webpage I have 20 examples that we're
going to go through right now and I've
broken them into eight sections the
first one I call fixed background
scrolling body the first example in this
category a fixed background scrolling
body is okay Studios de and I mean just
as I described before we have a few
elements in the foreground and maybe
even take the liberty of blurring these
elements here so they look like they're
definitely in the foreground and as we
scroll the page this main hero image
stays exactly still it's just a fixed
position and the rest of the the body
will scroll by the next section will
cover that that fixed position hero
image and then when it when it is done
scrolling by it will reveal another
separate different image but fixed in
the same way and this time we're using
the same type of technique having
elements in the foreground that are
blurred to make it make it seem like a
really deep image and in this way of
having foreground mid-ground and
background images right background is
this what I called what are these things
called two cans now that's a flamingo
did you know that flamingos are not pink
naturally that's what they eat anyway
there's a flamingo in the background in
the mid-ground would be this this text
block here and the logo and the
foreground would be this pencil if they
really wanted to accentuate this effect
they would have this pencil scrolling at
a different pace but that's just one
nuance and by not doing it actually made
it a lot easier for them in terms of
development complexity another example
here is cut your studios they have again
these big background here nice
photography and they're scrolling their
website right on top of the background
images and these ones are actually using
a carousel so you can switch through the
images here I'm not sure what oh this is
just a theme I did I thought this is
actually a photographer website but okay
so DC
this screen that they put on top of the
images there's like a black screen on it
so every other row or start every other
column of pixels here has has black
overlay on top of it now the reason they
do that is that they can use lower
resolution images and multiply the size
of the images without it looking too
pixelated or gross because you're it's
an effect that will allow you to use
these these larger images because when
you're blowing up images full screen you
kind of want to be cognizant of people
who have lower resolution screens right
and or even not just lower resolution
screens but also slower internet speeds
and this will give them hopefully a
better browsing experience they don't
have to wait as long for the page to
load which could be a problem with these
fullscreen backgrounds so this screen
here adds an artistic effect but also
there's a technical reason for doing
that so this this is the section these
two examples are what I call fixed
background scrolling body ok the next
section is something I call slow
elements and this is when basically you
have elements scrolling at different
paces in this case we have this
background it looks fixed but it is
actually moving and where the mid-ground
is this photograph here of this
gentleman with a gold medal and the the
foreground would be this paragraph of
text now I wouldn't say this is a
winning design and it's funny because
when I was looking at examples of
parallax this page for Jason Kenny OB
came up a lot I don't even know why it's
not even anyway I want to critique the
design but it's like extremely hard to
read this right here and like
everything's like really chunky and I
don't know I wasn't - anyway let's see
what else do we have in the slow
elements category unfold I like how
they're using not just like photos that
land in a specific place so so if we go
back to Jason Kenny a lot of this
doesn't look good
until you're at a very specific spot
maybe right here is what the designer
when they were designing and static was
thinking I want this three on the left
above the paragraph the paragraph to lay
on top of the of the photograph here and
they're just like like experimenting
with ideas now that I think about it the
reason maybe it showed up on a lot of
search results is because it's older
this looks like an older implementation
it's not as elegant so what the next
example is done here in unfold no
they're using the same technological
technique in creating these slow
elements and people things moving at
different paces but they're not at any
one time making text illegible
but they are creating interest in making
like this line this simple line interact
with the text is not like that big huge
photo and even this navigational section
up here when the time comes for it to be
on a black background it will adapt it
will turn into a black background dark
background navigation now it'll be red
Oh scrolling up oh cool
I didn't realize I wasn't scrolled at
the top clever all right next one uh
this one is still in the slow elements
category and it's the new Apple MacBook
promotion page right there new golden
MacBook this this effect they're doing
right here where the MacBook just like
is falling through the air and opening
and like landing gracefully right here
this is an interesting effect it I won't
like dive too much into it but they're
controlling a video by how much you
scroll so it's really interesting really
unique and complex but this see that
shadow that lands and kind of moves into
place see how it's not touching the REC
book and it'll move into place in the
end get more opaque as the MacBook
closes in on it at that shadow is a
large image even though the what's
happening right above it is a video it's
super cool there did a really great job
on that but what I wanted to show about
this these slow elements are things like
how the MacBook when it's being revealed
it's parallaxing down like the the image
is moving down from its container but
it's very subtle they use subtlety to
enhance the experience of the viewer but
at the same time not bring so much
attention attention to the effect that
it takes away from the message and this
this will be a really great experience
for the user in the end help them to
understand what the message is and what
action they should be taking on the
website it's so easy to get carried away
with these effects to make really bad
decisions you see how this text is
cinching up as it Scrolls down but also
like it's not too much like this this
image of the of the laptop right here I
don't think is parallaxing at all these
next images I don't think are
parallaxing at all I mean just refresh
the page and I'll show you another
effect that I want to point out it's in
another section in this kind of all of
these examples called landing elements
the idea here is that your page is
scrolling by normally but as you hit a
certain point things will like fall into
place or appear and land at a specific
area that that's already laid out for
them but when they do their scrolling at
the normal speed of the page the effect
is that they've come from somewhere else
when you're scrolling and landed exactly
where they should be let me show you
what I mean when I scroll down at the
MacBook effect which again it's just
brilliant but right here at the bottom
look under this paragraph did you see
those numbers appear it was really
subtle they just kind of scoot in from
the from the right and refresh and do
that again pay attention to the bottom
right here I'm scrolling see those
numbers they all kind of parallax in and
different speeds the the larger numbers
come in faster than the labels the the
little letters down at the bottom makes
a really really great effect it brings
attention to the statistics that they're
trying to point out they want to show
that this MacBook is light that it's
thin and that it has a great display so
that I think they use a really great way
let's look at the next website in this
section of landing elements this is
called streamline their selling icons
let me refresh the page and you'll see
like it's a little bits
compared to the subtlety of the Apple
website that we just looked at this is
look a lot more aggressive so let me
refresh this and watch jointly
everything is just like jumping in all
at once like I think the whole page just
assembled itself the illustrations the
icons down below the headlines these
buttons popped in but as I scrolled in
scroll down you're going to see more and
more of this stuff just like bouncing
and all over the place now I personally
think this is a little bit much I think
they're a little bit heavy-handed on it
but you have to admit it does create a
little bit of interest and keep the user
scrolling down if you think about like
what the goal is as a as an interaction
designer so as a web designer is to
organize the information and display it
in a way that helps people to interact
with it and create and perform actions
that you want them to write but an
interaction designer will have a few
other a few other goals for example
create interest and and punctuate
different information points for example
here in each section
you're like loading in I think we're
done okay even these big boxes are
animated in let me read the reloads page
again and you'll see like like even
though it is like really kind of corny
you're gonna be like oh a headline just
jumped in like let me look at it and
stuff so and it also might keep you
scrolling to see like what else is going
to jump in and I don't know I have mixed
feelings about just say that this
phone's jumped all the way across the
screen amazing now this one is done
using a library actually there's library
for all these jumping this I forgot what
it's called it's called wow Jas is that
right duh gee yes yeah this guy
Wow touch everything you could possibly
think of ah goodness
okay so wowed ijs is the library that
they're using here by the way all right
the next example and the last example in
the landing
category is microsoft has done a really
good exam
job here of not being as subtle as the
Apple one but of course not being as
obtuse or aggressive as the is the line
icons a website so as I scroll down now
this this webpage is from Microsoft but
it's more of like a like a PR kind of
thing they're talking about their actual
teams and they're kind of selling
themselves as a personality so watch
what happens when I scroll down I'm
getting to like a more of an article
situation here and things at the bottom
start like looks like a messy desks like
this team that they're showing it or
this kind of like Department and their
company is called the garage this is
like where they experiment on things
they have a bunch of engineers and
designers working together in a really
messy environment to to innovate new
creative things so they want to make it
feel really really um you know kind of
haphazard in and creative and and just
like like mad science right and so when
they scroll down and refresh that you
scroll down these things kind of just
like looks like a table that just got
thrown you know like some capacitors on
and some motherboards on right here and
which is nice I think a nice effect I
like to also do you see how these um
these controls for the slide show came
in and refresh that they just kind of
about jump in after you get to a certain
point and that's nice as well because
remember you can use these these this
idea of landing elements to create
interest to things that the user should
interact with so if these controls here
we're there the whole time and I had to
mouse over them for them to like respond
for example give me this animation of
yes please click me it would be less
noticeable right but if I scroll down to
this carousel and I see the controls
come in I noticed them because we're
kind of like a t-rex right we notice
movement and were like oh okay that I
guess I want to click on that I just saw
it move I'm hungry
yeah okay let's continue on next we're
going to look at a new category called
multiple directions and the first
website in that quatre category is
called main quarterly comm slash Thoreau
and if I come down here to a few
different of these articles I'm going to
click on this bottom one called
exploring nature finding ourselves okay
so we have like a full screen experience
the the text is moving and this is not
what I'm talking about but this is a
great example of fixed background moving
elements that we discussed earlier right
but when we get down here we have this
this bisected view to full screen images
and one's a video and watch this there's
there my screen locks my scroll kind of
locks I'm scroll up here and then like
that it feels like it stops scrolling
and then then the the element start
scrolling in different directions and
this is controlled by my mouse right
it's like it's a wild and disorienting
and weird but also interesting and then
they land and can continue to scroll up
together so so do I like it I don't
think I like it I think it's weird and
disorienting it doesn't tell me a good
story but also like it definitely keeps
me scrolling like I'm gonna find the end
of this scroll because like I gotta know
why I'm looking at this weird stuff that
like is scrolling in different
directions it's a very interesting
design in terms of unusualness I don't
like it's a very unique design I don't
know that it's a pleasing design I'm not
filled with delight when I'm scrolling
I'm very agitated but at the same time
it's an effective design because it
keeps me scrolling so their goal is to
just have Travis scroll all the way down
their page or at least to the bottom of
this parallaxing section and I did it I
did do it because I wanted to see it now
I have more of the fixed background
scrolling elements which is the first
section this this this main quarterly
com /throe is full of this stuff look at
that big big background video
I like it very interesting website
alright the next one that has multiple
Direction elements is really cool
this one is called called carousel dot
drop box calm and carousel is a product
that Dropbox has created and it's really
cool so it's all about photos and using
photos to like be organized and create
moments and stuff whatever but so check
out this big hero photograph right here
the rest of the website will scroll away
and this this element is moving in a
different direction than the rest of the
website and it's landing on a specific
place in the example area here so
they've created like an iPhone layout
and then they have like a layout that
would you would find inside of their
application and as I scroll down the
layout inside of the application gets
manipulated a few different times but
that one image is always there right
it's getting moved and shrank and skewed
and rotated and there we go keep on
scrolling you know it's in a different
spot and then it moves back and then it
gets scrolled away so that is an example
of multiple Direction elements things
just get are flying around depending on
where you're at in the scroll in the
scroll journey there we are okay so the
next one is called Mouse movements these
are these are things that are happening
depending on where you're placing your
mouse this one is an example of J
parallax which is a jQuery plugin so
depending on where I have my mouse your
the parallax is happening but we have
the same elements of quickly moving
foregrounds moderately moving mid
grounds and slowly moving backgrounds
see that Sun is barely moving
but this foreground of these trees and
whatever is moving very quickly they
have tons of really interesting examples
a Beatles rock band to use this which is
cool or if it's still up
oh okay
either my browser is just really slow
right now or this website is like jank
because it was back in oh nine yeah
there's like the stylesheet missing this
is a cool this is a really cool website
when it came out I remember that when
that game came out anyway the next one
of this what is it called mouse
movements parallax is this one that so
they created a cool star field effect
and wherever I move my mouse the star
field is is is moving so they have stars
in the foreground they're brighter they
have some like would look like astronomy
not astronomy astrological signs and and
whatnot in the background and but the
content on bring your attention to this
fact the content is not parallaxing this
menu is the same everywhere I go when I
click into one of these elements the
content is just giving me a regular
scroll so the next one is actually my
own website I did a root beer tasting
article but I wanted the navigation here
to not be a drop down or a side scroll
so I put it all up in the top and then
I'd parallax did so no matter where you
are in the top you can get to one of
these root beers but it's gonna you know
you you bring more of that navigation
into the top it's very experimental I
wouldn't do this with like a like a
production level website because it's
not really that intuitive but it is an
interesting way of using the parallax
via the mouse movement effect to show
you that there are different
navigational items to explore cool all
right the next section I just have one
example and this is just called
thumbnailing
I was called a thumbnailing but the idea
is that it's similar to the mouse
movement but it's basically when you put
your mouse over a region it's no longer
it's not falling you're following your
mouse like those other parallax mouse
movements examples were it's more like
it activates this section this thumbnail
in these cases and we're going to
have some parallax movement happening so
in these lily examples the background is
sliding to the to the right Sadie
nothing is happening in terms of the
background we find another one okay
these Leila examples the background is
sliding down to just parallaxing moving
a little bit differently than you
normally would expect creating a little
bit more of a 3-dimensional view the
there's another one here Ruby Ruby is
going to give you a little bit more of
that depth of feed because they're
actually zooming out when you in when
you hover over this over this background
all right now there's this website type
an SEO drops com is a KO drop type and
Escom it's got tons of these really
great examples I'm really inspired by
these people all the time but this is an
article called I think subtle hover
effects and they use parallax and really
good in a charming way charming really
good way and you should definitely check
it out but that's the only example I
have for the thumbnailing events because
because they have so many examples on
this page right likes the other zooming
out right here and they teach you how to
do all of these examples to really cool
the next section I have is called I call
follow the rabbit okay so in the follow
the rabbit parallax event or in the in
the follow of the rabbit parallax
category you're going to have something
on the screen that is more or less
stable and it's going to be fixed and as
you scroll things are going to be
happening around and to it to create a
narrative and helpfully hopefully
portray the message of the web design so
in this case I have this Royal British
Legion and they're talking about poppy
seeds which is a tradition in England to
commemorate the fallen soldiers of
various Wars and it comes from a really
beautiful poem called in Flanders field
I don't can't remember too much about it
it's a beautiful thing and it's a great
cause but we have here this this poppy
seed design in the
in the center and as you scroll down the
poppy seed shows up in different ways in
kind of the same area right so that
it'll kind of fade out and disappear
here when you're initially scrolling but
as you get to the next section the poppy
seed shows up again in the same vertical
area although it is kind of scrolling up
and down but it's showing up in
different contexts so right here you're
teaching the kids about the the poppy
seeds and about the veterans and about
the sacrifices that they have made and
it's really cool interactive way like
the poppy seed is now being Illustrated
on the chalkboard for kids to understand
now as we continue to scroll down we see
that the poppy seed shows up in a in a
veteran's house or maybe in this case
it's the mother of a veteran here's
another of multi direction scrolling if
you have this mouse in a in a sewer
sewer pipeline as you scroll down it's
cute Triceratops and again the poppy
seed shows up at the bottom kind of
representing a beach day for the the
veteran family just adorable these kids
jump up from noir and the castle kind of
builds itself right here it's beautiful
I really enjoy it okay let's continue on
we're still looking at follow the rabbit
this one is called lost world affairs /
Atlantis and and it was designed by
forget the gentleman's name but he is
also a very notable author and Frank
Frank Camaro and it was sponsored by
Microsoft I think it was a few years ago
but anyway the idea here the concept
here is that this this guy in this kind
of elevator that's like submarine
elevator is going to keep going down the
tube and eventually find this lost world
of Atlantis and it's really fun and it
scrolls for like freakin forever
and and the elevator tube is basically
fixed the whole time and things are
moving around it and you're getting this
story of you know how far does it go and
here's some factoids and this little
counter here is taking taking note of
how far you've scrolled or in other
words how far this elevator the sub
submarine elevator has traveled and
there's kind of like things that are
happening around it it's good it's good
there's a Loch Ness monster
giant squid and eventually where are we
ah Atlantis we land see that's fun this
is an early example of you of this
technique as well that is pretty
innovative at the time it was it was
designed and created
here's another innovative one this is a
this is for a security like an Internet
security website and this guy named Ben
is kind of like a li on the professional
character and he's French and he's
walking down this street it's a really
seedy kind of like nor kind of thing
like here's somebody in this situation
somebody got mugged and Ben's like
washing walking by it is like yeah this
stuff happens but but not to you because
I got your back I'm the bodyguard you
know it's pretty funny she's walking
through like a vise kind of wow that's
weird it's really it's really dark
website actually this train is
controlled by parallax anyway so a lot
of things happen to Ben as he walks
through these see
CD city streets and what have you I have
one more for follow the rabbit and this
win it when it first was introduced
which is like a big deal everybody was
like ah I can't believe this so here we
are this is the pencil website it's a
it's a mouse or not some Mouse it's a
stylus that was designed by 53 who are
the makers of an iPad app a drawing app
so this is a like a high what is it
called
like a high-end iPad stylus is what this
thing is anyway so they want to sell you
one on what pencil is and what it can do
for you and they're kind of showing you
examples of how it works and what it'll
enable you to do unlock your creativity
and all that junk but in the bottom they
want to show you what went into making
it why is this pencil so expensive and
why do we consider it a high-end piece
of technology now at the bottom here
we're going to see this pencil show up
it'll scroll into view and then the
suddenly the the pencil itself will lock
right and things will start coming out
of it and work it's going to have like
an exploded view of the technology
inside so first of all the eraser tip
now the Bluetooth technology bit here's
the body now we're going to talk about
the nib we have the power source the
sensors the the tip and it's all
exploded but it's it's using parallax
for things moving in a different pace to
allow this explosion to happen and me as
the viewer I'm like witnessing I'm
controlling the explosion so it's very
explorative I'm going to I'm going to
scroll down and be like oh the eraser
tip on all pause and read it all
Bluetooth smart pause and read and so
forth and in this way they're going to
sell me on each little bit of their of
their technology which is really really
clever and a great experience for me to
it's very it's interesting it's not too
heavy-handed things aren't flying around
and being obnoxious but but it's like
very interactive and what I like most
about it is that I as the viewer am
controlling the parallax it's it's 100%
tied to my mouse movement if it's going
too fast all stops rolling I'll just
slow down and let myself pace myself so
a lot of these parallax things that kind
of multiply mouse scroll movements or
are triggered by them in our
their own animation pace so this is a
really really elegant example of letting
the user control the pace of information
but also giving them that kind of more
interactive more visual of the serial
pleasurable kind of scrolling experience
so that is the last of the examples of
what I call follow the rabbit and the
last two examples are what I call
zooming elements this one is on my own
website sorry if I'm doing my own
examples it's weird but like I was just
thinking of what I know of things that
do this stuff and of course I know my
own so I'm just showing you anyway
anyway so this is called zooming zooming
elements this is an article I did on my
website just talking about my own
personal workflow tools the different
applications or websites or services or
like even like podcasts and blogs that I
visit so when when you scroll down this
little bunny is imaged here it will just
kind of like start zooming and expanding
it's tied to the scroll and it'll just
keep going infinitely large and I call
that so it so it's not like moving at a
different pace like the element itself
is not moving but the but the content of
the of this box accont the the image
that's in this container is moving at a
different pace and a different direction
it's actually coming towards you and out
it's um the zoom is is anchored to
center bottom so his feet are not going
to change as much as his ears are
because they're further away from the
center in the bottom so you zooming out
the last example I have of the same
thing as a New York Times article where
they've made they've done the same
technique but they've broken it into
different layered elements to make a
little bit more immersive experience so
when I scroll we have this like
Cagefighting background when I scroll
the different background elements will
break off and start zooming away and it
makes me feel like I'm looking at this
cage fight and I'm walking into the
crowd and I'm walking between the
different spectators and I'm getting
closer to this cage fight see how they
kind of like come towards me and and go
go past me and they blur a little bit
dilip ler no I guess they don't maybe I
don't know but um I really like that I
really like that I really like that
effect and they do it a few times as you
scroll down let's find another one to do
they have this like a comic book motif
so here here we have this gentleman you
can see them through the window and as
you scroll the the part of the
illustration that contains the character
is zooming as I scroll in but not the
frame of the window so again it makes me
feel like like remember how I define
parallax's being a situation that is
observable in 3d space based on the up
based on the perspective of the viewer
this really feels like I am the viewer
and walking towards the the the picture
right like I'm walking towards this guy
I'm creeping up and looking through a
window at him and he's noticing me as he
turns around so literally interesting
experience and I feel like I'm getting
closer to these people understanding
their grief or whatever their mourning
as the as the scroll happens it's so
interesting that I can control the story
I feel like I'm in control as of yore
it's really impactful so a great great
job in New York Times
my name is the version that the example
that I gave you here is just like a
little weird stupid trick but they're
using it to tell a story and they're
doing such a great job like it it's it's
like an emotionally impactful it's like
right here I feel like I want to go and
comfort these people right here I feel
like I'm I'm peeking in on this guy I'm
learning about his secret or his his
like you know like something like I'm
discovering something like I'm a
detective or a peeping tom or something
weird and then at the top I feel like
I'm in this really seedy bar like a cage
fight match
and I'm walking between the fans and
stuff and I just have this like really
like immersive experience anyway so this
is the last example these betwenn tee
examples of different kinds of uses of
parallax you can find a list of all
these examples in the d'Ovidio
description below and i'm going to take
one or two of these examples for the
video next week I'm going to build them
out in front of you and help you
understand how they achieve these
effects and so that you can do this kind
of stuff with your own work but at the
same time if you really liked one of
these effects more than anything else
and you really want it and you comment
fast because I'm working on this as you
are viewing this leave a comment and you
know if it's like an overwhelming
request for any particular one of these
examples I'll try to make a video about
it okay but I have in mind one or two
already that I want to make for next
week I just kind of make them I haven't
done it yet
but if you guys can intercept my work
and say we actually want you to work on
this one Travis I'll try to accommodate
okay so leave your comments in the in
the doodle below and also be sure to
check out all these links and then and
then here is the outro I'm not fun thank
you so much for watching in the next
video we're going to look at how we can
build a few of these experiences in the
meantime the question of the week is
what is the most impressive parallax
website you've ever seen I can't wait to
see what you all dig up but until then
