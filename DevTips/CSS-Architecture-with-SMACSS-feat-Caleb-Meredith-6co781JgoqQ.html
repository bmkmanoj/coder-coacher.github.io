had a really awesome live episode of dev
tips where we all have kind of tuned in
and had fun and chatted to hung out we
were celebrating the milestone of dev
tips reaching 20,000 subscribers before
that show started I sent out a tweet and
asked if anybody wanted to come on to
the show and do some code examples or
something fun or you know whatever one
of the replies to that tweet was from
dev tipper Caleb Meredith who proposed a
really awesome idea unfortunately as the
time came closer our schedules couldn't
match up with a live show and he wasn't
able to do it but we kept talking and he
eventually made an entire video just for
you guys on his own and it's a good one
it really is it changed the way I look
at a lot of things I'm currently doing
and I think that's true of every time
you guys come in and teach me something
new whether that's making an entire
video by yourself or you know doing a
pull request on github or just drop in
knowledge in the comments down below and
so that's what we're gonna do today I'm
just going to pass it over to Caleb but
before we do you might remember in last
week's episode I teased a big dev tips
announcement stick around and at the end
of this show I'll have more information
for you on that topic but right now
let's say hello to Caleb and drink
deeply from the well of his knowledge ah
hi guys my name is Caleb Meredith and
Travis has invited me to make a video on
the channel about something which really
has a lot to do with the meta
conversation and discussion on the dev
tips channel about CSS preprocessors
frameworks so today I want to talk to
you about the CSS architecture so first
let's start with the problem and the
problem is this difficult to read CSS
when we're working in big projects or
with groups with CSS we are often we
often find our code being messy
difficult to read hard to extend and in
the future after we've given in a couple
months hard to come back and look at it
again and be able to get in the same
minds that we were when we wrote it so
what is what a lot of people have done
is they've created these
GSS architectures to help style their
code and style to code for their groups
so that the CSS becomes more readable
Smacks smacss scalable modular
architecture for CSS aims to do just
that it's a CSS architecture that I have
adopted
now while the CSS architecture Snax is a
bit different from a framework like
bootstrap a foundation as it's not
anything that you download and install
and write functions from and all that
great stuff instead it's a set of rules
it's a mindset it's more abstract so
let's learn more about Smacks how to use
it how to make our code better cleaner
easier to read and modular and scalable
as I said it's named so let's get right
to the example every project needs some
form of organization and just throwing
styles into whatever sass file you want
is an organization what smacks tries to
advocate is a set of standards a set of
rules for creating a good organization
for your structure so that not only you
can figure out what you're doing in the
future but also other team members and
other people who will have to look and
change your source in the future it's
almost the same as we write
documentation in our code because we
want future generations to be able to
figure out what we're doing we organized
our CSS or more accurately our sass so
that people will be able to find Styles
more easily and be able to make changes
to them that reflect what you initially
had in mind so as you can see here I've
just created a couple of base files I'm
using Coquette to compile my Jade and my
sass so it has its configuration here at
my index Jade we're also gonna be
looking at the wireframe Travis uses for
his grid series and just look at smacks
in relation to this when we start going
in-depth alright so in here I set up a
couple of blank
sass files here on my index I am
importing all of the files I will use
I'm okay so
Smacks composes
of five categories the base layout
modules state and the fifth category is
themed but as most websites don't have
themes it's not that important to add
but basically all of the style is he
throwing theme are the styles that are
going to be changed depending on the
theme you're loading so I'm not gonna go
over them in this video they're not too
important anyway and then for me when I
use Mac's with sass I add the utils and
the VARs file now you have to remember
that Smacks was not originally created
with sass and other processors in mind
so I've adopted a couple or I've changed
a couple of the rules of smacks and
added to it in order to better fit the
sass preprocessor environment so as you
can see here my utilities file is just a
couple of utilities golden ratio screen
sizes stuff like that that I use on
every project and my bars is empty but
it's where I would put variables for for
all my project alright so let's get
started writing code as you can see
here's what the indexed IJ looks like
and here's what it renders to so we're
gonna start with our base styles the
base styles define what an element
should look like anywhere on the page
they are the defaults so if you're using
a reset the values that the reset
changes your styles that's the defaults
for your project so base rules are gonna
include things like your default
typography font family sans-serif maybe
you like to change all your boxes box
sizing water bike so maybe you like to
do that to all your by at all your on
the elements on the page I know I do or
maybe you want to make all your links
had the default be read and hover be
blue I don't know whatever you want to
put in the base but all the all the
styles in your base should be the
default styles for the entire page so as
I mentioned before all of your reset
files are
really a part of the base base style so
I like to use normalize dot CSS I'd
probably put up here at import normalize
so that's what I would do you can do
whatever you want so all your default
styles for how anything should look
anyone the page goes in the base and you
should not have any classes or ID
selectors in your base files no any if
you're going to need to put a class in
here you need to have a really good
reason and as I go over the other
categories that smacks provides you'll
realize that when you need to use a
class you should be able to put it in
one of the other categories you should
not need to put it into your base style
next up on the next category is layout
so the layout styles are will divide the
page into sections into major sections
not like minor sections like the
navigation or maybe the sidebar for
example but the major major sections and
layouts will hold multiple modules
together so let's for a moment talk
about what a module and what one of
these large layout elements I'm talking
about is so I would consider a module on
this page to be perhaps the navigation I
would consider that as a module or more
specifically I would consider this to be
a module this little card with the title
and like a little label some metadata I
would consider this to be a module I
would also consider this right here to
be a module using or the same module as
this just with different content I'd
also consider this to be the same module
and all of these I'd maybe consider this
to be a subclass or an extension of this
module but we'll get into that later I
consider these little external links to
be their own module I'd also consider
the search box to be its own module I
might also consider this entire little
box right here to be its own modules so
anything on your page which are
useable and modular parts in your design
they will be a module and they'll be
styled as such your major elements that
you're gonna group together in your
layout is gonna be your header or your
main content or your footer so these are
like the main sections that stick out to
me footer main content and header and so
we should indicate these with IDs now
this should be only the one of two times
you are going to be using ID selectors
on your page because there's only one
section you're gonna use the idea of
course the other instance you're gonna
use let me also just move the hello
world in here the other instance you're
gonna use IDs is if you want to give
this header say an ID so when you type
it in the URL it jumps down to that
that's the other situation where you
might want to use the ID otherwise your
ID should be strictly restrained to your
major elements of the page which is
typically the header main and footer you
can also maybe say your sidebar is a is
a major element or maybe in your
navigation menu is a major element or
you could say it's a module whatever
your preference is and whatever the
requirement of your project is and when
I talk about more about modules you
should be able to better decide how you
want to define these as large as major
layout elements or as a module so we
defined the styles there but so not only
do we define the major element styles in
our layout dot sass we also define
specific modular classes that we will
append to our modules and other elements
throughout our page so for example
bootstrap has this pull right class
right where it says pull right float
right and pull left float left so that's
the type of utility class we will be
creating and adding into our layout file
as the second type
of things we'll put in here now before I
go on I want to talk a moment about
naming conventions in Smacks so if
you've ever heard of the concept of name
spacing it's basically adding the name
to the beginning of another element to
help distinguish it from anything else
so I don't know if you've ever run into
the problem where maybe you're writing
CSS and you have label of blah blah blah
put in whatever styles but then you come
to another element later on and you also
want it to be a label so instances where
you feel like two different things
really have the same name
well name spacing it you can say element
a label or maybe header label and then
maybe flitter labels so ultimately they
are that they're called the same thing
but they have a different name space a
different prefix so I use this in all my
variables too so maybe I want to have a
different color for my heads so I might
say see for color head or see link
whatever and I also prefix my Mickey my
mix-ins so I typically like to have a
mixin for tight so I would type tea head
as in my typography for my header so I
prefix everything you do in sass and
it'll just kind of help you organize
better so for the layout which brings us
back to this for all of these modular
classes we're going to use to lay things
out and if we want to move stuff around
pull it left or pull it right we're
going to prefix it with L so I typically
I typically don't put the pole that's
your choice I typically just do L right
for that and L left for float:left maybe
you even want to do dot layout on line
Center yeah
and then you can do text-align:center
so these layouts are meant to be just
appended wherever on to your thing so
maybe maybe not to your major layout
elements like these but to your modules
and other elements within your page you
can now use these layout classes to just
quickly float anything left or anything
right and define the layout so to recap
in the layout dot sass we're going to
have our major layout elements like the
header or main content or footer and
we're also going to have our modular
layout classes which we are going to
append two modules and whatnot all right
so next up on our list we have modules
modules are the reusable little bits of
snacks that you can throw around
everywhere so if we go back to here and
when I was talking about layouts I
mentioned I would consider this a module
I considered this the same module this
module this module they considered this
may be a module I'd consider probably
this whole column of module modules are
reusable bits of code and they should be
kept that way now I'm not sure if you
notice but I also created this modules
folder because as you can imagine we're
gonna have a lot of modules modules are
the most important part of smacks and
I'm gonna have a lot of them so I'm
gonna want to make my own file for them
so I would consider this maybe a card
module so let's just quickly write up
some of the markup for these modules so
if I were marking up the car or this
card here I do say card so this would be
my namespace this will be my namespace
as I mentioned earlier my prefix it'll
be a card module and then I'm going to
call card label Oh tell you why I do the
two dashes and
that does it say all mm card Mehta 2 2 2
h 2 dot card head epsom what else do we
have we have a paragraph I'll call that
card copy and I'm just gonna throw in
some wrong command just throw in a bit
of lawn ups in there and I know I'll
have you a lot card tags list item card
tags yeah tag and here and what I'm
gonna do is for the tags I am going to
define a second module that's inside of
the mate the larger card module zone tag
tag Epsom my tags tag lorem all right
and just for another example I'm just
gonna quickly make a module for the
navigation just as another example so I
do ul nav again being the name or in the
name space that we're gonna use Li
products and then Li dot and I have
search and we're just gonna put in input
type equals search okay so next thing
I'm going to do is I want to create what
I have three modules right and mine AVMA
module add my card module and have my
tag module so let's create three files
this one will be card dot SAS throw into
my modules here this one will be
yeah I've got sass right there and this
one will be tags sass and then in my
module sass file I'm just gonna import
them so I'm not cluttering up my modules
file too much instead I'm breaking them
all into different files and these
module files you will end up having a
lot of them and they will get pretty
long so thank you sass for allowing me
to important didn't misspell something I
did so thank you sass for allowing me to
import these files and these variables
and all of that stuff okay so I have
just have some pre-written style so I'm
just gonna quickly copy and paste tags
and I'll explain it a bit alright so
there we go and I'm just gonna make one
more change before I go over them in my
base styles I typically like to have my
unordered lists be opted in for the list
styling if that makes sense so instead
of opting out in every single module
I'll instead decide if I have an
unordered list all I decide to opt in or
not so I'm just automatically saying the
default is no list styling no margin no
padding just as it is alright so let's
go over these modules first we'll look
at card all right so I set the max width
400 give it a bit of margin and now
probably the first thing you'll notice
as a little weird or different or
something you haven't seen before is
this I do and dash dash label so why
would I do that instead of just card
label well let's see how this compiles
say that let it refresh and we'll go
down to index SCSS where are we
all right so you'll see something a bit
different when I write between when I
write it like this and when I write it
like this
when I write it like this you'll see
that SAS and automatically nests these
two in it so it's card and then it's dot
card label whereas here it just takes it
just does card meta now doing this is a
much better practice and this is
something not many or this is a kind of
a more abstract topic that not many
people get but CSS specificity which is
when here let me put this back and just
look back in this file again CSS
specificity so when you nest two things
when you say card and then inside of the
card label that's actually not a good
practice because what this does is it
increases the specificity for these card
label Styles now you might not
understand specificity it's kind of
difficult to explain so I'm gonna say if
you want to learn more about specificity
and why it's bad there's a great article
on CSS tricks otherwise just take my
word for it and no that's bad basically
what happens is the deeper you are and
nesting the harder it is for the rest of
the CSS to override those styles and if
you've ever been in a battle where you
have to put exclamation mark import and
then look at the old style and change it
that's because of specificity so
wouldn't we do it like this trust me
it'll save you a lot of headache in the
future and a lot less exclamation mark
imports by simply doing it that way so
this is a little trick that has been
hiding in sass right under your noses
likely for the whole time you've been
using it all that it does is it says the
ampersand means for all the selectors
above me add this to it and then output
it so and dash dash labels so as you can
see dot card
we took card and we prefixed it so we
got card - - label
I said it's probably been hiding on your
nose because here look at my base styles
when I declare a color red and hover
let's go up to the style here all it's
doing is again taking the a and then
adding hover to it so I can put whatever
I want here whatever it doesn't matter
it'll prefix it or it'll post fix a fix
it only this is the correct word
whatever I put there so the most common
usage is with pseudo-classes but you can
do it with whatever n so this is just a
nice little shortcut and it lets us keep
the awesome nesting feature of sass and
it avoids us having to write things like
this which we would have to do normally
so sass assess is pretty cool bloodiness
do that we love indentation so alright
so now why do I do this - - here like
does that it probably doesn't make sense
to you why don't I just use a single -
well okay so again card is our namespace
here and then label is the name of the
element so card namespace meta is the
name of our element etc etc well what if
I want the namespace to be slightly
different what if I have another
variation at this this layout actually
provides a great example of this this
module right here is pretty much the
same as each and every other module
except for it has a slightly different
background
so maybe what if I wanted to write card
fade what if I just wanted to write that
and then I wanted all of these other
things to be inherited well it would be
a little difficult if I did this as a
single and then oh and then what I can
do this is then I could just write card
fade - - label although I don't
recommend that I just recommend using
the default styles for card but what if
I had something like this and then I was
only using a single - so if I were only
using a single - here and
doing this it's where does the name
space end in this case card fade and
where does the new element begin
so to help distinguish I use the two
dashes sometimes you'll see two
underscores I like two dashes you can
whatever style you like you can use but
that's what I'd like to do so again to
recap this is going to be our name or
this together is our namespace this is
the main name this is maybe a different
types of one two three whatever red blue
pink whatever and then so you separate
those two by a dash and then you
separate the elements a label met ahead
copy or whatever by two dashes alright
so those are our modules so here's just
a code for nav and here is the code for
tax now our last and final section is
state or last and final category that is
what state defines it's a way to
describe how our modules look Lin in a
state so this is really for the
interactivity and is it hidden is it
expanded if you have maybe a jQuery
accordion it can you see the content can
you not see the content so the state
helps us helps us better define what it
looked what an element looks like when
it's in the state at a specific time so
and like we prefix layout with L dash
whatever a color with C - whatever we
proof we prefix our states with is so
for a nav we might commonly see this as
is selected so as you can see I wrote a
bit of sass here which says when it is
an A vitamin again remember what this
and is doing is just pulling the nav
down and here another ampersand and
where it's taking this item pulling down
nav and then adding is selected so when
we have a nav
item and it is selected so we can see
how that renders right here nav item and
dot is selected we can color it blue
it's an arbitrary color that I picked
off the time I had when I was styling it
obviously not the most aesthetically
pleasing I hope you don't use that for
your real website but yeah but that's
how you do a state all right and so one
last comment about modulus that I'd like
to make is as you can see with this
navsearch' what if I had in my items
that I wanted it to have border:solid
1px black a concept of many programming
languages is extending so you see how I
had these Nevada Nevada nav items I
would consider that my most general in
here you know remove that blue doesn't
look very good
holy yelling doesn't look good anyway
but it's for demonstration purposes
this is navsearch' I would consider a
nav item but I don't want to but writing
nav item and also nav search kind of
makes my markup very messy so what SAS
allows us to do is really cool it just
allows us to go and - - search that
extend dot nav item so it just kind of
allows us to easily extend that and as
you can see it gets its border if we
aren't extending if we aren't extending
it it's not going to have a board or
yeah and you'll notice that
you'll notice that I can't use the
ampersand here no I can I have to write
it out here but I'll alas that's for one
place you can't use it all right so just
a couple of closing thoughts if you want
to learn more I don't like that Bordeaux
changes continue now if you want to
learn more about snacks then just go to
this website and this max isn't
originally my idea and if you want to
learn more just go here you can read all
about it and but remember it's not
originally created for SAS so I just
gave you an example of how I use it of
how some of my ideas and how to
implement it with SAS and other
pre-processing languages so thank you so
much for your time and have a good day
wasn't that awesome
I know that I'm gonna take a serious
look at my styling habits and insert
some smacks up in there
so last week I teased about a big
announcement coming up it's exciting the
announcement is that I'm in the process
of organizing an exclusive community for
dev tips and it's happening very soon
I've set up a forum that you can use to
be notified when it launches you can't
click on this thing but in the
description below is a link to that form
the first 100 people who sign up will
receive a dev tip sticker and a personal
note from me in the mail be sure to
click that link in the description I'm
really really excited about all this and
also next week's release is going to be
accompanied by a live dev tip stream the
first 10 people who join will join me
and will watch next week's video
together and you know we can hang out
afterwards talk about questions and
shoot the breeze whatever I'm exploring
different options for the community
bonuses and this might be you know like
a fun thing to do anyway until I see you
again keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
