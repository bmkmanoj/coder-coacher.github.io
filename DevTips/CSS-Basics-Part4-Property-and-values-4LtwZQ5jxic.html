Rascals that's not very good now last
week we talked about CSS selectors those
little guys that select the different
HTML nodes that we want a style and next
week we'll jump into more advanced
methods of selecting different nodes but
today I want to talk about the CSS style
declarations themselves now a style
declaration is made up of two parts a
property and a value the syntax works
like this the name of the property the
colon the value and a semicolon at the
end you can stack up these declarations
to get more advanced complicated styles
and when you're done you wrap all those
Styles in a pair of curly brackets pop a
selector from last week before that
first curly bracket and you got yourself
a style
there are literally hundreds of CSS
properties I counted 369 so there's no
way that I'm going to list them all here
now wouldn't work anyway because not
only do you need to know what they are
you need to know what they do and how
they work together so I'm not going to
do that but what I will do is tell you
how I learn them all pretty quickly and
easily all the while being able to make
fully functional websites the first
thing you need to do is find the right
tools we need to find a code editor that
has the proper training wheels built in
I like to use a code that are called
espresso it happens to have these tools
that you can pop out right here on the
right and with a few clicks using this
graphical user interface you can start
writing real CSS today
another thing that exists in our world
is something called code completion this
can be a very big help but most modern
code editors have it all you have to do
is start typing and then the code editor
is like hey did you mean this and then
it starts suggesting things that you're
looking for
okay these are two ways to learn what's
possible with CSS when you're ready to
get on that and the only way to really
familiarize yourself with these
properties and values is to just use
them and to use them a lot build a lot
of things and read other people's code
and see what they're building and how
they're doing it the only way you're
going to learn all this stuff is just to
use it I'm also including a link down
below all of the CSS properties
available so chew on that alrighty next
week we're going to jump back into
advanced selectors I know you're excited
about it I can see it on your face right
there
thanks for watching guys and thanks for
subscribing I don't know if you noticed
but over this weekend we hit 100
subscribers and over two thousand video
views not just over the weekend but you
know total and it's such a cool thing
for me and I've never done this before
and I don't know what I'm doing and it's
so awesome to have you guys just
watching it hope you like it let me know
write me an email subscribe share it
with your friends write a question in
the comments I love it so much thanks

week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
