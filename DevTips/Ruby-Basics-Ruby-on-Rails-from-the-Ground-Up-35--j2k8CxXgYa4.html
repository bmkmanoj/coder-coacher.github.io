McKenzie child and this is episode 3 out
of 5 in the Ruby on Rails from the
ground up series ah last week we went
through and set up our development
environments with everything you need to
get going with Ruby on Rails if you have
not watched that video yet and don't
have your dev environment setup please
pause this go check that out and then
come back in this episode we are going
to go through the basics of the Ruby
programming language although you don't
absolutely need to learn Ruby before you
learn rails knowing at least the basic
syntax will definitely help us along
when we start coding our rails
application so without further ado let's
just jump in guys so the best way to
play around with Ruby is by using the
IRB or interactive Ruby interpreter you
can use the IRB to quickly test out your
ideas as well as learn Ruby to get
started open up a terminal window you
can find the terminal in your
applications menu or the command prompt
on Windows and type IRB and press Enter
so IRB is a read eval print loop or
repple basically a reacher inputs
evaluates it and then shows the result
so let's give it a little try let's type
a little greeting surrounded by
quotation marks try typing good morning
beautiful exclamation point and then hit
enter and it prints out good morning
beautiful so what exactly just happened
well IRB evaluated the expression we
wrote and outputted the results in this
case it outputted the string itself so
what if we wanted to print the results
to the screen well we could say puts
good morning beautiful
puts is a command to print something out
in Ruby so what does the arrow nil part
mean well that's the result of the
expression in Ruby a method always
returns something puts always returns
nil which in Ruby and other languages
means zilch zero or nothing just a quick
note you can get out of I or B by
pressing ctrl + D and it will exit you
out if you need to get out of a current
operation for example if I type good
morning and then hit enter
IRB is going to be confused so what we
can do is take control C to escape out
of that current command and retype it
also if you hit command + K you can
clear your current screen so in Ruby
your data comes in various types we have
numbers strings boolean's arrays symbols
and hashes so briefly I want to talk
about each one
first off numbers Ruby can do math
operations such as addition subtraction
multiplication but it can also do
evaluations such as even or odd values
for example let's give it a try let's
try 5 plus 5
it returns 10 5 minus 2 3 10 times 8 we
get 80 and in Ruby for the division we
do eight forward slash two as division
so 8 divided by 2 would be 4 and then we
can even check like I mentioned before
if a value is odd or even so if I did
eight daaad question mark it would
return false because 8 is a even number
strings are words or phrases surrounded
by single or double quotes for example
we can do opening quotes and say I am a
stream we can also combine strings
together by simply adding them so if I
did what's and then + up
it combines those two together to form
what's up
as you can see Ruby does not put in a
space by default so what we need to do
is go in there and add a space to the
second string and then hit enter again
and then it adds ohms together as a
single line you can also multiply
strings if you want for example so if I
did opening quotes ho space cut closing
quotes times 3 it would do ho-ho a
boolean is an expression that evaluates
to either true or false
most of the time you'll use a boolean
operator either a logical operator or
comparison operator to compare boolean
values in Ruby can do and or and not to
compare values between each other which
will result in either a true or false
value and is represented by two
ampersands or is represented by two pipe
characters and naught is represented by
an exclamation point so for example true
and true returns true true and false
returns false if I did true or true it
returns true true or false would return
true as well
if I did not true whoops if I did not
true that returns false and if I did not
false that returns true so comparison
operators are used to test the
relationship between objects the
available operators you can use are
equals which is represented by two equal
signs put together not equals which is
represented by a exclamation point N
equals a less than or equal to which is
the less than symbol and the equal sign
you could also use greater than or equal
to which is the greater than symbol and
equals and also less than or greater
than so if I try to
compared to values by D 1 equals 1
that's true if I do 5 is not equal to 5
that's obviously false is a 3 less than
or greater than 4 that is true if I do 3
is greater than or equal to 4 that's
false one is it greater than or is it
less than 3 that's true is one greater
than 3 that is false so in Ruby an array
is basically a list of objects that can
be any type of object including other
arrays you can create an array by
surrounding a list of objects with
square brackets for example we could say
my array which is a variable which we'll
get to shortly equals 1 and I'll say 2
which is a string 3 and I'll just say 4
which is another string so we can mix
and match integers and strings because
we can use that whatever type of object
we want so if we hit that that is our
array one thing to note is that arrays
are indexed from 0 for example so if I
did my array and I try to pull out the
second value you think it would be this
too but instead it's actually the 3
because it starts from 0 so this would
be 0 2 would be 1 3 would be 2
we can also add data to an array either
by adding a new array or using the
lesson less than operator for example if
we pull up the my array + and we make a
new array let's say 5 6 &amp;amp; 7 you can see
a new array is created with that is the
combination of the old array and the new
array we can append data to our current
array so if we did my array less and
less than 8 for example
it will say one two three four eight one
thing to note is this if we use the
addition add two arrays together it will
create a new array but if we append a
new item to the array it will modify the
existing ring for example if I say my
array you can see this is that now saved
but whereas when we added it that was
not saved symbols are similar to strings
as they're made up of characters but
instead of being wrapped in quotation
marks that are usually prefixed by : one
of the main uses for symbols are hash
keys we'll get into hashes in a second
but unlike strings symbols are unique
which makes them more memory efficient
you can see this for yourself by
creating a string and a symbol and
calling the object ID method on them
both for example if we do Ruby object
underscore ID we get this big long
number and if we do a symbol with Ruby
object ID we get a much smaller number
which makes it more memory efficient
hashes are a collection or a set of key
value pairs it's similar to an array
except that the indexing the hash key
can be any data type not just integer
index when you need to access a value
inside of a hash you'll just need to
pass the corresponding key through the
square brackets for example if I do a
variable called Who am I and assign that
to a hash opening curly and I'll say a
symbol first underscore name and I'll
assign that to my name
Mackenzie whoops be sure to close that
and I'll do another symbol of last name
and assign that to child and be sure to
add the closing curly bracket hit enter
now if we want to find a value of the
existing
II we can simply do Who am I and then
bracket and I'll say first name and that
returns the value as you've seen a few
times already variables are simply a
value assigned to a name a variable can
contain nearly all types of values
including numbers strings arrays or a
hash a variable is assigned using the
equal operator not to be confused with
the equal equals which is used for
testing equality one thing to know a
variable name can include a letter
number or underscore but it must begin
with either a letter or an underscore
when using a multiple word variable name
it's best practice to use an underscore
in between them for example I'll say my
underscore name that's a valid variable
name so again a variable if I just say
my name equals and then assign it to a
string with my name a method is simply a
block of reusable code creating a method
is simple they start with a def followed
by the name of the method and then they
go on until they reach an end and
everything in between
the Deaf and the end is what gets gets
run for example if I say def good
morning and they'll say puts a string of
good morning beautiful and then I'll do
an end so now if I try and run the good
morning method it will say good morning
beautiful ruby has a few conditional
operators that you can use to control
the flow of your program they include if
unless else if and else let's briefly
talk about each one the if statement
takes a boolean expression and only
executes the code if the expression
evaluates to true for example we can
assign a variable of age and say age is
72 so I can say if age is greater than
65 puts you're a senior
citizen and then in that block and you
can see it outputted who are a senior
citizen because age was indeed greater
than 65 unless is the opposite of an if
statement where it takes a boolean
expression and only executes the code if
the expression evaluates to false for
example if we do age equals 22 I can say
unless age is greater than 65 I'll say
put puts you were a young in and and
that and since the age wasn't greater
than 65 the puts value did indeed get
run if we do the same thing change the
variable name to 100 or age of 100 and
then we do unless age greater than 65
puts you're a young in and that and will
return nil because it did not get run an
else if statement is used to manage the
flow of a program it has to be used
within and if or unless block and take a
boolean expression it only runs the code
if the previous statement statements do
not run and its expression evaluates to
true for example if we do age equals 22
we can say if age is less than 2 puts
you're still a baby and then we'll do an
if age or else if age is less than 13
we'll puts you were a child else if age
is less than 19 I'll say puts you're a
teenager and then we'll say else puts
you're an adult and then we'll end that
block and because age is equal to 22 it
none of the other values evaluated to
true so it did the else statement and
said you're an adult an else block is
very similar to the else if in that it
has to be used within an if or unless
block and it only gets run if the other
statements do not get run but the
difference between an else and an else
if is the else does not take any
arguments for example if we do age
equals 22 again they say if age is
greater than 50 I'll say it puts you're
getting old and then we'll say else puts
you're still young and because we're
only 22 at the age is only 22 the if
statement does not get a run so the else
statement gets run instead so when
you're working with a collection of
objects for example an array or in a
hash sometimes you want to perform an
operation on each item within that
collection for that Ruby provides a
method called each and each method can
accept one or more parameters which are
listed inside of the pipe characters for
example let's say we have a array with
the values of 1 2 3 4 5 assigned to a
variable called list so I'll say list
equals 1 2 3 4 5 if we wanted to take
each value multiply the value times 8
and output the results we would do list
each do number and the number wrapped in
the pipes is the argument
and I'll say puts number times 8 so
we're multiplying the argument times 8
and then end and you can see outputs 8
16 24 32 and 40 which is each original
number endless variable of that array
multiplied times 8 we could also write
the same thing by doing list each
opening brackets or curly brackets say
number and I'll say it puts number times
8 and then closing curly brackets all
