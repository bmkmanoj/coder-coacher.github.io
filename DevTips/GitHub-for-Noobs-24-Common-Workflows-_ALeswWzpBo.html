you that makes me the perfect candidate
to host this series called github for
noobs I have to get open noobs last week
we talked about the history of git and
github
spoiler alert there are different things
this week we're going to look at how git
is used a few common functions and
answer the question what role does the
company github play in this workflow ah
let's look at a run-of-the-mill project
that uses git here's a project folder
this is what we refer to as a repository
or a repo if you're trying to sound like
one of them cool kids now imagine that
we've been working on this project for a
while we're done working on a new
feature and we're ready to save but this
is not the same as just saving the file
in being done this save that we want to
do is more like taking a snapshot of the
entire project as it is at this time
this snapshot is called a commit commits
are cool because not only can you write
a comment on it and share that snapshot
with your friends and collaborators but
you can return to that snapshot at any
time commits I really would give get
most of its power now imagine that we're
skipping along our happy little self
down this development path all the live
long day and we're making these commits
the whole time but suddenly we get this
crazy idea what if I don't know we want
to develop a feature that makes it easy
for dogs to log in it could be anything
we can create something called a branch
a branch is essentially a new
development path that we can follow as
long as we like without ever really
messing up with our original plans if we
decide against our dog idea no biggie
we can just switch back to the master
branch and carry on as if nothing had
ever happened so far we've learned about
repositories commits branches and master
branches it's not that scary
this is Lou
all right all right let's go let's keep
on going all right let's say you have
your own repo and you're making commits
and your buddy says to you hey dude you
made a few typos in your code but don't
worry
I'll fix it your buddy can now make his
own branch and then fix the errors
himself after he's all done he can ask
you to pull in his changes by using
something called a pull request a pull
request is a report of all the changes
made and if you like them all you can
accept the request and pull in his
changes now that branch is merged into
the master branch using this workflow
has a lot of advantages it allows you to
explore new ideas in a non-destructive
way and invite new collaborators to
contribute code it provides a working
history of all of your code and these
are all fantastic things but if all of
this is git where does get hub come into
the mix well calm down new because I'm
getting to that
github is built to be the perfect place
to host the repository when we put our
repo on github we then have a
centralized place to distribute the code
from a github workflow might look like
this I have my repo on github I pull the
latest version to my local machine and
make a few edits I commit my edits and
then I push from my local machine to the
repo hosted on github now that my
updated code is on github it is easier
to invite friends to share the code or
distribute something that I made to the
world now pretend that I made a little
plug-in or library or framework or
whatever and you come across it you like
it but you need it to be a little
different for your purpose github allows
you to fork my repository and make the
changes you desire a fork is different
than a branch in that a branch is still
a version of the code contained inside
my repo a fork creates an entirely new
repo for you to manage on your own the
fork is now a part of your github
account now there may come a time when
you think that I might appreciate your
changes and you request that I pull in
new commits from your fork
that can work too this is how large
open-source projects are done some repos
have thousands of people forking the
code and trying to improve it and this
is the magic of github scale github also
offers other nice features like a
graphical user interface project wiki's
bug trackers being able to make comments
on pull requests or even a single line
of code
github even offers a free simple static
web page hosting solution fantastic
there is a ton that I've left out of
this video but it should be enough to
paint in your mind a pretty clear
picture of what is git and github and
why they are so important to modern web
development this video is created using
a camera a microphone and a copy of
Apple Keynote and it's supported by the
patrons of the channel these wonderful
ladies and gents pledged a dollar amount
of their choosing for every video that I
create in turn there's a few perks they
get to watch the videos early they get
to see a few extra videos and they have
access to dev tips chat where they meet
each other and make friends work
together and help each other solve
problems it's really awesome to see find
out more at patreon.com slash dev tips
and there's a link in the description
below next week we're going to be
looking at how to get started on your
own applications using the free
application created by github and until
I see you then my friends keep on
hacking keep on acting is used this week
we can look at how git is used actually
just some paper in hand who's calling me
father-in-law just keep on hacking I'm
not even joking you
step on that you can't see it you can't
see it forget it
just trust me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
