better learn to code this is the title
of an article I read this morning on
wired comm is written by Liz Stinton I
kind of want to just pull out a few
highlights from this article and have a
discussion with you guys John Maeda
gives this design and Technology report
every year at South by Southwest and
that's kind of what this article is
about and if you're unfamiliar with John
Maeda he's kind of a big deal in design
in fact the article that I read this
morning on wire describes him as being
to design what Warren Buffett is to
finance meaning that he's a seasoned
technologist who spend more than a
decade at the MIT Media Lab before
becoming the president of the Rhode
Island School of Design he's also a
partner at the VC powerhouse kleiner
perkins and now he's the head of
computational design and inclusion at
automatic this is wordpress.com parent
company so there's a lot of a story to
be behind the presentation that is given
and I'm going to walk through not the
presentation but this article that I
read so I've made a few slides in the
first one I have here is that the role
of design is changing it's no longer
enough to iterate and understand your
user what companies need now our
designers who can empathize and bang out
lines of JavaScript I thought that was
quite poignant right because you know I
ran a YouTube channel for several years
called depth tips and the long name of
it is dev tips for designers the initial
aim of it was to find designers who want
to become more adept in development as a
skill and so a line like that you
knowing in wired.com that says companies
are looking to hire designers who can
bang out lines of JavaScript it's
extremely validating to a YouTube
channel like depth tip inserting the
article the author pulls out this kind
of key phrase that may use is called a
computational designer and a pull quote
from the article is that in report made
it makes the distinction between a
classic designer the makers of finite
objects for a select group of people so
think
graphic designer industrial designer
furniture designer and computational
designers like computational in air
quotes computational designers who deal
mostly in code and build constantly
involving projects that will impact
millions of people's lives so when I see
this comparison of like the classic
designer and the computational designer
I really am kind of split on on this
definition and it seems to be because
the emphasis is trying to be placed on
scale like industrial designers designs
don't impact millions of people I mean
tell that to Johnny Ivor or like the
designers of you know freeways or
buildings or things like this or or or
furniture fashion designers like they
don't touch millions of people's lives I
don't understand that but as a general
theme I think that designers should have
a very flexible skill set and even if
not just a skill set but a flexible
interest right because we need to be
open to being informed by other
disciplines and that's really really
important to become a well-rounded
designer and being able to code I feel
like I kind of lucked out because I I
decided that I wanted to make that one
of my design tools early on and I've
kind of just evolved with it and have
learned CSS and JavaScript but I've
always kind of used them as a design
tool the code has never been you know my
goal my goal has always been to make
living breathing useable things and
products and experiences so in that way
I look at the you know the coding part
of of what I do as a design skill I
don't think of it as like a something
foreign you know like they're in two
separate verticals design here in code
here I don't look at it I think I think
code is a design tool and to say that
that designers need to do any one thing
is is limiting actually to what a
designer is in fact a designer's
most traditional and most
rewarding skill is the idea that we can
collaborate with other types of creators
in fact that's what makes us so great
that a designer we need other people
well I don't know if we should be
required to do all these things with
involving other people in the
collaborative process actually creates
the better experience and a better
result in the end so here's another
quote and again it's talking about these
computational designers their hybrid
status is increasingly attractive to
technology companies that are looking
for employees who can both identify
problems and build solutions when you
can do both you can do things that no
one else can do says John Maeda
technology companies that innovate tend
to have these unique people so my
response to that is like sure like the
more Skills you are the more you can do
like I totally get that but also in
making the claim that like these are the
kinds of people who get jobs now and
people who can't design and code don't
get jobs I think that is totally
unfounded and actually incorrect and and
furthermore I think it really really
depends on the organization that is
looking to hire right so I spent years
in Silicon Valley doing startups and and
as a designer who can code I felt that
my skill set my broad skill set in that
way was was complimentary to the types
of companies that I worked with
early-stage companies and small team can
really use versatile creators as a
designer when you're submitting code
with like the people who are like
technically hired as engineers I think
that's a really good thing now that I
work at Google um I really don't code it
all anymore
and I don't feel limited by that you see
I don't feel like that is that I'm
losing out on anything I feel in fact
that I'm enhanced by my ability to focus
on what I'm what I do best
and collaborate with people that code
better than I ever could and so it
really really depends these statements
on like technology companies that
innovate
tend to have these unique people
speaking of computational designers I
kind of like I feel like the author of
this article is trying to make a
specific point in it know that persons
at liberty to make that point and I'm
not trying to denigrate small teams in
startups or extol larger companies I'm
just saying that the required skills to
thrive in each of these may be a little
different and that that makes sense
another slide saying that design is
still having this moment since 2004
corporations like Accenture Capital One
and Deloitte have scooped up more than
71 independent design consultancies with
50 of those multi-million dollar talent
grabs happening in the past two years
meanwhile business schools starting with
Yale School of Management have begun
adding design classes to their core
curriculum companies like McKinsey and
IBM have promoted designers to the top
level of management an acknowledgement
that design has in many ways already
proven itself ok again here a lot of
companies are doubling down on the ideas
of design but again I don't see that as
supporting the thesis that designers
need to code in fact here's a quote from
another article and you can see how it
takes those same points the same source
material and and comes away with an
entirely different conclusion the code
is being Facebook Google and Amazon have
hired 65% more designers in the past
year why is the demand happening now
because technology is so commoditized
anyone can make an app made a told us
now that you can do that how does it
make someone feel how relevant is it to
someone's life that is more of a design
question this kind of makes the exact
opposite point as the other quote right
it says that if if production is so
commoditized what then unique value do
you bring to this whole process and I
like this as it focuses more on the
question than the solution and maybe
it's a designer in me but I believe that
you can get further down the road with a
good question than a good answer
another quote is that designs role in
this world is con
only shifting in his 2017 report made it
makes the case that the most successful
designers will be those who can work
with intangible materials code words and
voice yes yes this is this is what I'm
talking about and you know the more and
more I reread these selections and kind
of like get into the headspace of where
I think maybe is kind of actually going
I realize how quick baby that title of
this article really is I don't believe
that Maeda is trying to answer the tired
old question of should designers learn
to code he's saying something bigger
like like designers who are successful
are going to be more flexible in the
future but I really did love this
sentiment that the author extracted from
the presentation at the end I love I
love this at the end here saying that as
the distinction between engineering
writing and design becomes blurrier
designs role in technology only stands
to become more ingrained in the product
development process in the end design as
a singular field could become less
visible but more relevant thanks for
watching my name is Travis Nelson
leaving your thoughts below on the the
changing nature of the relationship of
design and production and have a good
night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
