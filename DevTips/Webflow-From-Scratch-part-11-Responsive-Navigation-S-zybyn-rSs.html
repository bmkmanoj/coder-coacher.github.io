and this is dev tips we are about to
start a whole new series where we're
going to build a website from scratch
this is a particularly exciting time for
me because I'm trying out a new tool to
build this site I am teaming up with the
good people at webflow who are
sponsoring this series so everybody say
thank you flow because they're you know
making it as possible they're also
donating a free web flow Pro account for
each video that we make in this series
so stick around to the end of this video
and I'll tell you how you can get your
hands on the first one which is going to
be given away after this video
so speaking of this series let's get
into it what we're going to be building
is actually here's the project right
here you can see it on my screen blows
my podcast co-host design this Oh like
layout
quite a while ago one has been bugging
me to build it for for quite a while and
I just felt like this was the perfect
time to get it done so this design this
layout here has a lot of cool features
too a lot of nuances and we're going to
be building it using the web flow tool
so a few things about that arrangement I
have never used web flow before and this
is going to be a learning experience for
me and for you if you follow along
ideally like honestly if you go with me
through this series you'll walk out of
this being able to make almost anything
in web flow and that's that's a pretty
good promise to make for any like web
series on the youtube i think it's
pretty exciting
but um also like I don't plan on holding
any punches and and I were talking to
web flow team about this and and they're
on board they want the the one they want
a candid response to their tool that
they put so much effort into so I plan
on sharing the good the bad and the ugly
and all the frustrations but also
exciting things that I find inside the
tool I've already set up my account but
I've not started the project yet so
we're going to be starting from Ground
Zero alright let's get into it
okay let's first start by running
through the design and seeing what we're
going to build and keep in mind that I
didn't design this this is this is
Lowe's my companion my co-host of the
show this guy right here that's the one
and who built it or designed it and I'm
going to be using web flow to make it
built so let's take a look here we've
got this logo which sits nicely and it
like jets out down from the header which
is interesting I wonder how we'll do
that and then we've got this navigation
that corresponds to different sections
as we scroll down about episodes donate
swag Instagram and he's also got a cart
here so this is like most kind of design
this out of context he didn't he didn't
know that I'd be using web flow to build
it and if we don't necessarily have any
swag to sell right now so like as we as
you scroll down you'll see that there's
like this big you know squares because
this is what he intended but in truth
he'd we don't have anything ready and
also like this is basically lorem ipsum
he didn't like copyright anything um and
I'm not I'm not I'm not sweating lows
right now I'm just letting you know the
state of things so that we will run into
situations later on and also there's
like a newsletter here which we don't
have a newsletter right now so um and
also these guys are the episodes and we
need to find either a way to use RSS or
some type of I don't know what what flow
can do about that like pulling in
information into flow I know that it can
handle like its own manageable databases
and stuff but I don't know about pulling
in foreign foreign data we'll see about
that and then and then shirts stickers
pulling in Instagram okay it looks like
um it looks pretty straightforward
there's going to be some situations
right here this is where this is going
to be kind of like a blog so I wonder if
there's like a blog situation inside of
web flow where you know you can like
each post will have its own page and
there's going to be an archive of pages
to archive episodes you know but yeah
all in all it looks pretty good little
pretty straightforward we're going to
have some data entry kind of stuff right
here where I don't think that we can
pull from iTunes well hey there is like
a feed of this stuff so Louis and I
would be like manually and putting it
into the site but anyhow we'll get to
that when we get to that let's figure
out this first
we do I think probably what we'll do
today is like the header and the first
section and I think we can achieve that
in the next like 20 minutes or so then
we'll be good especially considering
I've never used web flow before so let's
get started I'm going to slide over to
my web flow account and this is the web
flow dashboard and this would be where
all of my projects are but I have not
created a project yet so I'm going to
start a new one and here okay so you can
start from a bunch of templates they
look quite nice oh and some of them are
purchasable okay so then they're not all
free Oh none of them are free oh they
have a free filter so here are the free
templates I'm going to do blank but I
just wanted to check out these templates
Oh quite nice oh they do do blocks okay
I wonder what what is the difference
between a free and a paid is it because
the paid ours are like a store and
they're paying people to make the
templates for them or just like webflow
thinks that these ones are better I
don't know okay so it could be the sites
could name could be a Travis's friendly
site but we're going to call it we're
going to call it late nights and I think
that's an internal name I'm not sure if
that's going to be like late nights web
flow calm or whatever but I have my own
URL so I'm not too worried about that
right now
creating the web site load madad --is
your browser has a non-standard zoom
setting yeah that's true that's true
because you know I'm doing a tutorial is
that going to be the whole time it's
gonna really bother me okay
well uh looks like we're right into it
which is just like a blank page right
here and here's the body element okay so
I I watched ran do a few things a little
while ago
when
I was watching him create stuff so I
know a little bit about it and there's
also I saw here we go site settings so
what I want to do first is get a good
font in there I don't want to use Arial
or Helvetica so in the settings i know
that i can change fonts because i did i
poked around a little bit although i
didn't build anything yet okay so font
and i'm just going to go to a font i
trust so you know i use this one all the
time because it's trustworthy and i'm
going to do bold and regular maybe
medium to just because and add it okay
it looks like we have that font
available to us now and you can upload
your own font or use Typekit gosh that's
great what else do we get here forums oh
cool oh cool so if you wanted we talked
about setting up like a an email list
this can send it right to my own gmail
account settings a website name yeah
there are light night's web okay let's
get into the design designer okay here
we are so first thing i want to do is go
to the body here which we're selective
that's the only thing to select and you
can either create a class or you can
just select the body tag which is going
to go to all pages whereas this body
would have like a class of home because
it's the home page I'm just going to go
to all pages on the body it looks like
your zoom level oh I have to have actual
zoom in order to do this sorry you guys
I did not know that would be a
limitation the controls go away if you
have a zoom and you have that annoying
kind of like thing at the bottom okay
anyway I'll not let that stop me I'm
gonna go down to hopefully it's in this
list because I did there it is real
photo okay so um I rebuttal on the
the body now let's go back over here to
check out the elements that we want to
build so this is going to be a header
section and I'm not going to mess with a
cart right now because I don't we don't
I mean what content thing to sell and
then here is a navigation element and
this logo I'm noticing this alignment
which is interesting and I don't have a
license for sketch right now so I just
exported this as a ping so it's very
it's a flat file that I'm going to have
to manipulate so this looks like the
column is 800 pixels looks like that's
800 pixels and then he's got this logo
flying out here which is not making a
lot of sense to me how can you do that
unless you're going to like
I wonder if this got bigger if the logo
would stay floating attached to the left
and this would stay centered on 800 I
don't know what his intent was so I'm
just gonna make it up let's see what we
can do okay let start with a header so
you go to this plus button here to add
elements and I think that a header I'm
noticing that it goes all the way across
with this little drop shadow thing is
like a container has a fixed width and
it's centered and it's certainly not a
column so I'm going to put a section in
here and I'm going to name the class of
this thing I'm gonna call it header and
now that it's a header it can have I'm
going to give it a background color not
blue how about like super gray isse evan
een ein mmp-9 and then I'm gonna also
give it a drop shadow a box shadow and I
wanted to have a blur of like let's say
15 the color can be black with an
opacity of 20 and let's click this
little eyeball here to get a preview oh
that's a horrible preview oh I know why
because there's nothing in it
so in the like
this Web flow design phase will have the
box have a height so I can manipulate it
but when I look at the view there's
actually no height on the element so it
just completely disappears so let's put
something in there I know that let's see
this is navigator oh cool
ah images okay to upload I have this
ping here which is a face okay and I'm
going to drag this face into the header
okay cool cool cool cool and it is a
high density whatever high dip kind of
thing
let's get a container and drag it in
here too and then drag this image into
the container okay so now it's centered
the container is I don't know how wide
how it are containers
I guess I couldn't measure it like this
is it 800 I want to be laughing at so if
it's 800 it's 940 and Louis designed at
800 right
okay so um what is that - 60 60 70 - 70
okay so if I do class container into a
padding of like 35 then there's a width
of 800 right yeah yeah yeah this makes
sense okay
don't stop me I'm cruising I need a
little bit of a darker shadow outer glow
because that shadow is no bueno for
there you go now it's a hard to line
okay
so one of the things I need to do I'm
noticing that this shadow guide goes
under the logo here so I'm going to
click on this logo Oh actually how how
far from the top is it mmm about about
20 pixels much off so I click on this
logo and give it a class of logo
everything needs a class and you can you
can go on element level things but it's
pretty like they look I feel like it
forces me to do classes a lot which is
theirs okay it's fine
I want margin top of 20 and I want to do
margin bottom of negative 80 Wow okay
yeah that looks about right right let me
flip back
yeah I just this header is too dark for
what he designed
I feel like white on white it's kind of
weird but here's e-e-e is that right you
Iggy okay
so we have this container and then this
image is in the container the container
has 35 pixels padding around it so this
total width is 800 now I need this um
need to have a navigation here so I
could do a list and also have your
dynamic content what is that
okay dynamic content is the is the thing
in web flow it's like your custom data
and stuff like if you like a store or a
blog or something like generated
components embeds there's a nav bar nav
bar tabs knepper this is cool all these
things have like a little question mark
so you can like easy to use bundle of
elements that give you responsive header
and/or navigation which is kind of what
we're looking at let's try this and drag
a nav bar into the container it's pretty
good this container let's make it a flex
item mmm how do you what okay the reason
I wanted it flex because so I could be
like side to side but it looks like oh
something's going on here so I'm gonna
go to this and say sizing um expand
don't expand the line to the top okay
here we go okay and this is the nav bar
right
container logo navbar and the navbar is
chilling because it's in a parent that's
flex select a class navbar tell it to
expand there we go mmmmmm
now the navbar here we go
is it dark for some reason it has a
let's say nav bar
- container and take this background off
of it am I seeing this right it has a
background right this is background
transparent
I understand why is it darker am I
getting the nesting wrong so here's the
navbar what color is it
ah how do you turn it off oh here we go
there we go
okay so that's the navbar that was
having the color not the navbar
container now bar containers inside of
now far okay a half bar now for our
container brand is it the logo am I
supposed to Boop that's not you like am
I supposed to drag a logo into this
thing oh snap I think that's not
supposed to do I'm gonna delete this
alright and then ha what would you okay
uh logo right oh that's cool so when I
put the class of the previous class I
defined it like got all of the style to
it it's cool it's cool okay so this is
this is the navbar I'm getting it I'm
getting it container is the thing I
built with the 35 pixels padding then
the navbar which I've been messing with
and then navbar container why navbar
container that's a part of the component
or something that I put in there okay
brand is that logo and then the nav menu
nav menu brand menu button
okay so when it gets to these other
sizes tablet portrait the the thing will
change and I give this menu button menu
open oh okay okay okay okay
so menu button opens and it's only okay
so it's responsive okay okay
got it so what I want to do is get I
guess right now I want to focus on these
things how do you add new nav links
because I think Louis made me design
five about episodes donate swag
Instagram let me rename these double
click yep one point about not enter and
to point this sews right two episodes
donate swag three donate and I hope I
can like just drag in and nav link maybe
link block
it's a link block is that love thing
about this thing okay drag in something
link block mmm link I'll just try this
dragon on the link it's not the same
look at this navigator here nav link
kind of duplicate this kind option drag
like yep so that's one way to create new
lap nav links just option drag option
drag here yes you can so inside the UI
you can option drag
- okay so donate swag in Instagram so
ever for is swag and we're 5 here is I
and Estia
am okay so I have these five links up at
the top here and nav menu needs to be
centered nav menu needs to be centered
is it a child or send us now what's
interesting to me is I can't just be
like all the nav menus because it
already has a thing right it's already
something nav menu anyway it should be a
child of flex is this not this is not
flexed it is flexed so it's oh this is
not flexed though which is the nav bar
container let's flex it that looks good
now let's go back to this nav menu and
make it grow and then go back to the
children of nav menu so I think the
hardest part for me is like the nesting
clicking on the right thing and knowing
what I'm targeting and what like you
know so now link hasn't
then I say nav menu link okay and then
for these nav menu links these are
children of flex so I'm hoping there's
like right there children effects
whether or not oh now they are that was
cool
dum dum dum de dum
I have menu link I have to put nav menu
link on all of these Wow I wonder if
there's a way to like multiple command
select no I'm holding shift and
selecting and they're not double
selecting so you have to go through an
attack attach a class to all of these
all right that's whatever that's fine we
go to this navigator again so this is
the whole link it's that big box is it
have padding on it it does it has
padding on it which is unexpected
because why would it because I guess has
part of like where the component built
from web flow came from right now that
looks all right
but if I compare it it looks a little
not all right so let's go to all cool if
I click on this label it shows me like
it's nested parents so here's the nav
menu link there's a menu that have made
a container just up to three I guess but
still it's cool logo brand now container
that's cool so it's an easy way to
navigate that way so I think the web
flow knows that it's kind of hard to
navigate and so they're making like
these little things possible you know
like if you click on the wrong thing you
can just navigate up right here still
takes work but it's a good effort it's a
good effort um what do I want to do I
want to style these things are these
anchor tags what is this stuff
saves changed oh you can go undo
export
yes this is look at this this is the
code that I built so far body class
header W container oh so W nav is going
to be the web flow class that's on it
that made it like have like the padding
and everything here's the anchor tag for
the logo it's a nav element and then
okay each of these is an anchor so this
is an anchor tag don't worry don't worry
that's an anchor tag but why is it not
like underlined and stuff here's what
here's I'm going to do I'm going to get
some color and that's the color of that
I want this to be oh yeah yeah also also
also I want these all of you zero there
and now I'll push them all down wait why
did I see a 16 point 67 what's going on
in there okay
and then if they're in if they're the
children of a flex I can just say flex
distribute like that that's better so
let me also say that I want to push them
down so on this parent I should just say
like you know some padding how do you do
this
oh here okay um that's good and how
about I instead of this color I want the
color of the beard
yeah I like that color and these need to
get bigger how big are they now
14 16 18 18 and font weight medium and
also let's do some letter spacing
there we go how's that looking guys
that's looking good
although it's not quite perfect yeah
that's that's what I want went right
right aligned and then I'll put some
margins on the left of it let's say 40
pixels not not what I wanted to do I
wanted 40 pixels on each one of these
huh okay what'd you guys think about
that
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh I think this header is
bigger than mine that's a hundred and 15
pixels mine is a hundred and fifteen
pixels so about the same why does this
look different little different it's
just a little different looks good
though I'm pretty happy with that okay
so let's check out them mobile view not
what I was thinking not what I was
thinking cool cool and then how did I
get all right well first of all nav
container this menu button is inside of
what brand
I want to say a menu I've spilt that
menu button okay and I want it to mmm I
was hoping that would just work
oh that's order um I want this to be all
over to the right and it is a child of a
Flex parent right yeah
your parents are flexed what about
No
I'm trying to get this guy over to the
right and its brand is visible own
navbar container that's at all
now menu is invisible and met so these
so I should be able to say like when
you're in a tablet view so it's like a
media query change this flex um this
this flex align left' or items left just
if I start to like space between I don't
know why space between means that it has
parted on the side here
okay big
that's space left
on that space between oh wait does that
mean it has a mini query so here's the
net bar container and it's like this
laptop or desktop and then they hit
tablet and my flex layout changes so it
does have a media query can I move this
in oh how about this mobile let's make
this thing smaller can we do that max a
max it width is 100% how about you know
60% hmm so a full media query mobile
media query phone horizontal from
vertical that make sense okay so let's
do um if I click on the menu button and
then I go to menu button settings I can
open the menu
oh snap that looks horrible that looks
horrible but what is it menu button icon
brand what is it how do i target it oh
this is the nav menu okay is this stuff
okay nav menu interesting okay so
I'm hoping the states are such that I'm
manipulating the nav menu when it's open
when it's mobile I guess let's see also
yeah well I'll do that one later but let
me see all right um first thing I want
to do is make this nav menu position
like uh like fixed or absolute
so where's position here we are it's
absolute right now absolute what top
sixty down why would it be 60 down
that's two zero want to make it fixed so
it's like yeah yeah yeah yeah negative
30
okay but why is it why is it
oh here's why the padding top so I was
like why is it not from the top but
there we go okay and now I want to do
padding top like let's say 50 or
something like that okay and then each
one of these things can have a margin
bottom of you know another 20 or
something okay so going back to the menu
button I'm going to turn it off let's go
to oops let's go to view here oh but
it's covered how do you get it
how do you get it back it's pretty cool
though like it looks nice and it slides
down from the top I didn't I wasn't
expecting a slide from the top thing
here go to the menu button then you open
menu button we need to raise its z-index
right because
when you button raise
oh here's the um here's the animation
drop down over right over left I'll do
that later on and raise the z-index of
this menu button transition from four
effects is there a help
where's the z-index where would that be
by position maybe position ah here we
are Z index 1 to preview yeah baby it
turns white and the color just like well
why is the Yser background color on it
I don't you remember fitting that there
uh one thing else okay let's check out
this Oh
oh dear so okay okay so I'm looking at
this and I'm seeing how webflow is
thinking about mobile first and they're
not mobile first they're like mobile
apps or desktop first which is not
horrible there's better ways to do it
but I'm realizing that let's see how do
I look like code if I look at the code
is generating see this media query here
these are all the things that I just did
like making that menu bigger and stuff
and I need to get all these things into
here into this media query so how can I
just take this code and scoot it into
this block
can I add it the code somewhere edit the
code
can i edit the code somewhere I don't
think I can so what I need to do is go
okay so these all look fine but here
here here here I need to get the menu
open code and bring it over here
so it's this thing that menu need to
turn it mmm how can you do this
how can you undo not just undo but
delete specific things here's here's
what we'll do go into this and we'll say
position auto or whatever it was and
padding top-20
is that right now I don't know what they
were well I don't I start here and see
if it translates down and I'll just well
fix it as I go down
okay so nav menu here I wanted to turn
into fixed where did you go where are
you
I have menus down here for some reason
okay um fixed and then zero zero there
we are
fix fix you get zero - this is all the
stuff that I just did for the menu
before padding 50 I think it was 50 okay
and each individual element gets 20
margin bottom ok this looks ok let's go
to view turn it on
except for you need when the thing is
open you need more Z index Z index right
here up up to okay now let's do a view
that's good okay so this is working on
here's desktop and here's tablet there's
all the links looks very good wide
mobile mmm I messed it up I can't all
right keep in mind this is a big this is
a big thing
make your styles when you're considering
mobile design when you're considering
your your media queries that they can
they cascade down not up right these
these are using max width and up in
width okay so right here I need a fix I
need that fix this let's go and you and
then you go to settings there's a little
obtuse but it's okay menu okay now what
I want to do is like just take it off
like I just want to get rid of this code
how do I just get rid of this code here
at the bottom I just want to delete this
stuff I don't need it because this stuff
works for it I don't want to replicate
it in a media query I just do something
bad I just deleted something yikes okay
all right I don't this guy I just I
don't want any position Oh remove style
yeah yes you can remove styles there we
go
that's how you do it haha so uh and you
remove it would be nice to click on an
item and see all of the things that are
are impacting it not the options that
you have and I noticed that when you do
change something like you know it turns
blue right which is easy to like just
remove the style I think what's the
orange what does the orange mean
something else is impacting it
oh it's inherited that's what orange
means okay I like that I like that and
I'm happy that I figured it out but I
think that that was um hard ok so what
do you guys think oh yeah yeah we're
gonna leave it there ok so you guys I
feel like just by doing this little work
of just the header and making it
responsive figuring these things out
like I learned a lot about this tool and
if you know this took me like 30 or 40
minutes if I were to remake this
tomorrow the same like the same
constraints of everything I needed to do
I think I could get it done in like 10
minutes like that's how learning is you
know you you battle yourself through the
learning curve and then when you get it
when they like you clicks then you can
go a lot faster because you've already
done it you understand how things kind
of work together and it also helps that
I'm really familiar with HT
and CSS because if I was not this would
be kind of a headache this would be kind
of a headache uh yeah so what what I do
like about it is that I mean if you can
compare what I was supposed to make
versus you know what I made it's pretty
darn close and I'm intentional about
this changes like the color I like the
color better maybe I can you know I
think he was meaning link I think he
wanted this to be a fixed header now to
look at and they went as you scroll down
maybe this thing will change intensities
or like the active thing and maybe we
can do that later I don't know you
change this to not bold the medium just
normal that's better anyway so I'm going
