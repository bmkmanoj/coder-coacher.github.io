be the last video that I'm going to
record tonight so a few things first
about the videos i decided i'm going to
release them all on monday so you don't
have to wait every day to get the new
one and I'll be surprised if anybody
watches them all in order on one day
I'll be surprised if anybody watches the
long period they're like on average 15
minutes like 20 minutes being the
longest one so far that's really weird
because the production overhead is so
low I mean and just sit down here's the
camera there's the screen and just start
talking and so it's easy to make them
and it's easy to make them long and I
really I'm having fun I'm really
enjoying myself I get to talk naturally
I don't have a script usually I write a
script and then I come do several takes
for each sentence and then chop them up
and put them together you know I feel
like they come o'clock across pretty
concise and like you know relatively
well produced for a youtube video and
how well for a coding youtube video but
this is quite nice I feel comfortable I
feel like I'm doing some cool stuff
learning what's your as opinion do you
like this format do you appreciate the
candor and do you appreciate being able
to see what I'm doing as I'm doing it
instead of having me tell you principles
and show you examples of things that are
mostly done already what's your pain I
really really really really want to know
would you please let me down in the
comments or just you know thumbs down
all of these videos if you hate them
thumbs them up if you like them whatever
so um all these videos are going to be
released on Monday and if you watch the
other ones before this one which makes
sense because they're become before it
I'm talking about how they're going to
be at least 10 every day this week but
that's wrong and now you're
now you understand why you're watching
them on monday what a surprise what a
mystery that is unraveled I bet you feel
like you know the Hardy Boys or
something like that you're so smart
you're so clever creech you you're
amazing anyhow I want to share something
with you this is the last video and it
actually doesn't have anything to do
with coding it actually doesn't have
much to do with anything we've talked
about so far other than it's just like
one of those awesome awesome awesome
tips visit my god ah that mic is on of
course it's my Joey's mom it's been on I
can psyched out every video need like it
a little what's a call where the volume
goes up and down I need a visual volume
feedback on this discipline anyhow this
tip that I'm going to share with you if
you apply it and make it use of your
everyday computer the hacking it will
like totally speed up your work because
it's just so such a great tip ok so look
at the screen everybody knows about this
is for mac by the way everybody knows
about command space command space will
enable you to quickly bring up any you
can launch any program you can also
search for things also you can do math
in it like 23 + 2014 this 37 did you
know that I know it's typed it in my
spotlight hey anyway let's do this
everybody knows about that let me show
you the other one that you that you
probably don't know about you probably
hey you know about this already don't
you because you're so smart and clever
remember we established that already
anyhow if you didn't know well we're
pretending that you do know about it so
let's just talk about the thing there to
know about here we are on the stream
remember how this text this sass file
that i'm working in not twerking and
working in is not syntax highlight
it and I would like it to be I would
like to quickly browse and see the
selectors colorized differently then the
the values the properties and values so
I can go into actions oops I go to view
language and actually even though this
is SAS i use the stylist syntax
highlighter because of the non bracketed
nature of the syntax flavor I like it's
not really everybody everybody uses SCSS
it's so frustrating it's like it's SAS s
is so much better and maybe i'll make
another quick video huh maybe six videos
oh my god play just thought of another
tip and i can make the next video and
sits another reason that SAS is better
than scss nem i use style ups to
highlight my sin taxes let me show you
this instead of having to do this like
menu search when you language and scroll
down to find stylist I can just type and
grab the camera I'll show you my
keyboard can you see this I'm doing
that's the wrong keys I'm doing shift
command that's the question work is that
blurry this is so awkward for me I'm
doing man ? and okay now you're
back here and focus okay so looking at
the screen and shift command ? what
that's what did that is doing is popping
up this help menu will go search in it
and this search will go through all of
the menu items on on the menu bar of the
application so if I just popped open it
helped search menu and a types died and
i just press the down arrow look at that
I got this finger arrow pointing right
to stylist i can plug press return now
you may have used the help menu before
because it's so helpful but just that
command shift ?
that's so great it's so quick and easy I
mean I use it all the time here's a few
other examples I'm in chrome and I was
telling you guys about bourbon earlier
and I was looking at the documentation
for like the other day so if I just
command shift question where Ruben
documentation there it is it looked in
my recent history found it look at that
here's my bourbon documentation I can
find all the things I can do with
bourbon here's photoshop i have this
thing it's a i was doing a like an
animation before and use this imac
looking screen as if to represent
computers did I just take off this
background take off the shadow to know
where and I do command shift trim
because I want to get rid of that
negative space around it or the empty
pixels trim its floating it finds it so
here's actually another thing in
Photoshop I don't know why it's really
picky it's really buggy I guess in
Photoshop but it doesn't do it you can't
hit enter and it doesn't do anything so
but at least it finds it for you because
I don't know where half the stuff is in
the meetings I always search for it so
anyway it's right here so I can swim I
mouse over it and choose it I'll hit
enter and it trimmed it just like I
thought it would this is another great
way a great great way of extracting
elements from a PSD if you're coding
maybe I'll throw this tip on later got
so many good tips for you get but anyway
if you just you can extract PSD is by
doing the trim its way cleaner and it's
way easier than doing any slicing I
never slice using the slice tool is
totally new bitch and that's all I'm
going to say about that so the tip of
the day is this this helped feature and
this is in all across macintosh in any
application and if you have Windows or
Linux like this if you do linux
or Chrome OS what I don't know what the
the you know corollary is there but this
is super helpful and it will like you
know totally like a power user kind of
thing but you already knew that didn't
you remember you're smart and you're
clever and is this mic on that's it for
debate take care see you guys tomorrow
should I just six videos okay i could
probably six videos it's only two
o'clock in the morning my kids are gonna
wake me up in like four hours because
they don't sleep they do sleep I'm just
don't wake when they sleep because I
can't get anything done when they're
awake paradox</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
