ready to share it with you I'm ready to

live episodes of dev tips and you've
seen me write personal notes and send
stickers to people these are all things
that are part of the dev tips community

community is in the form of a patreon
page if you're not familiar with patreon

members and fans to support content

video in that page that I created which
explains all the details the link is in

associated with this community some are
really really valuable like the dev tips

other questions that pop up that's about
6 hours from now I'll also be in dev
tips chat throughout the day welcoming
