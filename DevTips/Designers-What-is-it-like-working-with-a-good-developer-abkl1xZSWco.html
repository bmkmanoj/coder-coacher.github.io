important is collaboration in this
business how important is it to work
well with people that have skillsets
outside of your own as developers how
important and what is it like to work
well with a good designer ah well last
week I went to a meet-up filled with
designers and I asked them the exact
opposite question what is it like to
work with a good developer ladies and
gentlemen I present to you 13 of
California's top designers or at least
13 designers that had nothing better to
do that night and showed up and also
didn't say no and I stuck a camera in
their face and could complete a sentence
and also some animal footage wild
animals that you know I thought they
were cute I'm in my experience working
with a really good developer is like
having an expert at your fingertips all
the time
these people know their platform inside
now
and you can work with them so tightly
because they are the expert hey I'm
George Penenberg working with a good
developer to me is it's really great
having someone that rather than shied
away from challenges just kind of like
embraces them and tries to figure out
you know like how do we figure out how
to do this is it's the most awesome
thing when I was Lawrence working with a
good developer makes life really great
because you know you save a lot of time
and yeah it makes the workflow really
good what my name is Preston
collaboration is is interesting because
you kind of have to sometimes when
you're sitting in a room with the people
with different ideas can have to step
back and listen to things but not let
your emotions get into it that's
probably the hardest things like not
getting your idea told it's know you
have to learn to take criticism you have
to learn to take the tangibles for other
people's ideas and then try and
collaborate and bring those ideas
together and that's probably the hardest
part of design probably just enveloping
and bringing it all together I guess
okay so my name is McCollum and working
with good developers priceless first of
all I think it's someone who doesn't
make your design that you're I think
static design just you know I think
communion and then perfectly perfectly
like pixel perfect in a way but at the
same time it needs to be very breezy and
obviously delivered the whole kind of
function I think from you know A to B so
the good developer what brings a table I
think is you know when he makes he makes
he makes the design alive basically my
name is Dave Anderson and the best way
to work with the developer is very close
hey my name is Seymour and developer
actually should be in the idea visuals
or ammo cups so we should be able to
reproduce the design I don't want to say
pixel perfect good
my name's Amir working we're a really
good developer really makes things a lot
easier it allows you to just build your
dreams
working with a really good developer is
like butter on toast
use Jam all day
hi
show me design it will be like I don't
know how to do it but I'm going to find
out believers I guess a knock people
were just thinking about that I'm
Freddie working with a good thing
developer insight he can inspire you
like make you feel your work is can can
make a difference
I think it really encourage you to dare
to thing that is like thank
out-of-the-box
I have travel Erie and oh man it's like
the best song that you've ever heard
like being able to have a connection
with the developer that understands
design and you can understand them and
you're you're speaking the same language
it's what is it like to be involved in a
good collaboration is is it's just
having the same kinetic when the
connection with each other is is being
able to communicate with each other on a
on the more than a personal level is
just having that that synthesis with
each other so that's a good
collaboration
I get my own title card
I'm Travis Nelson and I think working
with a good developer is bomb because
they do all the hard stuff
I get it dropped pretty pictures all day
and they do the math so that's good for
me no but honestly working with a good
developer is such a blessing in my work
because a good developer understands the
problem and also the tools to solve the
problem usually a lot better than
anybody else on the team it's been my
experience that they often offer
incredibly insightful UI suggestions and
also can identify really simple solution
to complex problems the synergistic
relationship between a developer and a
designer is one of the most fulfilling
in the entire industry
I wanted this video to be a peek into a
designer's worldview I wanted to show
you how much they need and appreciate
someone with your skills and also to
inspire you to be the developer that
every designer wants to work with and
yes we do have favorites so today's
question of the week is what was your
best collaboration what made it a
success I really want to know so please
leave your comments down below and if
you liked this video and you want to be
notified when more videos like it or
available please subscribe and that way
you can know I'm Travis and keep on
hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
