called parallax on the web I know that
because we're doing a footer and footers
come last science
this is a normal footer see how it's on
the bottom see how it naturally follows
the content on the page now behold our
footer see how it isn't moved you see
how it is revealed it stands a simple
element unmoved by the whims of its
master scroll wheel it is a spectacle it
is beautiful and best of all it's really
easy to do so to make this fantabulous
fixed footer we're going to head over to
the index Jade file and go all the way
to the bottom and we have here these
posts that we made in the last video and
we're going to outdent
a little bit and go on the same level of
the of the article here because the
article is constraining the width we
want the footer to be full width so
let's say footer and inside of the
footer we're going to need first of all
a row and we can call that row footer
and call it footer stuff and then inside
the rowing make some columns and we're
going to do three columns for this one
and uh let's say that it's like a list
of links in the you know it's like
footer stuff so the first one would be a
list of links and this will be like
social media so find us on because it's
a remember the fashion website they love
their links so make a ul and then inside
of that some allies with some links in
them
and there's gonna be like Twitter and
Facebook and whatever else Twitter
Facebook what do people like to Twitter
a interest that's fashion a in Instagram
okay so we have these links in this
columns to the next column here which is
going to be column and dot three and
we'll just like like say it's like a you
know like sister shops or sister sites
we'll call it other shops and we'll do
the same structures up above here with
the UL and everything and let's just
let's call Blackbird let's make up like
Red Robin emerald eagle of crimson crane
and AH burn what's a what's a bird that
starts with an A
Auburn Auburn I don't even know any
birds that start with an A there's all
these suggestions birds that start of
CEP
it's amazing that like so many people
have Google that's already beginning
birds beginning with a ok let's call it
an Abbott I guess that's a bird okay so
we have all these like cute little
illiterate a little alliterative store
names and then in the last column that's
right the last column C these are uneven
uneven column this is going to be it's
going to be 6 6 units wide
we're going to do a paragraph some lorem
hey some lorem thank you and this is
going to be actually like a newsletter
thing so sign up for the news letter and
I don't need a lot of one just a little
bit and then this can be strong strong
okay
and below that will have the actual
newsletter signups we're going to need a
form and the form is going to be the row
and we're going to make some columns in
here alums eight for the for the input
field and so we'll say input type equals
email and place holder equals your email
and then we're going to do columns
columns for and another input and this
will be the the button type equals
submit and we'll call this class this
this is a class that's inside of
actually idea is that working so so so
we have this footer here at the bottom
you see how this this email box is not
going all the way across we have to add
something to it or to add a class of you
- full - width hopefully that will throw
that out and it doesn't look like it
okay don't care oh yeah that worked now
let's jump into our styles and go all
the way to the bottom and create a new
section called you guessed it footer and
it will start with a footer tag
and we want to make this background
black and the color of the text should
be white give it a nice heavy contrast
boom and the links inside there they
should be color white too padding can be
top and bottom forty pixels and then the
footer stuff which is the inside of the
footer that needs to have a max width of
like you know 640 I think was what was
what the other grid was right okay and
then margin:0 auto to center it okay and
that's maybe still a little too much
text on the newsletter but it's fine now
let's get rid of it okay better that
button though it's like see-through or
transparent background so we'll add
another skeleton class of button
- primary it'll make it blue there you
go alright back to the layout let's make
this footer position fixed bottom zero
boom with 100% okay okay now everything
now so it's like always on the bottom
everything is kind of going under it and
that's cool but what we want to do to
make this a parallax effect we want kind
of things - like scroll differently than
we normally expect them to so I want to
have this footer be kind of revealed
so I have to nest it a little bit
different because right now it's inside
let's look at this dog here the footer
is a sibling of article and it's inside
of this section let's move it outside of
the section okay now it goes all the way
up wild why is that oh I know why okay
so it's outside of this section but this
section is because it's because it's
later in the Dom it's fistfuls I get
sitting on top so let's find that
section at the top here in this tiles
and at such called section of content
we'll say a position relative and
z-index - all right everything is on top
now that's good except for a background
white looking good now for okay any
dizzy index up that bird box too
bird box there we go all right now
everything is sitting on top of the
footer because its position fix if I add
a little bit of go back to the article
and I add a little bit of margin note
content why is that Connor and I add a
little bit of margin bottom to it we'll
get like let's say 400 pixels margin
bottom now when I scroll it come reveals
where's my footer stuff while you way
over there
okay this thing at the bottom here needs
to go remember that remember that big
big div we put there so we could like
check out our scrolling stuffy stuff
stuff scrolling stuffy stuff stuff check
out our what's it called our car
parallax tough it was screwing up my day
okay so now I have this black footer
here that gets kind of like like
revealed instead of like it being on the
bottom of stuff it's it's revealed by
this container going above it it's cool
huh I like it
that's fun and that one didn't even ease
any job is any job II enough and that
one didn't even use any JavaScript so
it's a little bit easier to implement
cool my friends it has been my pleasure

you impress your friends and your bosses
