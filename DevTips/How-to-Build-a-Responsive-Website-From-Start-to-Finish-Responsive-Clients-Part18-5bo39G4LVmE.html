this is my show it's on YouTube you can
watch it for free ah you thought we were
done with a client section well you're
wrong I thought we were done with the
client section too but turns out you
know a lot of you guys in the comments
of the last video pointed out a lot of
things that that I could have done
better this is a perfect opportunity to
revisit and rethink a few important
things number one I think I can do
better on these links down here below
see how the lining goes all the way out
this is because all of these logos are
inside of a box it's all the same length
as as each other right they have a
minimum I think they have a min width of
like 200 in something or something like
that so
so this line under it goes as long as it
can so what I want to do is kind of
actually get these logos inside of the
Dom not just as backgrounds and that way
this line will go just as far as it
needs to go and not along further like
that and the second thing I want to do
really should have been one of the first
things I did was kind of make it
responsive look at this it turns into a
holy mess when it gets shrunk down so I
want to take care of those things today
in this video that's what we're doing
buckle your safety belt because it's
going to be a wild ride okay like I said
in the introduction the first thing I
want to do is kind of get these
background images into the Dom right now
if we look at the clients code here in
the clients HTML these are all where are
we now client logos these are all
background images of this div so I want
to make this div actually an image tag
and do doop doop doop boop be doop
source there we go and I'm gonna call
this alt you can find a better name for
it later but right now I'll just copy
him okay so now it's going to be an
image inside the dom let's refresh and
see how that looks
see how they're all sized all weird and
wonky there are some styles we have to
do to take care of that so let's jump
over to our Styles go down to the logos
and we can see there's a few things that
can work better here max-width style is
relative okay oh wait I just realized
these are crazy this should actually be
Center and this should be spaced around
I don't know how I get those mixed up
but that's not the case so the client
logo the reason they're all stretched up
here and weird is because they have a
height declared let's get rid of that
because now there are no longer divs
there they're images which have their
own natural dimension to them so we have
the height there we can get rid of all
these background styles cursor:pointer
yeah I want to keep that margin bottom
let's keep that and min-width
you don't need the min-width anymore
let's check lick to that okay so this is
oh this is like nearly exactly what I
wanted except for a few things there
alignments are a bit off you see here
where the the line on the bottom is kind
of like right there and then if I click
on this one it's a lot higher so what I
want to do there is kind of align these
all to the bottom instead of a lining
item spacer around I could say align
items
flex end and that will like push them
all to the bottom
well basically align them all to a
single base line refresh yeah there we
go now it's not looking like that that
gold bar or that accent color is jumping
all around I like that a lot better okay
and I like how also this gold bar is the
length that it needs to be right here on
this one it's a lot shorter than this
one that's because the logo is
dimensionally shorter or like it's like
you know not as wide of a logo so the
bar doesn't need to be as wide either I
like that a lot
now let's take this bottom rule here
that was made with drop shadows from
last time and just make it a
conventional border bottom
little bit more easier to understand I
had a few questions about it so I want
to make it a little bit easier to work
with so instead of saying box shadow
down here we'll say for your bottom four
pixels solid and the accent color okay
but we need to make sure that so if I
don't put anything on the other ones see
how it kind of jumps them all up and
down like that that four pixels needs to
be accounted for for all the other logos
whereas box shadow it doesn't box shadow
is just not like alter the position of
things in the Dom the flow of the Dom
but border does so I want to kind of
compensate for those four pixels inside
of the other logos so I'm going to do
that by going up to all of the client
logos not just the currently active one
and putting a border bottom on that and
it's going to be again four pixels solid
but this time the color is going to be
transparent and refresh and now they're
not going to see that hah like you did
the other time another thing that I want
to do that I realized that I didn't in
the Photoshop design but I didn't do in
the coding was that I made the active
one fully opaque where the other
inactive ones were like like kind of
knocked down and opacity so let me turn
the opacity down I'm going to take it to
0.5 and then for the active client I'll
bring it back up to one there we go now
it's a little bit more pronounced which
one is active I like that and I want to
get that far away from the bottom of the
logo again but now since we're not
talking about background images it's
just like a regular image I can put some
padding on it that'll work pretty well
let's say margin 20 padding bottom
20 here we go
looks good let's make it 10 it's a
little much there yeah it looks pretty
good okay that's it for those logos I
think that kind of makes it satisfies
what I wanted to achieve with them but
now I want to make this layout work in a
responsive environment okay so the first
thing we're going to do is crunch it in
and see where our problems are and we
have to think about what we can retain
and what we need to compensate for and
what we can lose okay so the first thing
I'm going to notice is that these left
and right arrows just don't work well in
mobile I don't think you can ever see
kind of that working well it's swiping
it's not tapping left and right so I'm
going to set up a down here below
everything I'm going to set up a media
query media max width will be 750 pixels
all right and inside there I want to
just get rid of those um client controls
client controls display none all right
so when our browsers or hits like right
about that area right there we're going
to lose those controls see how they
they're in there now and they pop out
right there that's because once it gets
me smaller than that it's not going to
be they're not going to be useful to us
anyhow we're just going to get rid of
that visual clutter and we're going to
rely on a few other ways to control this
namely these logos down below and we
might support them in other ways and
compensate for losing the client
controls what do we need to do here to
make these logos make this kind of like
area work better well first thing I need
to do is stop kind of aligning these in
columns I need to break this into one
kind of tube of information and that
will be by doing let's see I need to
focus on the client felt
pull aye and belt and then the client
unit remember the client unit is both
the avatar and the content inside there
so that client unit right now is
currently set at display flex which is
there a really kind of convenient way to
get those easy columns in there we have
to turn that off if turn that display
call display flex off because we don't
want that column anymore we want to
stack up normally so let's say display
block now since it's going to be
stacking up and I'm going to have the
next section float under it and we're
going to be changing the length of the
the content right now they're all the
same same length and I realized as well
another thing I realized actually is is
that we you know putting the margin on
the the top of the logos to push
everything down is kind of a bad
strategy because that's not dynamically
based on the length of content in the
quotation it's based on like an
arbitrary number right so I want to take
that away by not making it
position:absolute by making it
position:relative so I'm going to turn
this position here into a relative and
I'll say margin left is zero pixels
because it was negative
325 I think and left is going to be
narrow Auto which is the default as if
it was reset
okay so let's basically right there is
turning off display flex and it's also
turning off position:absolute it should
kind of like slap everything down let's
see how that works out
wow this is the wrong name there we go
okay so now it's stacked up on top of
each other and that margin on top of the
logos is coming into play here and the
lows are squished oh I know what that is
I'll take care of that in a second right
here we have and we have a really good
layout I want to take this um face I
just want to put a little bit of margin
below it
okay client phase margin blue and now in
this client content here I want to kind
of bring that in from the edges there
I'll put a padding of 0 and 30 pixels on
the right and the left and let's kind of
restrict the the size of it anyway
because I don't like I don't like it how
it is longer if it's like around 700
pixels it's kind of too big for me right
there so let's say max width is going to
be 400 pixels and then um say I'm margin
is 0 Auto ok looks a bit a little bit
better
let's bring in that client quote mark to
my left let's bring that quote mark in
to left 15 pixels okay cool oh it's all
pretty good um ok now that that works
well right now and because now that this
uh you know client unit is
position:relative I can get rid of this
margin on top of the logos in fact I
wonder it can i I just make the whole
thing position:relative not just in the
hmm let's go back up here to our same
position positive or position:absolute
and say position:relative now what that
does is actually allows me to get rid of
the margin on top of those logos at edit
at any moment position let's see 50
pixels and then Auto for left and right
so it can be centered ok let's get rid
of these that margin on top of the logos
client logos margin top 350 let's just
put that at 50 looks good
let me get this window better for you
okay and then when we close this window
our left and right are going to
disappear and our clients what is called
a client testimonial will stack up and
then we can start clicking on a guy
right there
now I want to see these logos how they
start scrunching up like that that's bad
news everything else looks pretty good
though for those logos let's say right
in here actually for those logos I'm
thinking like even if you did squeeze
them in like even if I did stack them
like this watch clients logos um it flex
rap-rap this will make the logos wrap
around but even but if you think about
it like on like a little mobile device
this is going to be kind of weird like
like that is kind of disconnected from
the content you like scroll down to the
next guy click his name or tap his name
and scroll back up to see his name and
in his face and stuff down here is his
company and then up here's is kind of
like his attribution so it's kind of
weird so I think what I want to do is I
want to create a mobile navigation that
suited just for tapping and it suited
more towards um I don't you know like
that will show up only on mobile and
these logos with logos will just go away
so let's say client logos in this kind
of mobile view let's say display:none
and then okay now let's start to work on
our mobile nav so let's go back into
clients and we want this to be a loop
outside of the clients belt I want to
put it above the head so it's like more
associated with you know like the
clients name and click on the next one
next name right we'll have more there
instead of below all the content
back up and that crazy mess so that's
good for a desktop but it's not working
for us right now on mobile let's take a
look at making a loop and having these
kind of having the navigation be a more
mobile native style for client and and
for okay now for each one of these I
want to just create like an easy
something to click on so I'll just use a
span and I want to put them inside of a
wrap so div class I'll call it clients
mobile nav that sounds fine it could be
anything okay now there should be four
spans or in other words there should be
one span for every client and there are
four clients there now let's go in and
dial these guys right here and we'll say
that they should what I call them
clients noble nav something up at a
client's fly-in
my fingers are not ever spelling clients
right mobile nav text-align:center and
then we'll say for every span inside of
there you get these styles I'm going to
cursor:pointer and display let's scroll
down here display will be in line block
and then size I want to be a little bit
larger because it's going to be on a
mobile phone so I'll say like 16 pixels
like a nice big target for your finger
right there 16 pixels and
I'll make them circle kind of styled
like those little dots that were in our
skill section so so those are like
border-radius 50% border we could say
Solid 2 pixels and we'll do we use the
color like that blue color that thing is
just called background color and then
margin them out like Sphero pixels 10
pixels and yeah that looks like that
look pretty all right
centered okay let's see what they look
like here we are okay and then I want to
call that a and active client line and
uh you'll your border color will be
accent okay now I want the active one to
be called accent so what I need to do is
run back into my JavaScript and treat it
like one of those logos let's close this
up so you know see how mobile-friendly
that looks really styled well for your
phone I love that lets go into our our
assets javascript add it to our
javascript just those those class names
to make it function as if it were just
like those logos down below but now it's
just these little circles above okay so
the first thing we need to do is find
the first one of them and make them
active client clients mobile nav span
okay that worked cool and then do to do
clients mobile I get active span okay
now let's take the same selector and
throw it on the same function that
control
the logos and these guys will add I mean
they'll basically act just like the
logos right there's 4.2 click the 1 and
1 that corresponds will bring up the
corresponding quotation just like the
logo so 2 comma and then just what we
wrote right there and this hopefully
there we go bring up the corresponding
quotation now now the reason this works
ok just kind of art architectural or
information design wise is because the
name of the clients company is still on
his quotation it was supported by the
logos but it didn't rely on the logos
right so it's still there the and all
the information is still there it just
presented a little differently and it's
optimized for the mobile phone ok one
more thing we have to do to optimize it
earlier is to say I want the
display:none up here and then I'll kind
of when it's below you know 700 pixels
or whatever it was 750 pixels I'll show
it so display:block okay so you're here
you're good and then you're gone there
and then you're coming cool I like it
this makes me happy
ok that is just it for the quick you
know things I wanted to do in this video
order to get those logos like tightened
up a little bit visually and then also
to make this work in a mobile device
make it responsive like this is one of
our goals for this website so that's it
for today a bit or hopefully a quick
video for you and thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you next week
when we continue on our exciting journey
of the artist theme
keep on hacking I'll talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
