this is dev tips for designers a YouTube
channel we talk about web development
and stuff if this is your first time
here hey welcome welcome to the party
it's going to be so much fun we're going
to talk about website stuff and make it
if this is not your first time so man
all right this is the first video in a
series I call CSS basics we're going to
be talking about style sheets and how to
make your website a beautiful joy to
look at so let's talk about CSS what is
it well write this down CSS is the
stylesheet language used to describe the
presentational semantics of a document
written in the markup language like HTML
so more specific to our case CSS make
sure what's that look like it does but
that may be an abstract concept so let's
take a look at some real-life examples
all right homeboy let's take a look at a
few popular websites and then turn off
their style sheet so we can get a better
idea of what they actually do and why
they're so important I'm just going to
reach up here and turn off the style
sheets Wow look at that
all right here's Apple comm known for
its fancy layouts reach up here turn off
the style sheets and Wow look at that
it's just marker finally sure all you
tweeners love this one Facebook reach up
here turn style sheets off and looks
just like the others see you're getting
it yeah style sheets give the web just
that style all right let me break a
little history off for you you see HTML
was never intended to contain tags that
would define the style of a document it
was always to describe the content of a
document just like we talked about in
our html5 series however in the HTML 3.2
specification some presentational tags
were added things like center or font
now while it was really nice to have
some control over the look of our web
sites it was such a headache to
make uniform changes even over a smalls
website imagine manually selecting every
link on a website and individually
tweaking the color to solve this problem
the w3c blessed us with CSS in HTML for
all of the formatting could be removed
from the HTML document and placed in a
separate style document called CSS
external style sheets enable you to
change the appearance and layout of
every web page on a website just by
editing one single next week we're going
to look at the different ways that CSS
can be written and we're going to talk
about the way it actually Cascades and
see that work thanks for watching guys

hi guys welcome to the section of the
video I call leaving in comments it's

that was a great entry here we go this
is from a video called CSS beginners and
Billy Scanlon asks did you make this
website or know the owner Billy I don't
know what you're talking about
just going to ask what is the best way
of showing photos on a website great
question that comes from listen listen
the best way to show a photo on a
website is to use an IMG tag in your
HTML like we already discussed weren't
you watching what's matter with you he
also asks where should I buy my domain
name listen buy your domain name on the
Internet it's the best place to get them
just looking for questions people
talking about their genitals Jedi pics X
asks where can I put a line center in a
link to a photo so that the link is
centered on my site
well Jedi pics X don't do that mmm
there's no such property as a line equal
center you may be thinking of text - a
line equal center but that's not even
CSS is it you don't equal anything CSS
hmm this is what you want bro
put that on the parent of the whatever
you're centering here's one written in
Russian I don't know what that's about
and the last one from burn wine son
