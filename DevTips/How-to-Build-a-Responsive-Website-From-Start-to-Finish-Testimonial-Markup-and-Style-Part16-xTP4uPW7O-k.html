feel like every episode I start like
this is that true ah so today is going
to be a really cool if so because today
we're starting on the clients section of
the artist theme and you know I'm going
through those those kind of emotions
when when you're starting a new project
or starting a new part of a project and
it's like a blank page you know going
through them experiencing that right now
and that's always intimidating for me
that's always maybe a little bit scary
but it's also thrilling right like
there's so many possibilities I'm not
kind of locked into any path or any
whatever so there's like a lot we could
do right now and there's a lot of
different ways we could take this so
that's really exciting anyhow I wanted
first before we get started I want to
thank everybody who's been submitting
pull requests for the last little bit
last week was just like just a bunch of
pull requests we did a few videos in one
week
all dealing with all pull requests that
you guys are doing with really awesome
things so thank you so much for that it
is like I kind of just for a minute say
how cool it is like how wonderful it
feels to have people like you guys who
are doing these contributions like care
enough about the the those videos about
the lessons about the community about
everybody who's walking who about
everybody else who's watching enough to
use their time talent and energy to make
this project a better thing for
everybody that's just
I'm just so impressed with the level of
skill the jays are bringing to the table
the level of like thinking and ingenuity
that you guys are using to solve
problems that you see and I'm just I'm
just I just feel really lucky and and
kind of like special I don't know just
anyway I'm just saying thank you
also I always want to say whoa this is
the 15th video but you who are watching
this video you are amazing you are
amazing just because you've watched 15
of these things when they're like an
hour long then maybe more some of them
so you're doing pretty good man
that's awesome I really appreciate your
viewership and we appreciate your
interactions you guys are in the
comments asking good questions and being
really supportive I mean everything I
don't know I hear lots of like hey good
job I like this video and and you may
think that that's just like a kind of a
thumbs up but like it really makes my
day and I'm not I'm not like begging for
it or anything right now I'm just I'm
just saying that I appreciate it and I
appreciate your guys viewership and your
engagements the way you guys help each
other in the comments and kind of find
solutions or or even you'll see me do
something or or offer up a solution of
my own and then in the comments you guys
we recommend an even better tool or a
better method or something like that
that's just so cool and I I just think
it's really great and I appreciate that
too so 15 videos let's keep it up anyway
shut up let's get started you know okay
this is me oh yeah all right so if you
would point your direction to my
computer screen here we are looking at
Trello remember Trello okay so we have
the showcase and gallery is done with
development and we've had so many cool
things come out of that lots of great
contributions and lots of great just
discussion come out of those few videos
next we're going to be going into the
testimonials the testimonial section is
a call it clients area but it's kind of
like a testimonials it's kind of like a
space where you can
allow you know a proof we call this what
social proof when you know when a
visitor is looking at your work and they
see other people that you've worked for
that are appreciative of the work that
you did for them or they'll like the
things that you've done and so that
social proof they'll feel the idea
behind this is that they will see other
people appreciating your work and feel
that it's okay to do it we'll give them
like a kind of like a social green light
you know to like think that this is good
work it will approve it gives them proof
that this is good work and also
encourages them to be a part of that
community of people who like your work
it's very like hand-wavy in terms of
like the psychology of what's going on
but the idea is that we're providing a
place not only for people to just talk
about how great you are but for for your
potential client and remember bringing
this all back into our original goals of
this being a sales piece for you for
your product or service this brings it
all back in that way in that it allows
the person who's viewing this website of
yours to say okay I can identify with
these real humans you know I can see
that this guy has two eyes and a nose
and a mouth just like I do and a brain
so he can decide if he likes this work
therefore he's one of my fellow humans
and he trusts your work therefore I have
Liberty to do so as well do you see that
kind of logic in there that's the
psychology behind a testimonial section
enough hand-waving
let's talk about what we're going to
need to do just scoot this down on here
and then jump over to the code now
remember our index page look how simple
it is that's because we're using these
includes now I'm going to jump over to
this include just paste another one of
them here and call it clients clients
clients yeah and then I'll jump over
here to the includes and create a new
file and I'll call that clients oh why
is it caps lock silly
dot html' and there we are
and in that client-side HTML I'm gonna
say hello hello hello blue low and if I
played all my cards right and my server
is working when I jump over the artists
theme and refresh scroll down there is
how hello and that is the new section
that we'll be building so hmm we're
going to have clients and then let's
make a space in our assets CSS section
new file clients got SAS and then in our
sections directory just duplicate this
line and say clients and that's kind of
it so our clients I just want to make
sure this is working some as a body if
not class of body just body back ground
pink and if that's working right this
background here should be pink when i
refresh errors okay and error is found
conversion error file not found clients
Oh see I misspelled it CLI that's right
in my directory i misspelled it I'm glad
that I test these things out like baby
steps yeah there you are you you're pink
now that means that you work and you can
be done boom why do I always use the
color pink to test stuff I don't know
know what that means about me up hang
out with my daughter a lot she let her
favorite colors pink she also likes
purple but not as much as a pink duh
hello let me take a peek at our work
section to see how we did this actually
let me take a peek at our About section
so we did here this is what we want is
what I'm looking for how do I kind of
start
this page so we have a section and then
an h3 it's not called idea about me it's
called clients yeah I think with our
design say clients yeah okay and looking
good all right already who
okay now let's dissect this here
actually remember what we do I feel like
it's been so long since we've done this
the process for generating the markup of
something like this is that I use HTML
to describe what's going on inside that
like what's going on visually I describe
it with HTML I've talked about that
before but I want to let you let that
soak in really what's happening I'm
going to look at this image this picture
and I'm going to and I'm going to think
about the way that the boxes work
together the way things are floated next
to each other the way that you know you
can kind of how one click affects
another and what I expect to happen okay
so the first thing I see here is a very
long box and that's going to be called
the that's a div called the clients
class equals there you go clients belt
that's going to be because this is going
to be a sort of am what's it called up
what's it called I'd forget the word
what's this word called guys this is a
sign language for belt carousel carousel
is what we're looking for so and each of
these things clients belt hmm
now below the clients belt I'll have a
section for the icons so I'll call it
clients logos because the the controls
are going to be logos and do class
client client logo so the difference
between this and the parent is that
these are singular while the parent is
plural okay
client logo client logo clan logo I got
four of them in the clients belt I have
a div class I have these sections that
are going to be moving around and I'm
going to call it client unit I call I
usually name things units that are kind
of like these repeating items and so
this section where it's going to be like
a template you know we call that a unit
so this this client unit is going to be
a repeating item within the belt and
it's going to be consisting of two parts
one is going to be called div class
client
face I don't think that's a good name
for it it'll probably change and then
give the class client e ent client
content like what they say right now in
here I'm going to put basically grab my
text I'm just going to put this stuff in
here and then the face I'm going to have
a few things have a image
and I do have the image but I'll have it
ready right now and then the other one
is I'm going to say mmm mmm strong but
I'm going to call it class client ie NT
client mmm
name and his name is Scott Summers 10
points for anybody who knows who Scott
Summers is no googling don't google it
you just have to know it 10 points 10
gift 2 points not redeemable for any
real value and these I'll put in em and
I'll call this client title and his is
director design québec International
paste that okay that looks pretty good
uh I think that's kind of it oh we have
these guys here what a day like little
controls like next in previous controls
here's how we'll do that
uh I want this on the the outside of
client unit I want them on the outside
of the belt too I think
yes yes and hold them in the section and
outside of the belt and I'll call these
little guys here um div class class um
client controls and there's going to be
two of them next in previous
client control control next and prove
because it's going to have to be a you
have to be able to like control the
carousel right um
this looks like pretty strong markup we
need to say that one of these is the
active one
so client logo I'll say active client
and then that's the one it would be on
and then yeah okay so let's talk about
assets I have prepared some faces I have
prepared some SVG documents here left
right and quote and I've prepared some
logos and I've made them all black and
white so that I don't that's not
important necessarily for your design if
you guys are using this for your own
work but I have made them black and
white now let's look at how we're going
to where we're going to put these in our
project and how we're going to kind of
use them in the display alright so the
first thing I want to do is in my assets
images I have all these work sections
and I want to kind of mimic that
structure for the client so new file or
trying to folder call it clients and
then in there I'm just going to actually
just going to throw it over his face in
one actually all these things are just
going to go in there aren't they
everything except for the SVG's
yeah you are okay these are real people
I got these faces from I think I got
them from this really fun website called
UI faces calm this is a really awesome
place to get faces if you're like
designing user interfaces you can just
go and grab a bunch of faces from here
and these are like people who have given
permission and you can add you can
submit your own face to UI face is calm
anyway that's a nice place to be
mm-hmm okay so we have all these faces
they have these logos and let's put some
faces in here so this would be source
assets image clients face - a-a-are Oh n
I our own a heron a dot jpg refresh ah
Scott Somers director Oh brilliant
oh it's almost perfectly done it's
already almost done already wouldn't
have to do any work and I'm just kidding
that's not very funny I'll probably at
that joke help maybe not I'm going to
delay on the quotes and the what's it
called the next in previous buttons for
now and I'm going to structure I'm going
to do this the layout and style for this
what's it called this unit right a
client unit so let's jump into our say s
and talk about how we're going to do
this client unit hmm okay so the first
thing to concern yourself is the client
belt I have a little plugin for espresso
called stylus it's funny like the the
language like the tit like text
highlighting for stylus or for sass I
couldn't find a good one but ironically
the one
for stylist which is a competitor of
sass works just great
espresso it was one of those editors and
I see like I hear like a lot of you guys
talking about how you're using espresso
and I think that's possibly because I
recommend it I think I'm the only person
that I know that uses espresso um
professionally like everybody I work
with doesn't there they wouldn't spend
the time with it they don't like it but
I like it a lot I like it because it's
comfy like for me it like makes sense it
feels like much more design oriented
which is my background I'm a designer
first and then a developer second so it
feels geerdon oriented towards someone
like me but you know feel free to use
anything you want sublime text is a huge
one maybe some other time I'll do like a
video about text editors and like a
roundup or something I think that'd be
kind of nice but in the meantime I use I
use espresso and to get SAS looking good
I have to use a stylist plug-in called
espressos plugins are all called sugars
so IDs stylist sugar what was I saying
again
oh yes clients but border clients bra
belt belt is that right client clients
belt ok PluralEyes good and then this
one is called client unit is that right
ah backspace client unit ok I want
clients belt to actually be as wide no I
want it to be 100% wide width what the
heck is that whit whit the live width
100% ok if on your mind I was going to
give you some excuses for why I'm typing
like an idiot but the truth is I kind of
always do that so there's no excuses
with is 100% I want it to span the whole
width of the browser similar to what we
did in the work section because I'm
going to be sliding things in and out of
it and I need to have like a framework
to - hold on - right like when I'm
sliding I needs to be in relation to
what and that's going to be this client
belt so therefore I'm going to call it
position:relative that way it's the
children of it will be positioned
relative to it so client unit is an
example of one of those things I do I
want to do this max with let's I don't
know the max width is um goodness what
is it right here
we'll go fly let's say this to this
when is it inches goodness pixels I want
pixels dang it uh I was at 700 okay max
will be 700 pixels hmm margin will be 0
Auto well 0 Auto 50 okay that's looking
pretty good it inside the client unit I
want my next to you know HTML elements
to kind of line up I could do one of two
things I could float them left or I
could use flexbox I think I'm going to
use flexbox here because it makes it so
much easier flexbox and the way I do
that is I use I go to the parent of
those two units which is the client unit
were apparent are those two elements
which is client unit that we're looking
at right now and I'm going to say plus
and display let me use the look what's
it called the bourbon mixin call display
and say flex this play is that right
yeah okay see what happened here they're
aligned
nice and neat Oh what client content and
client face okay so they're actually not
overlapping but my clients face is too
big for the box that I put them in so we
need to control the width of this one or
both of them really and how we do that
is we say well let's what it what are
they called here client face and client
content client face client con client
content client content needs to be I'm
pretty upset with them so here client
face we need to put a min width minimum
with the I'm in width of let's say like
300 and this should give us a little bit
more breathing room cool yes that's good
so inside client face I want to UM
text-align:center and I want to make
these all these things if I if I go into
that strong like which is actually
things called client name that write
client name so if I go in here and make
this one a block element these two will
just basically be shoved outside of the
kind of because there's three in a row
and I take the middle one and make it a
block yellow two will be shoved up above
and below it so I may not need to
directly make the other ones block so
let's try that name display
block there we go
and then they're centered looks good man
I'm into it cool so we want to get that
face client face image
I guess what was callin client face
image and we want to make it round so
right now it's 128 so I'll say max width
is 128 pixels and border radius is 50%
I'm concerned right now for you know if
this is smaller should I make it smaller
Oh 800 not 128 100 yeah okay and then I
want to go into this right here which
was called plant text I think is called
client content paragraph client content
font size 16 pixels so 16 or 18 take a
check here
18 pixels and what's the line height
here 36 18 line height 36 right pixels
font weight 300 oh yeah that's good
that's good looking good um this first
line I wanted to get it inside of a
strong so let's try to okay and other
than that I just need to put these these
quotations above and below it but other
than that looks pretty good I think the
paragraph should be a little bit whiter
huh maybe I can make it max width of 750
there we go that's a little bit nicer
it's almost perfect actually now it
looks like there's some kind of
something going on with the the lines
here
yeah and right here I wanted the like
the line to that what I'm doing the
circle a little bit tighter here so what
can I do to do that I could tighten up
this client content a little bit I could
just move it up a little bit a little
bit so client content margin top
negative 10 pixels
yeah that looks a little bit more like
what I'm going for
okay um I like that a lot let's take a
look at these names make sure I get the
name wrong or a name right so a client
name you're going to be display:block
you're going to be a text transform
uppercase breathe and this one is going
to be a on weight the ID aged a weight
600 no it's math it's going to be 400
and letter-spacing
one pixel spread it out a little bit see
we got oh looks really good
okay and then for the what is this
called title client title client title
you are going to be a font-style:normal
and you're going to be font size like
ten pixels right
12 font size 12 pixels let's see what we
got there looks pretty good color of is
it nine nine nine yeah alright um I
really like the way that looks
that's what a lark stance okay cool
now the next section to do is to move on
down to these logos and I called them
clients logo I really it really should
be client logos but everything else is
Internet clients clients logo clients
logos to plurals I don't know okay and
they are inside the belt and they're not
side the belt here's the belt and here's
the logo so it's a sibling of the belt
which means I go all the way to the root
of this document clients logos is that
bad English I think it's bad English
poor English I think I think it's poor
English and then inside that is a client
logo okay so first we're gonna make this
position relative and with it is going
to be similar to what's it called up
there the client unit in that or side of
the aisle the width is going to be 100%
okay and now we can take these client
logos and spread them across so actually
here we're going to say display flex
and get these guys running across as
well and move this up so you can see it
better client logo you are interesting
character you are going to have a
there's for you um okay you're going to
have a height of what is that like
140/80 or can't count right now a height
of 80 and um I'm not going to mess Y am
in width of what in width of 200 am in
width min width of 200 Turner pixels and
your background your background a image
is going to be your L assets image
clients what is it going to be clients
logo one-upping and your size is going
to be contained and your position is
going to be Center Center and your
repeat is going to be no-repeat
let's see we got Boop
oh okay looks pretty good except for you
need to be what is it called justify
text justify a line items line well this
is going to be max oh here this needs to
be max width and it needs to be wet like
700 750 or would you say the other one
so we have 750 and then margin of 0 Auto
and 100 pixels display flex and then
align items line
- items is it a line items Center and
justify content just to adjust to a by
content center line items is spaced
around okay let's see if I got all that
stuff right maybe I did
let's check it let's W Debbie check
right here aligned items display box box
a line yep box pack Center just to my
content huh I can't believe I got it
right so hard for me to remember these
things I think space between though no I
let space around okay I want space
around because when the because when
it's time for the browser to get small I
don't want I don't want it to like crush
in on the sides and touch the sides I
want it to be like you know equal dis
equidistant kind of space around it and
then then the collapse I don't want it
to be conflicting and kind of like cause
it little impacts everywhere so we're
going to keep it there and now these
icons as you can see well first of all
they need to be what does it called your
cursor it is to be a pointer when we
refer to that that is a hovering cursor
and then we're going to say um and was
it active client say and active client
now remember an ampersand in sass is a
placeholder that means everything that
came before it so we're going to say if
it's
client logos if instance if it's a
client logo inside of client logos and
it also has a class of active client
then we're going to say make a box
shadow of um I think it's like what four
pixels zero pixels or say either way
around I always get this confused which
ones X&amp;amp;Y this one's X or at least it
should be in my opinion so we're going
to go with that zero pixels for the for
the blur and zero pixels for the spread
we're going to put that just blur spine
and then the color is going to be accent
is it just X centers accent color oh
there it is yeah
so that's fine cool um want to put some
margin on these guys margin me zero ten
pixels get some space some breathing
room yeah you guys don't wanna breathe
margins Oh goof I didn't put the colon
okay there we go a little bit more
breathing room let's make it a little
bit more as well
yeah 20 all right 20 pixels breathing
room on these guys and that looks pretty
good let's take a look-see here step
back and look at it
clients here's the arrangement of the
clients this looks pretty good I want to
say okay I'm thinking about right now
I'm thinking about the this guy right
here these pull quotes and I want to
have it reflect the color of the accent
but at the same time it'd be easier to
use it as a background color but I don't
think that you can control the SPG's
color if it's a background color it
needs to be inserted into the Dom well
that's fine I can do that right right
here right here
plant content yeah that's fine I'm going
to insert that into the Dom and we'll
say div class a client quote mark and
inside that I'll make a what is it must
- % % include and I don't have it set up
yet but it's going to be include icons
slash quote quote mark dot HTML Jekyll
should be really sad right now that I
said that let's go make that includes
quote more icons yes icon - quote - mark
okay new file icon - - quote - mark
dot html' cool and then uh here in my
thing thing I'm going to open this up in
HTML not so bad
grab it paste get rid of this view box
and I don't want to have a fill color on
it and it doesn't look like a do okay
that should be good
let's see what happened there yeah
that's exactly right
okay um now what I'm going to do what is
it I call that I called it client quote
mark logos oh it's going to be right
here client quote mark okay I want it to
be first of all what is it called
position absolute position absolute
position T i/o in absolute and then I
want it to be top zero pixels right no
bottom null left zero pixels the height
and width of it let's make it a box so
say size is going to be a 50 say 60 60
pixels let's see we got okay okay okay
that just means that client content
needs to be
relative planet content position
relative relative refresh okay good
you get that back it's going to be okay
and then you see how it's sitting up
there on top I needed to get behind
everything yeah some do a little bit a
little bit of Z and Dixie Z - index 0
and if that doesn't work I'm thinking
negative one wheel negative 1 refresh
okay see now it's behind the text that's
good now let's do a stroke no it's path
path is going to be fill uh accent no no
Y Drive any sass errors was this error I
have a problem there was an error
illegal nesting this is too many one
yeah
illegal nesting oh no there we go that's
better
refresh okay that's the color and I want
to knock the opacity down quite a bit is
going to 0.3 that's good now I see that
I want the like I want it to going to
stick up and out going to be negative 20
pixels from the top
yep and negative 10 from the left yeah
yeah that's pretty good
negative 15 yeah I like that
maybe negative 18 right here
so I'm going to stick below that
baseline a little bit okay cool
I think I'm happy with that the way that
looks how much time do we got okay we
have a little bit more time let's get
these
let's get these whatever these things
are called in there so clients controls
next in previous so icon so let's do
these again a new folder a new file icon
next dot HTML and I grab this next arrow
and icon new file icon preview dot HTML
you could call these you know what I
call them arrows as well right arrow and
left arrow that's probably more
descriptive but in the end it doesn't
really matter we are our own customer
for these little choices all right okay
so year forty forty view box o preview
icon next in icon previous are ready to
go let's stick them in their places
next goes here previous goes here icon
next I just had a flashback to my
childhood we want to like a like a
cactus place on a field trip it's weird
next previous where my codes go here we
are refresh whoa these things are he his
things are huge
go back into this next piece get rid of
that view box
don't want it want it save and save and
then from a shy ass Oh what are these
things called again well these things
are called client controls client
controls neck line controls talk client
control client controls and then div
right that's this is going to be both of
them I want to I want to make the size
40 pixels and position position is a
tion position absolute for the parent so
that it was not it's going to be taken
out of the flow of the Dom that's what
we won't want everything to kind of
collapse on top of these things and
hopefully that should make everything go
back to where they would and our things
are sized
back to normal that's great so since now
let me also show you that the parent
here of client controls indeed what is
the width of it client controls 40 to 80
okay so I need the width of clinic
controls to be 100% okay now I can say
that with 40 I can call them out
individually until the mark go oops
plant control Priven clan control next
all right
so client control next you're going to
go position:absolute top to this here
let's do this - sighs where's that plus
sign here it is sighs and if that's true
this is going to be broken I want to go
won't it be 50% from the top next
so 0% 0/6 or let's say 25th so 10 pixels
10 pixels from the right null from the
bottom end all from the left and let's
make the same thing true of client
control brief breathe except for null
from the right and all from the left and
then they'll from the bottom and then 10
pixels from the left ok let's see we got
here ok so now let me show you how that
happened and why those just jump down
that far
oh I put client controls at a hundred
percent of the height which for some
reason is turning out to be wonder why
it's so low
hmm Museum out here for a little bit
oh you know it's okay I think I
understand
hmm I don't but here okay so a better
way of doing this instead of saying that
your position is absolute your size is
100% let's say client controls what's
the parent of client controls actually a
section okay
section what class we had to do this for
work section what did we call it section
work section clients okay so we go all
the way up and say section clients you
are a position:relative I'll turn off in
this grill and get excited a
position:relative and what oh let's try
that there we go
so reverse there right oh okay we took
the size off of client controls here's
what I wanted to do make this a mix in
so I can kind of do it all at once
position:absolute and then for these
guys I'm just do one pixel all the way
around so it kind of like hugs its
parent all the way around everywhere so
see what happen let me explain the
client controls are what are set to the
top right left and bottom if that makes
sense whatever they're all one right so
they're right on the edges and the
unit's inside are set to 50% from the
top but 40 they're 40 tall so I want to
say margin-top negative 20 to pull them
back up so there it should be like like
this is the screen here and my controls
wrap what is it called controls are zero
zero zero I'm going to take it a 50%
from the top coming here and then my
icon should be like hanging down from
50% and then I take a negative margin of
half of the height to bring it up to
that there so it's like exactly in the
middle
now that should work no matter like
where this is see how they're coming in
like that and then next time when we
come back and do more work we'll we'll
catch those with media queries and kind
of adjust how that's working but I think
this looks pretty good for a framework
for what the content that we're going to
enter and also creating the interactions
for it so in the next video we'll be
doing just that will be finding places
to get this content and make it kind of
repeatable and kind of making the
interaction happen left and right and
clicking on these these logos I hope
that you enjoyed this great episode of
dev tips I'm pretty happy with it so far
and I'm excited I'm really excited to
continue on with this series I hope that
you guys are enjoying it as much as I am
the way that you guys are watching these
these episodes is very interesting to me
