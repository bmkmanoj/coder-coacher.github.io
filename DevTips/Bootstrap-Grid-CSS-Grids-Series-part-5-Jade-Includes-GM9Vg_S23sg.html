now let's focus on this column here now
this is this this uh this Jade file here
is getting a bit long getting a bit
nasty we're already like six nests in
what I want to do is do an include this
is really exciting so I'm going to go to
a new file and I'm gonna say I'm gonna
say column - main dot Jade and make sure
code KITT knows about that column me
okay and then I'll write simply include
column - main and that looks good column
- main is note the output file for
column - main according to code KITT is
no direct output imported by other files
that is exactly what we wanted and while
we're at it let's just make a few others
here new file called - secondary and dot
Jade and include
call that main and then we're going to
do another one just going to secondary
and then the third one will be tertiary
tertiary amines third third of a series
let's see new file call - tertiary I did
spell it right by the way that was
exciting for me okay
and inside of call - main I'm going to
put this this heading so say the call -
main a dot mains a new thing and I'll
put this heading here now you see how
that showed up just like we thought it
would because this file is now being
imported simply into index Jade which is
right here now look how easy that was is
just include and then main I was using a
similar pre-compiled markup language
called slim I was using that with a
project and the crap you had to write to
get an include done was pretty pretty
severe I'm really excited that it's just
include and then the name you don't even
have to write Jade although you could
but you don't have to and that's what's
fun like not doing stuff I don't have to
that's what I like doing that's why I do
computer stiff and not actual work that
real humans do sorry real humans
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
