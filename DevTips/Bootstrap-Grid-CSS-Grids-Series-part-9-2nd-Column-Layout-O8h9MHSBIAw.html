our we need some rules going on the left
and the right of this middle column so
I'm gonna jump back in to the index dot
no what am i mixing but I'm gonna go to
index dot Jade where our columns are
living and I'm going to identify this
one as call secondary all right and then
I'm gonna go over to that Styles SAS
document that I created before and I'll
say call - secondary border one pixel
solid and the color EE and then also I
want border-top:none and border bottom
no okay now what happened here you see
that the width this is good this is what
I wanted the other one was too tight
because it was inside of the actual
column it was inside of the actual grid
and I wanted to use the grid to make
make the rules not be and squished
inside of it so now I have padding
inside of it and on the outside this is
good this is what I wanted but it's only
gonna be as long as the content of this
column which I think I'm okay with let's
go back to that secondary column and see
what's next for us oh another thing is
this article is gonna get a gray
background
so I'm gonna go back into my sass and
say I call them secondary BG - gray and
background it's gonna be like f + 5 f5
f5 and let's change these borders to CCC
a little stronger the background okay
but this background gray also because
now I'm putting a background in it it
needs to pad itself out too so padding
10 pixels is that true
you true that'll do it
but we don't want padding on the top 10
pixels it's just too much padding on the
top so it's gonna be 0 10 10 yeah yep
good like a glows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
