section with real live content and we're
going to make the content switch out
depending on what thumbnail you click
when it slides in and that you'd
remember the sliding bit from last week
that's what we're doing today
content inin so we're going to be using
a technique called Ajax Ajax stands for
asynchronous JavaScript and XML it will
allow us to dynamically change out the
content the page without refreshing the
browser which gives us that really quick
and modern feel now when I was learning
JavaScript years ago Ajax was always
that weird and scary thing that never
made much sense to me but I'm sure that
you will like how simple this is going
to be and before we start once again I
like to give my big shout out and thanks
to the artists who have given their
permission to use their work in the
portfolio as placeholders in this theme
and on these videos links to their
respective projects are in the video
description here and on the project
readme file on github.com let's get
ready to back
I have here a folder full of images that
we'll be using in our portfolio some of
them are longer images using the whole
image for the one post and some of them
are a folder full of smaller images that
together create the entire project so
right now we have to get this content
into our folder structure in our project
the first one we're doing is typo
international design talks and that one
was done by Mikhail Beutel and he has a
series of JPEGs here and he also has a
little bit of text that we can put into
the project so when we go to the project
we'll go into the assets images and find
work and project one it should already
have the thumbnail there we're going to
put images 1 through 5 into the project
1 subfolder alright and then I'm going
to create a new directory a new folder
and I'm gonna call it word and inside
there
I'm going to create a new file and I'll
call it work - 1 dot HTML ok now in this
HTML file I'm just going to quickly
create the content that I want to show
up in the project I have a paragraph
from his project from Behance and also I
have a few images that I can put in
there the source remember again the path
is going to be assets image works
section project - 1 and then the images
or image 1 through image 5 so it's going
to be IMG one dot jpg ok um so I'm V T
all right now I'll just there's what
four or five of these things
two two three four five and two three
four five okay
I think that we want to put this one
above the paragraph so now that we have
the work document set up that we want to
have for this type of international
design talk thumbnail click it in - we
want to see that content there okay
that's going to be in this include in
the work section and that's right here
find that work container and then the
work return is the little back button
and then there's our headline so right
under that for the actual content will
say div class project load this is where
we're going to load our our projects and
these can actually just get rid of these
and it will close that dip off alright
and then h4 will give this a class of
project title ok mmm that looks about
right okay let's go over to our
JavaScript now we're going to be writing
some more JavaScript this week okay so
the last thing we did was write this
work belt and that's how you get back
and forth between the work section and
the thumbnails right now we're going to
create the JavaScript that's going to
allow us to dynamically load in the
projects so for example the first one we
made was work - one dot HTML and this is
how we'll do it say we'll say let's
close this function work load and then
we'll create a new function down here
function work load all right so now
before we start bringing in content we
want to tell the browser that we want to
cache the content and I'll tell you why
in just a few seconds after I show you
how to do it so we want to say Ajax a
set up forget these come do it a lot
nope yep
and then we write cash false yeah that
looks good okay so what that does is it
tells the browser to actually want cash
true okay so if we were bringing in a
really really random things like random
blog posts or random products on your
you know your e-commerce site we would
not cache it because we don't want to
load up our cache with random things
that are just really going to see one
once upon a time but but these projects
there's only eight options and they
don't change you know you're not adding
comments to it or you know you're not
they're they're just going to be kind of
the same every time you want to see them
so it's okay to cache it'll make a
little faster when you're going back and
forth between them especially for
somebody who's seen it already so cache
we're going to turn that on right now
this click here let's say same thing no
thumb unit dot click all right now
here's the magic we need a we need to
set up a few variables the first one is
going to be called a spinner and this
will be the spinner the little graphic
image you'll see before any of the HTML
comes in from our work project let me
show you where to get that I'll just
Google a single single element CSS
spinner this one here was good I like
these dots these are fun so I'll view
source and grab that right there and
that's it that's the all the HTML that I
need because it's a single element
spinner but I do need to create the CSS
to allow that spinner to animate and to
look good right there so go into our
sass and our tool because it's not
something I'm writing it's like a vendor
new file spinner and I'll say SCSS so I
don't have to worry about the brackets
and stuff it is giving me a vanilla CSS
so I can put in a CSS file it'll be just
fine
save and I'll put that in the tools
directory spinner okay that should take
care of that if it does a problem we'll
go back to it I think that's fine all
right we have a spinner variable and now
we need to choose the document that is
going to be loaded in so this will be
called a new HTML I guess and equals and
we will just want to point this to the
path of this should be a single quote
and this will be a single quote - okay
the reason I did singles is because
these are going to be doubles here in
the class so anyhow new HTML is going to
be the new path that's going to be
injected in right now we only have one
and it's path is going to be slash work
slash work - one dot HTML yeah I think
that works
and now we'll write the really small
code that will actually load in that us
that's HTML snippet that's inside of
work one and that that looks like this
dollar sign jQuery and we want to call
identify that the section we want to do
the project load okay
project load and then we'll say load the
new HTML simple as that really really
easy Oh before we load it in we want to
quickly inject that spinner and then
after that spinner is there and then
after the H the new HTML is ready to
load
it'll just overwrite the spinner because
it comes later in the function and it it
overwrites whatever the HTML is there so
let me show you how that well where I
think this is it is that it so the click
happens load the variables variable in
ver to which I'm project load yeah I
think this should be good
let's check it out and refresh click oh
look at that
it worked kind of the URL so these
images is not working let's go check out
our HTML why why not guys assets image
work project OSF proj that's what's up
Prague was all right let's try that oh
come on guys
for some reason it's not oh because it's
cached ha ha is that it i think i HX
cache to myself into a bad spot let's
try it now excite opened the the dev
tools and when you have these dev tools
open you can turn caching off on the dev
tools open so ah there we are
that was it okay so that was pretty
funny uh caching so this guy here I'd
neglected to change that top one here so
proj okay Raj one there we go ok so that
looks pretty good huh cool let's do
number two um what is that going to be
that's going to be called city in
website and I have this one right here
so I'm going to go to proj to put this
city in website and copy that
I'm going to make a new file in work
call work - - dot HTML you guys can name
these whatever you like but this this
naming structure you'll see in a few
seconds that it's intentional
what is the path am assets work proj -
two - this and this is called city in
alright and this is like all the whole
HTML should be and because it's only
they're going to be one of those with
one long images but if you have in your
project a lot of images or even
paragraphs whatever just put them in
there in fact I want to wrap this in a
paragraph I don't know I didn't do that
earlier okay let's test it out typo
International Design talks we're going
to click and yeah
it's just exactly what I wanted let's
try another one of these even though I
know we don't have the information
yeah there so I thought so because here
in the code we've hardwired the URL to
always be here work one the output
you know project will always be work one
but I can in the meantime change this
headline if I go back to that code I can
I want to cash my this and I'm not going
to tell you much more about it other
than to say that this is probably a good
idea every time you want to use and
reuse the object of this you want to
cache it like that so you're not dipping
back into the into the pool there this
represents the thing you've clicked so
in this case it's going to be some unit
so I want to say oh yes this oh the new
variable is going to be called by the
way it's going to be called new title
total title and it looks like this this
dot find let me look at that markup I
think it's strong yeah strong
MN t ext so I'm going to find the text
that's in the strong tag and I'm going
to say that's a variable of new title
and then I want to load in project title
that's going to be that H for right here
right where are you oh right here a
product title H for right project title
of text and then in there I can say new
title if I'm right about this
it should say typo international design
talks and then it should say crispy
icons ah and it will happen crispy what
the heck am i caching myself at again
went from this cache off
disable cache am I just doing this wrong
or did I have a failure refresh all
right what happened new title oh is
lowercase capital buddy has to be exact
refresh all right there we go so the
title changes right here is you flat
mobile flat mobile UI UX concept great
okay that's exactly what we wanted back
in our functions file we've hard-coded
this HTML path into it and I need to get
this needs to be - if this wants to work
so when we look at our work a loop we
can see this this variable projects
folder is what's changing the thumbnail
so let's stash that um data folder
equals that now when i refresh you
should see each of these guys right here
having a property called data data -
folder with the project number on it all
right now we can dip into that and use
that to identify which HTML page we
should be using as it will correlate so
project 1 actually change this from work
1 to proj 1 just be a little bit easier
that way ouch - and then back in my
functions file all again will say new
folder I guess yeah this dot data folder
so that will come out as did you do we
want to take new folder see that so this
this variable is going to pull out that
information which in the in the case of
clicking the second icon
this new folder variable will spit out
or print out the text proj - - which is
what I want to be here so I'm going to
close these quotes do some addition and
kind of like add in my variable right
there okay cool so refresh I'm going to
click on number two and hopefully my
city in website will be the you know the
populated in my project good good and
the title great great okay I'll do
number three with you guys one more time
and then I'm just going to quickly go
and do these all my on my own so a
number let me create a new file here
prog juh - 3 dot HTML all right and
number three is going to be crispy icons
so find crispy icons take them over to
project 3 images and dump that in there
Prante it's an image uh that's in slash
assets images what's this next one
called oh yeah work slash proj three
slash that and it's called crispy icons
super awesome okay now I'm just going to
speed up the camera and run through the
other the other five of these things
here all right as a review we've got all
of these HTML pages kind of populated
with their respective content and that
can be as you know many images it can be
images and paragraphs you can put titles
in there you can embed videos in here
you can do whatever you like
I got projects one through two or sorry
one through eight filled out with their
respective content I'm using the assets
still to maintain the assets here and
I'm using this jQuery function to pull
in the the specific project dynamically
depending on what thumbnail you click on
and that is how we populate the works
section it's pretty good looks pretty
good
I'm really happy with this
okay that concludes the work section and
the artist theme thing that we're doing
next week I have a super super super
special video plan for you guys so I
really hope you tune in for that and
then the week after that we're going to
be in the next section of the artist
theme which is the client section or the
testimonial section and that is going to
be super fun awesome so please tune in
for that also I will see you then keep
on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
