thing we want to look at is an attribute
method an attribute is anything in HTML
like a class or a source or a name or an
href right those things that are inside
of HTML tags the attribute method in
jQuery can set attributes but also
retrieve them so for example we're
focusing on the first paragraph here
let's say attribute and let's ask it
what the class is so let's put that in
an alert so we can see it and when I hit
save
an alert should pop up and let me know
the class there it is lead remember the
first paragraph is lead okay so now
instead of asking what the class is
let's set the class and you put a comma
after the first thing and then let's
just say not lead and then let's take
off the alert here and now we set this
first paragraph to not lead let's
inspect that and the class here you can
see is not lead and this can be super
powerful for example this image that I
have right here I can use the attribute
method of jQuery to swap out the source
attribute in the HTML so I'll do a adder
right here and then inside of that I'll
say take that source attribute and
change it from image 1 to image to jpg
and when I save it the image will
literally change because the source is
being changed to the second image in the
series that I have here now remember the
animations that we did in the last
episode what if we took this image here
ended a fade out and then inside of the
fade out we'll say it'll take 500
milliseconds to fade out and then after
that we can write another anonymous
function and then inside of that we'll
take this which is if you write this in
parentheses you're talking about
whatever the function is called on in
jQuery and then let's call that the
script that we just wrote up there where
we're changing the source and then
chained another method onto it let's do
that fade in and let's make the fade in
last 500 milliseconds okay so we're
going to fade out change the source and
fade it in
you see it it happened pretty fast let's
put a delay right in the beginning of
like you know 500 so that we can there
you go and just that easily we have this
really attractive animation where we're
swapping out images
awesome right and it's just ever one
image tag we're just swapping out the
source that's pretty crazy now let's
talk about the class methods in jQuery
if you're good with CSS this can be one
of the most powerful things in jQuery
because it can work well with CSS to
manipulate how the page looks in its
structure first of all I want to show
you the jQuery can actually ask things
if it has a class so for example I'm
focusing on the last paragraph and I'm
going to say hey do you has class let's
call it class of lead right and let's
just throw this an alert so we can see
it and then when an alert pops up it'll
tell us false this last paragraph does
not have a class of lead okay let's ask
if the first one does it's true it's
true it does have a class of lead this
is a really great tool to use if you're
walking through the DOM and doing
conditionals like if it has a class then
make it blue or something like that in
fact let's take the class blue as an
example in say the first one not has a
class but add we want to add the class
to it as a blue and you can even let me
say remove class of lead because we know
that the first one has the class of lead
let's remove it and now it's not bold or
big so we remove the lead why don't we
go to all of the paragraphs here not
just the first and and toggle now toggle
will say if it is then turn it off if
it's not then turn it on right so where
the last paragraph was the only one that
had the class of blue now the other
three do let me turn this off you can
see that normally just the bottom one
does and now I'm turning it on and I'm
just toggling that so this is a great
way to do drop-down menus or tabs or
anything where you need to switch the
state just throw a toggle on it and the
last type of methods that I want to show
you in this episode are called content
methods these are methods that jQuery
uses to look at the content of the
things for example what is in a
paragraph tag so let's take a look at
that let's look at that first paragraph
tag and let's change the text of it
using the text method we'll say hey
you guys and when we save it the content
where it says before they sold out now
it will change to hey you guys this is
exciting right you can use the text
method to set text like we just did or
just even retrieve it and like stash it
in a variable or something
let's change or let's use an alert here
to take a look at what is the content of
that first paragraph so our alert pops
up it actually tells us before sold out
blah blah blah this is just nonsense
text but the point is that I'm pulling
that paragraph out and I can do things
with it once I have it so that so text
is the way that you pull text out of out
of an element now an interesting thing
to note about text is that we talked
earlier about how you can use the method
text to insert copy into a dom node here
let's say a hey there buddy
let's say that we want to wrap this last
word in a tag when we do that using text
it will all be interpreted as text and
you can see the HTML tags showing up in
text so if you want it to be interpreted
as actual HTML you have to write use the
HTML method and now that word buddy will
be italicized if you wrap an M around it
inside of the method okay just one more
content method I want to look at this
form element down below here a random
input let's select the input and ask it
for its value now again let's put this
in alert so we can actually see it but
when the alert comes back it will it'll
take the value out of that text field
and say and give it to us and you can
again imagine all the useful things you
can do by storing content storing user
input or whatever you can also not only
just like gather the information you can
set it and now that input says yo dude
and yo dude that's the end of this video
thanks for watching this video it was so
much fun to make and if you like making
cool things as much as I do be sure to
check out the rest of this series and
after that take your JavaScript skills
to the next level and check out my
killing it with jQuery course
now these are some courses that I'm
currently developing so when you go to
killing it with jQuery com
you can sign up to be informed about
updates as I go along little snacks of
value and bonuses that I'll be sending
to everybody as I gear up for the
release later this year and if you're
watching this now later after the course
has already been released will go to
killing it with j.crew comm and start
killing it with jQuery right link is
definitely in the description below
thank you so much for watching
oh my goodness sign up I'll see you next
video
and keep on hacking okay okay okay
killing it killing it with jQuery
killing it with jQuery killing it with
jQuery killing it with jQuery killing it
with J query no how do you say this how
do you say killing it with jQuery
without sounding stupid killing it with
jQuery killing it with jQuery killing it
turn jQuery top oh that was a mess geez
alright a knife or a gun killing it with
jQuery
killing it with jQuery yo killing it
with jQuery is up your artistic killing
it with jQuery Oh killing it killing it
killing it with jQuery killing it with
jQuery that's that's the winner that's
the winner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
