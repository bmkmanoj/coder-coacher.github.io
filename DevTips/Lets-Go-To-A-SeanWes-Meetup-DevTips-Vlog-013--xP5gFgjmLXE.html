value is yeah totally it's like what's
the thing that I can provide other
people that they're gonna be really
happy excited about that I can provide
consistently and with consistent quality
and so I'm I'm taking a stock and trying
to figure out what is it's kind of
mysterious but being surrounded by
people that have that same goal is
helping you out definitely is and and
all those podcasts about like kind of
like getting out of your comfort zone
and going to meetups like this I'm very
private quiet right right yeah just just

really good friends from like sorry to
interrupt now yeah I was gonna see you
again man
best of luck in season relieving buddy I
know you're over here we're on the other
side of the room
I upgraded let me say something well on
the top of my car uh-huh
drove several minutes in the microphone
it's not connected and so drove back
like 10-15 years looking down Jimmy here
tried to do that
drove around I'm looking around I see it
on the road pretty sure it got run over
this is the damage right here so it's
like it's got a little bit of a scuff
right there timely but iPhone 6s plus
can't say enough good things about him
where's Lois
got to go got to go
take it easy man everyone see everyone
that was fun
doh alright we just got done with the
Shawn West meetup that was a lot of fun
but now we're gonna do a few questions
before we end the vlog and Lois is gonna
be helping yeah I want your face this is
part so this question comes from Jacob
Varner he says that he's in school right
now and wants to know should he just
kind of like be in school and learn as
much as he can or shading it up in here
or should or should he get freelance
work as well so should you focus on his
studies or mix freelance a minute in
there as well yeah you you learn all the
time yeah like so your answer is guess
go for freelance yeah go freelance
because you may be learning theory and
school and freelance will allow you to
put a lot of that theory in practice
yeah and question that theory as well
theory is created by by us right that's
a good point yeah like like in school
they're just teaching you what
professionals know yeah and so you can
get a lot more or you can get ahead of
all your school mates by being a
professional and you can do that right
away you don't need to be hired by an
agency you don't need to whatever just
start doing some freelance work and
voila you're a professional and you're
gonna get those lessons that they can't
teach you at school because they don't
know yet it's good working with clients
is something that's really hard to
replicate in education setting because
there's there's so much educational
pretence right but when somebody is
actually trying to get value and extract
it from your work I don't think there's
anything that can really touch that
experience so I would say do some
freelance projects as well and mix it up
you know like like you don't have to do
continual freelance all the time it if
you're harder for time just
do a freelance projects while you're in
school and then wait for a while and you
know take another one on later on like I
do freelance work but I do maybe like
three projects a year I don't do a lot
of projects because I don't want to
overwhelm myself but at the same time I
want to keep my sword sharp so next
question is from Ricardo is a Kalon he
says how do you fight the urge to feel
like you always need to learn a little
bit more before you're ready to actually
do the work there's so much to learn man
like
you can always learn a little bit more
before doing whatever yeah right if
you're gonna let that stop you you won't
ever do anything like where's where's
the cutoff point where's the cutoff yeah
okay after that you got just a little
bit more here's a quote that
has inspired me for the last two weeks
it's about plans for making plans
because you're planning to learn more
yeah that's the plan right there yeah a
good plan violently executed now is
better than a perfect plan executed next
week you're trying to do a perfect plan
don't do a perfect plan
violently execute a good plan yeah and
the thing that I would add to that is
that the more that you're trying to
learn that little that little 10% more
that you think you need you're actually
going to pick up as you just start
executing it as you start doing so
you're gonna pick those things up along
the way what you need to write do right
now is get in the mode of working the
mode of publishing of finishing projects
of working with clients that habit is
more important than knowing what to do
every time so get to work next question
all right this next question is from
Stuart Walker it says who are some
designers that inspire you some I'm
inspired by when it comes to designers
not right now and not so much by like
they're like what they're making or what
it looks like for example like I think
things are cool and look gray like the
drop box below like they're making some
coolest raishin is however what's
inspiring me is is like the Google
venture designers that work on the team
because their product is design thinking
and helping permeate that and other
companies it's like it's how to design
not how to push pixels is how to be a
designer how to think through problems
as designers do which the answer isn't
coming from like designers are superior
it's coming from like it's a different
way of thinking that is now being
leveraged for for like businesses yeah
I really agree with I tend to agree with
that like I'm not really inspired by it
work so much anymore as I'm inspired by
process yeah I will say also in addition
to that like I'm inspired by a human
humanity and like like the way that
people can be with each other yeah for
an exemple Lois and I went to a
conference this past week and there was
this person that was on the stage and
you could tell that they were either
kind of nervous or kind of something
because they were just like very like it
was it wasn't it wasn't connecting right
it wasn't connecting as soon as this
speech was done we were doing a Celt
question-and-answer with the audience
and I felt like the person who was
presenting who before was kind of stuffy
melted and like the person just really
connected with the audience like after
the question-and-answer session and all
the sudden I respected this person's
work all right all of a sudden I like
wanted to learn more and at first I was
like put off by how much I felt like
this person was disconnected from me so
I think that like more than like looking
at dribble or more than looking at you
know
cohhd cohhd pen-like just understanding
humans and seeing who's able to connect
with other people that really inspires
me a lot yeah like that gonna delegate
it to connect with that answer all right
that's not the question that's we're
gonna do today I hope you guys liked the
Sean West eat up that we went to met a
lot of cool people and also just the
exciting news that it's a big
announcement
it's a big revelation also for me that
the air just sent me an offer so I'll be
starting in the middle of November and
so hopefully we'll have some vlogs about
that when that happens but until then
we'll see you next time and take care
everyone
peace out
I wonder if I recorded that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
