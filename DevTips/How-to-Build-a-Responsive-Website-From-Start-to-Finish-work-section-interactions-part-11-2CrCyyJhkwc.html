the eleventh video I think in this
series we're back here in the future so
what we're doing now last week we looked
at the work section we built the
thumbnails and actually the week before
last and then last week we talked about
the hover States and made some cool
animations for them this week we're
going to do the exciting work of
figuring out what happens when you click
on the thumbnails now this is
interesting because we have no design
for this I literally haven't thought
about it at all and I'm trying to I'm
trying to make these videos as candid as
possible no rehearsing no pre coding and
seeing if things work and that's why I
think I've had so many pull requests for
this video series because I've been
making a lot of mistakes which is normal
this is part of the course of developing
something we're doing good guys I think
that this is a really good series and
I'm really excited about the way things
are going in the contributions that I'm
getting thank you so much for going to
github and submitting for requests and
making this even more awesome than than
the high level of Awesomeness that it
was before anyway so like I said today
we are going to look at what happens
when I click click so currently what
happens when I click let's try it click
nothing okay take a look at the includes
I'm going to take a look at the work
section here now each of these
thumbnails is printed out as a thumb
unit in and they're a div and that's
okay we'll just leave that there for now
let me get rid of a little bit of
unnecessary whitespace and tighten this
up a bit because what I'm going to be
doing now is deciding how I can bring in
the content that the thumb container is
referencing right so when somebody
clicks on a thumb I want to bring in new
content on to bring in the expanded
version of the website and that's going
to happen by I'm going to make a sibling
of
container call it div a class work
container yeah look it's not a section
work container and it's a sibling of
thumb container and in here I'm going to
say do work I just make that a big old
and this is going to be the title of the
project right and then there's going to
be like an image here so I'll just make
a placeholder div now styling just right
here just so I can I mean sometimes I do
this I create like really small simple
styles in line so I can create false
objects so I don't have to let go find
the actual image and stuff so this is
what I'm talking about I'm say width you
know 500 pixels I guess height again 500
pixels I don't know and background CCC
so which is like a gray square 500 by
500 pixels and below that I'll have a
paragraph of lorem which I can get by
doing that just a few words
and then we'll repeat that twice because
maybe I want this to be like a series
you know a series of photographs and
explanations there's three of them okay
so now I have this here I need to figure
out a way to kind of bring it in get rid
of the thumbs and then when I'm done
with it bring it out and bring the
thumbs back and I think I might want to
do like a sliding transition so since
they're siblings I'll wrap them in a
parent and I'll call that div Oh work in
a class of work
- slider I don't know yeah I don't
really like that name but you get the
idea and then I'll close out this div
right here highlight everything and
indent one okay
so work slider is going to wrap around
both of my work container and my thumb
container when I call it a belt because
like like a conveyor belt like a
conveyor conveys the okay so uh let's
jump back to the work sass and all of
this code here this whole page has just
been about these thumbnails and that's
fine that's cool but of them above that
is the just newly named work what I call
it belt work belt I'm using this thumb
container to constrain the max width of
these thumbnails groupings to 960 but I
need an element that's going to be
around the margins of that 960 right so
like I need an element it's going to go
100% width of the page because what I
want to do is I want to say that this
work belt is going to be the width is
200% it's going to go right off the page
mm-hmm and I want this section work
section
I want to go to section work oops ah
belt and say that your overflow - X is
hidden so that when it's 200% it's going
off and it's not going to like create
this weird like sideways scrolling thing
it's just going to be gone out and
hidden on the X so work section
overflow:hidden X the work belt is 200%
let me put a color on this back ground
pink so we can kind of see we're doing
the right thing right now this is gonna
be bad no this is gonna be fine okay
refresh this is bad okay this is not
horrible but it's not what I wanted but
it I did I knew that this was not going
to be what I wanted because I know that
we're not doing I just wanted to take a
you know a check I wanna just wanted to
check what am I trying to say I just
wanted to take a temp the temperature I
just wanted to take the temperature of
what we have so far now this is let me
show you what we have so far we have a
200% box which is this pink box and it's
stretching from here and twice as far
out and you'll notice that you can only
see four of the work thumbnails because
there's they're eight
you know they're they're a four by four
so you can only see half of it which
means it's dead center still with a max
width of 960 and then the margins are
centering it and that's good and then
below that I had still I have a 200%
another container which is the work
container the the h4 and then the three
grey boxes that I wanted this is exactly
what I was hoping to get and what's nice
about is that see how there's no
horizontal scrolling that is the key
that overflow X is going to stop my you
know page from looking all wonky because
I'm going to try to hide this do work
section I try to hide the working
container off-screen and then like try
to you know slide it in when
you want it but I have to wrap this I
have to wrap them both so let me show
you how to do that I'm going to call
this I'm gonna do another one div here
class thumb wrap div indent you div
class work wrap
indent boom I just said boom I hate that
word boom yeah and now what I'll do I'll
go up here to create a class for work
wrap and thumb wrap actually I think it
was thumb nap thumb wrap were crap
right so okay and then I want to say
that their width is going to be 100%
155-foot 100% and float:left okay now
I'm going to tell you what's going to
happen and we're seeing if I'm right or
if I'm crazy so I'm going to 100% refers
to the width of the parent I might be
crazy but I'm hoping it's the width of
the document that wouldn't make sense
it's probably not going to change
anything except for they're floating
left okay that wasn't that did nothing
so what I need to do 50% their width has
to be 50% because 50% of 200% of the
document is 100% of the document that's
how you do math kids so let's refresh
and here we are we have a really tall
box but that's okay we'll fix that but
our again we are centered and if I make
this smaller it does what we wanted to
Oh perfect just perfect make it bigger
it's centered again with our things so
now if we go in here - our work belt
background pink now the reason we can't
see pink is because background is these
are floated elements so they're the
height of this thing is zero let me say
first of all you know say position is
going to be relative to its current
position and then I'll say left negative
100%
refresh alright see so my work section
my work what did I call it my work rap
my work container is now in the center
of the page right work container and my
thumb container right here is is you
know 100% off of the page off to the
left
right so it's like that that is what we
got going on I think that's super
fantastic this is exactly what we want
while we're here let's not go back to
the thumb container until we have styled
the work document what does it look like
when when somebody is viewing your work
okay and that is going to be work
container
all right we're going to jump down here
actually really just it's going to be
exactly this
now you may be asking why didn't I just
put a comma and then put work container
and I could but I didn't because there's
a lot of there's a lot of stuff in here
a lot of children of the thumb container
and the minute I put a comma and then a
new selector it means I have a new
parent selector on all of these too so
I'm doubling up on all of these
unnecessary selectors so it's it's
outputting a lot more cruft in my CSS
than I need then just creating this one
small extra selector work container okay
it's going to be 960 with a margin:0
auto which means it's going to be 960 in
the center one thing I want to do is I
want to make sure that all my image is
our max width 100% so if somebody comes
in behind me and puts in like really
like a thousand pixels wide images I
can't stop them from doing that but I
can't stop there thousand white pixels
image from going a thousand pixels wide
so I'm gonna say the width the maximum
width that an image can be is 100
percent of its parent which is going to
be 960 okay yeah yeah okay
it's kind of wide
I want it to be 600 what you can do
about that
yeah I like it better I like it better
and then we go to the work section and I
say the width it's gonna be 600 - all
these like fake images just so I can
feel what they're like to be a hundred
percent wide good good good good good
good good
it's already shaping up to be an
exciting little thing okay uh how about
we do we need to address this headline
which is like a h5 I said it was right
h4 okay it's an h4 let's talk about this
headline h4 color is xn is X ain't and
the I want it to be reminiscent of I
wanted to be reminiscent of the title
that of the thumbnail that we just
clicked on and that's going to be right
here
font 300 transform uppercase this stuff
yeah baby
okay cool that looks good
so do work and then some paragraphs want
to make sure that the paragraphs have
okay images are going to have a margin
bottom 20 pixels like our paragraphs do
oh these are not images okay let's say
they did
what's it okay hmm and then do work
that's good it's good now there needs to
be a way to get back to the thumbnail
group and for that I made this icon here
in illustrator it's basically at one of
the crispy icons flipped around and put
inside of a circle I made that in
Illustrator and I exported it to the SVG
using the same process that I described
in earlier videos so here I am I'm going
to inject this icon back I'm going to
inject this into my HTML and I want to
do it so where this icon shows up near
the title so let's run into our work
HTML and I'll I'll wrap it in a div
class let's call it work return that'll
be fine and then we need to we need to
call that HTM we need to call that a SVG
that's that's in HTML right now and
that's include icons slash icon - back
dot HTML all right let's see what it
looks like son of the WoW pushed it down
quite a bit okay alright that happens
from time to time so let's see the let's
run over to our SAS and
start right here work - return and I
need to put a size on that to get this
big old height resolved size and I'm
going to have it be squared at 40 pixels
because that's what size this frame here
is this white frame 40 so I'll do 40
pixels oh let's just see how that works
actually okay yeah that's kind of what I
want but if this is going to be a link I
want it to have the style of a link
cause I want to get the cursor:pointer
and then so it is the SVG so I want to
say the child of the work return that's
the path we want you to have a fill
color of RGB a let's just make it a
lighter gray so let's actually make it
transparent to 40% and then when you
hover over work return so I put and
hover it's going to I just want to take
the whole thing
oh pass it D down to 50% so 0.5 all
right let's see how that works all right
so it's gray and I hover over it and I
got a finger and it and it cries out
even more I like it maybe I should
actually reverse that so let's take it
opacity of one and then the worker turn
is normally opacity of 0.5 let's check
that out
oh that's zero point one no I want one I
like that like it darkens up when I
hover over it making it more more like
yeah click me click me click me instead
of fading out which says ooh don't click
me so that's good I like that I don't
want to sit above the headline here so
I'll take it and I'll move it around by
using position AB so absolute and uh I
want to say no from the top no from the
right no from the bottom but let's say
negative like 50 pixels well it's
actually 40 so maybe 20 between it and
the text this should collapse because
it'll be absolute and then pull it over
negative 20 pixels let's see okay that
worked but not as not enough oh so 60
let's do 60 so it's 40 plus 20 that's
what I intended to do okay cool
that looks good but it's a little
vertically off so say negative 5 pixels
here move it up a bit
that looks good maybe a little bit too
much for that looks good I like that
okay so letting the work I'll just click
it click click this button and that will
take me back to the thumbnails one other
concern I have with this though is that
when I'm on a mobile device we're
building a responsive site this is going
to be a problem it's just sticking out
too far so I need to put a catch in
there using and media
max-width now we remember that this is
600 pixels and then this is sticking out
60 so 60 plus 60 is 120 because we want
to consider how it sits in the middle
sticking at one time so that's 720 and
we'll just say 744 a little padding sink
740 pixels we're going to say take the
position and make it relative let's just
make it this whole mixing again so
position:relative
zero pixels from the top null from the
right null from the bottom zero from the
left and it will close that okay let's
check it out
alright when I get closer okay
it it goes back to where it was
initially okay now this is all well and
nice it feels like a back button it's
you know it points towards the
thumbnails that we just came from so I
think it the positioning and the
relative relative spacing between this
and label and also where you just came
from works really well but when we put
this in a smaller browser and that link
collapses it looks kind of clumsy there
it still makes sense it's still doable I
guess but it just looks a little bit
clumsy maybe we should get this this
icon in front of mm let me take this
media okay I want to
put that down here and then I can start
from the top work container you're going
to be in there buddy work return you're
going to be in there and as also is the
h4 okay now I'm thinking that I'll take
the work return and I'll make the top
the top is fine I want to make the left
go to zero pixels so I want to be I want
to I want to impact that text let's see
if it works
refresh Oh cuz it no I don't want it to
go relative okay
great that's what I wanted so I want
this arrow to just kind of jump
backwards to be on top of that text now
I can take that text and stick it out
with a margin left of what was it 60 60
pixels there we go so now it just kind
of jumps in line right there oh that's
much better I like that a lot better
okay cool so yeah when when I click
it'll jump back to my thing now that
we've got this work section kind of
styled relatively how we want it we need
to before I populate it with images and
stuff I want to get that interaction
down of switching between the thumbnails
and the work sections basically that
slide around and that's going to be
pretty simple let me show you how that's
done we're going to crack open the
functions of the first time ever in this
project and we're going to write a
function that when we click the
thumbnail it will jump over to the work
section and then when we click the close
button it will jump back over to the
thumbnails let's do that then so what I
want to do is alright the function will
be called work work belt right that's
the reference to the function that says
that when the page loads make this
function available to run or run it
anyhow and the function will say what is
called work belt this is the function
everything inside these two mustache
brackets are going to be what the
function is okay I'm not giving lessons
in jQuery at the moment but I'll kind of
talk you through the logic of the
function and then like maybe in another
video series I'll talk about you know
the ins and outs of JavaScript and
jQuery
sorry guys this is just just bear with
me right here okay so let's say jQuery
please listen up
we are going to say look for all of the
what are these things called work
section these things are called thumb
units look for all the thumb units and
then when somebody clicks on one this is
going to happen
everything inside these two parentheses
will happen when somebody clicks on a
thumb unit right and that's going to be
this take the what is this thing called
by the work belt at the 200 pixel wide
one other tool yeah hundred percent wide
work belt
and move it will say left is that I'll
do this left the left a negative 100
pixels %
done that's what you're going to do
that's all you do and then when somebody
listen up jQuery when somebody clicks
the what we call oops
we call this thing the close button work
return it's a weird name work rich thumb
return work Network returns fine work
return when somebody clicks this
take this work belt and put it at left
0% and I need to default the left at 0%
and put a transition on it that should
be good let's see how we work out so
we've got these thumbnails click on one
and the work slides in it goes back it
goes in it goes back up again yeah I'll
go back and then and then then okay the
only problem I have right here is that
you look at the horizontal position let
me put out a rule here and put a rule
here where the top of these things are
and click one of these two at the top of
this thing it so what's up with this
what's up with this I would like this
headline to be right at the top of this
let's figure that out I'll tell you what
that is that's a weird margin top from
the headline so we're going to go to
that h4 down here and say
margin zero pixels Otto
now just zero
zero zero twenty that you could do with
it are you gonna say there you go
perfect okay that's what I wanted
like that and like that it's quite nice
but here's the problem when I'm back in
my thumbs I still have the height of the
work container dictating how tall this
work section is before I added the work
section The Container ended like right
here and that was quite nice but now I
have this big long work container and
that's a problem so what I want to do is
come over to here
and say in both instances grab the work
container and and let's see actually for
this one alright when you click the work
return I'm going to take that Ward
container and I'm gonna hide it and then
when you click the thumb unit I'm going
to take the work container and show it
and I need to set the work container
display:none by default and let's take a
look at what we got all right normal
happy old work thumbnails click on them
and they jump into the work container
which is looking good and nice and tall
slide out here they come back yeah good
good good I could do this though because
you see how when I click on it when so
you see it disappears before it slides
away now it's going so fast I guess it
doesn't really matter but if wanted to
slow that down a little bit like where's
that transition
I'll slow that down to all 800
milliseconds
see it disappears it's kind of strange
really easy fixed to do that is to take
this hide call and jQuery and transition
it over the 800 milliseconds and that
way it won't disappear but it will fade
in color or fade in opacity
meanwhile maintaining its dimension as
it slides out so let me show you what
that's like
so I'll slide it in as you're used to
and then when I slide it out it's still
going to be there just fading out as it
goes and which is a nice effect but it
also keeps the shape yummy you can see
it leaving and that's exactly what I
wanted and then all we also have but
it's gone the bottom will cinch up to
where it should be so I'm happy I'm
happy for now I think there's still a
few more optimizations we can do on this
effect but the majority of what we need
to do now in the work section is to just
fill in the work and kind of make that a
comfortable experience for the the owner
of the site I hope this has been a good
video for you guys I feel like it was
kind of like because I had no design
forward or no idea what it should be as
kind of like oh maybe this and maybe
that you know but sometimes when you're
designing like in the browser that's
going to be your experience so yeah I
hope you enjoyed the video if you have
any questions or comments please leave
them in the doodle below I love to hear
from you guys and thanks to all the
contributors of the artists theme on
github your pull requests are kind of
stacking up and I'm excited to get to
them but I'm really anxious to get
through the work section before I do get
to them so keep on doing what you're
doing and I'll see you guys next Monday
keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
