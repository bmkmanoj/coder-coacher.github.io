and this is dev tips this video is a
little bit different because the video
that was scheduled for today went out on
Saturday I sent out a tweet on Saturday
saying if this tweet gets retweeted 10
times then I'll publish the video early
and it happened in like 10 minutes
so I felt like I had nothing to give on
Monday morning when I know that most of
you guys are tuning in expecting some
new content so check out the one right
there
from that was supposed to be on Monday's
video it's a new episode in the paralax
series and then this video is going to
be a little bit different this is a
behind the scenes at de tire I had a few
questions about my setup on my monitor
and a few of the things I said you know
what why don't I just give you guys a
tour of the studio and a tour of like my
tools and it might be a little fun ok so
what you're looking at right now is the
the kind of setup that I have when I'm
doing introductions and outros and maybe
if I'm doing a video where I'm just
talking to the camera or something like
that this is the setup it's I've got my
DSLR right here that I'm talking to this
is my microphone that I've been using
for the past little while it's called a
zoom h5 and it's got different different
attachments to of it this is the XY
attachment and it's for general purposes
let me take the camera here and try to
do this okay so this is behind the
scenes alright so this is what it looks
like on the other side if that's where
the camera goes right there on that on
that tripod and then right below it
right here I have a desk and so if I'm
talking to the screen I'm looking down
here for ok I have an iPad here this is
hard to do with two hands and usually
here I keep my scripts and in my notes
and whatever on this like little table
can you see that this is really hard and
then I have two lights on the side of me
and they're just you know $50 lights
from Amazon with umbrellas on there to
defuse the the hard light and then
behind me I have
a small light here to throw you know to
remove any shadows from the background
and the background is just like this
white wall that I built into the garage
and the garage itself is nothing
impressive in fact it's pretty crappy
and I have some audio dampers like
behind the camera some was like some
sound absorbing kind of materials but
honestly that they don't do very much
work at all
they kind of suck and then recently I
got this green screen so let me show you
how that works that we'll be talking
about set up number two so set up number
one is me standing on my feet let me get
the light on my face is standing is me
standing on my feet in front of this
white background here and usually the
the microphone is kind of low on that
table that I showed you and it's out of
the way and I'm trying to address you
guys like that like on my feet you know
okay so let me show you let me show you
pause the camera and then I'll show you
how how the setup works when I'm coding
okay so now I'll show you what it's like
when I'm doing recordings of my coding
setup so let me spin the camera here so
I have my I mean Beckett okay so I have
a desk here in the middle of the garage
with my iMac on it it's a 27-inch iMac
like I have it's like 2 or 2 years old
and maybe a little bit more than 2 years
old and I take that that that desk that
we had my iPad on it what below the
camera and I put I put this camera on it
right here this high that's a webcam and
it's a Logitech webcam I use it to
record my face when I'm recording and
then the behind me usually is gonna be
this
so spinning around usually this green
screen and I just got this green screen
it's like this big it's on a wire and
it's on a stand and I just got it and
it's pretty cool because it lets me
knock out the stuff behind me so I can
play put my face right on this bottom of
the browser like I've been doing in the
in the parallax series and I don't know
it's alright I'm not sure if I love it
but I've been doing it for these few
videos and I'll continue it through the
parallax series and then see where else
we go when I'm sitting at the desk
I have the camera on my face right here
and then
and I have usually the microphone is on
this little tripod and I have this other
extension this is a boom boom mic this
is what the mic looks like without a
without the it's a pretty cool boom mic
it just sits there on the desk and
records my face so I have this kind of
like weird office chair here in the
garage with this little Ikea table and
my IMAX sitting on top of it okay so
let's talk a little bit about my desktop
configuration how I configure my windows
and all that stuff while I'm recording
so I can get a good screen grab of it
all and then edit a composite of that
coding work that I'm doing later on to
get you guys the video style that I've
been using for the past few videos so
you direct your attention to my screen
here you see that it's a 27-inch imac so
it's kind of big but i have divided the
screen into a few specific quadrants on
the right here the right half of the
screen is the browser and when I'm
developing I have half of the screen for
the browser and the coding that you guys
see on the left half of the screen when
I'm doing the tutorials is actually just
an eighth of the screen it's just this
little box right here now what do I do
with the other two the 3/8 of the screen
well on the on the left of the coding
sometimes I'll put you know my console
here or my my terminal here or my code
kit right there and then below that I
have this is where I put my notes so if
I'm doing it like a code example
sometimes I build them beforehand and
make sure that my idea works sometimes I
don't I just kind of show you things
off-the-cuff so depending on that
sometimes I'll have like just some
bullet points of things I want to cover
while I'm while I'm going through the
code because sorry this is so dark when
I'm when I'm talking to you guys in the
first configuration that I showed you I
have I usually have a script so most of
the words are prepared and have like a
clear idea of what I want to say but
when I'm in front of the screen and I'm
recording my code it's all very candid
there's no script so
times it's just some bullet points of
some topics that I want to cover and
sometimes it's just like I've already
done some coding and I've like validated
my idea that I want to do and now I'm
like doing it for real in front of you
guys and but it's all candid yeah it's
just a part of it
so I'll put the notes you know any notes
that I have or maybe the coding exercise
that I did previously there so I can
make sure that I don't make any huge
mistakes although it totally make
mistakes all the time and I use I use
screen was a default screen flow to
capture this the screens and then I
export ix but then I export the whole
screen together and then as one export
and then I go through another pass and i
zoom in on just this eighth of the
screen here and I export that and then
and then I'm also you know grabbing my
face from from the webcam right here and
I'll export that too so I have three
composite videos that I'm working with
when I'm doing any of these tutorial
videos and I'll put them all together
inside of Final Cut let me show you what
a final cut project will look like they
can get a little messy sometimes but
generally they're kind of they kind of
have a like an expected kind of thing
here's a video that I doing recently my
mouse is running out of batteries all
right so can you see here down at the
bottom I have those three composite
videos the bottom is going to be the
browser the middle one is going to be
the code and the top one is going to be
my face so when I hover over that time
in the timeline you can see that the
video is going to be those three things
the browser the code in my face but then
I have different kind of things going on
inside here stupid Mouse is not working
come on connection lost all right so in
the beginning of how like different
overlays and texts and never done a
video like this so it's hard okay and
then like different overlays and effects
and kind of explaining things these
green tracks are the
are the music down there so when I'm
doing these musics I'll either produce
the music on my iPad using a tools music
tools like chord gadget or different
drum machines or something like that
and sometimes I just get lazy and use
GarageBand to just quickly whip up a
loop or something it's all custom though
most 90% of it all is all custom and
then yeah so then then it's like
exporting to YouTube and sending nothing
so let me show you also my Trello this
is a big part of my production is of
course the organization right the Trello
so here are all my Trello boards this is
the dev tips board to call it dev tip
2015 and I have different sprints and
kind of series planned out I don't know
if you can read them I kind of don't
want you to so here are all the like
there there are two kinds of episodes
there are series episodes and filler
episodes is what I call them so the the
series episodes are the ones where it's
going to be a longer series like these
parallax ones I'm working on a few other
series that have just I'm working on
this one that I started in January that
that I'm really excited to share but and
so it's taking so long and then I have
these filler episodes here and this
longest list is called the fillers and I
know this is blurry and I'm doing that
on purpose because I don't want to spoil
anything for you guys so this is the
filler list here these are the
investments so these are things to work
on like like the dev tips community
websites like the promotion promotional
things emails different things like like
benefits for the patrons and things like
that
and then I have these these three
columns are important somebody's driving
by it's four o'clock in the morning
anyway these three columns are important
for the actual for the actual production
of it so this one is called in
production all of these videos here are
currently in production they're not
published yet and I'm working on them
all simultaneous imal taneous lee at
once and then
this this column here with one video in
it is our the all the videos that are
that are recorded and done and on
YouTube and just waiting for me to pull
the trigger on so I have one or two at a
time there in case like I don't make my
deadline for every Monday that I want to
do and I need like a little bit more
time to get that video ready even
perfect for you guys although they're
never perfect but so I have one one
video in the like in the chamber ready
to go in in like an emergency and I try
to make those videos that I have there
in the in the in the what I call it the
Polish queue I try to make those videos
um timeless so they're not talking about
anything that happened yesterday or
today or tomorrow but they're just kind
of like general principles or big ideas
that I need to share with you guys and
then this next column these are videos
that have already been published so
after I published them I'll just drag
them into this column here and these are
videos that have been published this
year actually just this quarter and
there's been quite a few and then
there's other next columns are are these
are ideas for my vine my vine account
where I just talk about just like really
small call it just the tips just like
small ideas and they're just seven
second vine vine videos and this next
column I call minutia and this is just
like things that I need to remind myself
like when I'm hosting and on the podcast
of trav and Louis when I need to put out
a new newsletter for my notes what links
that I need to have like in the in the
descriptions of things like that
and then this last one oh these are
actually been notes these are ideas for
the for them for my notes and for my
podcast
so I have other kinds of productions if
you're not familiar I'll just take a
second to talk about what other things
that I'm doing the first one is my
podcast called late nights with trav and
low so I have a friend los Montoya and
he is my co-host for our podcast and and
it's a fun it's a fun podcast we just
hang out late into the night and discuss
different topics and either he'll be
presenting or I'll be presenting
and if you know one of the other the
other person is listening and kind of
commenting and acting as if they were an
audience member and just kind of asking
questions and and and pushing back on
the ideas to validate them and things
like that it's a lot of fun Travon lost
comm if you haven't tried that podcast
yet I really really recommend it it's
really good
we're having a lot of fun in fact we
have a VIP odd cast episode coming out
on Tuesday so tomorrow and this episode
is so I okay so if you can zoom in here
can you see the time wait where's the
time you see the time no and he can't
even see the time okay
nevermind that but let me tell you what
time it is it's 357 a.m. I'm usually up
early in the morning making these things
my sleep schedule is very odd I wake up
at midnight and then I work usually on
dev tips and other kind of things until
about like 4:00 a.m. and that's what
time it is now and then I had take a nap
for 20 minutes and then I wake up again
for 34 20 and I I work until like about
6:00 and that's how I'm able to make
videos for you guys that's what I make
that's when I write the notes the email
notes and that's when I write podcast
things and all that stuff so next Monday
tomorrow we're gonna have a podcast
episode where I'm talking to Louis about
my sleep schedule and I think it's the
coolest thing that I've ever done and I
hope I want you to tune into it so
here's a link or at least there's a link
in the description below to that episode
and it's a two-parter episode but you
get to get a peek into how I construct
my kind of whole daily routine around
being able to have more time in my day
to produce more videos and content for
you guys
that was a long ramble about the podcast
what else do I got so I have this new
letter you can sign up at Travis Nielsen
comm slash notes and this is not
necessarily technical things for you
guys like dev tips is but it's more like
more like um it's a it's a combination
of like advice for your your soft skill
set like you know like like the videos
that I've made about being a good
creator being focusing on empathy
focusing on awareness and grit things
like that so there are more skills for
life like life skills and it's also a
combination of a journal so I talked
about what I'm doing lately and and why
why things ended up this way and what
I'm experiencing and how I can kind of
use these experiences as principles to
teach and help you guys kind of gain
more experience and just kind of talk
about these these things and and and
everyone's really great on that you know
we reply to emails all the time and just
carry it on that conversation throughout
the week so I recommend signing it for
that if you haven't already that's at
Travis Nielsen comm slash notes and then
there's the podcast trav and Louis and
then I have another podcast that I've
been doing it's just for patrons so if
you're not already a patron if you I
mean even if even if you're at just like
the the $2 level you have access to the
patron podcast and I made it available
on your phones and made it available on
patron comm so if you had a patron calms
them or information about becoming a
patron and as a patron you have access
to different things like extra videos
like something like this would normally
be on the patron videos but since I did
the whole weird Monday Saturday thing
it's for everybody and then in but also
a part of that is the patron podcast is
something I need to always be creating
be mindful of creating content for so
that concludes our tour of dev tips if I
left anything out please let me know and
I'll try to answer your questions in the
comments below and if you haven't seen
it already check out the video that I
published on Saturday which is a
continuation of the paralax series I
have about three maybe four more
episodes to go in that series and then
I'll be onto a different kind of project
that I've been really
to get to lately and yeah thank you so
much for sticking with me through this
video I hope you enjoyed it bye and keep
on hacking of course God remembers say
keep on hacking because if it isn't if
you don't say keep on hacking it's
basically not a dev tips video so keep
on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
