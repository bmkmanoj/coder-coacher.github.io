have a really exciting episode for you
today I was able to last night go to a
dribble comm meetup in San Francisco and
I met some of the coolest people that
I've met in a long time and they were
lucky enough or rather I was lucky
enough that they were gracious enough to
let me stick my camera in front of their
face and ask them a few questions now in
a room full of creative professionals I
asked them all about inspiration where
did they get their inspiration how do
they harness it what is it really about
to them and the answers were as
interesting and as varied as the people
who gave so without further ado let me
roll this tape for you and then
afterwards I'll share some of my own
thoughts
and my trick should come from my archive
of screenshots whatever it finds in the
offending the website
a project let's take a quick clip of it
and I'll sort away I'll archive it
sometimes I'll tack up my color and
whenever I'm bored or looking for
inspiration I'll flip through their
outspoken scrolls 2002 screenshots I've
taken over the years a nice way to look
at different especially UI patterns so
that going to do
Tom Gurkha
so when I think my generation is usually
involved looking for
Ronin
The Stand make in a warm feeling
any other inspirational site you kind of
just do a broad search
I know that sandwich that together you
don't really like pay attention all the
details out there you kind of like need
to get the gears going
when you find a happy balance between
the two so you travel this inspiration
you want to like find something that
it's not too alien for you also want to
find something that's original
in the design set on the visual sense
here so it's really
designer and I store my clips in
Evernote and search through them my
color tag
vibration promoters
which is actually just
my inspirations are actual
and looking at things in a different way
you can draw much more inspiration as a
designer
my picture in future
my name is Aoyama buzzword is
for me designer dysfunction of
problem-solving so I try to see whether
your function
and then I look at what people have done
to solve it before because chances are
you had a problem someone has had it
before as well the actual mechanics i
never delete my stream through and i
tend to remember what i say so it is a
conscious blue candy browser bar and
your solution is only a click away j
suppose
so I see the sign
everywhere in nature every look at
things like the bottle is show we're all
good fire off
those spiral sequence always golden
ratio rule of thirds if you look at
nature you'll see design
it'll be pleasing to the eye you see
just a beautiful design all around here
so for me something that I look for
UX design is working with a good
collaborative team
I enjoy working with other designers
that are you know better than me or even
designers at or at my current skill set
or even below it's important to have
different perspectives in what
and sometimes you may be working on
something
you have a problem that you just can't
solve and someone else might come in to
give a different perspective and help
you get over the hump so working in a
collaborative effort is hugely important
in terms of being a designer whether you
design a footprint or designer for the
web
I'm sorry
I inspiration by everything
I paid off the people that I talked to
walk around the streets you know
picture advertisement for
nature itself
everything is wired
my lemon
- Raymond
you know I feel really hungry after like
you know getting inspiration from
different sources like you maybe it's a
museum or gallery
photoshoot
inspired by that and being always hungry
and being inspired by also different
things not only related to your design
work and we're always really helpful to
opening new horizons on
getting inspired by different colors
different textures
and in always being open for it I think
that's primarily thing for me that it's
my interest going after inspiration
being able to learn and adapt to these
new techniques things be hungry for
getting better and better and designers
always space to improve yourself
that's what I would say so
first step you have to take
you're open-minded
things are just gonna start falling in
your lap
after that
look at the world
creatures
whenever I need something
like a design project I can just go back
and redo
over there my
to be creative I think the most
important thing is to get as much
enjoyment
our show
as much coming in as
the concept always
this market inspiration
sparking a switch
that's kind of like growing in love with
yourself in the best position for us to
happen
you gotta offer yourself up in Florence
to feel different
Jovie here we say
I'm taking things in one field to bring
about a new ugly dress
inspiration happens when you're in the
right group or
when you've been working for today
what I do for inspiration what it's
really not coming
basically mentally grow up into my
I could take
it might be good for the
in delegates
come take
stay inspired
trying to get away sometimes for a week
city plug a bit and
is a reading
skateboarding
try to try to kind of get out of my
normal rhythm so when Omaha bitch
the unexpected
cool cool
I hope you guys like that so this
morning as I was walking to work I I
finished the last chapter in a book I've
been reading for a while on and off
it's called manager day-to-day build
your routine find focus and sharpen your
creative mind so a lot of the same
themes that I've been talking to these
creatives about last night
the last chapter was was really really
appropriate for this video talked about
being able to find inspiration when you
need it like overcoming overcoming like
creative drow and like when you're
what's called like writers when you're
blocked
then the writer's block or creative
block like like finding the different
reasons that causes creative block and
taking in and having a practical
approach to to overcoming it so anyhow I
don't want to preach too much about the
last chapter of the book but the book
itself is really great is published by
behance with their publishing arm 99u I
really recommend it it's not that long
it took me a while because I forgot I
had it in my backpack I've been carrying
it everywhere I just forgot it was in
there anyhow um and it was interesting
because I had spent so long the night
before and talking to everybody about
inspiration and hearing their thoughts
and ideas about it and then you know and
talking with my friends about it and
thinking about it for quite a while and
then at the end of the chapter
finishing up there's this there's this
page with a single quote on it I'm gonna
share it with you you can read that
this is by Chuck Chuck Close this
inspiration is for amateurs the rest of
us just show up and get to work
weird right I don't know how I feel
about that I mean it's obviously
controversial right it's gonna make a
lot of the people that I interviewed
last night it might make them feel
uneasy with their answers I think
there's a lot to it though I think
there's a lot to not worrying about
being inspired and about having the
strength and conviction just to show up
for work and just get it done because
that's what needs to happen it's a
really you know blue-collar approach to
it you know my dad shows up to work
every day and does his job it doesn't
worry about inspiration to pick up a
hammer or a welding torch or whatever
the heck he does and a lot of people
would say the same thing right I mean
the world we have was was built on the
backs of people who didn't wait around
for inspiration they just got to work so
I don't know I I guess I I do believe in
inspiration I do believe in being
inspired and but I think it's more than
an emotional thing I think it's a lot
about sensory input right so as a
creative we have to we have to have
creative output I believe that nothing
is created from thin air you know
everything is created from something
everything is a remix so
you you borrow from what you're
influenced by from what you see around
you and I think that has a lot to do
with creativity specifically and then
there's the other side of inspiration
which is not just the practical sensory
the input the the knowledge and material
that you draw upon when you're creative
there's also the inspiration about just
being pumped up you know and and just
being excited to to do what we do every
day and we use the same word inspiration
for both of these things but I think
they're different one is more source
material where the other is more
emotional engagement right an excitement
about about what we do so I think that I
think the both of them are really a
valid you don't have to I mean to
respect that quote a little bit you
don't have to wait around all day to get
excited and at the same time it's your
responsibility as a creative person
to pick up your hammer and get to work
so these are my thoughts on the the
subject of the night I really appreciate
