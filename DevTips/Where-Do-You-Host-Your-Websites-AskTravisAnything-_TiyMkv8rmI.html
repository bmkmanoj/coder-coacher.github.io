scott anything yeah alright today's
question comes from Zachary Newton Zach
asks I would very much like to know who
you used to host your different websites
and the reason behind why you chose them
and I I don't host and do things are
very much lot i use mostly github with
attic yeah flat files so i'm really glad
that you're here because yeah Scott
Scott if you don't know by the way is
the host of the level up tutorials
channel that's on his t-shirt and Scott
take it away tell me about your hosting
yeah so I host a nearly everything on on
a on digital ocean um and digital ocean
from the get-go they're not paying me by
the way is the question might sound like
an advertisement yeah I do yeah we were
just ask the question it's not an ad
yeah right so digital ocean I one thing
that struck me immediately was their
attention to detail and things like the
design and things like that but the the
price is good you concerted droplet
which is like essentially like your own
private little server yeah you can start
it blank you can start it with apache or
engine X or any of these things
pre-installed on it or even CMS's or
whatever you can get it pre-configured
or pre installed or you can get a blank
right um and in addition the whole
interface for growing and scaling up and
everything is just is beautiful and
their documentation is as good as it
gets their documentation is the gold
standard in my opinion for a technical
explanation as well as just tutorials
before digital ocean I didn't know how
to start my own linux server I didn't
know anything about engine X I didn't
know about proxy pass or yeah I didn't
know about any things I mostly hosted on
media temple before and then maybe like
hostgator one of those shared hostings
before so digitalocean might not be the
best place to host if you're not looking
to get your hands dirty a little bit and
in in ssh in and and configure some
server files but when you need to do it
you possibly need to know is in the
digital ocean documentation and I've
learned an insane amount from that so
that's one of the reasons why I really
appreciate them you know there's there's
a lot of interesting things that you
just said in there that I'd like to pull
out number one is that when you're
judging a technology looking at the
community and the documentation around
it is is almost as valuable as how well
can this technology perform second thing
I want to pull out from that is that it
lets say if digital ocean is a little
bit complex for what you know maybe this
person is right for you mentioned
immediate sampler Hostgator are some of
those what are some of those entry level
I a lot of WordPress um new WordPress
users ask me about bluehost yep so can
you give us a rundown of what we're
looking at there yeah I for those hosts
they're largely very similar you have
the cpanel that you log in and has your
sort of one click installs and your
email management just basically you're
sort of management stuff and they're all
extremely similar whether it's hosting
on godaddy hosting on Hostgator bluehost
whatever if I had to pick I would pick
blue host only because I get referral
cash from them but go to Bluehost calm /
Scott referral yeah click on those
things about descriptions but uh no I
honestly I I have hosted sites on their
and their interface is as good or better
than any of the others chances are
between those different between the big
the big hosting companies hosting calm
and like I the ones they said before
Hostgator godaddy gowda between those
they're all really comparable yeah um if
the price is good which blue house price
is good the interface is good their
interface is good that's all you need
really I've never had any downtime
issues or anything with them so I don't
have any negative experiences but in
with any of these hosts it only takes
one negative experience before you're
like swearing off that let's go to life
yeah my saying so so in summary all of
these kind of entry level hosts are a
lot easier to use and they're all very
comparable in terms of service and
power and Macbeth fit to you value but
at the same time Scott uses was it rain
cloud digitalocean yeah I use digital
ocean club yeah digital ocean because
because it's super flexible and he's
learned a lot from using it thanks God
for joining us we're going to do a few
more quick questions and we'll see you
guys in the next video you just watched
ask Travis anything if you have a
question for me then send a tweak to at
dev tips show and hashtag it just ask
Travis anything thanks for watching can
