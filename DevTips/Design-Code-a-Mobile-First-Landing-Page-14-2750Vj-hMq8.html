podcast co-host Carlos sent me a link to
a tweet from Mackenzie child McKenzie
child if you don't know is a youtuber
here doing design and code and he's
doing great and I said I said back to
Carlos McKenzie that guy he's killing it
right now he's doing a great job and
Carlos challenged me he said what was
what is he doing that's different or
better than you on YouTube and I said
why is doing YouTube but not only that
he's creating products and courses and
he's selling them and he's kind of
turning it into a small business and
that's something that I've always talked
about and always thought about doing but
I've never just had the strategy or the
inroad or maybe the plan I don't know
what it was I never never did it and he
challenged me again you know this is why
I love Carlos right he's I wrote about
him recently in a notice that Carlos is
a frustrating person because he's always
challenging me but he did getting
challenged me says why don't you do
these things why do you say you want to
do them but unless you actually do them
you don't really want to do them you
just like to talk about it they hate
being put in my place so I said you know
you're right in fact I've been thinking
about a series that I want to do for
YouTube and the series is three videos
and it's called learn jQuery in 15
minutes each video would be five minutes
long and that's the best video series
that I planned to release today I'm not
going to release it today I'm gonna
release it starting next week today I'm
going to talk with you and show you how
I plan to
take the momentum because I imagine 15
minutes and you know jQuery right that's
a pretty good sales proposition that's
like you would click on those videos
right I'm expecting really good
viewership for it so I want to take the
momentum that these videos will give the
channel and I want to transfer them into
the opportunity to create an advanced
jQuery course and I'm thinking instead
of just covering what is jQuery how does
it work what are these things do but how
do we build things project-based lessons
right how do we build an image slider a
modal of menu system or the core twit
whatever it is and so that's the that's
the the the course that I'm thinking of
producing and selling and it will be on
the side of dev tips dev tips will still
be free don't worry about all that kind
of junk
every Monday a free tutorial that's this
would be something different and it
would be jQuery courses that would be
good you know I have a little bit
experience now doing over 200 videos on
YouTube I think that I can make some
courses that would rival anything that
you see out there and and better in fact
I get this kind of request all time so
so I'm gearing myself up yeah I should
do this but in order to sell courses you
need a website you know like a course
like a little sales page a landing page
and I don't even have a website for for
dev tips proper I own a few URLs and I
haven't really used anything and dev
tips really exists on YouTube and
patreon but it doesn't have a.com itself
so I thought okay if I'm gonna make a
landing page for jQuery I'm going to
need a few things and so I started
mapping it out I'm gonna show you my
maps
my maps so so I'm thinking how would
somebody talking about user journeys now
how would somebody find these courses
you see that focus okay this one is
somebody
it says YT what is that so YT referral
so somebody sees my video on YouTube and
then they go directly to a landing page
which is the jQuery sales page so so I'd
be like talking about you know at the
end of the video like okay and also i
have a course or jquery go you know to
sign up or whatever go buy it another
opportunity for somebody to be a
referral is from the web at wd-50 or
like to hear about it whatever it's like
designer news whatever it's in the web
they're probably going to end up on the
dev tips homepage before they go to the
landing page right so we have two entry
points directly a referral me telling
you to go straight to you know.com slash
jQuery courses whatever or a referral
straight to the dot-com itself the
homepage so homepage and landing page
two different things and then we have
after you fill out the form a thank you
page so so I was like at the minimum of
what I need to do I need to before I
even create the courses if I want to get
interest I need to have people signing
up for this and letting me know that
they're excited about it so I need to
get names and emails and how do you do
that you create a form I'll say I wanted
to create just a Google Form I love
Google Forms but this needs to feel like
the production is better is higher right
because I want these courses to feel
like they're high production course and
then will be so I need to create a
legitimate landing page and and also I
need on that landing page a form to
collect data names and email addresses
and I also need a thank you page after
they fill in that form to round out the
experience you know I can't just have
like a comm slash jQuery courses and not
even build out a comp I
the homepage so I need three pages
homepage landing page Thank You page
thank you for signing in that's what
we're going to do in this video so you
guys remember the the 12 hours that
those like you know 18 videos I spent
creating my Travis Nielsen com website
well this is going to be one video and
we're going to create three pages today
and I'm going to show you how how I I
sketched them out and how we design them
in high fidelity designs and code them
out now I'm not gonna be able to go over
every keystroke with you but I'm going
to be pulling out process and principles
with you and this would be like a higher
level learning rather than you know in
the trenches so let's start with these
sketches so after I made the map of the
user journeys I kind of wrote down the
like the features or the things that
will need to be on each page so for
example on the landing page we're going
to need a good headline it's good sales
right you need a good headline learn
jQuery change your life something you
know with something powerful or or
something that speaks directly to let
the courses are but also how they how
they really improve your life so it also
needs to have a form right and you have
that signup form it needs to have a
description and features this is so you
have the headline and you kind of like
smack them in the face of the headline
and then after that you break down the
features and benefits and say this the
course will cover these things and you
can use them to do these things right
this is how you can get a better job
this is how you can impress your clients
or whatever it is and then I thought
also it would be great because I'm still
going to produce these 15 minute I learn
jQuery and 15-minute tutorials and that
will start next week so I thought it'd
be great to have a link to those and say
like you want to learn jQuery but you
need to know the basics first so go get
these for free and then come back
and purchase them here or whatever and
then and also the landing page itself is
interesting because somebody going to
the landing page may not necessarily
know who I am or what dev tips is they
may not know about the two hundred
videos on YouTube for free and so I
thought well we should also talk about
that on the landing page and that's kind
of it for the landing page for the for
the home page I have a few other notes
ballistamon let me show you this the
sketches so I start with the home page
to do sketches my outline yellow is home
page blue landing green as thank you so
now here this is the home page and
you'll notice that it's mobile first
what I did here on the on the right is I
wrote down a few of the feature sets
that would need to be represented on
this on this page so that the top there
says hero the next line says description
this line says top videos now this is
the Jade this is the dev tips home page
not a jquery site so bio the top dev
tips videos when you kind of cool like
it like a bunch of thumbnails of those
and then and then have a section that
represents the jquery course that's
without the line right there says JQ our
course and then also because patreon is
such a big part of the dev tips
experience we have this community here
that's just so awesome that I wanted to
represent that on the dev tips home page
right this is not the jquery course
landing pages of dev tips home page so
this is a hero right it's a video maybe
i'll take like my favorite video this is
like an About section like what is dev
tips here the the thumbnails of like top
videos you know like most popular or
something and then continuing on from
that here's the jquery section i like
colored it blue because
blue and it's going to have a form on it
that's the most important parts like
it's like here's a quick sales pitch in
a form and that's on the homepage right
still on the homepage and then below
here is these are this is patreon and
like features and benefits down here and
then a footer so it's pretty it's pretty
like what you'd expect for a for like a
homepage we're getting straight to what
depth tips is about how we can help your
life here the links go getta
you know all this needs to be done
before Monday and it's Friday night
right now and that means I have two
nights to do this because I only I don't
work in the daytime on this stuff I do
the only in nights murder is sleeping so
the next portion here is the jQuery
landing page so it starts right here and
I line in blue like maybe there's like a
big sign up here and then these here are
the features these are like the videos
that go go look at those fifteen minute
videos right here and get ready for the
jQuery tutorials and this is like about
dev tips like maybe they landed on the
jQuery page this is this is continued
here right see that so maybe they landed
on this jQuery page and they never heard
of dev tips
well here's like about me and about dev
tips and like what it what it's all
about
and then here is a forum again so I have
to form in two places on this one web
page there's one landing page where they
can sign up and then a footer down the
bottom
all right so those are my sketches right
now is time to do the designs I'm just
going to do this kind of like you know
speed design and then hopefully pull out
principles along the way for you get
started
so it all happened yesterday I got a
tweet you know it all kind of started
you know it up you know you know it all
really started yesterday
it all happened yesterday when my pad
