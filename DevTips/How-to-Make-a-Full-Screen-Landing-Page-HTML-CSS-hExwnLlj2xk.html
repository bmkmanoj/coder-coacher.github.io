comments that I think would make a
really fun and a cool video ah
Nicolai Anderson asks I was wondering if
you could make a tutorial of a
full-screen landing page it has become a
trend and I can't find a good tutorial
if you zoom or change the screen size
the image will still fill the whole page
in any browser I hope you can help me ok
so just to give you an example of what
we want to recreate we have this right
here it's just it's a full bleed image
across the whole background and there's
some text in the center and the text
will stay in the center when the image
the you know the viewport gets resized
and the browser shrinks and the image
will size up and down to notice that
it's always going to be in the bottom
here and then I can actually scroll up
and the image will will go away choose
but it's it's always going to be full
frame right a hundred percent of the
height 1 percent of the width and that's
what we want to recreate so what I got
here is a blank blank HTML page and have
a Jade that renders that you know see
it's an empty body here and a sass file
that feeds the Jade I'm gonna say body
background honeydew and just like that
we got a honey-do background ok so
there's a few things to remember and to
think about this it's not exactly tricky
but there is a few nuances that that
might be interesting to understand first
let's get into making the markup work
here we're going to need a few things we
just start with an h1 now say hello
hello Clarice and gotta h1 here hello
curry Clarice
so also an h4 it's nice to see you again
now let me show you something that's
really interesting about this and I made
a I made a video about it a while ago
but it was a long while ago so you
probably you know haven't seen it so
notice that the background of the of the
whole body is honeydew and the whole
canvas here of this whole page is
honeydew if I change that to pink that's
more obvious this whole page is pink and
which is really really odd and and
interesting because that's actually not
the size of the body the the body HTML
element is the only HTML element that
does this that it's background will
actually go outside of its dimension
let me show you what I mean border ten
pixels
- and the let's call it red you see what
we have here this border goes around the
body and that's an interesting thing
because you can't have the element that
we want in this case this big this big
photograph go outside of the body and
the body is collapsed all the way up
here so for example if I went here and
said I want to put these things inside
of a header
I was tab those into it and then I said
header
background image and I have a background
image already okay if I did that you can
see that the image is only taking up as
much space as the content inside of the
header right and so if I wanted to
extend the header height and say 100%
well this is not going to change at all
because the parent of the header the the
body in other words is collapsed down
this far so I need to say to the body
height 100% also now you might have
expected that the body would go all the
way down to the viewport bottom here and
then my image would stretch as well but
that that's another thing that is kind
of really tricky about this is that the
HTML element is actually giving the body
dimension as well so let me show you
what I mean if I put a border dotted ten
pixels and green look at that that green
dotted border is the HTML in the
document isn't that interesting usually
when you think of the DOM and how it
renders and you know your CSS and stuff
you're kind of just thinking about the
body on down because on the head is kind
of invisible you never see it and
actually here's another interesting
thing about watch this
ahead display:block it and see that
title that is the title right here see
you can actually style it
crazy huh that's not we're doing today
what we're doing day I'm just showing
you that that these things that you
don't normally think of as having
dimension in the page actually do have
dimension so we have to come down to
HTML and say height 100% and once you
allow that 100% height then you have an
opportunity for the image to stretch
down as well and now I'll take the
background image and I'll say background
background size cover and that will take
this image and kind of tell it to only
ill tell it to stretch to the edge that
has the highest proportion so for
example right here the the top is
hitting the edge and the bottom is
hitting the edge but there's going to be
a breaking point where the side is going
to hit it right it's going to cover the
background all the time there's never
going to be a spot of the background not
showing right which would be different
than contain let's see
a little bit different good to know the
difference now so we want to use cover
we also want to get rid of these
ridiculous borders and you don't need a
background pink and so that means that
body can just go over here okay and as
soon as we start putting content under
the header let me get some paragraphs
here ten paragraphs now those ten
paragraphs below the header will let us
scroll up and the height the header
remains 100% of the size of the of the
viewport right
we just style those paragraphs a little
bit better
margin-top 50 no zero Auto in 20 pixels
there we go I'm back margin margin
bottom give me 50 there we go
so now it looks like a an article okay
so that's one approach
is that you can make the HTML body and
the head 100% of the viewport and then
start putting things atra but here's
here's a problem with that and it might
not be a huge problem but it is a
problem or at least something to
consider that we've got our HTML and our
body ending right here you see that so
this text is actually sitting outside of
the body tag it's extending outside of
the body tag and that's just not that's
weird I mean we shouldn't it's okay it
works I've done it before this is a
little strange so there's a better way
that I've thought about about doing this
instead of fussing with the HTML and
body I can say height 100 vah vah is
viewport height and 100 means basically
100 percent or 100 viewport height units
so the viewport if you just imagine this
thing getting cut into 100 slices here
that's what a viewport unit is it's
1/100 of the height of this viewport so
right here it's still 1/100 and right
here it's still 1/100 brilliant huh and
now what that does is it enables the
body let me show you the body
I was at 10 pixels solid red okay that
enables the body to extend all the way
to the bottom now to it to wrap around
the content of the page which is what we
really want you know just good structure
a lot better that way now if we want to
take it one step further this is not a
part of the demo but why don't we just
Center this text here so what we would
do is a header display flex and now
we'll say Flex Direction column and that
will get these stacked up again okay now
their flex column we can say justify
content center they're centered
vertically and now we have sent to them
horizontally by saying align items
center here we are hello Clarice it's so
nice to see you again and that's in the
center no matter how big this viewport
is it's 100 percent right cool okay
that's it for the demo today if you want
to check it out there is a version of
this on code pen that I made for you
guys so you can hack around with it and
mess with the different options there
and yeah I hope you guys like this

to do more suggested videos in the
future
