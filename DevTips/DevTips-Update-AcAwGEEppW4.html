this is just a really quick video to
give you kind of an update on what's
what's going on lately there's been a
lot of balls in the air for me balls and
I wanted to kind of just kind of get get
everything off my chest about about how
the channels going what my plans are for
the near future and what's have been
happening lately so there's quite a few
things actually let's start with the
good news first of all I'm really
excited in the mail recently actually it
happened a few months ago but I got this
in the mail if you're not familiar this
is a silver play button that YouTube the
company sends to people who have
channels with a subscriber base of over
100,000 now if you look at the
subscribers there you'll see like I'm
around 130,000 so it's been a little
while I've had this for for a bit and I
haven't shared it with you guys because
there's been so much other kind of stuff
in the way and I'm going to talk more
about this later I'm gonna make a full
video about what it's like to receive
this package and also you know some tips
for people who want to be video creators
who want to have a successful YouTube
channel so that should be coming in the
next few days I'll probably record it
tonight and then release it soon the
next thing is pretty exciting too
especially on a personal level so a lot
of you may know that recently about six
or seven months ago I joined Google as a
designer and one of the first projects
that I ever did when I first started
about six months ago
was finally released publicly just a few
days ago which which is really exciting
to to be able to talk about it publicly
and kind of show you guys on the phone
here so let me do a quick zoom in here
hopefully you can can you see it okay
there the lights adjusted now so this is
a speed test if you do a Google search
for speed test on your phone or on your
your browser there's a there's a test
that happens
again let's compensate for it okay now
you can see in the garage my speed test
my speed isn't that very good that's
like when I'm when I'm coding tutorials
and stuff and if it's slow that's why
cuz just really bad internet out here
but anyway so if you Google speed test
or internet speed test then you're gonna
have this like little box right there
where you can perform a speed test right
in your browser and you know I it was a
fun project a really fun project that
was given to me early on and to be to be
completely transparent I was not the
only designer that worked on it it was
kind of a hand-me-down from other
designers I think there's two other
designers whose names are Roy West and
Jamie Leach and they they worked on it
and did research and a lot of great work
and then when I finally came on the
scene they had you know user testing was
being done and finally it was done but
they had moved on to other projects and
so I I didn't do a ton of work although
everything that you see on the design I
did put their pixel by pixel but a lot
of the concept of research understanding
like the big parts of design work were
done by these other talented creators
other talented designers so I'm not
taking all the credit but I did my part
in it was kind of just pushing the UI
past the finish line which is really
gratifying for like a new person to come
on to a big company like Google and just
like have a really quick a quick win so
I'm grateful to the product partners
that I had to make this thing work and
and also the designers who kind of set
the stage for a kind of a slam-dunk
you know like early on and you can you
can do it now everybody it's available
to you now so that's a really really
exciting thing for me I always said that
like you know hey guys
I have a project published at Google I
will let you know because this is
something that's extremely visible right
like you could use it right now so that
that's that's one of the the big updates
that I don't wanted to get to the the
silver play button and then my first
Google project was released publicly
another thing I want to talk about was
the CSS animation series that we're
doing currently it's been a very popular
series you guys are very much into it
and I'm really excited about that it
makes me excited to make more of them I
think I'm gonna do one more video and
that will be coming out next Monday I'm
not quite sure on what the content will
be I thought that my last video is gonna
be the last one but I thought oh one
more so I'm currently developing that
and then after that there's a lot of
options that we can do but I think we're
gonna have one video from Ren do you
guys know ran this is ran ran has been
on my vlogs a little bit lately and I've
been on his vlogs I met him on in the
trip on the trip to Tel Aviv and he's
gonna be walking you guys through how to
recreate a design in HTML and CSS using
a tool called web flow and this is one
of those tools where you don't actually
touch code you just kind of like fill in
a bunch of boxes and kind of like move
you know switches and sliders and stuff
and then you have you have the design
built in HTML code and then you export
the code and then hand it to your
developer to connect it to like the
database and stuff which is for
front-end stuff it doesn't do it's not
like a CMS or anything anyway so that
will be soon maybe like a week or two
and I also have a few other series is
coming up like the time that I spent
recently with Adobe to talk about what
the heck did we talk about a UI basics
and fundamentals and like design
principles that was really good I think
that you guys would really like that so
that's coming up soon and another one
that's kind of a big deal that I'll be
working on that I have been working on
and I'm still working on but I want to
give you kind of like a little sneak
peek is like let's let's look at it
right now so this screen is going to go
away and
present a logo to you and here we go so
that is the logo animation for the
jQuery course that I've been working on
and to say that I've been working on it
the whole time since I announced it and
Tintin today would be a little bit of an
exaggeration there's been absent flows
with it it's interesting when you take
yourself off of a release schedule let
me rephrase that when you maintain a
release schedule but do not have a
strict release schedule for this other
project it's really easy to let that
other project kind of just go week by
week without having any movement on it
because this one the main YouTube
channel is so demanding but I I've got
this logo now and I felt like that was
one of the blockers is that I couldn't
ever export a video because I didn't
have the branding finished and and I
engaged some really talented artists
from Russia to get this done and I'm
really excited to have it and show it to
you guys so so I'll be working on that
more but the question I get a lot is
when will it be ready Travis when will
be when when will be able to kill it
with jQuery I I don't know I want it to
be soon but I think you should plant
cherry trees and what I mean by that is
that cherry trees take a while to grow
so that's it that's the update for the
channel and that's what will be
happening in the near future I'm off now
to record the YouTube plate let me show
you this thing again this is pretty cool
I'm off to record the video about how to
get one of these for yourself and and
also to record the next YouTube video of
dev tips right I don't know it the next
day and then CSS animations video is
going to be but I need to make it make
it up so thanks for tuning in to this
update I hope it was interesting to give
you a little insight on what's coming up
soon and I really appreciate your
reviewing this and keep on hacking we'll
see you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
