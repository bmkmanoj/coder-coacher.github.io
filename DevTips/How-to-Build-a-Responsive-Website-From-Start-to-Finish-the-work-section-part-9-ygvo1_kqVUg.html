the night video in this series called
how to make the best website in the
world or any of the other worlds forever
ah if this is your first time watching
depth it's welcome welcome to the family
you should click right here though this
is not the video for you this playlist
will take you to the first video in the
series that we're watching right now
again how to make the best website in
the world forever today finally we're
going to start looking at the showcase
area or the work section of the site
that we're building and I mean I say
finally because we spent I think two
weeks now looking at awesome poll
requests and I say finally kind of like
a tongue-in-cheek wags the actual
reasons we've had a delay getting to
this section it have been so incredible
you know you guys are contributing to
the codebase on github
adding awesome things in fact even as I
you know create this video and edit it
down and record these intros and stuff
there's been an explosion of pull
requests just this week and people are
adding awesome things and we're just
having a great discussion over there on
github about all these features so check
that out here maybe there's the thing to
click on and then also there's a link to
the github repo in the description of
the video below so like I said we're
going to do the work section today I'm
excited I know you're excited let's just
let's just start right now
ok let's dive right in in the past few
videos we saw that we made the header
here the About section and the footer
and there's been a lot of contributions
for example we now have a scrolling menu
these are automatically generated by a
settings page and a few other things I'm
really excited about what we're doing
but today we're going to be focusing on
the section that comes right in between
here
the next section which is the work
section which is going to look like this
now I already have a few things set up
in my project here for times sake we've
seen how we construct these things in
previous videos but I set up a word into
the index.html right here and that's
included in the templating system that
comes along with Jekyll also I've
created a work dot sass and that's
pulled in through the the sections
directory right here so the sass work
and the worked out a chi ml are ready to
be created right now also I want to
direct your attention to the images
folder I have created a new subfolder
called work and in that subfolder are
eight project folders and each one has a
thumbnail called thumb jpg they're all
called phone jpg and there are eight
project folders and we'll get to that
use those in a little bit now for the
first part of this video we're going to
do like we do for every other section up
into this point and we're going to
describe with our markup what we see in
the design first I see here a gray box
and a title of work and then inside here
the thumbnails so I'm just going to make
another section then I want that same
headline in there and that's going to be
an h3 and actually I want to use that
menu auto scroll so I need to put this
as an ID of oops equals ID of work and
inside on the right for work now on this
section area I need to have a way to
signify that this is going to be one of
the good darker blocks so like for
example we have clients here it's on
white and then this contact contact
ticket that's in gray here so I need to
wait like a calm in a class or something
on this section so I'll just put um
those put a class of alternate Oh
all section yeah okay and what we'll do
with that all sections we'll just hook
the color and the different headline
style color into that and now that we
have the work and the body or the kind
of container of the section in a create
old place for the UM oh it is like
thumbnails to live now currently in its
design I have them just going to the
edge of the grid and they're not full
width I'm I'm deciding if I want them to
be full width or not um I mean you could
easily do so they could expand quite
simply but let's say that there is a max
width and then when they collapse
they'll be full width let's say that
okay so they need to have a container do
class this is the project container okay
and then now we have to map out what one
of these containers will kind of look
like actually I don't want the coast
project container because it's not the
actual project these are the thumbnails
wanna call this some container
I'm container okay and now we have to
kind of map out what the structure of
these thumbnails will look like and
notice that we have a kind of like a
popover or a slide in or something kind
of an interaction this this magnifying
glass and this the name of the project
will show up when we hover over it and
it will be kind of like grayed out by
the accent color and I'm not sure but I
want some type of animation maybe like
it zooms out or zooms in or slides you
know in or whatever we can think about
that later but div class um unit and now
I'm describing I'm describing the kind
of the whole container of each thumbnail
I call I use the word the keyword unit
what I'm talking about like repeatable
item like structures so thumb unit and
then maybe I'll put this an anchor tag
so that I can clickable you know well it
would be clickable anyway good with
JavaScript you can make anything
clickable but just you know keep it a
little I'll use a background on the
anchor itself and make it a block
element but I want this text to slide up
right so I'm gonna make a div of class
um overlay and in there we'll call it um
strong this is this is going to be the
first one will be called chuckle typo
International and then we need to have a
space for that icon so let's just put
this here this is the placeholder so we
know that we're going to put something
there I'm not going to call a zoom icon
that's probably not going to be a div
but that's just there so we can know
what's up um that looks pretty good but
overlays going to have the color it's
going to be the words this could be an
icon after it I'm just kind of nervous
that like what if the name of the
project or the unit is kind of long I
don't want that to have a problem
visually like it will rap or something
like that maybe there's something we can
do with JavaScript to keep it nice and
short this looks pretty good let's make
a few of these two three four five six
seven eight okay and dip doop doop I
want to do something where okay well
anyway that's the structure of it and it
looks pretty good now that we have the
structure mapped out with our markup we
can focus on the styling of this section
so welcome to part two this is about
styling okay the first thing I see is a
class
called alt section and I want this
section to have a background of the
color is going to be it's in our sass
here a document background color nope
section nope background color alright
let's see if we got okay oh good so it
being a section gave us all the right
margins that we wanted the background
color looks good and we have all these
are our block level anchor tags
interesting oh why are they block level
because they rap blocks yeah they're not
display:block okay cool okay the first
thing we need to do is set out on a grid
here so I'm going to take each well
first of all let's take this thunk
container and make that a worthy
container so class um container it is
going to be max width of 960 pixels and
margin it's going to be 0 from the top
because it looks like the bottom padding
of this headline already takes care of
the space I want between there and then
I do want some space on the bottom it
looks like I want about 100 pixels on
the bottom so this marginal gonna be 0
Auto to Center and 100 pixels to the
bottom and there we go Oh mmm
that didn't work out too well let's just
put it as 0 the bottom and then the
padding we'll put 100 pixels the bottom
I think
100 pixels and that's much better
now we have to take consideration each
of these thumb units is that what we
call them from the unit yep okay so club
unit you're going to be four across
which means are going to be with a 25%
and height you're going to be let's say
just you know start out here 200 knots
too tall
150 150 um background okay just we can
see you oh you know what it is because
it's an anchor tag which is normally on
display in light I need to Jenny to
forcibly change that anchor to be a
display block so now that was why the
height width wasn't taking although the
background could have worked let's see
okay so now we have the correct
dimensions but they're neat they need to
be positioned with each other and I say
float:left so they can wrap up four in a
row okay good good good good
and the thumb container I want to clear
fix that great just great
okay cool so please look tight you look
tight and you look nice I'll put a
placeholder of the background image here
and assets
one project - 100 K they should all be
the same cool and then of back ground so
this is something cool you can do with
sass you just do this so I have to write
the word background every time I found a
Center and repeat no repeat and size
cover if you have to put the little guy
there there we are okay so let's see
what happens when we scrunch this in
okay so these things are going to get
thinner they're not going to get smaller
because because because because because
I'll tell you why because the height is
a fixed height that we defined it's not
a proportional height right so let me
show you what I mean by that so I said
 the height is 150 pixels I remove
that completely what happens it will
collapse down to just the height of its
text right just the height of the
content that's keeping it there but if I
go in here to them overlay
oh and I need to position this guy
around the tip if I go into thumb
overlay and position it as absolute what
will happen these little you won't be
able to see any of these images they'll
just collapse and their collapse they
collapse all eight of those words are
just right here because they have no
height and they have no height so what
we want to do is I want to create the
height based on the width and there is a
way to do that and it's kind of sneaky
if I go in here to the thumb unit and I
say um padding top 20%
now that's this padding is based on it's
20% of the width of the unit which is
really weird but also super convenient
for us to do proportional are you know
kind of proportional thumbnails look at
this now the the word the label is
pushed outside because it's being pushed
down by the M by the padding but I
called it position:absolute if I say top
zero it will it will stay inside of its
container see inside of its parent
because its parent is relative we did
that together earlier so in my design or
these icons are these yeah they aren't
touching okay I need to take this thumb
overlay and I need to me let's do a
better let's do a shorthand for this
position here position AB so I'm so
looped zero tickle zero six zero pixels
through pixels pixels all right and then
uh that what that will do is we'll
stretch this
thumb overlay to the top to the bottom
to the left and to the right so we'll
cover completely and then I'll say back
ground you're going to be Oh what is it
called in SAS Oh pacify it's a weird
word Oh pacify my color of accent about
or pacify it about 90% is that right or
is it 10% like I always get confused
let's see method net nothing okay why
not thumb unit and inside overlay wait
time overlay oh we having an error oh it
looks like opacifier might be wrong oh
it's not persist not 90% it's a scale
between 1 &amp;amp; 2 0 &amp;amp; 1 Sora
oh no pacify it was it 0.9 mm okay I was
expecting it to go all the way to the
top some unit
thunk overlay why is this position
absolute kitten over it oh it's a wrong
AB so Luke okay awkward and there we go
that's a sweat blow is expecting
complete block but I was expecting a
little bit of opacity let's put that
back down to five hmm that's not what I
wanted a sass Oh pace if Phi this is
what I'm looking for right here
okay I was doing it wrong I was making
the color more opaque which it's already
at a hundred percent opacity right now
so that was doing nothing what I wanted
to use the keyword of transparent eyes
or fade out fade out is easy to remember
I'll use fade out fade out 50% see if
that works that's what we wanted okay so
what that does is it takes the hex so
this color is just a simple hex and it
fades it out it does the math and says
what is this going to be RGB a so that
it can have some transparency to it now
five is too much according to our design
let's look at our design look at how
rich that is this is 50 that doesn't
look right
fade out and so this aunt this color to
only come in when you're hovering over
the thumb unit so what I'm going to do
is going to say I'm unit and hover
then the thumb overlay I think I'll have
it just like slide in slide in so if in
order to have it slide in this is what I
want the background to end up as so I'll
do like this thump overlay so hey I read
this selector to you when you're
hovering over the thumb unit thumb
overlay will get this position so by
default I wanted to have a different
position which is let's see top of one
hundred percent actually and I'll change
this to zero percent so it's relative so
it says the same scale and zero zero is
fine but um for the bottom I'll just
quote no because I don't want to declare
the bottom and then I need to make it a
height of 100% so that it will be the
same height as its parent but not
constrained by the
positioning so that it can jump up and
down I want to say thumb overlay sorry I
want to say thumb unit when you're
outside of the thumb unit I don't want
you to show so I'm going to say
overflow:hidden alright let's see if
that worked
oh yeah it did looks good so it just
appears quickly right now let me animate
it for you to show you what I'm doing
here a transition here we go see how it
jumps up like that that's pretty okay
now these these are looking a little
tall in my opinion let's say I'm 14%
tall height there we go it's a little
bit better maybe not enough at 17 16
that's a little better okay now we need
to mess with this text here now remember
that overlay here that it's inside has
is though this brown guy so it uh we
have a lot of work to do so overlay
strong mm-hmm you're gonna be text
aligned actually text aligned I can go
in the parent Center and okay no strong
is going to have padding top actually
padding all over the top is going to be
20 pixels the right left or also give me
20 fix levels and the bottom is can be
20 pixels so just wipe it around I guess
I'll start there
this boy block it's an inline element
normally so there Teleca block I can
happen assign that padding to it cool
now that overly is going to be styled a
little bit different we're going to have
white text and it's going to be like
thinner in all caps so color blind
um font weight is like 300 right and
text transform uppercase okay cool and
then size is 24 it might be a little big
yeah look at that it's kind of huge but
it's good to see let me go into the
inspect element here and go to its
parent and click hover so it's just kind
of always up we can always just see how
it is oh it's gone now okay I'll do line
height like one point two so that it's
not so there we go it's a little tighter
um I'm okay with it
being two lines but I'm just kind of
nervous that if it is one line it'll
look like just kind of lopsided towards
the top if it's three lines we'll push
it too far bottom so I mean it doesn't
have to be big issue but I could Center
that the whole block of text all right
me again there's some missing footage
here you didn't miss much though I
exported that magnifying glass icon the
exact way that I did all the icons in
video number five
and we created an SVG and Ives kind of
plug that in there using the same
methods nothing is is mysterious right
now
it just didn't as a recording problem
let's jump back now I've just finished
inputting that icon there there we go
what's good right ok maybe later I can
show you a few different ways to
transition these in but right now they
just kind of jump up from the top now
that we have the general look and feel
of these thumb units down I'm going to
need to find a way to manage the content
for any you know people that come in
later they want to find an easy way to
upload their images change the titles of
these projects and stuff like that so
the first thing I'm going to do is go
back into my work and find all the other
seven of these things basically get rid
of we only need one I'm going to follow
the pattern that was put in place by our
contributor Ricardo when he turned and
turned this into a loop when I was doing
the menu section and and also the skill
section so it was really really
impressive how he did it so let's follow
that pattern did we jump over the about
page we can see what he did he said for
each skill that's on that data page
create you know create one of these
loops so a percent percent and its end
four so this is going to loop every time
there's a skill so we don't want it to
be skilled we want to go into that
settings page and create a new section
call the work section and this will be
projects I'll just copy the pattern here
I've never done this before I think it's
really cool but let's do a little bit of
copy of pasty right here too you know
just basically right on his awesome
coattails
so yeah project name and then thumb is
going to be right here in the URL that
would be you know project 1 - 1 / um jpg
maybe I don't want to cheat them maybe I
want it to be something a little bit
more generalized by like folder and then
I could say project 1 folder and then I
could just ex extract the thumb if I
expect the thumb to be there so this one
is going to be called typo International
so this will be project 2 and let's just
go on to a full 8 here so we can see
what we're working with 3 4 5 6 6 7 and
one more for 8 ok that all can be called
typo no let's go to the images and see
what they should be called this one is
called American Apparel I don't know I
don't have any words for these yet okay
well that's fine
um so if we know the name and we know
the folder we can we can extract the
thumb if each one of them is called
thumb jpg and then we can also get a few
more things if we know this project
folder so that's why we didn't want to
dig too far and talk about the thumbnail
specifically but yeah let's try to see
if this works so in this template I want
to change the word skill to project in
the projects so there are 8 projects and
for each of those project spit out this
will
a bit of code changing this here to
project name and then some unit is going
to have the background so you'd have
this called project folder and it's
going to be something like assets images
work then fold remember and then thumb
cough jpg so I need to remove the
background image from the sass
where are you background image ok let's
see what we get
refresh oh wow look at this all the
correct so I'm just so excited right now
okay so since the they were all named
correctly in terms of project numbers
and the thumbnails they showed up where
they should have been so I'm pretty
excited about that they just need to
have a correct names now and we do that
by going into the settings page and just
kind of changing them around so this one
what is called crisp icons number three
and number four is called goodness you
know what these actually do have names
and the names are that which they have
been named by their creators and we want
to respect that so I'll name these I'll
name these what they should be named all
right being a little bit more unprepared
than usual Travis sure right now
Moff researching the the names of all
these projects and then I'm slowly
typing them out you know with my index
fingers for each one of the each one of
the units there again it's not magic but
we're going to jump ahead in time now
okay it should be done let's jump back
to what I was doing before I went and
found all the proper names of these
projects from the owners and while I'm
talking about the moment to give a quick
shout out to the people who actually
created these visual designs they are
not mine but all credit goes to their
owners and you can find their names and
links to their Behance
projects in the description of this
video below and also in the readme file
in the whole project so a quick a quick
thank you to Michael Petra Sergey a of
Anton Nick Jonathan and Jo Jo for being
awesome designers and creating these
projects and also being like really cool
to everybody in depth tips here that
they've given their express permission
that we can use these in our projects
you use these designs in our project as
placeholder projects so cool cool beans
cool guys so while I was also making the
names I noticed that I didn't like to
kind of like the zooming icon and just
put a plus here I don't I still don't
think that I love it maybe that'll
change in the future but it is what it
is maybe I don't even need it
maybe I'll just you know what let's just
get rid of it go back into my work
HTML and delete this lion right here now
this is cool because I get rid of this
file icons in the trash oh I feel better
already
what this does is it opens us up for a
little bit more flexibility with how I
position this how your position this
type so I would rather have this these
this tech be you know dead center here
instead of kind of pushed up to the top
like it is right here flex
and align items is it Center right there
we are okay that's kind of what we
wanted
why are they why are they floating to
the left let's say justify content and
justify content and we say space around
this work better okay so cool then I'm
not everything is nice and tight in the
middle of their space now I still have a
problem when I'm going to shrink this
down the text gets too big and
everything but let's think about this
what's the spot where this collecting
less this right here um and the same
spot where the was at five forty five
forty okay so at five forty we know that
the skills are collapsing so let's just
make the same spot right here for this
for the work section hopefully it's not
too late in the work width of our thumb
unit okay is with the twenty five
percent let's say at media and now it's
screen and Max width of was it five
forty pixels we're gonna say it thirty
percent
all right did I read that right I don't
know that's fine now no I didn't write
it right oh wait yes I did okay so I did
write it correctly but it still looks a
little too small
looks a little a little too let's see
what we got here so break this break
this out so you can see it better okay
so when 540 comes along first first of
all those two small already I want to do
it right about you shouldn't need it I
looked around 760 that's still a little
big but it'll be fine 760
okay now I need to find out why this
height is so small if the height is
going to be 100 personal height is going
to be the percentage of sorry I'm
talking and looking for this covering
same time so the height of the padding
top of 16 percent is that not enough
anymore ah it's really small come on all
right well petting time will be 26
percent then when it's what it's time to
do that okay so let's try that again one
more time so this is how wide you are
and you look nice and good now let's
shrink it up and oh look still look nice
and good and then let's shrink a bit
earlier I will used to look pretty good
I don't think I see one text overflow
that's pretty good like this one gets a
little tight a little bit ooh now that
we're centering ourselves in the middle
we don't need to do this kind of padding
that I had on I still want their padding
on the sides so let's do 0 20
cool okay so when it's big it looks good
when it's medium it's pretty good
and when it's small looks pretty good
too
I'm happy with that you guys happy with
that okay so this is gone along this
videos gone pretty far I hope I can edit
it down to her it's not you know two
hours that I spent doing it picking my
nose and everything else I've done and
if you guys want to spend another video
next week on like doing different kinds
of transitions here and kind of
organizing this up a little bit
differently than we can do that let me
know in the comments if you do want to
organize it differently otherwise I'm
gonna do you know what happens when you
click it I'm thinking you know this
whole anyway will be like some Java
scripting actually to get this working
thank you for watching to the end the
40th minute is always the best minute if
you enjoyed this video do what you do
like it share it tweet it you know hide
it under your pillow and save it for
later I don't know no judgments here is
judgement free zone and also guys hey
leave a comment down below and say if
you want me to spend more time on the
animations like the hover bits in the
work section I can make a few different
variations there we can talk about like
my approach to animations or you know if
you want to say just Travis just get on
with the work section and show us how to
you know do the rest of it we can do
that next week as well I want to hear
from you let me know in the blows gonna
be like a like a Simon Cowell you know
like like text now and your provider
will pay anyway mmm thanks for watching
everybody and keep on hacking I'll see
you next week
