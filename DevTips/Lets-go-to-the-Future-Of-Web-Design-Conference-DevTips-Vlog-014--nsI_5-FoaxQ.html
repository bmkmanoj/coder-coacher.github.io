future of web design conference
I love coming to conferences because I
love the community I love talking with
people but especially this conference
feature Web Design in San Francisco has
been great because I've been able to
have spent a lot of time with individual
speakers they're showing up to the the
stuff I've been able to spend time
talking to them after their sessions and
they've had some gradients and we just
finished watching Rachel Smith talk and
it was wonderful and I want to go work
on canvas now so mission accomplished
yesterday there was the talk about the
designers
coding it was always something that
we've talked about of my agency about
the designers wanting to know more about
how to actually get into the process
even now like hearing that it's really
inspiring okay like I can actually learn
community start doing things like she
mentioned a lot of like really great
ways of introducing it into a business
yeah
I really enjoyed foud which I just
learned that's how you pronounce it San
Francisco because of its venue I feel
like it keeps everybody sort of together
it's been really nice let me interact
with people on a one-to-one level that
feel like some of the larger conferences
and other venues where things move
around a lot as an impossible and it's
been fantastic just to see so many
people engaged I think the one thing
that they're doing that is very
interesting is the sort of office hours
with the speakers where people can get
some sort of one-on-one attention with
the work they're doing get some answers
I think that's unique with CSS and I
think that was really inspiring use
animations animations make interaction
these are notes from gentlemen this
morning she was talking about modern
modern layouts and designers being in a
rut so this was just kind of popping
yourself up she I trying to capture some
of the interesting stuff she's showing
like circle layouts that we were like
tissue Big Apple high drawn for it she
also talked about magazines oh and that
was really really cool she brought up
like boats of tender she is so I just
googled those and tried to copy me this
was in the next talk of the day so this
was greatly Smith she was talking about
free encoding a job as good as a before
skilled
Jane Simmons standard layout the boring
layout right I know she brought up a
court and so by by that I was listening
to other parts of the talk I was able to
just kind of when you start I started
one of my friends well I assume somebody
else sketchnoting at a conference
actually and then one of my friends was
like will you just do it you know I just
I was sitting in a lecture I just
started started drawing kind of dueling
they were terrible at first but like
they could still be terrible I don't
know I'm not a great like judge itself
thanks for sharing what's been your
favorite part of the conference so far
yeah favorite part has probably been
basically connecting a face to a lot of
these voices that I've already heard I
listen to a lot of podcasts so I was
able to finally see Jen Simmons in
person see des Trainor
so the web ahead inside intercom
actually like connecting a face to those
voices make me real yeah that's awesome
dude thanks for cheering yeah so I think
what's been really good about a number
of the talks is how the speakers have
also talks about applying this to the
macro-level so yes this might be like a
direct process of how you might be
working on a product or how you might
reply something but if you take that on
like a overall scale of what your career
is right like are you thinking about
milestones for yourself are you sending
like a product roadmap of what do you
want to be and you're still kind of
having that broadened out so that it's
not just you know how I check in and
here's my work of the day but it's like
well here's my work for myself
and here is my day-to-day which happens
to be a part of what that yeah like if
you have your t-shape as a designer is
your like long extended part actually a
job and could everything else on the
side is are those like maybe they're not
related to your design but they might
inform it right you might be very
inspired by cooking and I might be
playing in some facet of you know your
creative practice or outdoors and
exploring does that eat it everything
else so it's something that I've been
giving a lot of thought to it late and
it's good to kind of hear other way that
people identify yeah how'd you like the
conference how do I cool I know there's
a lot of inspirational thing what is the
favorite thing that you're inspired by
make good things like if you're at a
company and you're working on
whatever don't wait for approval and
just work on something that and when
inspiration hits them do it would you
like to see next time I'd love to see
more future of web design more future
design more future and experiments like
robots and 3d I don't know what that is
I don't know what the future is virtual
reality realities yeah what about you
John
I like oh they had a good selection of
snacks and I really appreciated that
right any conference by their snacks and
a lot of coffee was good
I wish there was more experimental
technology I really liked Rachel Smith's
talk on canvas is really rad hmm really
inspiring broke it down to like really
simple forms but I would like to see
some more futuristic weird stuff pushing
the boundaries of the internet instead
of systematizing it alright so we are
done with the conference right now we're
about to catch an uber down to go eat
some meals and then we're gonna be done
with the whole the whole thing so let's
go catch it
Uber's
Pacific growing company cific Brewing
