welcome to github for noobs haha I have
to get out but noobs this is the fourth
and last video of the series in the
first few videos we learned about the
history of github and how git is used
and a few common workflows then in the
most recent video we performed those
workflows using a desktop application
that's developed by the company github
so check those out if you haven't
already this week we're going to be
doing all those same actions that we did
last week but this time on the command
line now this is where I put my new
badge on because I have never done this
before in order to create this video I
had to go and like learn all the stuff
this week but you know what it's not
really that scary you thought I was
gonna jump scare you again how you
thought I was gonna I'm not I'm not
trust me I will never do that again and
to all the people that I made so your
pants I am very sorry about that and I
won't do it again
no more jump scares on this channel for
the rest of its existence I promise so
thinking back to our last video we want
to do all the things that will allow us
to recreate the functions of our last
video but this time in the command line
so I wrote a list of what we did we
cloned a repo or created a repo and
pulled it down from the server we made
changes like the pink background and so
forth and we committed them then we
created a new branch we switched
branches we did pull requests and we
learn how to delete branches in a series
that's intended to warm you guys up and
to help you to get comfortable with the
idea of using
and github this is a pretty good outline
and it's not everything get is way more
powerful than everything that we're
covering here but this is a great start
so let's do it on the command line okay
the first thing we said we wanted to do
was clone a repo cloning a repo is just
fancy get talk for taking something that
already exists and making it exist on my
local machine so taking it from the
server and bringing it down locally okay
in the last video you saw me make the
HTML and CSS I've already created that
stuff and it's in a repo on the server
so I'm gonna go to here it's called
github for noobs tubes it's the second
time we're using the same kind of code
layout owning a github repo is really
easy but the first thing I need to do is
think about where do I want to put it
once I grab it and put it on my local
system so let me go to my terminal here
and I want to change directory CD to my
desktop and when I'm on my desktop I
want to make Drive I'm gonna call it get
movie PO stuff what could get repos is
good okay so I've made a folder called
git repos on a change directory into git
- repos and now I'm inside git repos now
here's where I want to clone it to so
I'll go back to github I'm going to go
down here and click this button called
copy to clipboard and that just copies
the get URL not the page URL not this
that we're at but get URL and it copies
it to my clipboard now I'll type in git
clone and we're using git for the first
time here V and paste in there we are so
now it's pulling down all of the all of
the code and all of the the files in
that repository to my local drive keep
in mind that this tutorial does not
cover installing get through the command
line because last week when we use the
git application and we clicked do you
want to add command line tools that's
when we installed all this ability to
you know get clone and do all that stuff
so I'm not even going to cover adding
the git application through the command
line to your system I'm assuming that
you already have it so there's that okay
so now we have all those files in there
let's do an LS to see what folders we
pull down okay we got github for noobs
let's CD into
github for noobs - and now we're inside
of that and let's LS and see all the
files are in there we have an index and
style great so we can if we have Adam
installed like I do you can type Adam
and a space dot and that will open Adam
within the currently focused directory
of terminal so when I hit enter it'll
open Adam and it will open in that
directory that we're working on so let
me get this over there so as you can see
here in Adam this is the same HTML and
CSS from the last video we don't need to
get into what those are but we want to
go down here and to the very bottom of
the CSS and make a small change
so we'll say body background pink and
save it and then when we open that file
in our browser we want to check that
that is indeed pink okay so now let's go
back to our terminal let me if you press
command K with the terminal you can just
clean up everything all with the
previous history of text there what I
want to do now is just make sure that
that that change has been kind of like
noticed by git and so I want to say git
status okay
git status is a command that will just
kind of give you the the hundred-yard
view of what it is like right now so it
says that we're on our master branch the
branch is up to date meaning that
there's there's no commits on our on the
server that are not locally we have all
that locally and we have a few changes
that are not staged which is this we
have one file that's modified and see
how it's read that means it's not ready
to be committed yet get do you remember
the check marks that were in the in the
application and I said that you have to
have these things checked in order to
make the commit this is the the
correlator here on on the terminal is
that they have to be air quotes added so
what we're going to do is we're going to
get add get add style dot CSS and hit
enter and now it's been added so
to another get status oops that's not
even a thing get status okay and we can
see that where again we're on master
branch and these changes are added so
it's now it's green it's not red that
means it's ready to be committed okay so
we're going to make this commit me press
K to remove all that craft there so get
status is that we're ready to go now the
the command on the command line
to commit these changes to the
repository and the branch that I'm
working on right now which is master
branch is git commit now remember how in
the github application we have a space
to write comments and stuff there it's
always a really great idea to write
comments to do that you want to write -
mmm mmm needs means message yeah it
means message and then you'll write a
within the quotes what is the message
what did we do and we'll just write made
the BGA pink and then end my quote and
then I'll make that commit great so one
file changed and five insertions which
means new lines so I tab down a little
bit and then made the three lines okay
so now we've made a commit I know how
scary and weird this crap is so take a
moment to give yourself a pat on the
back because you just made your first
commit on the command line you're
exceptional and your mother loves you
unless she doesn't then I love you so
can I give you a hug that's a good good
good job all right next we're going to
do a git status to make sure that our
commit is looking good so we're on our
master master branch and my branch is
ahead of the mass of the origin master
origin means that it's on the server
origin is far away local is what we're
working on
so our origin master it were ahead of
that by one commit right so the next
thing it's giving me a prompt to use git
push to publish my local commits to to
my origin right to sync it up that way
oh and we can do that but before we do
that I want to show you something else
let's go back to our code and just
remove that
line and save we can verify that in our
browser so our backup background is back
to being that gray color and remember
how in the last example of this I wrote
get add and then the you know the file
name it's kind of tedious like what if
you what if you're working for like a
half an hour or a while and you've got
like seven files or thirty files I do
you have to go there and write get add
get add get add that's a little tedious
so it gives us a shortcut to do that you
can add and commit at the same time and
this is this is the shortcut get - a
means add everything and then - em for
your message and I'll say removed the
pink BG okay see I made a new mistake I
wrote get - a what does get nothing okay
so what I should have written was this
git commit - a - M removed the the pink
BG get commit at a still a noob remember
I'm still a noob all right now what have
we done we have removed the pink
background one file changed what that
did was added the file and committed it
in one brush and if you have like 30
files it will add them all and commit
them all and add that one message so
this is like a shortcut it'll save you
time a time you don't have to add one at
a time I know you're worried about that
so I'm glad that you know we talked this
out I'm glad we had this talk let's
press command K to clear all this all
this messaging up I'll show you another
cool command called git log and this
will show you all of your commits over
time right the most recent one was
removed the pink background but here's
the made the background pink and
remember when we were setting up our get
we put our name and like our email so
like we could figure out who did this
and it's like if you're looking at like
a commit history from that you've
inherited a code base you can see who
made all these changes and when so
that's pretty good and then this right
here is called the commit hash
we're not going to deal with that today
but that is kind of like a it's a unique
identifying number to this commit
message or this commit so um that's all
cool you press Q to get out of this like
I couldn't figure out how to get out of
logs the situation for a while like I
was like how do I get out of this I
can't type anything it's weird
how you get out of this as you press the
letter Q okay now we're back to normal
press command K to clear everything up
all right now let's again say that
someone came to our desk and said you
know what would be awesome is if we
didn't have a gray or a pink background
but we had a lavender background I'll
have endure background it's such a crazy
idea it's such a crazy idea that I don't
want to do it on my master branch I want
to create a new branch so we're going to
do with a command line right now just
similar what we did in the last video
we're going to create a new branch
called crazy idea you're right get
checkout and then right - be for
creating a new branch and then the name
of the new branch which is called crazy
they're Hydra they're crazy idea
so get checkout me and switch branches
and putting that - B means it's going to
be a new branch and then the name of the
new branch crazy idea so hit enter and
then switched to new branch crazy idea
pretty awesome right you can type in any
time type git branch and this will give
you like an overview of all the branches
that are on your local system now I have
two I have master and then I have
created a idea and crazy idea has an
asterisk and it's green to let me know
that this is the one that I'm looking at
if I go to Adam I can see that I'm on
branch crazy idea right here it's pretty
cool
and if I want to switch back to master I
right get checkout master and then I've
switched the Brandt the branch to master
and you can see that it branch master is
ahead of origin by two commits kids and
then we switch to Adam we have the
master branch and then this little up
two means that it's ahead of origin by
two commits meaning we added the
background pink and we took it away
those are the two commits
that we made so let's switch back to a
git checkout what's the one called oh
did you guys notice if you press the up
arrow on your keyboard right here it
like just cycles through all of the
previous things you've written ever even
if they're wrong so if I go up and go
back to get checkout and I could write
crazy idea there and now I'm back to
switch to branch the crazy idea so let's
make a change to crazy idea let's make
the background lavender that's the high
spell lavender that is and we'll save
that again confirm that with our browser
here and then and then we'll do a git
commit get commit em here our message is
going to be VG to lavandier so I'll look
at we're noobs again we got an error it
says we these changes were not staged
for the commit so we made a commit but
they had no changes in it I guess or
maybe it didn't know no change is added
to the commit I wish I could get see
yeah interesting
okay let's try that again uh go up get
commit - a to add them all and then - em
and then we wanted to call it a VG -
laughs great that was what we wanted to
do now let's switch back to our master
and refresh our browser and it should be
gray because the lavender is on the blab
under branch and then so that's what I
just wanted to show you so let's go
let's get checkout crazy idea again and
switch back now it's lavender so you see
what's happening of course you do
because you're not a noob anymore you're
growing we're all growing so now is the
hard part
what we want to do is we have this
lavender background
proved and we all agree that it's the
best idea in the world
but now we need to tuck it back into the
master branch we need to do what we did
last week called a pull request and so
my noobish is coming out right now if
you guys know better than me like leave
a comment down below but I did a lot of
research to try to find out when a lot
means like I googled for two minutes but
like it like I couldn't figure out how
to do this and I found something that
looked close but in the end it wasn't
it's called request pull like get
requests pollen and I don't know that it
wasn't what I was thinking it was so
here's what we're going to do to get
that pull request happening when you're
using github and get remember we're in
branch crazy idea right now so what we
want to do is we want to push this crazy
idea up to get push the whole branch so
here's how you here's how you push a
branch that you've created locally up to
github I'm going to write git push and
then - - set - up stream and then I want
it to go to my origin which is on github
and I'm going to push the branch crazy
idea now don't worry if you can't
remember this all just google it you
know how do I do a git push and it's
there it's really easy to find get
actually has some pretty great
documentation so I'm gonna hit enter
right here and now what we're doing is
we're pushing our local git or local
crazy idea branch up to github so it
looks like we've done that let's go over
to github and hit refresh now we have
the branch here master and when we click
into branches we can see crazy idea is
an option and we also have this new
yellow alert line here this is pretty
great what github does it says oh you
just pushed up a branch called crazy
idea do you want to create a pull
request right there and I'm thinking
like you know I kind of do so let's do
that so let me click this button compare
and create a pull request and remember
that little graphic that we had of
master and with the crazy idea going
into it last week this is the same here
this is the base and we're pulling in
crazy idea and github has checked it and
said yeah there's no conflicts with this
code it's good to merge so we can just
you know write a message like this is
the best idea ever
and then create a pull request
now I'm pretending I'm a different
person and we go and like see okay look
look there's no conflicts we all agree
that this is the best idea
fr and here all the changes made looks
pretty good let's merge it into the
master and I'll write merge to master
confirm and it looks like our pull
request has been accepted successfully
merged and closed this pull request is
closed let's delete the branch like we
did last time and now we have if we go
back to our branch list we have just one
we just have just master but if we go
back to our command line and let's clean
this up and we type git branch we can
see that we have two two branches and we
want to kind of get rid of this extra
branch it's already been merged up what
we're going to do now is we're going to
switch over to master and then we're
going to pull in the changes that
happened over on the server on
github.com and then we're just going to
delete our local version of get a crazy
idea so here's how we're going to do
that get checkout master and we've
switched to the master branch this is
great and so now we want to pull all the
information from the server onto our
local master because they had the PO
request up there and we need to get that
so we'll write get pull and that's going
to pull all everything down from master
now we get status we're the same nope
yeah I did mean status thank you get
Stan
test your branch is up to date that's
what we wanted okay and the next thing
we need to do is delete the crazy idea
how to clear that with command K and
then we write git branch and then we'll
check out all the branches right we're
on master crazy ideas also there well
write again get branch and then after
that we'll write - - delete and then the
name of the branch want to delete which
is crazy idea and this happened let's
look at git branch again what did I just
create a branch called delete oh I think
it's because I put a space right here
whoa Travis you're such a noob right now
alright okay I mean it's called github
for noobs
let's fix this get branch a space base
or - - delete and then delete because
we're deleting this is embarrassing so
we're deleting the Brett called delete
okay and then we'll do git branch to
check out our branches now alright we
just have the two branches you can and
then we'll do that same thing get branch
delete but this time we call it crazy I
can't believe we created RIT alright and
then get branch and now we only have
master fantastic and then for good
measure let's just do a good old
fashioned get stabbed
at us and we have one branch and it's
master and it's up to date with our
origin and there's nothing to commit
working directory is clean that is an
awesome message that makes me happy on
all my inside parts ah we did it when a
lot of noobs okay well we're still noobs
right I mean between you and me we're
noobs but the truth is you kind of want
to stay noobish as long as you can and
there's just like something really
freeing about being like hey I have a
noob I don't know what I'm doing but I
can learn that's what noobs do so stay
hungry stay noobish you know there's a
group of people who love dev tips and
they believe in what we're doing here so
much so they decided it'd be a good idea
to donate a dollar or two for every
tutorial video that I make now this is
not the vlogs or the whatever other
videos these are just the tutorial
videos that come out every Monday these
people get the video is early and they
also get live hangouts dev tips chat
check out patreon.com/crashcourse early
twenty hour long day in which I'm making
videos going to work at Google making
podcasts hanging out with my family
the whole thing is in there if you're
interested in the vlog II type of
content from dev tips it's this this is
one you don't want to miss all right
everyone keep on hacking by you know
what time it is
yo noobs you know yo noobs yo noobs you
know what time it is
welcome to github the noobs you know
what time it is yo noobs you know what
time it is
welcome to github the noobs
we did it I have no idea what its gonna
be but it's gonna be awesome I'm sure
somebody told me help me Jesus
hmm okay ah we did it long noobs okay
well we're still news</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
