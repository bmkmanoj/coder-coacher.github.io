like artsy and craftsy kind of time so
we're actually gonna call this video
super fun times with drop shadow making
awesome buttons calm and that's gonna be
the name of it and then um so what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to show you a lot
of different ways to make interesting
little quickie buttons using the dynamic
CSS property of box shadow does that
sound fun that sounds that sounds a lot
of fun let's jump let's let's dive in I
have a page set up here on the right and
codings here on the left for our HTML
structure we have just a headline that
you know talks about what we're doing
today and then a few HR which are
horizontal rules and these going to be
the rules between each of these buttons
and then the focus of our lesson today
is on these buttons themselves I have
six button setup and I want to use
interesting methods of box-shadow to
make them exciting when you do hovers
and different things like that so let's
look so jumping into the CSS I'm going
to collapse this HTML here so we need to
see the CSS what we have is I'm
importing a font open sans to get the
you know nice font style there and then
I'm using some colors pre-selected by
murmurs or mr. mrs. I'm not sure how he
pronounces his name he's a cool guy uh
and his website that he made for these
colors is colors dot CC and it's just
like a bunch of actually color variables
that are nicely selected colors so I
don't have to like last time I googled
blue I don't have to do that this time I
have them prepared okay uh and then
here's some general styles my body is
going to have a padding of 50 and text
everything is aligned Center and I'm
using the font open sans I have my h2
font weight is 800
is thirty and for the color and for the
margin-bottom
for these h2 which is the headline and
then for my rules I'm just given it I'm
going to make my width forty percent
it's centered and it's going to have a
certain color to pixels talked done okay
those are the generals now we have the
style for the general button it's not a
general button it's a button in general
it doesn't have any rank in the military
it's a button this button is inline
block that's so I can get it to work
well with margins and padding's and so I
have the padding sent to set to 1 M and
to M one M on the top and bottom to him
on the left and right that shorthand
this is not a SAS thing that shorthand
will work in CSS as well font size 18
text-decoration:none I don't want an
underline up under it because these are
an anchor tag so they will by default
line so I remove that and margin around
it I want space around it to make it
look nice letter spacing border radius
is going to be like these little borders
here and the background is olive okay
let's jump in I have each of these
buttons with it labeled with a class in
succession so the first one is called 1
2 3 &amp;amp; 4 so I can I can target them
directly to make cool classes cool class
is okay uh let's do one what do we want
to do here let's say that uh when we
hover it it gets a box shadow Oh a box
shadow shorthand is the first number is
the offset from the left or topic a
number and then the other one is the O
on whichever the first one wasn't so
let's say it's the left and then top so
I'm not offsetting it all and in a
second the third property is blur so
like how how much spread on the blur or
like awesome or whatever and I'm not
going to do anything so I means it's
going to be hard line and and be
and in the fourth property which you
probably don't see a lot is going to be
the actual spread so how far away from
the edge is that blur going to start
taking place and I want it to take a
place to pixels from the edge on a call
of the color white because our
background is white and then I'm going
to make another drop shadow so there's
going to be two and then when you do to
drop shadows though the way that they're
layered is you start closest to you and
move back back back back back so this
would this white one is going to be in
front of the next one we declare into
zero pixels or pixels zero pixels for
the blur again and a spread I'm going to
say four pixels and I'm gonna make it
that all with color and let's see what
we got
oh my sexy goodness look at that and it
animates - I did transition right here
see this is a in sass in the indented
flavor you don't have to put a mix app
directive mix in you know like f mixin
you just write plus transition and plus
transition is a mix in that is available
in bourbon you'll notice that here on
core code pen I'm using a bourbon to
help me out which is just a bunch of mix
ins that are helpful mostly just kind of
removing mostly just removing now
prefixing and stuff but here we go hey
let's go to number two see another sexy
button style too and I'll make this one
back drowned
it's a cool color who we got here let's
make it mmm
blue of course not pound but there you
go
for you blue your blue now okay and then
for the
and however let's see okay this time I'm
going to take my box shadow because this
lesson is all about shadows box
shadow and say do the hard lines as well
and say I want it to be one pixel and I
want to use that same color blue and
then wanna make it insect hmm inset Oh
instead of going out of the border it's
going to go in we're going in the second
one I'm going to do another another drop
shadow pixel pixel pixel pressure no
pressure low particular I want to make
this one just good too
is that certain yeah so the spread is
going to be to or sorry that whatever
this attribute feature I don't know and
I'm gonna make this one white so when we
get this one ready it should be like it
should be like oh that's not insect it
should be like Boop see look at that it
looks kind of like the Gmail not I'm
seeing it looks like the Gmail compose
button I like it it's pretty sexy pretty
sexy
okay um let's do another one
try something for three over Fox I
change the color on three chains Colin
he chokes we all these really awesome
colors we could use its use fuchsia bro
oh my gosh for totally using fuchsia
okay and then for hey you should be
fuchsia oh it's not compiling in the box
show won't see fuchsia oh it's cute
okay um for this one I'm gonna make
actually I want to take the
border-radius off here
network no and what am I going to do
it's okay I got a good idea on day two
pixels white and actually no I want to
not spread it I'm going to move this
when I offset this two pixels down to
the right into two off the top and to
the left and then make four pixels four
pixels zero pixels zero pixels I don't
even need to declare this this last one
if I'm not spreading it at all
and make it FUS I think I have it in my
clipboard okay ah-oh need a hyphen
oh it's over huh
I forgot it dude on hover anyway so
here's a cool hover one I was thinking
it wasn't I didn't know that ever I
thought is going to be like this just on
which is kind of cool actually the hover
is kind of cool so I can be like what if
we what if we did this position all
right watch this pixels actually need to
be need and the Left negative four
pixels
huh I don't like that and the reason is
one thing is going faster than the other
okay if you don't want to why would top
and left me jumpy like that they're not
covered in my transition it should be
because you're in a however oh it's
because I'm not declaring anything for
them when it's not alright so top zero
and I'm going to say pixels so that
they're in the same kind of like
language of not language but spectrum of
I don't even have the word for it but
like if it was percent jumping the
pixels it'd be like confuse so I'm gonna
say zero pixels so that it knows how to
get to negative four pixels right now
it's jumping because it's like nothing
is declared to negative four pixels so I
was like Oh negative four pixels so
let's try this at left let's see if
daddy's right let's see if daddy's right
and I'm a hover over it and it's gonna
up daddy's right the you don't be a
dollar uh okay so this is a cool button
I kinda think it's kind of fun I come
inside out set hmm what about let's
reverse this one from number four let's
say number four box shadow
and I want to take that board radius off
too
though that didn't take border-radius
off none is not our correct property
yeah there we go look at that it's even
cooler no actually it doesn't
I like this one the fuchsia you can keep
your board radius I didn't ever wanted
it anyway for you're coming with me
box-shadow what am I going to do here
okay I'm gonna set a look true color
going to be bro I can't even focus on
the budget okay box-shadow you're gonna
be um five pixels five pigs slope five
pixels zero blur pixels and you're gonna
be CK Brown PAHO what number calls uh
let's do some yella that's nice
some yellows oh that is a nice yellow
it's certainly a nice yellow all right a
back wall you're going to be yellow too
oh okay so you see how it's offset there
I can see like the difference you know I
make this hole bigger sure done Swami
sorry everybody
so seems like I got that offset here on
the corner I can if we see that it is
showing up there but I want to make it
so this is a cool SAS thing lighting by
20% that's it yeah that's nice but it
needs more oh that's too much a 30
that's cool that's cool
okay so let's do it to where um here's
another bourbon shortcut or mixin
position:relative and then you can set
these like this actually these bottom
wait
it goes top right left which I bought a
top right a bottom left
in this particular mixin if you don't
want it to be declared you leave it at
zero so the so the with the CSS that
this will output is position:relative
top pik CIL's and left zero pixels which
is good shorthand I was easy to write
and for the hover and hoe and hover over
a brick let's make it
now you have five pixels what am i doing
this three time left is negative five
pixels - and that box shadow you are
going to be zero pixels or pixels zero
pixels lighten yella let's see what we
got uh-oh
okay it was jumping up because of those
negative five was pulling it right left
I need to push it down and suck that
there we go it's like I'm like bouncing
on it that would be good actually good
actually for like active and then it
would give you like this normally and
you can push it down maybe but it takes
too long maybe five pixels too many but
let's move on you the idea there it's up
I'm over it let's make it over and hover
and here's a cool on color saturate you
are saturate
Lelo by 10 percent so let's call it
background what the
it's saturating but not enough saturate
50% there's something happening that's
too dark buddy I'm going to darken it
10% saturate didn't work well to me
because it was like already a saturated
color pretty much very color there you
go
so it's going to be nice bright yellow
harbor over it's too dark still make
that 3% how there we go nice darkens a
little bit button-down done okay next
one four no five how many of these are
we doing looks like we have six okay
you're not green anymore
background big room Oh what color shall
you be Oh nice purple mmm thank you
that's a nice purple these are good
colors oops wonderful what can we do
here what can we do here do here ooh
what about like this is gonna be weird
let's try it out box shadow and we'll do
like one pixel zero pixels or pixels
white
and three pixels to zero pixels purple
oh okay
and then on the take-up border-radius
zero and then it was actually ahead it
wrong is these guys alright what a why
was this line across the bottom of it
huh okay and now I'm thinking is there a
way to
hmm now at box-shadow I don't think I
wanted to do like a line that we moved
around and stuff but now I'm looking at
it I'm like Vox shadow is always going
to be represent the shape of its parent
so one thing I'm going to do something
entirely different this is not Vox
shadow based first sort of make your
position relative because I'm going to
do some weird stuff inside of you it's a
good way to pick up girls oh I still
want it background color purple okay and
then let's take a pseudo element of
after now after this is nothing and
let's play a block and I want Don to be
visible so display:block I want to give
it to mention something give it a width
of 100% of its parent yeah and a high of
height of three no two pixels and a
bathroom Oh what see we got the padding
mate throw me throwing it off yeah looks
like it underlying it's not what I want
it's not what I want what I want is this
position:absolute I can get rid of that
because I'm gonna be doing it old-school
zero so I don't care the top the right
is going to be one pixel bottom in one
pixel and left Cindy one pixel see we
got yeah that's what I wanted except
around it again
scrolling is killing me um that looks
more than one pixel on the bottom oh
it's just my zoom level okay that's cool
that's cool
okay okay let's do and hover after so
this is saying referring to the parent
element which is five and say my hover
over five take after and do these styles
to it which is left
animate to do to be like ten pixels and
right ten pixels and I need to put on
after this transition mixing too so that
will work
Wow looks good let's try it oh that's
cool
how about how about I change these to
percents
now I can do 50 and 50 so it will like
disappear entirely
see ya looks interesting I don't know
that's interesting let's do this before
before as well and before and then we
really enable say or make sure that you
don't actually over the top there you go
over the bottom is going to pay you tow
and top is whether they say 1% um and
after before nope that's not what I
wanted what if this and before now
they'll both animate
that's interesting I don't know if I
like it let's just move on okay now
number five six okay and for this last
one let's just do a cool thing dinghy um
we'll call this background color aqua
and box-shadow so - their tram is zero
pixels zero pixels four pixels aqua Oh
flight
lighten it about 10% okay and then next
foods not a koala that's the that's
thrown me the error right there all
right
okay that's giving me the error and then
I want to move these pixels down by one
each see my very good that's pretty good
here we go we will see that fade that is
nice is that nice that's nice right yeah
okay well uh all you have to do is you
know plug your internet in and press go
and then the internet builds and then
after that you can have fun with Fox
shadows
lesson learned have a happy Monday guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
