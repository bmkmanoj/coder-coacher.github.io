dev tips ah a little while ago we
finished a big project called design and
code my personal website in 12 hours we
ended up with this and I'm really happy
with it is my personal website I think
it represents myself really well what I
want to do today is see if we can
enhance this top section here by adding
a video background we're going to start
by figuring out how to do that full
screen background across the whole
browser but after that I'm going to go
back to that website and I'm going to do
just the About section and you can see
how both of those work so now let's just
get started the files that I'm using a
very basic right now we have an
index.html and I have a style CSS which
is blank I also have a poster dot ping
this is just a screenshot I took of
nothing of just the desktop because I
didn't have anything else and then
there's the vine mp4 and then the vibe
vine dot web M mp4 is the video file web
m is the video file also there's going
to be two formats of it so though all
browsers can use this that what the
project that we're doing now what I did
is I just took my mp4 and I did it just
googled mp4 to web em in any of those
websites fold will just convert it
really easily but let's continue on
right here so I'm gonna go to my
index.html and I'm just really easily
going to create a video tag video and
then end the tag and then I want to
close the tag right here by going video
done that's how you do a video tag html5
easy there's a few attributes inside and
the first one is going to be poster and
poster is going to be the source of the
image that will show up if the if the
browser can't play video or it can't
find the video or there's like a problem
playing the video it's going to show the
poster so we want to have like it's kind
of come back up before the video it's a
static image and I made a poster ping
which is I just screenshotted my desktop
as I work so here's this is the video
and post your ping shows up as the back
as likethey as the substitute for the
actual moving videos so let's go inside
of that video tag and put a few of these
things called source
and the source is going to have an SRC
attribute like a source in the source at
whatever and we're going to look for
these these files here a vine
okay so vine mp4 and let's do another
one oh and you want to say type type
equals video slash mp4 all right now
when I copy this and paste it right
below and this time I'm going to say
WebM and save there's a few other
attributes that you can put inside that
video one of them is going to be
autoplay and autoplay you can you can
just write autoplay or autoplay equals
true and now it just starts playing I
have my computer muted so you don't hear
it but this is a vine that I did a while
ago and see how it gets to the end and
just stops all right the attribute loop
and this time it should go through and
he's going to be running and then the
loop again okay so that's kind of what
we want for this it's a full screen
background we just want it to kind of
like be playing and then like looping
and you don't want it to kind of ever
stop if we wanted to be really advanced
with it we could tell JavaScript to like
say if it's in the viewport play if we
scroll out of the viewport don't play
but right now I just want to show you
how to make this video fullscreen and
you guys can like maybe we'll come back
to this or whatever but that's the
mission today is just make this
fullscreen first of all let's take this
body and the HTML that we're in and
remove the margins 0 and padding:0 now
see how that videos like right up tight
against the top of the browser that's
good next we want to say video and we
can put a class on this video and call
it but there's only one video element in
this so I'm just doing it by the
just calling it by the tag name video
we're gonna say position:absolute and
then we want to top we're going to
basically Center if you guys haven't
seen the centering video that I did on
dev tips while ago this is all of that
kind stuff so I'm just going to quickly
do this left 50% can I put these closing
things I'm used to SAS and then I'm
going to do transform translate a
negative 50% comma negative 50% and that
will pull it up there okay oh it's weird
why is it not centered oh you got a
spell it right position
Posey Shawn okay now it's centered in my
viewport
let's go and just stretch it so we're
going to say mm minimum width is 100%
easy minimum height 100%
see now this see that the white on the
bottom and the top
I'm 100 pixels 100% that will the white
uh so so what we're doing is saying the
minimum width and the minimum height are
both 100 cent so if if it needs to be
100% in this case the height is going to
take it all the way and then if we're
going to squeeze it in the other aspect
ratio it's going to be a 100 cent why it
so it's going to make the video bigger
so this is like a great way it's kind of
like saying background size cover it's
very very similar to that and then we're
going to go and just make sure that
things are looking good all the time and
then it keeps this aspect ratio by
saying with Auto and in high auto
that's just going to in make sure that
it keeps its aspect ratio all the time
everything that you expect okay so this
is a full-screen of video here we can do
let's see we can do a little bit more
work with it let's put it in a container
div class container and then we're also
going to put a div class equals text
okay so now the video is inside of a
container and then there is a there's
also a sibling of the video it's called
text and there's just like a bunch of
random text in it so let's go back to
our style and say text z-index too and
then we'll put z-index here make it one
so we want to get that text on top of
the on top of the video or are you text
or are you not on top and z-index to
oaks you need a position:relative
z-index doesn't work unless the unless
the position is declared
so now as soon as I declared it doesn't
need to be absolutely can be relative or
fixed but then z-index will work so
that's why I think more so now we have
text on top of the video let's put the
text in let's say let's say background
RGB a make it black opacity of like 40
percent
now let's stretch it out say top:0
bottom:0 left zero zero and right zero I
need to say position:absolute okay now I
put an overlay on top of this video I
could change the hue of it so it's now
it's a red overlay on top of the video
and you could even put like a gradient
across the top of the video and change
you can do a lot with this stuff okay so
this is this is very basically putting
text on top of a full screen video and
putting an overlay on top of the video
now what I want to do is share with you
how I'm going to use this on my website
okay this is how my website currently
works and I'm not going to take you
through writing the code and everything
was it because I just did it in the last
section but I want to show you how I did
it and I'll show you the code and then
you guys can see it on github but here
in this area we have the Travis is
trying to grow up section and then
there's a background image on that on
that area on that section and it's my
face what I wanted to do is say if if it
can do it replace that face with a video
and so in the Indy Jade I did exactly
what I showed you before and here are
the two sources called Travis and when I
save you'll see that it'll refresh and
you'll see a video there instead of the
background image
so now there's a creepy video of
Travis's face doing things instead of so
weird instead of just the still image
and that's fun here's a few differences
from what I did a few minutes ago in the
fullscreen video and what happened here
number one is that I did not have a
poster in the video it's blank and the
reason for that is that I use the
background of the section as the air
quotes poster so I didn't want to have a
still image inside of the video player I
wanted to have a still image inside of
the container parent which works out
just to be the same like if this video
doesn't play there's still an image
going on right there and that's why when
I just commented out these video sources
you could see the image behind it which
is basically two in one in seven other I
don't know that phrase but it's
basically the same thing so next let's
go to this sass have this work out well
in the About section
I made it relative and overflow:hidden
so if I take this overflow:hidden off
you'll see that the video is a lot
larger than its parent container and I
did that so that you know when it's
responsive it can have different
proportions but it's overflow:hidden and
then we did some positioning here to get
it positioned in the right place the
z-index one to put it behind the text
Travis is trying to grow up men hi
everything that you've seen already this
is I mean it's pretty a one-to-one
transition right there from the first
project into this project the difference
being it's contained into a strip and
it's behind text that's already there
and that's how I made my website a
little bit more creepy it's fun huh
