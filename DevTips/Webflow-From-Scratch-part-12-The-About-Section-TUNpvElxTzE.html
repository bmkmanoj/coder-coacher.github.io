midweek here because there's a few
things that I wanted to do and finish in
this project that it didn't get done in
the first video and next week I want to
start on the new section right so in the
first video I wanted to do the header
and the first section and I only got the
header done so let's get let's get that
first section done right now I'm gonna
call this video like 1.2 or something
like that because section 2 is gonna be
episode 2 anyhow let's talk about this
section so what I want to do is have
each of these sections have like a
common spacing and feel so this first
section is actually going to be kind of
critical because just like CSS you
define these things and then use them
later so the first thing I do is to drag
out this section here and to the body
and now a section in webflow is that
100% container it in container it's
funny I'm using the words container in
web flow means that it's constricted and
width and it kind of floats to the
middle so I want every one of these
sections 1 2 3 to be in a in a section
block and I'll give that section block a
class like home - section and then I'll
reuse this styling for each one of them
so they have a consistent look and
spacing and right now I need the spacing
is to get out from under that beard so
I'm gonna drag up on this margin control
drag out maybe let's do it 80 pixels 80
pixels get out from under that beard
it's hard I know the beard is ominous it
gets in the way but it's worth it so we
have a home section let's drag out a
container and inside of that container
we can give it a class of what this
class was it's called class container so
if I give this container then it will
see right now and if I give this the
container it will can let's see ill yeah
it'll have the padding's that I put on
the other one earlier so we'll maintain
that same kind of like a vertical rhythm
and in that container
let's drag out a heading a headline and
we'll say one
about the - this is losest copy - dudes
in the cantina and if you guys are not
familiar with the cantina the cantina is
the place where we record our podcast
it's outdoors when we invite guests we
all sit in the backyard
around a table and like hang out and
record it it's pretty great so let's
let's change this to like an h2 so it's
not quite the site title which I usually
reserved for an h1 but a section title
is a good h3 and like you know like a
like a sidebar is good for an age 3
that's my opinion that's just kind of
like how I've been doing it for years
it doesn't really mean anything so let's
say go and style all the h2 headings
okay first of all let's get some color
here and pick that color here for the
h2s our gonna be this dark deep purple
color you can be size 32 is fine I want
to spread out the font a little bit
right here let's do some tracking one
pixels good that looks pretty good
what if we did font size or font weight
not bold but just like normal
no I like it bold good call what Louis
alright let's drag out two paragraphs
here's a paragraph put it inside of that
container and let's drag out another one
paragraph and these are already lorem
and my designer did not specify like
like if you read this it looks good
right here but if you read it it's just
like you know you got it from like some
like article or something so it's not
really intentional copy
so I'm putting both these paragraphs
inside of the container which they
didn't go when I dragged him into whoa
whoa whoa is this container flexed
okay this container is not flexed is
this container flexed those containers
no flex either huh okay four paragraph
tags I want let's see there's ten pixels
the bottom here let's put 20 on there
and for this h2 let's go back to it and
do the padding and sizing here we have
20 at the top we wanted to make that
zero and we want to put 20 in the bottom
now it has a little bit more of a
genuine rhythm in this section here
maybe it needs let's go up to the home
section it needs a little bit more than
80 let's just try 100 okay it looks good
that looks good ish this paragraph tag
can be a little bit font size could be
16 that's good and the let's see we have
pixels here - okay if you this is cool
so you can select the the unit right
here and it can go two M's or percents
line-height has a dash so if you put no
units on a line height it's just a
multiplier of what the the the height of
the text is it's kind of like saying m
but let's just say one point six to get
that nice line height less for the one
point eight there we go so it's a pretty
good line height there looks pretty good
is this a specific font color
let me change that color here there
there you go I like that I like that
color
all right how are we doing okay next
thing we need is a video video and there
we go
drop it in there you can just set a
video url here let me just grab one of
my dev tips URLs or YouTube videos
and let's do let's do one of these vlogs
let's check out our vlog so what good
vlog do we have here I like the colors
of this thumbnail so we'll say save link
copy link address and then you just put
the whole link address here in the video
right here and it's thinking I turned
over it's pretty nice so the whole the
video just shows up and oh it's the it's
part of the playlist too which is cool
and I can play it in Lion let me go to
preview kind of play in line yeah looks
like again good morning Oh sleepy Trev
I'm do that anymore
let's refreshed on how to look at my
face right okay cool
so next is this join the newsletter
button down here let's see if we got
like a button command or a button like
thing here's a button put that in
in here put it in the container okay
let's see I'm gonna put a clasp on here
it's a special class I'll call it news
letter newsletter - button and news
letter button yeah okay and the thing is
this needs to be text centered right now
its parent does maybe I can put a div
block here and then move the button into
the div block and on the div block go
text - center and then go to Center okay
and I also want to put on the button
this is newsletter button I want to add
just 20 pixels of margin top maybe
actually more how much did let's put
here he had 50 okay 50 and we want the
padding to be a little bit more extreme
maybe like 25 25 and 50 button text
should be enjoying our and news letter
oops
and it's this purple here
and the background color display
background good and the padding should
be a little bit more aggressive here -
let's just say 20 and and the font size
can be 18 I think and letter-spacing 1 -
oh says join out a newsletter join our
newsletter and and that looks like
pretty good except for these proportions
are a little wrong so right here the
designer said about 50 pixels from the
top here and about 40 pixels in between
so let's go back to the paragraph here
and how many paragraph we said bottom
margin was 20 let's make it 30 and then
we'll just say for the video a video
class is gonna have margins of 20 and
well not 20 I guess magic
oh okay there isn't that fifty and let's
do 50 here two and then remove it from
that button okay
cool that looks a little bit better how
much did he actually plan for here 150
didn't I give it like 80 or something
home section 100 okay 150 there you go
that's a little bit better I also
noticed that this is why and I chose
great for some reason may reverse that
get that back white just zero it out and
then we have this drop shadow here which
just come looking at it like I get it
it's alright but what if we didn't have
any drop shadow a toll how about that
the that looks just as fine right when
we scroll down why don't we keep this
header fixed and then add that drop
shadow on scroll let's try to do that in
another video but this is gonna be
pretty much all I wanted to do like in
this quick video and hopefully you guys
have a good middle of the week and I'll
see you on Monday for episode 2 thanks
for watching keep on hacking all that
stuff goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
