is the last video of the day it's now
for 16 in the morning these videos are
gonna be released in just a few hours
and I thought you know instead of just
doing the the time-lapse videos and how
fun that was I thought it might be good
to pause for thee and just kind of
review the work that we did this weekend
and I'm gonna be screen capturing this
thing right here and scrolling through
scrolling through it and kind of making
commentary on what I think was
successful about this design and
execution and what I think could be
improved hopefully I'll be kind of
making a road map for updates and
improvements that I want to be doing off
camera in the next week or so before the
launch of this three videos jQuery learn
jQuery 15 minutes and and eventually the
course that I'll be developing in the
background too so we've got a lot of
work to do and we've done a lot of work
already I'm really proud generally of
what I'm doing here so let's talk about
it let's kind of do a design review
alright so let's get started let's throw
up a screen capture of what I'm looking
at this is the home page the home page
of the dev tips show calm really and
I've mentioned this before it really
just exists the reason I created it this
weekend is because I wanted to create a
landing page for a course that I'll be
developing but the home page needed to
exist in case anybody went to the home
page of the URL so until previously dev
tips show calm I owned the URL but
nothing was on it it was just kind of
like just parked I guess so here what we
have now is a home page for the dev tips
show this is not about the jQuery course
in general this is about the about the
show so I wanted to like kind of think
okay what what what does the show mean
well the most important thing about the
show the most impactful thing about show
are actually the video so I wanted to
put a video front and center and I chose
this one what
would you give yourself and it's
interesting I go to a meet-up and I talk
to people about advice that they would
give themselves so it's so it's really
good for a lot of the audience who likes
like step tips people that want to learn
more people that are just like in you
know curious and recite 'fl people I
think this video does really well for
them and represents the kind of content
that I enjoy creating for the show and
also a big plus is that it's you know
the thumbnail uses the color scheme of
the website so that was really nice for
me so let's talk about that the video
itself is good and it works well and all
those things but the problem that I have
here when I look at this homepage is
that it's not immediately clear what the
heck I'm looking at and I think that
even though the video is a great
immersive experience at first go
when I first glance at it I'm seeing a
thumbnail it doesn't tell me I need
plain English right now I need a
headline when I'm looking at this I'm
not seeing the headline that I need to
know to understand what's going on here
below that when I scroll up I have a
what is dev tip section dev tips is a
weekly YouTube show that focuses on web
development design hosted by Travis
Nielsen and that's all good and then on
if I hold it sideways does it no it's
not big enough if it's on desktop like
this this what what is dev tips goes to
the left and the videos on the right so
it's kind of more headline ish with the
about there but still it's not perfect
what I'd like to see is a big headline
that says something like and you know I
have to tweak the copy at a later time
but something like YouTube videos like
or learn code you know like I don't know
what the headline is and for me writing
is super important because you want to
say the right things in the most fewest
amount of words and the simplest way
possible that's like the goal of
marketing writing so the the essence of
what I'd like to say with this is
something like watch youtube videos
they're free there
and you can learn skills that will
positively impact your life right think
you could change your life
scrolling up I have this popular episode
section and I thought oh it'd be great
to like showcase dev tips and what it is
by having popular episodes but when I
look at it now and when I see it now I
realize that this is just a list and
it's not even apparent that these are
links so for example if I tap on
parallax it will open YouTube this is a
link to a video or to a video series so
I think this could be better obviously
that the the first approach to improve
this would be to add the video
thumbnails and make this a little bit
more obvious what you're doing if I had
a lot more time and energy to spend on
this I would like to do like a carousel
that I could swipe my thumb through and
and be like oh in the next video the
next video the next video is something
like that so that would be interesting
to look forward to this next section is
the jquery video course i think it's
fine i don't have any big problems with
it the reason this is on the home page
is because it's trying to like create
movement between the pages it's not even
though there's a forum on it I don't
intend that this will be the place where
people make the decision to input their
their information although it could very
well be but there's a little link so to
get from here to the the page that
describes the jquery course is just this
little link at the bottom right here so
you click this link it'll go to the next
page which will give you a greater idea
of of the course but the problem is that
the link is just so small oh and I have
a port hover State on it it should stay
away when it's focused but so when you
look at this section the most important
thing or like the main call to action is
the is the form and the submit button
and it probably should I don't know I
don't want to compete with that anyway
let's move on to the patreon community I
think this this section is really good
it might it might be better if I
had a link or like a call-to-action that
said patreon.com right now it's like a
dev tips commune it's not not exactly
clear what it is but I but having said
that the whole purpose of this homepage
is not to sell patreon is to kind of
like make a place for like just to make
room for things to grow and also to like
keep the focus of jQuery so of the
jQuery code so you'll notice that when I
scroll up and down the thing that is the
most impactful I'm using like the heavy
blue is the jQuery course it's the only
one that's knock out colors what I mean
by that is I'm using white type on a
solid colored background everything else
is like white or it's like slightly off
grey you know with with dark type yeah
so overall I think that this page is
pretty good I think the things that I
would change are this list here making
the header more like having an impactful
headline and then the patreon community
could use a little work too so let's go
into the menu system I really like the
way this feels it feels kind of a P the
animation is great we're like behind it
it's dark when you when I click the
button in the menu hovers over you can
see on the right here there's it's dark
and I can't like I'm trying to scroll
right now like the important thing to me
was to keep the user from having this
weird jumpy around situation if they try
to like swipe their finger when the
menus out so it doesn't scroll and I did
that by locking down go check out the
styles that I have on the body tag win
the menu system is out it's like
overflow overflow hidden and and
position fixed so that it doesn't scroll
behind the menu which is important to me
so that and the animation is pretty good
so the black overlay kind of comes in
and then the menus the white kind of
plate slides over which is like
happening at the same time it just kind
of it's pretty good alakay the next two
things the problem I have with this menu
here is that it's kind of ordered a
little strangely so home YouTube videos
jQuery course and patreon
YouTube videos and patreon kind of go
you know off they go to a different
place but jQuery core course and home
are local so I probably reorganize this
and maybe even put like little
indicators that these two are like going
off right and if so let's go to jQuery
course the jQuery of course landing page
is pretty is pretty solid I think like
there's well there's a lot of batteries
running out there's a lot of type but
that's that's important because this is
a sales page right somebody who's going
to invest in this course needs to
understand what's going to happen so I
so I took a lot of time and crafted
these sentences like like listen to this
sentence it's pretty impactful and it's
pretty short and succinct and and clear
right learn jQuery the dev tips way by
coding real projects that you can use
professionally that's a good sentence it
tells you a lot of things in a very
short amount in a very simple way so
it's that's a pretty good sentence we
have a jQuery icon and then like some
icons of projects that I plan on
creating and then I already mentioned
here that these are like actually the
wrong thumbnails cuz they haven't made
the the 15 minute courses yet so I need
to make them and switch out the
thumbnails and then a little bit about
Travis I think that could be different
too like I think that instead of putting
my face maybe I'll put like the dev tips
logo or something because somebody might
come to this page and they're not a fan
of dev tips they don't know who what dev
tips is they just want to learn jQuery
so this page has to kind of like orient
them to the course and sell them on the
course but also teach them about what
dev tips is and what is the dev tips way
of learning you know so I think the I
think this these icons and paragraphs do
a pretty good great job of like outline
possibilities of the courses I mean I
just I made up these projects as I was
designing I'm like what is a project
that I want to do for this course I have
no idea what this course is going to be
but these are just like some ideas like
placeholders I don't and I'll test them
you know like like do people respond to
these things and the other criticism I
have on this page is that it doesn't
like we're using the colors and I have
the icon of jQuery there in the middle
right here but it doesn't scream jQuery
like it doesn't there's no like code
something like a snippet or something
you know on this page they could be a
little bit more coterie or something and
then the other thing about this page is
that actually like is that we have some
pretty good form validation here and
then if you type your name let's just
send send a you're at hmm VI dot yes if
I send this it gives me to that oh that
was not a valid and dot okay okay now
when I send this it will take me to the
next page which is a landing page look
at look at that size of that headline
that's what I'm talking about for those
for like the home page like I need one
of those this says thank you for signing
up and you'll be notified when the
course is ready sure that's simple but
that headline is so BAM right there
that's like like you know exactly what's
happening and so I need something like
that on the home page but this this is a
thank you for signing up page and you
know you've seen everything else here
but like now we're getting into the idea
that you know you've signed up what else
is there for you there's these fifteen
minutes you're getting ready repaired
for the course
go watch the fifteen minute fifteen
minute videos and then also there's an
additional patreon thing available for
you too so that's kind of a review of
the of the work that we did this week
and I hope that those things like like I
know I didn't you know I didn't type
everything out with you but hopefully
the way I presented this project will be
meaningful to you in different ways
looking at process looking at different
kind of ways that somebody goes about
the the process of creation not just
typing on code but the way they think
about creating or they think about
writing the way somebody thinks about
design and critiquing your own work
looking at being abject
about the work that you do being able to
say this isn't great anyway my battery's
gonna run out I just want to say thank
you for watching all of the videos if
you watch them all but near Europe your
amazing human being next week is going
to be the first video of the learn
jQuery in 15 minute videos and it's
gonna be like a 5 minute like just smack
you in the face with some jQuery and
there's gonna be three videos for the
next few weeks like we got got some work
lined up for us this is gonna be awesome
thank you for watching you have tips and
let's talk about the patreon community
so we have a community of developers
around deb tips who are interested in
the show and they M they donate whatever
they like it's like a choose your own
amount kind of thing when they donate
some money for every video that we
publish and the money goes to helping
helping create videos right paying for
editors paying for like new cameras or
software or learning different things or
paying expenses for me to go travel to a
place and talk to something new or go to
a conference or whatever it is and I
don't keep any of the money all of the
money of the patreon donations goes
directly back into the show this is not
like a side job for me this is just a
way for me to perpetuate and propagate
the show itself right so people who are
patrons are definitely helping the show
they're not helping me or my family
they're helping you who are a viewer and
a beneficiary of the work that we do
here at dev tips if you are interested
in that come join us
at patreon.com slash dev tips and and
learn more about the benefits that those
people who are patrons get like things
like a community chat 24/7 live hangouts
extra videos things like acha like a
private patreon podcast things that
people who just watch the show will
never
and I'm just like waiting for that
battery to run out are you kind it's
like flashing red things I think it's
gonna run out right now okay
let's so let's have a staring contest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
