lunch today because we're going on a
field trip I'm here in beautiful
california on this night nice and bright
sunny day in front of ZURB headquarters
this is the place where foundation
framework was born we're going to go
inside I'm going to talk to a few people
the people who make foundation ask them
a few questions like where did it come
from why'd you make it who's it for what
are the plans for in the future and a
few other questions that you guys
submitted on Twitter so I'm really
looking forward to this let's get it on
ah
alright everybody I'm sitting down here
with Brandon who's the design lead here
is herb and the foundation lead thank
you so much for your time young man
thank you for having me here this place
absolutely that's your play section it
is argued as our doors algebra yeah I
mean you came here we sit a camera up it
was good camera and everything so can't
tell me a little bit about foundation
like just quickly the elevator pitch a
foundation is a responsive front and
framework so it's responsive in a way
that helps make sites that adapt to
screen sizes and it's used anywhere from
quickly producing prototypes to final
production websites how many people do
you know how many people have used it or
at least how many downloads that I can't
tell you that in any stretch of the
imagination right now I I would love to
have known that but I know I actually
don't but I know it's a ton of people a
lot of good sites on it we know like
vans calm is built on it we know you
know everything that deserve produces is
built on it as well and you know a lot
of contributors on github as well so
what how did it come about why did you
guys originally make this petition
actually started so the ribs a studio
for some foremost uh design consultancy
so sir yeah sorry serve clients to our
main our main like bread and butter is
doing like nvp work probably for
startups and then also enterprises that
want to feel more like startups and so
what what you get with that is people
need to produce ideas rapidly they need
to produce you know actual physical
clickable things live items they can get
in front of users and test their out
their hypothesis that's correct right so
a foundation came out of that we noticed
a while back that we were doing the same
things over and over and over again and
we had produced for internal server
projects which there's about 35 or 40
properties out there that serve like
managers and owns this thing called the
surf style guide and we originally real
and then we feel we realized people
night you know other people I benefit
from this and so we open source the
whole thing yeah so that's one of the
questions I had like who do you feel is
your ideal user and like who do you
imagine is using this when you're
building it yeah I mean it's anywhere
the
over the course of the last couple years
like it it really expands out and like
in different ranges right so over here
you might have like I'm this is consumer
I know like some of the one of the
owners kids and like one of his best
friends and they're like a used
foundation to like build things right
which is super cool so anywhere from
like someone who's like I heard the
internet was awesome uh you know to to
you know people just starting out on the
web or people who are have been on the
web for years all the way up to people
and enterprise companies who are
developers who just need a quick way to
get started and running and then also a
great way to keep like consistency
across a large group of people right so
companies who are using foundation
benefit from the fact that everyone the
company knows that they have these sets
of rules that they follow and it's our
two most of it's been figured out for
that right and you guys are on nor five
right version five we're on version 5
the it's the fourth public version if it
didn't want it there good of a place but
then was internal but was still like
week so call the foundation internally
yeah so is the first place for public
version we're working on foundation six
right now which is which is pretty
exciting so do you ever date that um no
no we like I said our studio first so
you build yeah yeah like when when you
have time to build or whatever and I
know that like this week especially like
we really were really jamming away on it
and there's a lot of good ideas flowing
it's the ebb and flow of it next week it
might be like we have two hours to work
on it but this week I know we're all
staying a little late trying to get
things pushed out yeah so there was like
one of the biggest questions I had
personally was I mean how do you make
this thing economically viable I know
you guys think a lot of resources into
it like time energy your talent there
either paying them to work on this thing
you're giving away for free so first
thanks yeah how do you guys make that
economically viable for your company uh
I mean that's that's like a silly
question oh it is like that's kind of
the the thyroid open source right which
is like how is open source effective and
useful and one its economic viable
because we created it specifically for
ourselves do you improve our work right
and so that would that was like first
before most like why was invented so
even if we never gave it to anyone else
we would have still been using it for
ourselves it's a bit of our development
process save any money that way now
that's obviously not like you know the
amount of money we spend fixing issues
that aren't things that we've run into
and things like that it is responsible
for a lot of leads like it'll come to us
because they know we were the makers of
foundations that helps as well and then
certain things like we do offer training
very small fraction of that that overall
us if we do classes where people and so
that covers like a little bit of that
how would they help I guess let's say
somebody wanted to get some ZURB
training straight from the hall from
deserves mouth yeah where would they go
ah jib calm / university great and that
has like online courses that we offer
like live with the people who work on
during all the time I'm their products
load time from anywhere from it's like a
like a live chat with them or something
it's it's a webinar and then we have a
question and answers after each one of
the sections and that's anywhere that
city or is he you get to think that's
fine I didn't like it uh yeah there's
the works oh it's joining you in this
Q&amp;amp;A and then there's anywhere from my
classes on foundation to our email like
you know creating HTML emails using yeah
so I was going to say you guys do much
more than foundation in terms of open
source like community-driven things like
you do I get an email blast from you
guys um Ben yeah sends me an email all
the time at first I was like who's been
and because and they're like Ben crumbs
are my god there we go but yeah it's
like really really helpful tips like how
to sketch like how to do these things
that you you know I mean they're not
like talked about as much as how to how
to code of foundation yeah yeah yeah so
actually I was like University next
after foundation of everything serve
does because there's this there's just
paid resources like the classes but
there's also tons of free resources on
there yeah from things like lessons that
then does a really good job taking
talking to each person in the company
and finding things they want to like
Express and teach and he does a
brilliant job writing those and has
anywhere from code stuff like you're
saying like SAS anything like how to
sketch certain things how do like solve
a problem using yeah I and then there's
also a bunch of things called the
library which were actually just
finishing up a new version of which is a
combination of a bunch of resources that
we put together uh uh uh things like
quips which is a bunch of statistics
that we you know take and put them into
one place for you so if you're ever like
I wonder how many people really use that
carousels we have a stat for that oh
cool triggers which is like how to use
psychology to manipulate people with
design he'll be equipped yeah I'm sorry
how do you how do people use that how
have you seen them using them we use it
quite a bit in the sense of before we do
like any redesign of a product or a site
uh-huh we do like a site audit and I'll
usually encourage our designers to use
quips and that and triggers in that and
say like okay right now you have a
carousel carousels are usually
ineffective for this reason attach equip
and when you're reporting to a client
giving a summary to them or even to
pitch to them you'll have some like
information to back up what your what
your thesis exactly you I like that or
if there's like a design decision
they're unsure about they're like I
don't know the fold and people don't
really scroll and you gonna be like well
there was a study done and here's like
here's a chunk of information about it's
on the internet so it must be true
obviously uh and then quips uh we just
do that manually ourselves we find them
all over the place from studies that are
being done in the studies we're not the
differences ourselves but we're finding
those and putting them at one place for
designers and developers it's a cool
site yeah I've been through it it's
really nice
so foundation is probably the thing you
guys are known most for you guys
certainly do a lot what's the biggest
challenge you have in maintaining these
large-scale projects I mean this
probably a couple biggest challenge is
number one is you know can't talk about
it early a little which is like the
trade-off of time for client war isn't
the time of internal projects right um
at any time is a designer you probably
have one or two external projects and
then one or two internal projects as
well as herb okay that's why the biggest
thing is just main to find the time to
do that in kind of time to make it
useful mm-hmm good foundation I would
say even more than that is trying to be
opinionated enough in your decisions of
the framework okay with with balancing
that with you know the needs of the
users so it's it's maybe maybe a few you
have to kind of weed out like what's a
few vocal minorities of like we want
this one thing and it might not be that
necessary it might be something that
maybe would be easier to have as an
external plug-in or maybe isn't the best
way to do that for the majority of users
and trying to be take all the facts and
be opinionated about it and then make a
decision that affects the most people in
the most positive way that can be a
credit heavy burden to shoulder yeah how
do you make that decision do your you
guys gathering data from how many people
use certain features what to include
what to deprecate yeah actually so for
foundation six we did actually a lot of
accidents probably one of the first
times we've done this on this scale no
but we did a lot of luck customer
advocacy on this so yeah we reached out
to people especially a lot of agencies a
lot of big companies that used it talk
to them about like the components they
use what they're like workflow is you
know what what are things that they like
could absolutely never live without we
did a whole bunch of that we took all
that data we we wait we sorted through
it we went through that we're trying to
discover a lot of things that we can do
better a lot of things that we can
actually just inform people of better as
well well that's interesting yeah
because a lot of the things some of the
things you hear you're like
been doing that for like two years
apparently just didn't tell anyone uh
yeah yeah which is like every component
in foundation is a mix in which is
actually rare like the grid and most
frameworks is a mixer uh-huh but every
component which means that you can take
any one of our components Nate create a
class of whatever name you want and then
just add include that component and then
now you have your own name diversion of
that without having to worry about how
we named that may be right so it's a big
responsibility not only to create these
tools for everybody to use but also to
teach them how to use it yes it seemed
like making sure everything's explained
clearly and sometimes miscommunications
can happen I know but when I i made a i
made a video about foundation as a first
time user and I was like okay this is
how I think it happens and then Rafi
came in in a comment to you is like well
you know what we were you saying we've
been doing this for years actually you
you missed this little tidbit that have
made your life easier and it's it's not
an easy job for you yeah so do you have
a team making foundation I kind of
wondering how you structure your
organization of team making it to
documenting it doing client work like
yeah so serve as a whole as if most
recently has been split up this isn't
how that's always been all designers
work on client work as well okay and
then all our designers also code so when
I say designer those people are probably
doing front-end code as well we have a
team of people working on notable which
is our apps right so like all our design
feedback apps that we produce leave a
team working on the library kind of
resources doing those things than we
have a foundation team and right now
that team is five people almost none of
which are like full-time on it but still
five people who are actively debating
actively talking to each other you know
you'll be in the middle of you know
doing some other work and I'll tap you
on the shoulder and five minutes later
on a whiteboard trying to figure out
that's new taxes how long has the Yeti
been a part of foundation this is the
first one really if you go look at the
if you go look at like the original Yeti
from foundation to first public one
actually good it is like the creepiest
thing you've ever I don't even know how
we put that out there those be and then
we have this awesome dude Adam Fairhead
who builds all our mascots uh-huh and
cool coolest guy really really good at
just taking feedback and making it and
he's he's been ever since I think three
been doing our mascots they're a lot
less creepy
you certainly have a lot going on with
foundation you split it into three
products recently what's the ultimate
vision I think those with vision is that
they're the the web as a whole does a
lot of things and having one framework
that does all those things feels weird I
think I think in theory it feels nice
because you're like that's one thing
right but then the one thing has to do
these other things the other things you
don't need everything all the time yeah
so foundation for emails are the biggest
outlier in that foundation for email is
currently called ink and that's being
brought in back to the family one of my
favorite things to see on twitter is
like hey this thing is like foundation
for email or like that yeah yeah I know
we should just called it that that's
that's being a little bit that we
brought in and why not and then the and
you know we're trying to make it a
little more consistent we're actually
doing some really neat stuff with that
where if you've used ink yeah if you've
already put an email by itself you know
that's like the worst thing in the world
using ink is better than that it's done
that amazing there's a lot of tables yes
we're gonna templating language for its
you'll be able to code with it just like
you would you know closer to regular
foundation then wash all that stuff out
and make all the ugly table stuff for
you I did see that um when we were here
a few weeks ago on a friday for a soap
box oh yeah someone was showing this
like the prototype of that yeah it's
pretty nice yeah it's really cool
excited for it yeah Jean universe yeah
yeah prabhat probably probably before
summer for that not far yeah I know
coming up that far and then oh yeah so
that's that's that's that's ink we have
furnishing besides it's really good for
making marketing sites and landing pages
and it doesn't amazingly well and then
we realized it was I'm making client
projects multiple we make up products so
digital products right mm-hmm we
realized that foundation and you know
most frameworks weren't built to do that
originally keep just really like two
sentences give me the difference between
a site and a product yeah yeah okay yeah
so a marketing site is usually
advertising some sort of product so it's
probably more more more text heavy more
like a brochures more than thing yeah or
a whole you know whole marketing site as
a whole and a product you know often
there is a blurred line but a product is
more interactive I have to do more
things it feels more like the apps on my
phone or more like the apps on my
computer right but we're trying to bring
that back into the web so foundation for
apps is great for that because it uses
angular so it can really quickly create
a swap content out without having a
whole page reload right there's
components that are very specific and
layouts that are very specific to apps
and we tried to create a grid and Korea
components that help distinguish those
from site from from marketing sites not
to say you can't build an app in
foundation precise and you can't build
you know a site in foundation for apps
but those are for the most part
different enough that we felt they
needed two different frameworks right
now haven't personally dived into
foundation for apps yet but I understand
there's a difference in the grid it's a
flexbox good this time yeah so there's a
flexbox grid and that's like a that
rather dependency on that is a little
little lacking right and innovative uh
you know but hey I mean Microsoft just
announced they're not even gonna keep
Internet Explorer in the family right
but yeah so it's a flexbox grid but more
than that even it's it's trying to
figure out like how to create sectioned
pieces of content like HD in a
traditional iphone app or ignore
additional desktop one so independent
scrolling panels were a big piece of
that trying to have items fixed position
vertically without actually having to
fix position things because mobile
doesn't really dig fixed positioning
they've ever seen like when you scroll
them things like so the flexbox grid it
is nice because it lets you do things
like like the golden layout they don't
always wants to do like every client
always wants this thing to be 300 pixels
like just fixed and this thing just to
fill the rest of the space yep that's a
surprisingly hard thing to do with
floats you haven't had a fixed position
a bunch of stuff and doing things it
does that just on its own by default
what do you envision for foundation in
the future not the near but like yeah
the far future three years uh yeah
that's something we talked about quite a
bit okay uh we because we're like things
are things are moving like I don't think
we're gonna we don't think we're going
to code forever right like or we'll
probably code you know Ted you back able
probably you know do anything complex
but code may not be part of fronting
code may not be in three years part of
my everyday lifestyle they may have
gotten good enough with a with kind of a
wysiwyg drab and drag-and-drop thing we
hope that foundation is a part of those
types of things you know we're looking
at ways to do that that's not saying
that is anyways you're performing any of
our plans maybe worse and maybe even
three years is a little less time for
that I feel like we haven't wanted to
give it up that's been the dream since
like you know dreamweaver pretended to
promise that years ago you have nice
things now like Adobe's experimenting
with it with think in what is there
David David Adler surrounding with it
macaw is your mounting with that still a
little shaky once you get responsive and
then there's nothing blocks it looks
pretty cool a bunch of a bunch of other
ones so that might end up being at least
with a prototyping stage but I think
when you eventually hit code you're
going to want that I think farther in
the future frameworks have frameworks
right now have solved the problem of
response and for the most part that I
figured it out but I think what we're
going to see more of is trying to
continue to refine framework so that
they're just as efficient as starting
from scratch right so worrying more
about efficiency the near term for a lot
of these things is accessibilities
become a big thing on the table which is
great finally yeah yeah like it's going
to be a point where the same way three
years ago maybe we looked at responsive
design is not necessary but now we do
accessibility is going to be necessary
starting now and beyond as like oh
you're not building accessible like
right here kind of a jerk there's like
an ethical way no no there is though
yeah and it's you know it just it's like
it's like if we didn't build buildings
accessible right like if I was like I
forget wheelchair ramps or anything the
I'm a channel we we definitely like
stress fundamentals a lot yeah I do
anyway and what struck me about we just
go back to serve as a company yeah when
I was talking to your people here when I
was here the first time it was mentioned
that everybody at serve coats even the
like the HR people yeah everybody we
make that happen it's a requirement for
the for the job I heard yeah yeah I mean
like like like that maybe a little a
slightly extreme but like every designer
every dinner codes every every engineer
designs okay which is nice for every
engineer learns how to do sketching the
way we sketch and learns how to
understand the basic principles design
it is true that our customer service
people uh anyone who's working on like
the former he was working on customer
service Minerva products also knows how
to code and it's also true that I think
currently our HR person is learning how
to code because it's such a big part of
our culture here that's awesome um
everyone also you know also be part of
that is sketching and yeah and being
able to express ideas in a vegetable
sense because verbally ideas are kind of
just a bunch of words but once you have
a concrete piece of paper that has a
thing on it yeah with a picture that
becomes it becomes a straight so
reserved as a whole really just push
like these those two fundamentals of
everyone codes everyone sketches
everyone's a designer everyone's a
friend of day that must really enable
your team to communicate with each other
yeah there's rarely a case in which in
fact I'm like sometimes if I'm is it
designed lead to my job is kind of
mentoring designers to make decisions
and sometimes we'll be talking and
there's not a pen here and I'll do this
hair both and i feel really bad i do
that i'm really in my head and i'll be
talking about like okay what you want to
do and i'll just go and the designers
have learned that just like grab a piece
of paper and like shove a pen in my hand
and I go okay awesome like this it's a
terrible but there's no do that right uh
but there's really like you know no time
that I can't explain something I'm
thinking ever thought that anyone can
has been something to anyone else with a
sketch that's awesome yeah it's good
even even any even just you know what
about doing you know employee interviews
like this if we have just personnel room
here
this thing so I have a few questions I
shot out that on Twitter that was
stopping by today and a few people said
yeah I like to ask them a few questions
if you don't mind yeah let's do it uh
this one comes a bite node code from app
bite node code well uh what inspired you
to make your project theme the way you
did okay that's actually pretty common
question so a foundation by a whole is
like really minimally styled and this by
intent yeah for design agency we
obviously understand design but we
wanted to make it so that you can skin
it as easy as possible without having to
overwrite almost any code that we do
either through a settings file or even
have to you know we want you to code
this we don't want a default necessarily
theme going out yes that looks like
served foundation mm-hmm we want you to
put design on top of it so that's pretty
much like the main thing that like when
it goes into that is the default theme
is as minimal as we can do in fact in
the next version we're working and even
trying to figure out how to take some of
the more specific things out even still
making it look good and nice to begin
with that if you're prototyping in it
you're okay yeah but trying to figure
out okay is this like this is this
border necessary is this border like if
I don't want a border now I have to undo
that border that seems a little annoying
so so as a creator of the foundation
framework you have to kind of find ways
to teach people to make it their own
yeah built into the foundation itself
yeah what we notice a lot with like
back-end devs is there they're not as
drawn to foundation because they're like
well I have to get designer to do this
and more like that and the valleys kind
of putting more and more emphasis on
design recently so I think that's a good
sign in that case which is that if
you're going to see less and less of
those like default framework themes
going out and more and more time spent
on how do I make this thing look like
our own and also how do I use design to
inform the interactions it need to take
place in this page right so if
everything is just just looks like
everything else then I have no way of
letting people know what's more
important with lesson
orton and things like that awesome yeah
cool I got another one here from Tim his
from at t Bogdanov 80 cool so um any
place in the future for web components
in foundation yeah I think so like hey
I've done a super apps uses a bunch of
directives alright and we're
experimenting with that we like the idea
of what components i just don't think
they're ready yet for for most things
we're not against them when i see where
to go probably not foundation six
possibly after that you guys have to
have a pretty high standard for
compatibility so there's a lot to think
of her to think of everybody else too
yeah it's like what your requirements
are exactly it's a big tits a large
undertaking i know there's people out
there solving that very hard problem as
well speaking of which I got another
question from app hmm UK okay well these
usernames he says that IE 8 is still
very important to him and to others and
is there an easy solution there's
there's actually you know we you know
ninety percent per project i'm the
identity five probably actually higher
than that we don't need IE eight and
mainly because we kind of put our foot
down as a company yeah and say and what
else we get more high-tech stuff too so
when you're building sets for you know a
different market or something there are
easy ways we just recently did it on a
project they're like we have a special
grid that you install just for ie8
there's a couple things you do with with
12 topping the version of jQuery it's
not too difficult for the most part we
we dropped ie8 actually in foundation
for which i think people like forget
it's been a little while now and we did
it for the sake of we wanted to start
that we wanted to be the change in that
situation yeah not like wait for the
change to happen then do it so we kind
of took a hit on that but we think it's
an important like Stan to take and say
no more like the more people that
support IE 8 the more people are going
to be on ie8 yeah so if everything
starts becoming really broken for people
they're going to upgrade their machines
and so the web forward yeah for sure
exactly we tried to do that we we pushed
response to scientist i at the very
beginning we pushed mobile first
definitely yeah when when Luke w started
talking about that girl looked up you
there I cannot pronounce his last name I
don't want to try wrong oh we talking
about that we definitely hopped on
hopped on that and are pushing that
forward yeah and we've seen pretty much
REMS we're pushing forward right now
every time we make a decision on that we
see the web kind of go along with them
so that's kind of a responsibility thing
I get it I've had to support ie8 before
yeah and I mean that my eyes / started
designing I sporting you like 5.5 right
