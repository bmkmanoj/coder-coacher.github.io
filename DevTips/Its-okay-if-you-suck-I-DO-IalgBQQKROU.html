spend the remainder of this video
showing you why that should be no excuse
and what you can do about it ah
about three weeks ago I put out a series
called design and code a landing page
these videos are a documentation of the
work that I've been doing for the past
few days of planning and designing and
coding a landing page for the upcoming
killing it with jQuery video courses
that I'm creating right now
the last video that series I went and
did a review of the web site and kind of
pointed out a few things that I did well
but also a few things that I didn't like
so much
and could improve and after these videos
were published I kept going back to it
and refining and refining it and
changing and tweaking things so what I
want to do is I want to walk you through
all of those tweaks and I want to show
you how a design and evolve I want to
show you that good work is not a product
of genius or skill or raw talent or
witchcraft good work comes from being
honest with yourself and taking time to
do the right things right and iterating
and and just sticking with it it takes
grit right and so we're gonna walk
through the commit history of this
project and show you how things evolve
and how after the end of all this no
matter your talent or skill you can come
out with something pleasing I'm going to
start right with this first version this
is version 1 this is the one that was
done right before the videos went out if
you glynn if you went to the web site on
day zero this is what you would have
seen right and it's not too bad I think
the major problems that I had was this
this kind of conflict of interest right
here on the Left we have this kind of
image and definition and title and on
the right we have a video which I think
would be good if the user would play it
below we have like a kind of just a list
of popular videos like there's no way to
just glance at this and see that these
are videos or any
anything is you know it's really going
on here this whole design was designed
to be mobile first so if I make this
into a mobile view you can see that the
there's a lot better structure here in
terms of the hierarchy we're starting
with the video then we're going down and
we're seeing the definition of what is
to have tips then we're seeing the
videos you know it's just kind of it
comes with one after the other and it
makes a lot more sense but to be in the
desktop version doesn't make a whole lot
of scanning sense and to top that off I
got a lot of complaints about the the
menu system here so is it's kind of
weird
there's a house for home and the YouTube
videos jQuery course and patreon
community now the the home is the only
grayscale one the other ones are colored
and YouTube videos and community go off
the website where jQuery courses that an
internal page in home is an internal
page so it kind of just like was was
really weird and also one of the things
is that if I click outside of a menu
which is a common common pattern like I
click menu I can click X but I should
also be able to click outside and and
out here it doesn't click the main it
doesn't close the menu which is a pretty
good pattern to follow so when I had a
chance one of the first things that did
is go back I'm gonna switch tabs here
and look at the second version so this
is version one point one point two if
you're looking in like the github repo
so when you go to this menu the first
thing you'll notice that this has
cleaned up just a bit it's not perfect
still there's more changes in the future
but there's like this horizontal line
denoting that these are internal pages
and these are external pages still not
perfect but it was like really quick and
there's a quick change that I could do
on the bus on the way to work just to
get just to help it would be a little
bit more clear what's going on and also
I added the functionality to click
outside of the menu and close the menu
so you can choose the X or outside but
also if you click on the menu itself it
doesn't close it just offside the menu
that will close it so that was the quick
changes like while I'm uploading videos
on like oh I should also update that
because I know that
broke but if you go down here everything
is still pretty much the same but if we
go up here to tab 3 we're gonna see a
lot of changes and this is gonna be
version 1 point 1 point 3 if you're
looking at the github commit history but
anyway this next tab is going to show us
a lot of changes on the homepage itself
because keep in mind that the homepage
was really designed as an afterthought
because I wanted the whole the whole
inspiration to make the dev tips show
combo site was to have a landing page to
kind of prep people and get people
excited and give them a place to sign up
for the jQuery course that I'm currently
developing and I figured that if I was
going to have a slash jQuery course the
root URL the.com needed to have
something on it too so this home page
was the answer for that but you'll
notice when I click on this next tab
that the positioning of the home page it
becomes a lot more refined right let's
take for example this left-hand column
right here where it says what is dev
tips and keep in mind that it's not
under here but if it's in menu or if
it's in mobile view then then we have a
different kind of display of it it's
below and it's in gray so let's let's go
to this next version and see how that
changed okay so this next version has
the gray down below even on desktop view
and it's able to keep that as a
secondary focus so the the initial focus
is not what is dev tips the initial
focus up here let me highlight it this
primary area this is not what dev tips
is it's what can it do for you right a
little bit different it's not what it's
why right why does it exist and so the
language used here is actually something
that I've been messing with for a while
I did an exercise awhile ago to to
answer the question why do i do dev tips
what's it for who's it for and the
answer came to be that it's to give
people the tools and experiences to
change their circumstances and be in
control of their own view
now I get emails a lot but I get
sometimes these emails that say like hey
because of the thing I taught I was able
to impress my co-workers or even land
the job or get that client that I've
been trying to win for a while and those
are those are my favorite emails because
they just like really make me feel like
the things that I'm doing in all this
effort that I'm putting into it are
valuable and worth something to some
people and what I want dev tips to be
the Y is to give people the tools and
experiences to change their
circumstances and to be in control of
their own future and that was what I
focused on at the top and then below the
what answer the what again what is it
it's a weekly YouTube show focuses on
web design and development hosted by
Travis and then I went back into that
list and added a staggered thumbnail
kind of presentation I still wasn't in
love with it but it was better than this
right remember this is just a list it's
basically just adding thumbnails on to
this and staggering like making every
other one left and right right so it's
not the best thing ever but it's better
but the next design took it even further
so let me switch to this next tab go to
tab four and now we can see when we
switch back and forth you can see the
changes happening right here number one
this great block is is obviously weird
right it's like collision course right
here it's like why is there a triangle
of white so what this one does is it
removes it and puts this wide depth what
deaf tips right on the white and then
the second thing is is this language has
changed so now it's no longer the tools
and experiences but now it's the
education and training to change your
circumstances and be in control of your
own future
so why tools and experiences change to
education and training
well I still believe tools and
experiences because I do a lot more than
just videos but these this website and
specifically for the purpose of
generating interest and height for the
jQuery courses I wanted to focus on that
aspect of dev tips being the education
and training so still fiddling with the
language coming down here to the
the what is dev tips removing the the
band of gray and putting it on the white
it didn't need a band of color and then
when I come down here to the videos I
redid the way that they look to put the
putting them on cards making them feel a
lot more clickable they have a hover
state now and and also they're on these
you know these cards and there's also
this colored band which is kind of cool
across the top which is an SVG it's a
lot better but when we go to the next
version which will focus a little bit
less on the homepage but more on the
jQuery course page okay let me actually
go back to the other jQuery course page
so you can see what what changed okay so
here we are on the previous one and
you're looking at reading this from top
to bottom there's not a lot of I mean
other than the order and a few other
things there's nothing to give me a
sense of true hierarchy or even impact
right where's the headline what's gonna
grab me right away so when I change it
to this version you'll notice that this
line right learn jQuery the dev tips way
this is a good sentence learn jQuery the
dev tips way by coding real projects
that you can use professionally right
it's simple it's succinct and it means a
lot of things right we're gonna learn
what we're gonna learn jQuery how the
dev tips way what are we gonna get from
that we're gonna get projects that we
real projects and we're gonna be doing
the coding and you can use them
professionally so there's a lot of
meaning impact in in that sentence and
that's that's really what I wanted to
showcase and so you can see the
difference here now when you look at
this page you're like okay I know
exactly what to read what's important
when I'm scanning scanning scanning I
know what to look at oh we also have by
this time I had released the learn
jQuery in 15 minutes videos on YouTube
at least the first one and I had all
three of the thumbnails ready to go and
so if I switch back to ya you're gonna
see like these a-holes these old
thumbnails like what do they even mean
they're just random thumbnails and it
and also if you clicked on them it would
go to like there's a weird video that
a placeholder that you can't get to
anymore because it's not this link does
not go there anymore but um it was like
I think it would sing a song it was a
log it was one of those ones that I made
at 3:00 in the morning that was trying
to scramble anyway if I go to this page
okay so so the update here was that
these thumbnails are actually the real
ones and I added a nice hover effect
that when you hover they all kind of
move in z space and kind of are more
three-dimensional so the back one
shrinks a little bit and the for the the
one in the foreground grows it scales up
and then the play button scales up the
most and becomes fully opaque a lot of
changes there getting ready for that
jQuery course to be to be identified and
named and kind of building hype for it
but the next version of this page
actually is is kind of a big departure
because in the next version that I
released and I'll I call that one in the
notes I call this one version one point
two point no because the big change
happens we no longer call this page the
jQuery video course which is like a
placeholder name right it's like it's
not very good name but it was like it's
what it was right
but this next version let's pull over to
it this next version actually names the
course and we call it killing it with
jQuery this is the more like marketable
name killing it with jQuery and I
started doing this thing where under it
I put video courses because I felt like
jQuery video courses was a lot more self
explanatory than killing a jQuery you
don't really know what that is and so
under I put video courses and when you
click onto it we get the branding the
big pink branding and like the big
thumbnail and then more of this kind of
like you know come click on it come sign
up come sign up kind of thing it's all
pink now which is fun and I really liked
what I did with the menu here and so in
the next version I went back to that
menu and I added this kind of sub line
for all of the items there so we have
home what is dev tips J killing with
jQuery video courses YouTube videos
hundreds for free patreon community
extra content
plus friends so a little bit more
explanation in the menu system not a
huge update but I feel that it goes a
long way when explaining to people with
this site is about when they go into the
menu system right the next version and
now we're coming to kind of like the end
here this next version and we go to this
last tab we're almost getting towards
the end here this one if I go to the
jQuery courses landing page we have it
we scroll down a little bit a
testimonial carousel now this is these
are like people's comments in on Twitter
and also in the comments section of the
videos where I'm talking about this
course and none of the people who are
like oh this is the best course ever
because nobody's seen it in fact the
truth is I still haven't made it I'm
still working on it but these guys are
talking just based on the 200 videos
that I've already made in our
relationship they're talking about how
they're excited about the product
tonight and I said a few of them hey can
I lexy kind of used this this quote here
this is gonna be great kind of put on
the website and then I quickly made this
carousel which is like it's on auto
rotate and then if you start number
tabbing through the auto rotate stops so
you can like it won't you know how like
it's so annoying if you say next and
then it goes to next you know so I so
anyway and so people like you are hyped
I added the carousel section and that's
that was kind of what happened on that
version and the way that I coated and
displayed this carousel my inform or
even show up in there killing it with
jQuery courses that I'm developing just
to give you something to chew on there
and the last tab that I have here is the
most recent update is version one point
3.0 when I added another page yes I
added an animated gifts page so in the
JK so in the dev tips community there's
a chat we have and we have a few people
there that are really really fond of
making avatars and emojis and gifts of
weird things that happen on dev tips so
if you go to dev tips show comm slash
gifts there's a bunch of gifts of
Travis's face doing all the weird things
that Travis's face kind of does
sometimes and we have the one down here
we're like Louis
comes into the channel and slaps my face
that's probably my favorite one or the
one there I'm throwing confetti here and
dancing like a goofball anyway so you
can go to dev tips show.com slash gifts
and find all these gifts here to go out
and spread them and make the internet a
weird and fun place but I wanted to show
all of these different versions of the
dev tip show comm just to really
underline the idea that you don't need
to get it right on the first time and if
you make something and it's not what you
wanted it's okay because you have the
ability in fact I encourage you to
exercise the option of going back in
iterating and working hard because
nothing is perfect the first time and
nobody has ever written a perfect piece
of code or made a perfect design their
first go-around it just never happens
and the huge benefit of working on the
web is that we can just update and
iterate as fast as we can so this is
what I wanted to share with you I hope
you enjoy these gifts and keep on
hacking thanks for watching this video
this is one of the unusual ones where
we're just talking about ideas rather
than showing you how to code things I'm
not sure what you think but I think
these kind of things are some of the
more valuable things on the channel
where we talk about these skills that
you probably won't hear people talk
about on other places where you know
we're doing a like how to code a thing
today you know like that's that's cool
that's valuable but think of this stuff
is the stuff you don't hear a lot and I
hope that this was inspirational to you
keep going keep working on the project
and and just get it right little by
little right I was watching the vlog of
it's called flux it's Biran who and and
you know he's just doing this thing he's
just doing this thing at the end he says
you know I didn't get a lot done today
but I did a little bit and it's those
little bits every day that lead to big
changes and I was like
that's exactly right that's exactly how
I feel like I sometimes I walk out of
the office or I get done with the night
of this depth tip stuff and I'm like
what did I even accomplish today and I
look back in it's just not it's not huge
stuff just little things but at the end
of the week or at the end of the month
or at the end of the project you have a
lot of work done and that is how
experience is gained and that is how
your portfolio gets filled you know if
you're if you're asking yourself how do
I become a professional well it's a
little bit at a time you become a
professional one day at a time and it's
things like this iterating sticking with
it working through the problems being
honest with yourself okay so thank you
for watching this video and others like
it were sponsored by the dev tips
community which can be found at
patreon.com slash dev tips that's right
there is a community of people who have
found these videos so valuable and so
helpful that they decided hey I would
like to donate to support that channel
and you know they choose a number
whatever their favorite number is if
their number favorite number is two
favorite number is 17 whatever you can
choose your favorite number and that is
the number that you give a few dollars
for every video that's published most
people do about three to four dollars
the majority of them and that's good
because it's manageable right that's
like 16 dollars a month which is
fantastic now there are some benefits to
being a dev tips patron number one is
you gonna watch these videos early so
where everybody else in the world is
waiting until Monday you're seeing these
the videos on Friday
ideally secondly you get to get extra
videos that nobody will ever see and you
get a dev tips podcast we have monthly
hangouts there are some community led
hangouts that happen a little bit more
frequently you can access to dev tips
chat which is where the it's kind of at
the heart and the soul of the community
is a 24/7 chat room and people
in there being so helpful and just
awesome and you know whenever I need
help with some code or some ideas or
feedback on my design that's where I go
I go in there and we're posting in there
and saying hey what do you what do you
think about this how can this be better
and we're it's just a community right
and if you want to know how a community
can benefit you check out this podcast
episode where we talk about the secret
the secret of how creative work is
spread and the unfair secret of how
people make a name for themselves how
creative work is spread this is through
communities so please take a look at
that podcast and also visit us at
patreon.com slash dev tips and that's it
for today and here's some outtakes video
