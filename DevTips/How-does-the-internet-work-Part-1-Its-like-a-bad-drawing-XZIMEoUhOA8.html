for designers my name is Travis Nielson
this is YouTube channel dedicated to
help designers get their feet wet with
web development what's that not a
designer well that's okay you can come
to last week we wrapped up our first
series of seven videos here on YouTube
called html5 basics if you haven't yet I
recommend taking a look at this playlist
right here and checking that out this
week I want to take a step back and talk
about how the internet actually works
it's very complicated full things and
stuff so I've taken liberty of making it
simple and drawing this picture for you
know I just get him but what I'm about
to describe is in no way a complete
picture or even an accurate one
but it's the Internet as I understand
and as far as I'm concerned that should
be good enough for you now there are
tons of more robust and complete
descriptions of what I'm about to tell
you but I wanted to give you this
perspective which is as simpler kind of
what you need to know about the Internet
in order to make the Internet at least a
teensy corner of the internet
perspective
okay let's start with a browser a
browser is an application on your
computer or phone or whatever that
translates or renders all of the codes
that we've been talking about into the
visible web pages that you can go on the
internet and see now the browser renders
all the codes right but the codes are
stored on a server you can think of a
server as a special kind of computer
whose main purpose is to talk to
browsers and give them the code to
enable them to render the website that
you want to view servers come in all
shapes and sizes anything from a few
hard drives in your mom's basement all
the way to large-scale data warehouses
like this data center in North Carolina
owned by Google the way a browser talks
to a server and get all those codes and
stuff is through a protocol called
hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP now
we as website makers need to be aware
that every time our browser hits up the
server for more information another
image or whatever it's using another
HTTP request now too many HTTP requests
and your website becomes sluggish and
slow now we can cut down on our HTTP
request by doing some simple things like
combining all of our files into as few
files as possible or creating sprites
out of our images and things like that
now sometimes but not always but
sometimes the websites that we build use
databases now databases are not as scary
as I thought they were think of them as
special types of spreadsheets that house
information and then when our website
needs that specific bit of information
it'll just plug it in like a blog entry
or something like that now we're not
going to talk about databases today we
made some other day but don't hold me to
that I think they're kind of boring okay
so where do we fit into all this
so we're this guy or girl over here
making HTML and CSS and JavaScript
websites on our low
machines like we should and when we're
done making our website with all the
coolest trendy toad tricks we put our
code up on that server over here using
another protocol called File Transfer
Protocol or FTP and now the world can
see your Internet's Cheers
next we go on and talk about a few more
details involved in this process like
how do we link all our files together
and structure our projects where
everything works together the way we
want them to okay that's it for this
week I'm looking for feedback on the
series html5 basics take a look at the
link right right there I want to make it
better I want to know what you guys are
interested in what you want to hear
about and if you have any specific kind
of questions please let me know comment
