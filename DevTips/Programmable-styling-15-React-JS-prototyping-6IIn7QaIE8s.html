final styling to the app and we are
developers doing styling so avert your
eyes
you're watching dev tips with guest host
mpj and david alright here we have the
the app it's running let's go to
localhost to see what we're doing
signing with Spotify see my playlists
you can see that it's not exactly
looking like the Spotify no it won't it
won't after our styling either we just
try to sort of make it a bit nicer
perhaps make this larger fix our margins
and wrap this up okay so what should I
put in a CSS file and what should I do
in line here ah
are you tend to and this again I stress
here that this is me I try to place as
much as possible ah as in line size okay
and the reason for that is that I really
like the fact that react allows you to
put everything related to a component in
the component so instead of separating
your code like Styles HTML and uh and
JavaScript which is that like the old
way of styling components which doesn't
really make sense because it just
confuses instead it allows you to think
playlists it allows you to think plain
is counter our counter like think in
those those terms and that is way better
way better way of organizing organizing
your application by feature instead of
technicality okay so should we just
remove the CSS what what do we have in
the CSS because some things are
cumbersome to put as inline Styles HTML
body back yeah exactly because safely
because react is not responsible for
rendering the body the react application
is contained in a div inside the body
but all this other crap we can remove
yes
because we're not using it yep and then
we'll just fix it yes
now it looks like this
exactly I think there was a centering
there in the absence s yeah but I don't
want it no no actually not it doesn't
really look good I think that this is
actually looking better we could just
add here some padding some basic padding
just to because this will apply it to
everything yep
hope Sun Bowl this looks fine yeah sure
let's say it's an improved you probably
don't think so but I'm fine with this
yeah
and we also see here we have some fake
data reminders for the remove that yes
we have the default style can we reduce
that I think we do use that in several
places
yeah but can we oh let's use it for font
let's change the font font family
Helvetica man or do I make sense oh
let's do it
the static cyst on the Mac no fail to
compile to only false compilation fail
no we don't have it perhaps you have
like open the font browser let's see if
we can find something like papyrus the
the only font face that is possibly
worse are these default ones do people
have these papyrus yeah sure papyrus
wasn't papyrus sorry
I think that the font-family that is
kind of like the style or something
there we go great that is amazing that
is it looks like a role-playing game
yeah this is a role-playing game
playlists overview fantastic and this h1
header has some default margins I guess
so I will just fix that you ready style
default font size and just - is there an
NPM module with the CSS reset let's do
that cool and now I think if you scroll
down somewhere here I think you can't
steal something like I think it will
work just steal that put it here no do
it in the app J and this is this and do
like above the import app CSS we import
that here yeah but like they use another
important thing let's see if that even
works
did that work let's see if worked you
might have to restart the it did work
nice and also like the advantage of this
instead of using an include statement or
like a separate in the HTML is that the
react create react app will not bundle
it so you will compact it into one CSS
file that is compressed as well so let's
do the playlist once or that so this
could have a margin top perhaps to
better 5 pixels this is not adapted to
more mobile or anything this is just
showing how to do it in react so then
that each playlist counter should we
have styled them here
I guess I know no style them inside the
playlist counter okay so that the
styling for the toilet area is already
started contained here oops
great okay that's it for those they can
be a slightly larger as well yeah okay
break this into a separate object that
would make the coat look a little bit
nicer to put before way yes so that is
playlist counter style so it's not mixed
in with the HTML like that yeah sure
that works can i while we're doing this
I'm gonna I want to showcase some cool
things with that you that it's really
really hard to do like it's impossible
to do in CSS and also rather cumbersome
to do in and stuff like less which is
that I can just throw functions in here
to evaluate things so let's say that you
wanted if the hours is really yeah are
many hours or yeah if there are a few
hours yeah exactly it's something like
that exactly so let's say that we want
the color to if the let's say oh we were
looking at the playlist counter here now
okay so do it instead in the hours
counter so let's break this style out
there and let's just call it and
Connor yes bad does it turn right yeah
that is not oh amazingly ugly alright so
let us say that is too low if the total
duration is below ten hours
yeah then it's too low then it should be
read otherwise it should be white so now
it's white let's filter it so that we
okay well it seems to only like how can
I find something that is not just cease
to forty hours forty that should be it's
31 now but it's no wait total duration
we divide that by 60 down there so the
total duration is not divided by 60 yet
oh so this is all that's this is total
rate this is minutes total duration
so let's total duration hours yeah I'm
gonna place this here yeah if the total
duration hours is below 40 31 hours it's
right
and I can also like say that we also
want it to be
if you wondering why I'm quoting some
properties it's a bit because JavaScript
does not allow allow dashes in object
property names unless they're a string
in a string exactly so let's say that
it's too low then the font weight should
be bold
otherwise it should be normal you can
also type like this if you so what's the
font size
I don't remember 2008 20 pixels so now
we have some duplication here yeah
between these I think so both of these
we see here like this is a great place
in my opinion a great programming
technique to know when you should
modernize and generalize and remove the
application you see a select duplication
rise first
yeah and that is what we're seeing here
so we see that we have the width where
the inline display:inline-block that
clay there's some font size exactly
there come on so let's let's create make
those perfectly duplicated so the font
size and the line height I was
experimenting with the line Heights oh
yeah we have that as well and I know why
that didn't work was because I thought
it was CSS classes I was actually
looking at the wrong at the wrong
counter yeah so so we are width we have
display and we have font size and we
have the line height also we have the
margin bottom here yeah so what so we
want to create now a something that is
shared between these two what would we
call these things mounters counters
okay so let's create a counter style
here
let's count their style the tension of
default style as well oh yeah that's
true because then they could the other
ones could extend the counter style
precisely so it's all of these perhaps
yeah so I am just gonna steal this there
and the playlist countdown is just gonna
be a counter style because that is we
don't have any extensions to this here
but here we are extending it so it's
gonna bleed this is gonna be we don't
need these because this is just gonna be
an extension of counter style so now
we've removed quite a bit of duplication
by composing these styling objects and
this is just completely impossible to do
in in CSS I think it's possibly possible
to do less or sass not sure but as it
like here we are doing it without
introducing any any special language or
special tooling it it yes we are just
making sure use of the tooling that
react is already using for other things
now I just start to fix up the input
field
can I put padding on it or do I know I
know
I need the object there and just to sign
something like that something like that
and of course we would like it to have
the same beautiful font so I will extend
with the default style how would that
work but I would have to put the color
to black will this work yes brilliant
beautiful because it's not used in
multiple components we might as well
just keep it here yeah it's not too bad
just add some paddy and I'd like a
background could I have the background
change now which is even or uneven yeah
sure
oops it will crash right now so how do
can I know if is it possible for me to
write now now which playlist I am in the
know but you can pass that in as a prop
actually okay just pass in the index as
a prop so that's when we're doing the
data the data stuff right or here when I
yeah exactly you yeah exactly
yes Matt doesn't having this it does it
does yeah it does as a second are you so
the index there yeah a lot of functional
purists programmers hate that but it's I
think it's actually very useful like
that yeah so if index modulus - yep this
is just to check if it's even or odd and
I don't care which one it is I just want
it to be either okay some cool color
nice color
Oh oh my god Google delivers silver yeah
it can be either silver or gray either
silver or there and it is called
background color I know this is very
scary
yeah index is not defined yeah because
it's called this is dot products
hmm that's very nice you can I also just
demonstrate one further feature of
various that is nice that you the fact
that we are that this is your JavaScript
and not just some special language
allows us to use your standard
JavaScript functions here so we can just
do like is even or is it odd I don't
care what do you mean is that a standard
JavaScript function no it isn't it isn't
but let's say that I music demo I want
to just demonstrate the capability of
using functions in your styling yeah so
let's say that we had access to that
function is called is odd so and it
should work now and it's probably the
other way around but we don't care it's
the other way yeah
okay and then just final final final
final side here v equals large ten
pixels and here let's do a side here as
well oops and everything looks way nicer
and this can just be way and I think
we're sort of done I think so I think so
I don't know if this has a boat what I
hope I sold the react styling
capabilities enough I mean this this
function capability could also you could
also use that to generate your
properties as well so you can use react
prints as if you wanted this to be like
slightly like start gray and then become
slightly wider so that became like this
gradient thing we could use the use
functions to to generate that which
would also be very difficult to do we
are playing CSS I just want them to be
for I know this is really really lousy
way of doing it yeah we know perhaps it
was really good that to her alright it
should be flexbox but ah I think that's
what you're really good at making this
looks looked really good but we have the
whole functionality here I can sort on
stuff or I can filter on stuff and we
get the hours and the playlists and
everything is conditional and we don't
have much in the CSS we have everything
in in line but it's attached to each
component so we don't have to worry
about the CSS limitations and we can
take advantage of the JavaScript
benefits of doing
these are even background stuff
so should we commit this yep
and for everyone's pleasure we'll just
publish it all right it's deployed let's
reload here I don't know if we have to
we do yeah well yeah you're talking
about the order in loading yeah that
only works on the ways it straps that
way
because the thing that it deploys is a
very sleep anymore
halo here we see that it's left the line
because it's using a new CSS that's more
sure I get my playlists and they have
the conditional styling here and here we
are going to do one more episode right
after this one where we just talk about
what you did and reflection on this
holder but first we're gonna go grab a
beer yeah I think it's down here
somewhere
yeah exactly so then I think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
