Nielsen and this is dev tips and as you
might be aware of we are doing a series
called CSS animations I really think you
should check out if you haven't the the
episode that we did last week on CSS
transitions which is the first episode
in this series and we talked about that
a broader sense what our animations and
what our transitions how do you trigger
them and a whole bunch of good stuff
that give a lot of context for what
we'll be doing today we talked about the
properties that you can animate and what
are the best properties to animate to
get the best performance out of your
browser so you really want to check
those out those were last week and if
you have already then this is this is
the party you should be joining us let's
do this okay
so as I said there's two main episodes
last week was transitions and then this
is the episode we're going to be doing
today about CSS animation print property
and then after this next week and for a
few weeks after that we're going to be
going into something that I call
elements you should animate and this is
going to be a little bit more into the
design style and UX of things like what
are good ideas to animate and what
should you stay away stay away from and
also when should you be animating things
right there sometimes are better than
others during the users interaction flow
okay enough of that we're going to get
in today's content which is the
animation property and in order to use
the animation property we have to use
something else called keyframes also so
these kind of things work together and
today is part 2 of the CSS animation
series so let's get started
we're going to talk about keyframes
first cuz they're a lot easier to
understand then animation property
animation property is a lot more fiddly
and see a CSS keyframes are a little bit
more like they make a lot more sense
when you just just read them so here is
the syntax for CSS keyframes it's pretty
simple now keep in mind that these do
not have any selectors on them they're
not nested inside of anything they are
on the root of the CSS page so you write
at keyframes and then a name you can
name it anything you want or you see
right there in orange name it whatever
you want and we're going to use that
name later on to call the selector okay
so I'm just going to iterate this again
these keyframes are not inside of a so
at all if you wrote these keyframes out
perfectly they would not make anything
happen on their own that's why the
animation and keyframes are kind of a
pair that work together but we're just
 song focusing on keyframes right
now nasty inside the keyframe
declaration you have the opening paren
and the closing print but inside those
are two other declarations you have what
are the actual keyframes right so in
this case we're looking at from and the
twos those those in purple those say
start here and end here and the green
definition of styles are what is
changing what should the initial state
be like and then - how should they
change what should it look like at the
end and the keyframes the animation call
will will transition those it'll handle
the in-between states or the tweening
that happens between these states from
into and here's here's an example of the
code written out so our name would be my
frames the from into and inside we're
going to have a high of 200 pixels and a
background of orange and it animates to
400 pixels in the background turns pink
that's this animation right here so what
we're going to do right now is we're
going to jump into the keyframes and
we're gonna write out a few freezing in
and I want to show you a few ideas that
you can do with them and some of the
nuances that are built into them that
may not be super apparent but it's
pretty easy I think that you're going to
enjoy so let's do let's do some
keyframes okay so this is a pretty
simple setup we have one HTML element
called box and we have a CSS body with a
padding of 50 and then the box element
has its inline block background pink
width and height or 200 pixels positions
relative and then I also have an
animation style declared on the box okay
now currently it's doing nothing because
there's it's calling an N it's calling
keyframes called my frames but there
currently are none so we need to write
that now later on when I go in to do
animation I'm gonna I'm gonna like talk
about everything that you're seeing here
and I'm going to delete it and write it
out for you and with you so you can see
how that's generated but I need those
things to enable you to see how these
keyframes are working right okay so
we're going to say at keyframes
and then I'm going to use the name that
I'm called in the animation right here
called my frames right so the keyframes
are my frames and now we'll write from
to have the starting state and then
let's just say height is a good a good
example to see this height is 200 pixels
as it is and then the - we want it just
to grow age height - maybe about let's
say 600 pixels okay so it's growing 600
pixels and you notice that the when the
animation is done when it's grown all
the way to 600 pixels it just resets
because the animation is looping and
we'll talk about how to define the
behaviors of the animation in a little
bit but right now these keyframes are
telling us what is happening and the
animation call will tell us how it's
happening so one of the things you can
do in this is put multiple um style
declarations in here so for example I'm
going to write background orange regular
house Bell orange and the animation is
starting at pink and animating down to
orange right it's pretty simple you can
also do this instead of saying from and
- you could say 0% to 100% and this is
this the same as doing from in to but
what this enables you to do is to add
something else in there like let's say
here's 30% and we'll make the width 400
pixels I'll see you there at 30% it's
growing a little bit wider as it's an as
its animating down now if I want that
width to kind of stay out there I could
write 100% right here right so notice
that you can define 100% twice really
which is an interesting thing you might
not see that a lot but it's possible you
could even do let's say 70% here so in
this case I'm defining 100% before I'm
defining 70% all right you see how see
how 100% had does not have a height of
6600 so it's shrinking back up before
the animation resets
right so there's a lot of interesting
things you can do there it's pretty
malleable but it makes um but but it
makes a lot of a lot of sense when you
kind of start digging into it and again
all of these things I'm showing you
today are just like how this works right
and to really get a great understanding
of how it works you're going to have to
crack open your browser and your editor
and start messing with things and to
really understand it and before we're
done with keyframes here one thing I
wanted to show you is you can create
kind of like a pause in the middle of
the animation in certain ways so for
example if I change this 100 to 70 in
this back to 100 so the you can see that
let make it simpler for you let me just
make this simpler for you I'll make this
400 I'll make this height so it's easier
to see get rid of this background color
stuff so what's happening is you're
going to see what looks like the
animation going to 400 pixels and then
pausing and then working down to 600
pixels and that's because from 30% to
70% I don't have any changes going on
and that's one really quick way to do
that right here and so instead of like
controlling random elements right here
you could also make it more in line and
have it create like a little brick in
the animation or a little pause so this
is all one looping animation even though
it looks like two animations are
happening grow and then grow but it's
actually grow pause grow inside of one
animation okay so that's a little trick
trick for you and next let's go back to
the code and learn about this guy learn
about animation yeah so the animation
property is pretty complicated and
nuanced but it's also pretty
straightforward once you get the hang of
the idea so here we are looking at the
syntax keep in mind that the animation
property is inside of the selector right
it doesn't hang outside like the
keyframes do in fact that name which is
the first value of the animation
property that should match the keyframes
perfectly exactly and this is how you
tie the keyframes to the animation so
the keyframes are what the animation
does and the animation is how it's done
like like the speed the
duration the timing function the delay
how many times it does that's the
iteration count and all this stuff this
is an example below of what it might
look like written out and keep in mind
that the animation property is a
shorthand CSS property so all these
things my frames two seconds is an out
zero seconds infinite they all have
meaning but you have to understand what
you're looking at it could look like
just like a bunch of random garbage so
so my recommendation is get get in the
habit of understanding what each of
these keywords are or with like each of
these values represent but in the
meantime there's a longhand way to write
them out and they're a lot easier to
read a lot easier for me to talk with
you about them so let's jump back into
the code and I'll show you exactly what
I'm talking about so here we are where
we left off in our code we have this
animation right here and this is again
that shorthand and we're going to delete
that and I have in my clipboard I'm just
going to paste basically the same thing
that the shorthand was doing but maybe a
little bit more verbose so each of these
prop H of these we have properties here
was one of the you know is equates to
one of the values that you saw in the
shorthand so let me separate this out
from the selector a little bit okay so
animation name obviously is going to be
my frames because our keyframes are
called my frames and if we want this
animation to work it has to be exact
now we want this animation to last two
seconds long so a lot of these are
pretty pretty easy but some of them are
a little bit tricky
timing values or timing function these
are going to be the same like transition
that we saw last week so these you can
use keywords like ease in linear ease in
out sign these kind of things or you can
even use cubic Bezier like we saw again
last week in the transition episode now
animation delay is interesting to
understand because it means how long are
we going to wait once this animation is
triggered before the visuals start
happening right and when you think about
okay so the next one here is called
iteration count and I'm going to circle
back to delay and show the relationship
there iteration count is a number
should this should this animation happen
twice you write the number two right
here I have the keyword infinite which
means that this animation will keep
going forever now go back to the delay
you might think that if I put a delay on
it let's say five seconds watch this
animation sit here for five seconds and
then start now what is your assumption
do you think there's going to be a
five-second between each one we are
wrong there is not so this delay only is
attributed to how long do we wait before
the animation starts if you want a delay
between each iteration you have to build
it into your keyframes kind of like we
did here when we paused it at 400 so you
might say 0-2 let's say 20% and then
there would be a delay in the beginning
then then you know the next one this is
riveting oh that five second threw me
off of like away I thought we got rid of
it okay so the five seconds is gone now
iteration count infinite now here's an
interesting thing as well because let's
say we put our iteration count at three
this means that this animation will
happen three times and then it will stop
one two three and then stop okay that
makes sense now the animation Direction
is pretty pretty closely tied to the
iteration count
okay so Direction means if you can think
of a time line right with this is an
animation so time line is which way is
the playhead moving you can actually put
this in Reverse so now the animation
will shrink instead of grow because
we're doing this animation in Reverse
and it will do it three times notice and
now it's done you can also put another
keyword alternate and this one means
that it will go forward backward and
then forward again and then stop now you
might have thinking like oh why didn't
it go back and forward three times but
it didn't because each way eat
forward/reverse and forwarding and
that's three iterations if it could be
be careful of that so if you wanted to
go up and down three times you have to
put six iterations because you know each
one is two you know what I mean
now let's look at animation Phil mode
this is this is a weird one so you'll
notice that every time this animation
stops it goes back to where it started
this animation film mode will control
what the what the element looks like
after it's been animated right or
stopped so if you put it's a really
weird keyword keyword um four words this
keyword will say make it look like the
last frame or make it look like the
ending of the animation and then stop it
so you notice how it went down it down
up and down which is our three iteration
count and then I said four words which
means it stops and it looks like how it
should at the end of the animation I
usually do four words but you could use
backwards or normal or inherit like you
know you like other things there's out
the keywords there but four words makes
the most sense to me like if I animate
something to the right I want to stay to
the right and the next thing is
animation place date this could be
running or pause duh so it's paused at
the top there because you know every
time I write this new code it kind of
refreshes that little browser thing in
there but let me show you some
JavaScript here and I will show you that
it actually does not just reset it and
stop it but it does pause it in the
middle of the prog the progress of the
animation so what are we talking about
here turn box and we're talking about on
click
function okay and inside of that click
function will say the thing that we
clicked on toggle class is paused all
right so that's our JavaScript and we
need to make another class here and
we'll say and is paused and then in that
class will put this animation play state
paused and then let's put the iteration
count got an error here okay let's put
the iteration count to infinite so you
can see okay so now when this refreshes
okay it's going to refresh and this
animation is going up and down up and
down the whole time but I have it so
when I click on this box a class will be
applied to it called is paused and if
that's true then the animation play
state will be paused so it's out in the
middle and it's paused I can toggle that
off and it will finish the animation
same so keep that in mind and that that
you know it's Java scripts you can put
the trigger on anything right like right
now I'm clicking on the box but there
could be like a button over here that
will stop animation over here you can do
a lot of things with this so now let's
talk about triggering since we're
already doing it here with the paused
why don't we talk about I mean last time
we showed you when we did transition I
showed you how you can hover over
something to enact an animation you can
add or remove classes to get animations
going or stopping right and then you can
also do what I just did right now by
using this this paused technique the
other way to get an animation going is
by introducing a new element that has
the animation applied to it so if you go
back to our classes it's the third one
right new elements that have animations
already on them
start getting animated and this is not
how transitions work remember at the end
the last video if you introduce a new
element the transition on it it starts
at the end of the transition it's just
like oh I've already been translate
transitioned but this will do the whole
animation in front of you okay let me
show you how that works okay so I
haven't thought about this example yet
let me do an iteration count of one and
I'll do I'll do the keyframes not height
but transform a scale from zero to is it
like animating while I'm working on this
zero to one and we'll do the duration
faster much faster 300 milliseconds
maybe the ease in out is good delay zero
good one mm-hmm-hmm nope for I wasn't
normal and fill mode forwards yeah
that's good and not is paused okay so
when I click on let's say body let's
just click on anything the body will get
appended append a and a box which is our
pink element that has it on there now
let's delete box and what I hope we see
is click on the body and the word box
shows up oh I was using a Jade inside of
jQuery not possible div class equals box
okay save
that was a little fast oh I did 30
milliseconds so like wow that's fast all
right and actually instead of clicking
on the body we need to click on HTML and
then this will say find find the body
find the body okay so does that make
sense what the reason I put a click on
HTML is because the body actually is
nothing in it it's super small so in
this meat gives us a bigger target area
I'll click on the HTML and guess what
happens a box grows in and now notice
that you know it didn't just like a peer
already animated or grow go away because
I put animation Phil forwards so this is
a great way of like if you have like if
your box said you know there's like an
alert inside of it then it's a great way
to like be able to share the message
with you know the viewer like oh here
grow the box there it is there we are
and you can do other things in here as
well like remember we said that in the
last video
opacity was opacity was a great was a
great thing to transform or to
transition so same thing with animation
Oh
2:01 okay there we go so now it looks
like it's fading in and you can do all
kinds of cool things but we'll get more
into that stuff like Nina in the other
videos we talked about like how what's a
good way to introduce an element to the
to the screen anyway uh this is really
great I've had a lot of fun and this is
these are animations so you have a
challenge this week because next week
we're going to go into the elements and
I'm not sure what element we're going to
do next week I'm thinking we might do
something really simple like a button or
like a drop down or something something
simple because I want to spend a little
bit more time talking about the UX of it
like when is it a good moment to to
spark an animation anyway your
assignment this
week is to go a code pin and or whatever
and make something with animations like
like try to invent something with
everything that we've learned use
transforms or use the animation property
it doesn't matter and then link it down
in the comments below because I want to
see what you guys are up to so I really
appreciate you got watching this and I'm
excited to see what you are doing and
