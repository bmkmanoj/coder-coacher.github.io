Travis and this is dev tips
ah recently we've been looking at
animation on the web and in the last two
videos we looked at the mechanics of CSS
animations and how to get them working
in your browser and we spent a lot of
time talking about how to get these
things done and as I was you know making
the next video to learn how to code
specific components for the web I
realized we haven't talked about the why
yet so before we go into learning more
about the specific components that I
think are a good idea to animate I want
to talk with you about why you should be
animating certain things and why you
should not be animating other things so
consider this an education in user
experience for you coding nerds and of
course this is not going to be an
exhaustive list but we can look at those
moments and see when animation is adding
to the user experience so I have a list
here of six things let's go down the
list we have orientation functional
change a new element is on the page
highlighting something to bring the
users attention to it visual feedback
letting the user know that they're doing
the right thing and system status
letting them know that you know
something's working so let's just scroll
through these I have a few examples of
these of an animation working in the
context of these moments right now keep
in mind that the execution of the
animation that I'm going to show here is
not of course the only time or the only
way that we can bring these moments
about I'm just giving you one example
that will let you understand how this
principle how this moment works and
again all of these this code is is live
and available for you to check out on
code pin so we're not going to be doing
any code right now today but all the
code that I wrote last night to get
these six examples working is available
for you to like you know you can go over
here to editor view in and
got all this all the code that I wrote
it's just too much to go over in this
one video but dissect it dive in it's
it's pretty it's pretty fun so let's go
back to a full page where was I okay
first one first principal first moment
is orientation okay now this moment this
idea this principal will try to answer
the question each of these moments I
paired with a question to help us like
understand what problem we're trying to
solve with this animation right so this
question is where am I now and in this
example here I have someone filling out
a form that's my new name
tortoise and when they click this button
okay what's going to happen and how do
we show show that in like a subliminal
orientated way to the user now click
this button and I can see that
the page I was in got taken away and
over overridden by a new page and so
we're giving the user information about
what they're going through right now
we're saying that there's going to be
steps like maybe the second page also
has a form like credit card number and
the next one be like email address or
whatever when we do this animation we're
saying we've got that here's the next
thing and there's a lot of subtlety that
we're communicating by doing this
animation we're saying that okay we we
understand your your input here's the
next step we're saying that this is a
sequence we're saying that you're doing
good like notice how the the color
changed a little bit it's more d
saturated right here we're saying that
these are part of a series right there's
a lot of things that are being
communicated with this animation now
orientation is a principal and I really
wanted to kind of nail down the idea
that all of these executions that I'm
going to showing you on this in this
video are not the only expression of the
principal right so here's orientation
how how else could you use the idea of
animating orientation to help people
know what their
doing I'm thinking of like you know if
you click on a calendar icon it expands
to have an actual calendar like it you
you can zoom in you can open unfold you
can you can orientate people like let's
say you click on a link and then you see
the page slide out a new page slide in
this is where modal's happen animation
lets you know that you traveled
somewhere that the UI is new because of
something that you did and it lets you
know where you are now in relation to
where you came from okay that's the
important thing when a user goes to a
new experience a new view a new page and
they don't feel confident in where they
are that means they're not sure where
they are in related relation to where
they came from okay so there's a lot of
this going on inside there but try to
tap into that and we can use animation
to orient people to where they are in
relation to where they were okay so
scroll down I think I've talked about
orientation enough functional change
there's a really interesting pattern in
UX where the thing that we clicked on
after we clicked on it it has a
different function the button means
something else okay so this this
animation answers the question what does
this element do now so here we have just
a basic toggle you've seen these a
million times but when I click it notice
that this button animates and we see
that it has a change if I click this
button again it has a completely
opposite effect of what it did the first
time I clicked it right it's a toggle on
or off it's the same UI element but it
can do different things depending on
what state it's in and this animation
here will help me to know what state
it's in so let me think it let me throw
out a few other like executions of this
principle we have the you know the
hamburger menu and if you click on it it
turns into an X that's the same button
the same area the same the same you know
icon to click has changed States and if
it if it just quickly turns interim an X
into a three button
three or that called a hamburger then
maybe it's not as clear as if you see
animate or something maybe there's like
a mute to a volume button different
things where that same area if I clicked
it twice it would have two different two
different functions this is what I'm
talking about when I was saying
functional change an animation can help
make that more clear okay that this
button means something else now and
answers the question what does it do now
let's move on a new element this answers
the question what should I be looking at
when we introduce a new element to the
page then there's that's it's a really
hard thing because we're trying to help
the user to understand that something
new is on the page and help them
understand why it's there
okay so I have a mock layout here it
looks like a wireframe or something and
when I hit this trigger button we're
going to we're going to animate in a
like an alert right pushes the
information down but notice the way it
doesn't just like pop in and just like
disorient where I was reading here and
now it's gone right it's pushing it down
it's animating it down to let me know
that something new happened here and I
can look at this new thing and say okay
this came from where I know where X is
it want and now I can read it and
understand what its relation is to the
content that it's you know being
introduced to so new elements are a
really good opportunity to use animation
to make it clear to the user what this
thing is why it's here and is it a
temporary item like a modal or a a new
interface but of a new interface element
alert message maybe it's a success like
a congratulations your purchase went
through maybe it's you know could be a
lot of things and it's having to add a
new element to the page it's an option
to animate in and I'm talking about like
maybe it's a drop-down menu you add a
mate animate the the menu that comes
down maybe it's a I don't know
maybe it's your adding you know a friend
like you know you just followed somebody
and so you're adding them to the list of
followers or something there's a lot of
opportunities where we can add elements
to the page and to do so with an
animation helps people to understand
what was added what what changed and why
use a lot you can communicate very
subtly with animation you can even tell
people why with animation and the next
one is highlight highlight answers the
question what is important on this page
and when I was thinking of highlight I
was thinking of like a maybe like it's
like a UX demo you know like this is
maybe we're have like a marketing page
for our application and you have this
like little beacon or this little like
of this feature and we and you hover
hover over it maybe like talks about
that feature or something or you know
but like these little animations these
little pulsing here bring our attention
to that spot now this is it this is a
really really powerful thing motion like
motion okay let's just take a moment
here and respect motion because in terms
of UX hierarchy we have information
levels right you know like let's say our
headline is at the top and then we have
a kicker and then the subhead and a body
line in like a citation maybe all of
these things have a built in structure
that give us information when we're
trying to scan a news article we know
what to look for right
well animation really it goes above
almost everything every time when we're
talking about the hierarchy of a page
and so if you really want to draw
attention to an element especially if
it's in a very crowded page you know
like a very busy noisy page sometimes
it's unavoidable but one way to stand
out above the crowd stand out is to use
animation and right here I'm showing you
like a little beacon that's popping but
it could be a million other things right
maybe you know maybe it's something
that's dropping out of the sky
maybe it's something that's you know
changing just changing colors or maybe a
million things just I'm talking about
animation as that principle to to answer
the question what is important here as
the user what should I be looking at
animation is a great way to do that less
next one visual feedbags is one of my
favorites on this example because I was
like by the time I coded this yesterday
was like 3:00 in the morning was like oh
he's going to be good anyway visual
feedback answers the question is this
layout understanding what I'm telling it
to do as a user I'm giving it
information I'm telling it that I you
know like I want to navigate to another
page or in this case I want to send this
message or this email right so let me
click the send the email button and tell
me if this animation makes you feel that
the email system understood what I was
trying to tell it okay click see how it
just kind of flew up this is something
I've seen on Mac OS X in their mill I
don't use their mail but I've seen this
and I would really liked it and also had
this like kind of like noise audio is
another another powerful thing anyway so
in in this animation you can see like it
has a bouncing it jumps up like we have
this idea that we're sending the email
we're shoving it up into the cloud or
putting it out on the internet and this
is really great visual feedback because
my intent as the user is to send this
email out and if the animation
replicates or or or represents that's
the idea that's the word if the
animation represents that idea with
motion it's all the better right so I'm
going to send this email it's gone
Internet all right we have one more this
is called system status this one is
actually really important let's say that
we're building an interface and the you
know the backend has to process some
information like maybe we're pulling a
report from a database maybe we're
sending sending
a submit of a form maybe we're what's
the other one
I don't know you know like processing
the credit card or something we need to
let the user know that we're not blocked
we're not stumbling we're not we're not
throwing errors but we're thinking and
we're processing and it's working this
is intended right so I have here just an
example of run-of-the-mill progress bar
but you can see that this progress bar
has different speeds it kind of kind of
stops right there and jumps to here and
slows back to normal and and so forth
this animation is specifically the way
that it kind of jerks around if it was
one linear growth like that would be
okay but I would I would know that you
know nothing is connected there to
what's actually happening but because it
has this kind of like jerky motion it
tricks me it makes me feel that like oh
something's happening I this is one time
sigh aside here but at a job that I was
doing I did a similar type of bar and I
programmed the animation wrong where
like it actually went up and then went
back and they went forward and then um
one of the engineers who is implementing
my code was like I really like it it
makes me think that like something went
wrong and then it tells me something
there right it was like a roller coaster
of emotion but the point is that
animation connects to us an emotional
level and you could say sure is just a
system status is just a progress bar but
the point is that we all have these
intimate relationships with progress
bars and you know what's what's more
effective a spinner or a progress bar
and why they all tell a story and this
is just this is just a progress bar but
the idea of a system status it could be
any time it could be any message
processing right and there's like the
little ball is jumping oh here's one the
Google like when you do a voice command
and like the balls jump like this and
then when you talk they they grow like
this those are system status animations
and there
so visual feedbacks like they all you
know that nothing is just exclusively
one but these things work together and
these principles combined together to
make a really great experience for your
user and that is the end of our video
now as we said in the beginning of this
video these are all moments right
but if you look deeper into what's
really happening you'll see that there's
something that ties all of these moments
together and that is the idea of change
when a user performs a command or hovers
over a button or clicks a target these
are all actions that are asking the user
is requesting from the interface things
to change open a modal send a form drop
a menu check a box navigate to a new
page these are all moments of change and
as we discussed in the first episode of
this series animation is all about the
motion of changing from one state into
another and helping the user to
understand what just happened and what
they should be doing now thank you so
