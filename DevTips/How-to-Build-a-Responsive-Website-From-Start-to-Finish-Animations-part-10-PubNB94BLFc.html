tips I are you so excited I get to ah
so welcome to Monday uh we are doing
number like ten of this video series is
just going to so much for so many more
and this is an interesting installment
of the video series because I asked you
guys what you wanted to do I said do you
want to do more animation stuff look at
the way that we handle these hover
effects for the thumbnails and in the
work section or do you want to continue
on and just build out the work section
and you responded in the comments below
the vast majority of you saying that you
wanted to look at some animations a
little bit more so never fear I have
listened and that's what we're doing
today we're looking at some animations I
want to take you through two different
approaches the first approach is that
I'm going to do it myself as one would
say okay what do I think would be a good
idea and just kind of walk you through a
bit of just like the normal way I would
approach transitioning these type of
interactions the second way is I'm going
to take you through and use a an open
source library where we can grab some
code and try to apply it to our use case
we have to do a little bit of hacking to
make it work but it does work and it's
really exciting so uh yeah that's it
let's just get started
okay here's where we left off last time
in the work section we have these panels
that slide up when we hover over the
thumbnail and how we do that is we have
the thumb unit and we say that it's
going to have an overflow of hidden and
then the also important thing is that we
have a position of relative so thumb
overlay is the next bit that's the brown
thing and what it will do is by nature
it will start at mmm the full height and
width of see height is 100 percent the
full height and width of its parent
which is the the the thumb unit but it
will also be pushed down from the top
100% if you can imagine it put actually
let me just illustrate that for you
inspect element I'm going to thumb
overlay and right now we're at the top
1% let me take that down you see how
this is working if it's 0% from the top
10% 20 and we're just pushing it down a
hundred percent is the is the same
amount of as whatever the height of the
parent is right so if the thumb units
height was padding top so if the thumb
unit was taller the height of the
overlay would be taller it's just that
simple
now that we understand how this overlays
pop is where it's coming from let me Oh
let me actually open this overlay
overflow and I'll show you what it looks
like when it's not being cut off you see
how these things are down below there
they're pushed down 100% and then when
we when we hover over them that's what
this declaration does hover over the
parent which this is this ampersand is
referring to the parent of thumb unit so
this says when the thumb unit gets
hovered take the child which is the
overlay the thumb overlay and position
it absolutely you know that I could do
this doesn't even need to be all this
magic it could be top I want to do okay
this could be the top 0% and then
position the overlay top 0% so put it
back where it naturally would be let's
refresh you're going to show that with I
mean see how it slides right back up to
where it naturally should be it's going
to the top 0% from 100% to 0% and that's
that slide now this is animated by using
this little declaration right in overlay
where are you transition right here this
guy is a a bourbon mix in which just
will output the the various browser
prefix transition declarations with a
few defaults I think it's 300
milliseconds transition all and the
easing is like easing out or something
like that those are the defaults right
so that's how this animation is
happening let me turn that
overflow:hidden back on so you can see
what it will look like so that's the
transition now we saw me kind of go
through this and create it last time but
what we want to do this time now that we
have a really firm understanding of how
this transition takes place we can mess
with it we can is really mold it and
this is where a lot of the fun comes
from my favorite parts anyway because
you could just like think of these
different parameters and kind of
attributes that are being attributed to
these styles and just mess with them and
make something really really interesting
so the first one I want to show you is
kind of like how to do like a little bit
more of a perspective on it now to do
that we have to remember and not forget
a really important CSS declaration
called perspective so let's look at the
work markup here and remember we have
the thumb unit which has the background
on it and then we have the thumb overlay
that's the brown box that's sliding up
and down so it's a parent and child now
we have to go to the thumb unit here and
tell it to have an inherent perspective
we have to tell it how far you has the
viewer or the you know the website user
are from this box literally in 3d space
it's kind of an interesting idea but let
me show you how that works go over to
the thumb unit and it's just as simple
as this I'm going to use bourbon again
and say perspective 300 now 300 is just
a starting place it's something that
I've used before I 300 is unit of
measurement that we're going to use to
start with and then we can adjust it
accordingly and it's something that I've
used and felt and found comfortable in
the passo to start there so the parent
of thumb the parent which is thumb unit
is going to have a perspective of 300
and then we'll go down here to the thumb
overlay and start kind of messing around
with another bourbon mix in another CSS
property
called transform rotate rotate Capital X
and then we'll just say 90 degrees now
this is going to be the beginning
position of our our animation remember
this is the natural place for it all of
them are going to be rotated 90 degrees
in the X plane until you hover over them
so let's copy and paste that down here
hover over them to be zero degrees okay
and let's just take a look at what we
got there so that's the animation right
now I want to slow that down a little
bit let's go to transition here and say
800 milliseconds okay so it's still
coming from the bottom like it used to
but it's tilting itself in 3d space you
see how these coordinates are slowed
down a little bit further let me say
five seconds and okay you see it's still
like it's in 3d space we could see that
it doesn't fit you know like the edges
right here are not touching the you know
it's got this kind of like perspective
going on which is good but it's still
like sliding up from the bottom which
makes it a little odd so why don't we
say that it's not starting at 100% but
it's starting it at like 50% from the
top
that looks a little better in terms of
like a I don't know like a bat cave door
mmm then you're going to drive your
Batmobile out jump over the bridge sorry
I read too many comic books um let's do
negative 50 so that it can like lift up
a little bit oh that's cool let's say
zero you know what we want to do let's
put a transform origin
- borage and and we'll say that's going
to be from the center and the bottom
that way we're anchoring our animation
from the bottom of this thing and we'll
move it back down yeah let me show you
this okay so now that's even more so it
used to be pivoting from the center but
now it's pivot by default but now it's
pivoting from the very bottom or on this
bottom edge here so it definitely looks
like a door that's raising up and
lowering and that's pretty cool now one
thing we can also do to it is say it
also has an opacity of zero by default
and then when we were hovering it
transitions to an opacity of one so
it'll it'll up fading in oh that's kind
of cool let's see what that looks in
real time
it's kind of like opening door effect I
like that it looks like it's popping up
at out at you I wonder what it would
look like if we kind of raised it up a
little bit and did that negative 50 here
so it's actually going to slide down a
little bit this time because we're
raising it negative 50 from the top and
then putting it to a 0% of when you
enact the animation let's try that now
this is interesting
it looks like it's popping a little bit
more like popping and flipping at you
because it's not jumping up from the
bottom or raising up like that kind of
like Batmobile door that we were looking
at just as I can go
looks like I has a little bit more pop
pop pop like a flip that's cool
see this is like the way I like to
handle like animation animations and
transitions like just kind of experiment
with beginning and ending States you
know like I don't know I think it's fun
but there are libraries as well that we
can we can utilize in fact I was just
looking at one today it's called bounce
bounce joyous calm and bounce j/s is
interesting it's not a JavaScript
library but it's a JavaScript powered
editor I guess you would say right so
you have this little brick down here and
let me make this smaller so you can see
it in the window
okay we have this little brick down here
that um though that's cute that um you
know we can attribute animations to and
what we do is we grab these components
and here's a scale component so the
animation would be that it just scales
up which is kind of actually what we
were kind of looking for stiffness
really stiff animation really loose
animation more jelly like bounces four
times let's see what Oh
oh wow
bowing oiling that's cool
um Oh easy
sway this is cool this is kind of what
we want so once we get what we want we
have to just press this right here to
export the CSS what happened is now
we're given an animation like right
proper animation is not just using
transitions like we did so let's grab
this animation it's kind of large this
won't work in our sass file so let's
create another sass file but we'll use
CSS CSS this time and we'll put it in
tools yeah yeah let's put it in tools
and say call it animations da s CSS and
just paste everything in there for now
go to directory and add animations to
our CSS now we can go into animations
and the workflow that they're
prescribing is that we add animation
target to the thing but we want to keep
it a little bit more dry so we'll add
this as a placeholder and we'll just
take that so placeholder animation so
what we do is go into our work SAS and
we'd say thumb overlay put this at
extend placeholder animation that's what
it's called right animation yeah and
then we would have to get rid of weight
get rid of these things that thing and
get rid of this thing and make it zero
percent because we won't
just stay at the top okay so we're not
thinking about before-and-after anymore
now we're thinking about where should it
be and then I'm thinking to have some
adjusting after we run this let's see
where we're at right now refresh okay
that's what I thought actually we've
copied the wrong thing so let's go back
to this and it wants to go from oh here
we are the height ratio we want to go
from 0 to 1/2 from 0 to 1 so let's get
that code actually and that's going to
be right here and we'll replace this
other one right here V all right let's
see if that made a difference so that's
saying start at with an with 0 scale and
pop out so that would work but we need
to see it huh
we need to have a start at zero so what
am i doing matrix 3d mics
I need to find the two or the from
okay this is what we need to transform
from so let's take this to our start
place and do that I'm not sure this is
all really experimental right in front
of you guys I'm not really prepared I
guess let's try this all right it's a
little flashy like a little pop it pops
in and out but I get that's the idea
right like it has this bounce is that
what we wanted let's slow it down let's
go to animations a thousand milliseconds
let's just go to two second sweaters it
was the one we used it's two seconds
all right so what it's doing here is you
see that little flicker it's like
popping up going from a from zero to
full and then the animation is starting
taking it back to zero and jump and like
bouncing it to fall so we need to why
would it do that if I put the start at
zero here's a trick that I could
possibly use it's not going to stop the
flicker but it's going to hide it so
opacity one will do this trick and
opacity zero and then transition huh a
transition opacity 300 milliseconds now
that should that should transition only
opacity not all like we had it
previously and the opacity is going to
start at zero so she'll hopefully should
hide that little flicker we'll see what
we get so the flicker is still there but
I can see that the opacity transition is
softened that flicker a little bit but
if we delayed the opacity transition I
think we could just this is like a hacky
thing to do but who cares sometimes you
got to do this so um opacity and then we
would say ease in and then delay would
be 3 mm 300 milliseconds let's see if
this works
it's getting along there that's pretty
cool now I don't want the bounce to
actually be this long we were just
testing the animation this looks pretty
good let's change that bounce animation
time back to one second maybe that's
even too long but it's fine let's try it
yeah
there we are it's kind of a huh what'd
you guys think about that one little
bouncy bounce
it's fun let's see what else we can get
out of bounce Jas they have some presets
here so jelly similar to what we just
looked in back and forth
clock
Splatt that's interesting scale would be
from 0 to 1 0 to 1 well we're messing it
up oh I see what it was for slinky oh
that's cute
smack but that one's it would be nice
probably yeah I like that one let's use
that one so let's see if this scale it
goes from 1 to 2 we want from 0 to 1
yeah I'm going to export that CSS and
I'll just do that cool let's plug that
in whoa plug that in here and see how
that affects our animation might have to
do some re rehashing huh oh that's quite
nice what'd you guys think about that
kind of flips out very soft look of it
jelly feel alright so let's bounce J s
that's how you would use something like
bounce just keeping in mind what is your
beginning 0 and what is your ending 1
these are a ratio so 1 is basically 100%
height and or sorry width and then high
it would be 1 you know how percent there
so that's cool that's cool um yeah I
think that I'm just going to leave it
like this for the time being I'll put
this on github now we could make this a
little bit more poppy if we go over here
to the overflow turn that off and then
make the hover a z-index well I want to
do it like this
actually hover over the parent and make
that z-index like two or one I guess not
two is fine and then this stuff gets
over it's still under the child so I
just have to break that up because I
want to insert that declaration right
there let's see how that works out
see how it pops over everything it's a
little bit more classy I think a little
bit more exciting all right we're just
gonna leave it there I think that's good
okay that's our video today I really
hope you like it I hope that you can use
something like this in your day to day
now I want to also kind of just point
out that we have if you may or may not
have noticed we have been experiencing a
little bit of a growth spurt in the
channel recently and which is awesome
welcome to the show
but you guys that are new you may or may
not understand that this channel is a
little bit unique in the way that we
conduct ourselves namely we're a very
highly engaged Channel some I got it I
got an email or a comment or a
notification one one gentleman said that
he had watched the show for two weeks
and finally you know he was he was
leaving a comment now I'm thinking to
myself oh my gosh this is this this guy
watched the show for two weeks and Here
I am not even knowing you know like who
he is and stuff and now I feel like I
have a more of a connected more of a
connection with this gentleman and I
think that these type of connections are
why I do this stuff so if you are nail
please introduce yourself down there in
the comments below I want to get to know
you everybody else who watches the
channel regularly we all just kind of
talk and chitchat and I answer every
comment and we you know we get to know
each other and even so some of some of
you guys have been contributing on
github and and doing it having other
ways of interaction
I think that's what makes dev tips great
you know I teach a little bit and I have
like make some jokes sometimes but
really what makes this channel great in
my opinion is the contributions and
interactions and engagements that come
from you guys so please introduce
yourself down below and if you haven't
