this is so exciting I have a special
video for you today of something big you
know I wasn't expecting to share but oh
man I just so excited about it couldn't
sleep so I learned about a technology
called jade has heard about Jade man
okay I want to share this screencast
that I did for you real quick
last night and and I hope you like it I
want to use Jade quickly in a few other
videos that I'm going to be making
shortly so I want to get you guys
prepared and ready for that so let's
watch this video and get awesome
together all right let's go ah so this
is Jade and one of the nice things about
it is that it brings an entirely new
syntax to your HTML document now um a
new syntax why do we need that well it's
kind of like how you know you guys know
very well that I love sass and I use
sass all the time and I really prefer
the way it looks and feels to
traditional CSS we're getting rid of the
curly brackets we're getting rid of the
unnecessary semicolons at the end of
each line and we're just making a much
more easily read document so if I
inherit a sass document from somebody
else it's really easy to scan and to
understand everything in a similar way
that's what we're looking at with with
Jade right here so here is a quick a
quick tour and I'm going to show you
guys how to work Jade into your workflow
really easily and again I just learned
about Jade last night I've kind of been
aware of it but I know I never thought
that it's something that I wanted to
invest my time in but I was looking at a
few different things and preparing for
another video that I'm going to be
releasing shortly and I came across two
I said well that's interesting maybe
I'll just give that a quick shot and as
soon as I started working with it
like the magic is I just got so excited
about it and as I said I couldn't sleep
and in the morning I went in and started
talking to with my colleagues about it
and he got excited about it - Eagles I
know I've been using it for this project
in that project now Mike can we just
bring it into our main application it's
so great anyway so I
I'm getting derailed by my excitement
right now so this is what we're kind of
going to be looking at so in a similar
way that sass relies on indention and
nesting to get the right output in their
code so does Jade so for example HTML
here and then head and then title
actually let me just get started kit
code kit is a free download and you have
a 10-day trial I'm using the trial right
now I've never used code kit 2 before
even though I've given it given a copy
away on dev tips I'm a fan of code kit 1
and I just kind of decided I'd try code
kit 2 while I'm at it now and and I
really liked it I was using last night
and when when my trial is over I
definitely will make that purchase so
where was I oh yeah so I just dropped
that little folder on right here and all
I have in this project is an index.html
which you see the little target that
means it's the output file so index Jade
is like right you know like just like
the setter here an output file is going
to be index.html so Jade will be worked
on by code kit and in index.html will be
the result so let's go over here to my
editor and what I'm using is coda 2
though the same one that's going to be
announced the winner of who gets the
free copy of Kota 2 I'm using my copy
right now I love it
I'm using Kota 2 and using the split
screen feature that I showed you guys in
this Monday's video and I'm going to
write code in I'm going to write Jade
code in the left here and it's going to
output in the right and we'll show you
how simple it is and easy to write
really easy to understand read and
editable markup the outputs to plain and
simple HTML and what's cool about Jade
and similar to SAS is that you can start
easy and start you know slow you don't
have to do that the more complicated
things which eventually include
JavaScript and kind of like importing
data sets and things like that but you
can just use it to write nicer code
right off the bat and I'll show you how
to do it right now so the first thing
you're going to do with any
a HTML document is declare a doctype and
that's really really easily done in Jade
so I'm gonna say doctype and then HTML
and I'll hit save and code kit will do
its thing and output the correct HTML
tag of doctype HTML that's the html5
doctype doctype now I'm going to write
HTML because that is the tag that's
going to wrap everything in HTML so now
you see that what I wrote has nothing
else it's just four characters there's
no you know open and closing tags or
anything like that and what Jade has
done or what code kit has done is taken
that Jade document and rendered a
accurate representation of HTML one of
written here so next what if you think
about what's inside of an HTML you have
two tags generally there's going to be
the head and there's going to be the
body now I notice that I've nested these
in one level when you nest in one level
it's saying that make this tag a child
of this tag right so let me save it and
you can see that code kit has rendered
this Jade properly the head is now
inside of the HTML and the body is a
sibling of the head together inside of
the HTML now we're going to go one
another level here nesting and we're
going to say the title which is another
tag that we need in our HTML document
and the question now is how do I write
inside of this title because I want to I
want to say that you know this this
website has a title so what you do is
you write a space after the tag name and
then you can just write your text so
I'll write Jade intro and save and it
fills in the content of that tag so
what's happening here is it's just
taking the first keyword of this string
on this new line that's nested making
that into a tag respecting the space
that's how it knows when the tag is done
and then taking the content and throwing
it inside that tag so for example if I
had a dev tips tip so if the first word
was dev tips
all right that's that would be
interpreted as the actual HTML tag when
it's output so I'm going to save and you
can see that we have a new we've
invented a new HTML tag called dev tips
and and the content is titled Jade intro
we don't want that we just want the
title to be Jade intro so we'll use
we'll use the proper formatting there so
other things that we need to do in our
HTML header if you do meta tags meat
tags meta tags now when you're going to
do a meta tag for example if we want to
do a char set or a character set tag if
I do a space and start typing it will be
you know a child of or it will be the
content of the meta tag so if I want to
do the attributes like for example an
anchor needs a href right so a meta tag
needs the the attributes of kit of char
set for it to be valid and how you do
that is you put a paren and inside of
the paren you you write the attribute in
this case the char set equals and quotes
this is just like you know I mean if
this was an HTML tag it would say like
this meta charset right and you'd kind
of you'd go on like that so it's very
similar except for you now you're
putting it inside these parentheses the
char set is going to be utf-8 so we can
know what character set we're using in
this document
I'm going to another meta tag this time
we're going to do the name is equal to
viewport and we want this to be a
responsive document so now we're at the
point where we have we need to actually
write to attributes now in HTML you just
kind of write attribute and then equals
and then quote and then space and then
actually equals quote in Jade for a few
reasons you want to put this comma
between your attributes it's not
complicated keeps things clean but but
it is necessary so the next attribute
inside of
the meta tag is going to be content and
that's going to be equal to width equals
device - width and comma initial scale -
scale equal to one great so that's a
responsive meta tag and I put it as
decide scrolling here so we don't get
confused with the the indentions and I
have the text blown up so it's easier
for you guys to read I usually don't
code in 24-point type but you know c'est
la vie so link is the next tag we want
to do and we want to pull in a style
sheet so I'll say rel equal style sheet
and comma and now I'm going to get the
href for the style sheet that I'm trying
to pull in and in this case I want to
pull in bootstrap so I'm going to run
over to get bootstrap com getting
started and there's a quick link to
their CDN which is a really easy way to
start and that's going to be this URL
mm-hmm I forgot how to Mouse today I'm
going to grab that URL right there
put it in my href and save now I've got
the meta tag I've got the the meta the
viewport which helps me have a
responsive website and then the link to
the bootstrap CDN right fantastic
fantastic things are looking good and
look how look how nice and and a clean
this is it's really easy to read HTML
head title meta link you know done and I
would probably link link another
stylesheet you know my personal style
sheet that was rendered through SAS but
I'm just going to leave it at boots
check because we're not going to be
styling anything I'm just showing you
how Jade will render to usable HTML and
it's really simply done ok now we're
inside of our body
and something that you'll see a lot
inside of a bootstrap website you'll see
a div with the class equals container
right and remember how this works is you
write the name of the tag and then in
the paren you write the attribute name
and then its value just like that now
there is another way and a simpler way
to do this very same thing and I really
really like how they do it so there is
an idea and the idea is that 90% of like
the kind of structural HTML tags that
you're going to be writing our div tags
I hope we can just all agree that it's
somewhere between 70 and 90% of the
tackle that you're going to write or div
tags and Jade is taking that in account
and it's allowing you to write a
shorthand and it's very very similar to
it we're already used to with CSS if I
just write the CSS class name dot
container save you can see the output is
div class container so it's assuming if
I write dot container here it's assuming
that I wanted a div with the class name
of container
similarly we can get a we can get a an
ID a div with an ID of container right
look at that so instead of writing this
all right instead of writing this kind
of like gobbledygook I just wrote one
word with a class inside of it and then
and then instead of writing things
inside of the container you know and
then you have to kind of like nest it
and you know get it lined up right and
make sure that these things are like
make sure that you closed the tag in
Jade I'm just going to run up and I'm
going to say hello let me get rid of
this ID get rid of this one too hello
and ooh actually I made a mistake here
so this is interesting what Jade did was
interpreted what I wanted to be
literally a div with a class container
and the child of that be a class of or
not sorry a tag of hello similar to what
I showed you over here whenever dev tips
so I messed out what I needed to do was
go on the same line of container and use
that space just like we did here and
press save so I'm just learning this
right now guys - I mean I mess with it
for a few hours last night for I went to
bed and that's probably so anyway so um
div class container and then hello
inside of that div and that's because
that's how you do that now this will be
a lot easier when you write P and then
like some lorem save and have a
paragraph tag now here with a bunch of
lorem ipsum in it or you could do like
uh you could do a ch3 head line and now
you have a h3 tag with a headline in it
right it's so simple and like look at
how succinct and clean and easy to read
this is compared to kind of this less
attractive strings of text so this is
the beauty of Jade and this is not the
end of it not even close it does a lot
more awesome things but these are the
very basics that you can do right now to
get started today and I want to share
with you more in fact I will be sharing
with you more because I'll be using Jade
in the in the upcoming videos that I'll
be making soon in fact I think that I
well in fact I hope the one that I can
make in the next two days to share with
you on Monday as using the Jade I really
like it I hope you guys can try it it's
free to use I mean the technology is
free if you want to use code kit like
I'm using you can download a copy of
code kit right now for free
also proposed is a free download and you
can you can run Jade through pre pros or
code kit and both of those applications
are free to use for a trial period and
then your child will run out and you'll
need to buy it there but about $30
alternatively you can use your command
line and install Jade through node
package manager and it's it's pretty
easily done it's very standard kind of
thing to do there but me I'm not really
a command line kind of guy although I do
use it sometimes I'm just babbling now
Jade is awesome and we will see you guys
in a few days I'm excited to announce
the winner of Kota 2 on Mondays video
and also share a few other things with
you then until then keep on hacking take
care guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
