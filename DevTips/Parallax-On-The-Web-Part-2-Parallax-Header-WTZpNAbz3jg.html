called parallax on the web
parallax on the web in the first video
we looked at over 20 examples covering 8
different categories of how really smart
and talented people are innovating in
this technique today in the comments of
that video you guys link to tons of
other really impressive examples of
parallax on the web just loads of great
resources offered up by oh if you
haven't checked that out please be my
guest
for the rest of this series and I don't
even know how many videos that will be
we're going to be looking back in
referencing those examples and looking
at how to recreate them and so in this
video we're going to be looking at one
of the most common uses of parallax that
you will see in marketing and e-commerce
websites in that other video I called it
fixed background scrolling elements so
we're going to be building this it's a
mock online clothing store homepage that
uses parallax in the header you can find
the files I used to create this example
on github there's a link in the in the
description below but without any
further ado let's get into it to begin
the project the first thing I did was
look for a good kind of image that had a
good sense of the depth to it that would
enable me to extract different elements
and create the different layers of our
parallax effect so I found this image
here of this bird and I thought wow
that's really great it's got a really
nice crisp foreground the background is
nice and blurry so we can kind of you
know take liberty with how we manipulate
that the back of that photo so I went
ahead and created a logo for this for
this photograph I just kind of reminded
me of like some like a black bird is the
brand and it's a clothing line so I have
this logo here and I made it in
Illustrator so it can be an SVG and but
I think it would be nice if you just
kind of like went up and down and then
the bird in the foreground
I already extracted all of these
elements so like here's the the
foreground bird right here here's the
logo right there there's a this is the
background I'd be saturated it and added
some grain to make it a little bit more
indistinguishable when I have it
repeating in the background and I also
tried to make it as good as I could I
don't I think I could have done better
but I try to make it like a more
repeating image instead of just one
photograph so I did a lot of masking and
blurring and repeating and things like
that so let me show you our workspace
it's close Photoshop I don't need it I'm
going to drag this in to Adam I've been
using Adam lately it quite liked it
and I have code kit here running our
code I started the workspace using a
framework called skeleton skeleton is
cool first time I've ever used it but
it's it's nice and lightweight there's
not much to it compared to the other
frameworks that I've been using in the
other series so it's cool maybe I'll
focus more in on skeleton at a later
time but I just use skeleton as the base
styles and also a simple grid that I
might want to use later on but I'm not
using the good to begin with so what I
have here is a Jade file which is very
basic and the only thing in it that's
kind of notable is that I have this
section called content and in there as a
headline and some lorem for a paragraph
and it's just because I'm doing a
clothing store so what I want to do is
create this paralax header above the
clothing store HTML that I have here
also to note I have a div right here
with a height manually set of 2,000
pixels the reason I did this is because
it is a parallax scrolling effect that
we're going for so I need to have the
browser be scrollable so I just made it
was really big div so I can scroll up
and down no matter how high I have my
window here I also have jQuery Script
added and a jQuery or any functions page
which is completely blank at the moment
so here's my sass I have the base styles
here which just take care of
you know the font and this this was
called this article and a few other
defaults that skeleton didn't really
take care of for me but we took care of
it ourselves so let's start in our Jade
file here this gets compiled to the
index.html which is with the what we're
looking at here on the right now I have
as I said this section here I may
collapse that there what I want to do is
start right above the section and I'm
going to create a new section or rather
the HTML tag I'll use this time as
header and in this header I want to have
all of the elements be able to be placed
and what this header to push down the
section content that I have currently um
marked up and I don't want to push it
down and create a parallaxing effect and
the effect we're going to use if you
remember the video last a week that I
outlined up a bunch of different
parallax types the what we're going to
be using is a fixed background moving
elements that's the one that you're
going to see a lot for headers and it
works really well that's why so let's
get started I'll call the header bird
box because it's a box and we're going
to put some some birds in it so the
header bird box is going to contain the
background image itself and then inside
of that bird box is going to be a few
things there's going to be the logo so
to start their logo there's also going
to be a the the bird in the foreground
so I'll just call that the for bird and
then I also found a picture book of a
raven in flight and I blurred it and
everything like that let me show you
what I mean by that I call it I call it
backward it's just like a little it's
just a blurry bird looking image and I
want to put that in the background tube
and hopefully this would be like in the
background behind the logo so the so the
the parallax layers that we talked about
last week you know the background
mid-ground and foreground I'm going to
use the the landscape as the background
and I also want to have this what do I
call it backward backward backward back
birds singing in the dead of night so
I'm going to take the back bird and the
in the background the landscape as the
background the logo is going to be in
the mid ground and the four bird is
going to be in the foreground and we're
going to use these layered elements to
create this parallaxing effect so that's
really the mark-up of the header it's
it's really quite simple we have our
elements all there and we're going to
use a lot of CSS to round this out so
I'm going to go into my layout of my
layout sass and in this section called
parallax is where I'm going to start and
I'll start with the bird box which is
the header and I'll begin with saying
position:relative now the reason I do
position:relative is because I'm going
to have all of these elements that are
in the in the bird box these parallaxing
elements I'm going to have them all
absolutely positioned within the bird
box so the bird box needs to be
positioned relative so that it can be an
anchor for these different parallaxing
elements so position:relative is super
important and the height I'm just going
to have an arbitrary height let's just
let's just start with 600 and see if
that's good and let's start the
background this is like probably the
most important part of the bird box the
background the image is going to be URL
and it's going to be slash images you
notice I don't have it in assets this
time that's a that's a skeleton thing I
didn't feel like changing it because
it's just a one-pager example anyway so
images bird - BG dot jpg soup again
alright that's
that's the background there it's really
big because I wanted to do it why is it
really big I don't know it's just really
big so I need to shrink it up so let's
say size contain okay that looks good
and position top Center okay so if we
scroll up right now we just see that
this box has a background in it just
getting out of the window it's just
going up but I want to have the fixed
background style so this next property
and value that I'm going to write are
really what makes that magic happen I'm
going to say attachment fixed save and
now I can see that the background isn't
going anywhere
but I got those little jiggle eNOS and
the background isn't working right in
terms of the size anymore so what I want
to do is instead of saying background
size contain because what background
size contain does is it will it will
make it will stretch the image to where
its tallest side or widest side is
hitting the edge of its container so the
image is going to be completely
contained in that and in the box but
since we know how exactly how big that
box is going to be we can be a little
bit smarter with the size of the
background and work and make the browser
do less thinking so we can just say its
width is going to be auto and its height
is going to be that 600 pixels there you
go now it Scrolls a little bit better
what if it's scrolled janking because
the image is so big let me make it
smaller
okay it was scroll drinking because the
image was so big limit that's that's
fair enough
okay fix that so now we see that the
background is fixed in the space and it
looks as if this white box below it is
actually scrolling above but the truth
is we're scrolling we're scrolling the
bird box away but the background behind
it is fixed okay
so let's jump down to the next bit
inside of the bird box which was the
logo the logo let's say its height is
100 pixels and its width I'm going to
stretch it all the way across stretch it
all the way across the available width
and the background I want to see what
I'm working with so I'm going to say a
background color is pink point and the
image it's going to be URL and I have an
SVG for this and that's going to be in
images black bird logo dot SVG and I
want it to be a position Center let's
see what you got okay so it's repeating
those let's turn the repeat off repeat
no - repeat okay good good okay so now
let's see how it's it's anchored up to
the top we want to use position:absolute
to get it down and we'll say we want to
make it 50% from the top and since we
know that it's a height of 100 pixels
we'll say a margin top is negative 50
pixels and what this does is it just
pulls the logo back up straight to the
center so let's look at our parallaxing
effects
far we have a fixed background and we
have a an absolutely positioned element
in there a centered element so when we
scroll we can see that the logo is kind
of acting independently of its
background and up we already have a
parallaxing effect that's pretty cool
it's pretty cool let's do the next one
and let's talk about the four bird right
four bird I think it's bigger for you
guys there we go
so the four bird let's say background
color is pink I'm going to stop there
the pink and I'll show you what I want
to do in terms of the of the positioning
and size of the for bird
so the four bird I want to give it a
width of 960 pixels and I look at the
height of the four bird here
where are you forward and look at the
height of the four bird and I can see
that is 733 pixels tall even though it's
444 pixels wide 733 is the height so
let's give it that exact height 7 3 3
pixels now we'll say a background image
is going to be that URL for bird right
so slash images for / or - per dot ping
where's the for bird Oh images plural
let me take this pink and do something
in sass called trans parent eyes and
that will just give me a an RGB a value
of 4 pink and so you do comma and then
let's say I want it to be 0.3% opaque
and that will just make my pink a little
bit less pink so that I can see behind
it so now we have we know where the box
that contains our for bird is and it's
960 wide which is going to be the
general
sense of the width of my browsing
experience but I need to Center it
because it's off to the left and it's up
to the top so we'll say oh but before we
do that let's take the repeat off of
this background no repeat and we'll
position it to the background position
we'll be right and bottom it doesn't
matter because it's the full height of
its thing always want to push it over to
the edge there we go
cool now let's position the the whole
box and we'll do that by making it
absolute so position absolute and we'll
say left 50% okay it's way over there we
need to be centered though and now it's
starting in the middle if 80% left so
let's bring it back with margin left
negative for 80 because the 480 is half
of 960 so this will bring it right in
the in the center there now it's too
tall it's too too big so let's move it
down from the top so let's say top 200 a
little bit more a little bit more how
about 300 a little bit more how about
350
it could be more 380 that's good get rid
of this pink or is that pink okay and
then I'll go to the parent which is the
bird box and I'll say that it's overflow
should be hidden and that will get rid
of this little the wood that's sticking
out below the box and it'll give it that
feel of it being in the foreground good
good so the bird and the logo are
scrolling together and the background is
fixed and let's just quickly place that
- element there and this one is called
what is it called it's called back bird
not black bird so funny 3 maybe it's
just late at night so backward is very
similar to the for bird in the way that
we're going to be positioning it so
let's quickly hammer out our width and
height the width is going to be the same
960 pixels and the height doesn't need
to be that much bigger what's the height
of the back bird the dimensions a height
is 298 so let's do that
298 pixels and the background we know
this already is image URL images back
bird dot ping and the repeat no-repeat
no - repeat and the position top and
left this time because I want it on the
other side of the logo and let's see
what we get with that oh there it is
there's that bird I like it I like it
but we need to Center we need to Center
this box now as well because if we make
if we do the I'm going to show you how
pink it is boo boo boo
see now it's not centered it's just like
in the left-aligned box Oh it'll what
kind like move with the scroll instead
of saying staying centered against it
position tab so loot left again the same
recipe left 50% and the margin left is
going to be negative for 80 pixels which
is half of 960 so oops
oh it's flying over here
today I suppose something wrong aha
absolute okay now it's where it should
be let's get rid of this pink great
that's that's what we want okay so now
that we've done the the styling and
positioning of these elements we need to
animate them or rather control how they
move when they're scrolled so let's open
our functions and now how we tell that
they're moving is we listen to the
scroll of the window so let's create an
object window and then we'll put a
listener for scroll and this is using
jQuery by the way and then in that
scroll we'll have a function so what
we're saying is anytime the window
Scrolls whatever I put inside of these
braces is going to happen I'm kind of a
nervous Nellie when I develop JavaScript
so I always like I use these things too
much but they're helpful for you guys
too so con so log console.log is just
going to print a little bit of a message
inside of the console so I'm going to
open up the console here and let's make
it bigger and refresh and start
scrolling you see I've scrolled 40
pixels and 40 times the output of high
showed up so if I put a variable in here
and I call it just like like the window
scroll equals
this dot scroll top this is more jQuery
stuff okay so what I've done is I've
said hey this variable when this happens
which is the window when the window
Scrolls tell me where this is in
relation to the top tell me how far it
scrolled so I'll replace the high with a
variable called W scroll and now each
time it Scrolls it will tell me how far
positioned the scroll is from zero from
the top I see all these numbers that's
telling me how far I've scrolled so when
this top hits the top it should be say
around 600 yep so that is just keeping
track of my scroll no matter where I'm
at you're going to go up or down
it'll keep track of it so that's nice
that variables going to be really
helpful to us actually because we're
going to use that in calculating how and
where and whatever I want these logos
and these birds and everything to move
when I scroll so the first thing I want
to do is let's take a look at the logo
and I'll select it by saying class of
logo and then what I want to do with
that logo is just like it's just mess
with the CSS right so let's go in here
to the CSS and create a little little
magic once I transform and I'll just and
what I'm going to be in what I'll be
manipulating is the translate property
the translate value of the transform
property so I'll say trans late and I'll
say 0 for the horizontal and for the for
the vertical let's say just like you
know 200 I always want to show you that
when I want to show you that when I
scroll the logo is going to be bumped up
200 pixels here we go you ready a boo
happened
oh I forgot the comma that's what
happened okay when I scroll the logo
should be bumped up 200 pixels or down
huh down not up so that's what happened
so let's take that 200 in our translate
and we'll go and we'll we'll create a
new number based on how far we've
scrolled so let's end the quotations and
we'll put plus plus in here to add
whatever we're writing in here to the
string so we want to we want to start
with W scroll with a capital S and do
and let's say slow it down to two so
divide W scroll by two and we need a
like this has pixels on here we need a
unit type so I'll just say percent and
see how that works out for us okay let's
scroll and see what's up oh my goodness
look at that and I like this a lot
because by dividing the pace of the
scroll in two and moving it down but
only at half speed you're keeping it in
the center as the box is closing the
logo is still in the center the whole
time which is really really cool and
that's what we want from a mid-ground
right we want the background to move
slowly the foreground to move quickly in
the mid-ground to be like that that kind
of fulcrum between the two this is
exactly what we want it looks good
already
even without even without animating
these two birds this this logo just
changes kind of the whole look of the
thing but let's not stop there let's
continue on with these with these birds
so let's do the back bird and we'll do
the same thing with the back bird but
we'll do it a little bit differently
when when it comes to its scroll pace so
instead of saying - let's do four
because we want it to be slower so we're
going to divide it by four so it's going
to move but a half the speed as the logo
you know the funnest thing about making
parallax designs is that you just get a
scroll it for a while to test it and
like yeah you scroll you scroll good I
love you scroll
so hard scroll scroll yeah okay the next
thing we're going to basically repeat
this whole process for the the next guy
which is the for bird but this time
instead of making it scroll down we want
it to scroll up so instead of making
that number positive for the translate
let me show you let me show you what I
mean
inspect element see this guy translate
if I scroll it if I scroll it down see
how this eighty-eight percent that is a
positive integer and we want to make
that a negative integer if we want it to
move up and we want that bird to move up
so we're going to put a negative sign
right in front of the scroll for the
bird and press save and see where that
lands us okay the birds going up this
time but it's coming up really fast but
it's doing exactly what we want let's go
back to the console okay
so all we have to really do is now
control the speed of the bird let's
speed that down it's divided by four
let's try divided by ten that looks good
that looks good I mean that we're not
seeing the bottom of the wood block
let's like that like technically passes
but I think it's still too fast because
look how fast it's covering the logo and
I think I'm okay with the logo being
covered like this that's kind of cool
like this is kind of a little bit too
much especially when it gets behind that
block of wood so let's slow it down a
little bit more let's break it down a
half speed of that money is still a
little aggressive goodness now we're
happy we're having each half so it's not
like it's not a linear divide here it's
an it it's a it's an exponential divide
so we're not getting as much of effect
only half at each time so let's go to 40
and see if that's what we wanted that's
that's a bit more what I wanted
slow down bird slowed down bird all
right so this is an example of the
parallax technique of fixed background
moving elements and I'm really excited
the way it turned out I like it a lot I
think
gives our store that look really modern
and dynamic look it does a lot to make
the Blackbird clothing I love it so this
is a clothing store as well
and there's more parallaxing we can do
on this design and we've run out of time
for this video we've gone a little bit
long but next week we can add more
parallaxing events or effects to this
design and make it like really really
pleasurable to use thank you for
watching if you haven't already
subscribe to the channel and you can be
notified when the next paralax video is
going to be released it's Monday it's
