I call design and code my personal
website in 12 hours my name is Travis
Nielsen but of course you knew that
already because why would you start
watching a video series at our 11 you
anarchist ah this week we're gonna build
the notes section this section includes
a form provided by MailChimp that will
enable us to gather new subscriptions to
my newsletter
I call them notes but what they are are
emails that I send out every Thursday
topics that include creativity work
ethic productivity tips creative health
personal insights if you have not signed
up you really should head over to Travis
Nelson comm slash notes to get some in
the meantime let's pass the mic to
little trash small trav let's scroll
down to the place where we're gonna
start working and here's our next
section here now I've already done a
little bit of prep work for this video
nothing that you haven't seen already
here is a list of what I've done so far
I've created a section notes Jade in
Jade files that's actually the document
that I'm writing in right here and I've
included that section notes Jade into
index out HTML on line 17 right here
simple so create the file include the
file next I've created the home notes
dot sass in assets CSS 3 dash sections
and I've imported it into Maine and you
can see that right there and that
concludes the work that I've done so far
now let's take a look at what we're
going to be doing this our jump over to
photoshop and last week we did the
dribble and behance and this week we're
doing email notes this is a really
exciting thing for me I really enjoy
writing email notes to everyone and this
is going to enable me to reach more
people and hopefully help them to get a
better understanding of what the tone
and cadence and purpose of my email
notes are so just structurally we have
Emma
selection we have a two-column thing it
spreads across both columns and then
right under that we have a column one
and another column one so it's kind of a
hybrid of two kind of ideas let me see
if we have this replicated anywhere else
not really in the columns we have
already set up a column two and then we
also have you know two column one set up
that we have done before so let's jump
into our section notes Jade this is
where we're going to start coding and
we're gonna say a section dot what is
this dot notes and let's open our
columns Jade and find the column two
that's we're gonna start oh yeah that's
where we're gonna start and we have
we're gonna start you know including you
know the home lead and then the let's
look at our design actually all right we
don't have a button this time we don't
have a home - CTA this time but instead
our CTA is actually this form and we'll
get to that in a second but first let's
sit up let's set up our lead paragraph
and these columns down here so the the
lead paragraph is the P home lead like
we've done every time and the statement
there is just sending notes sending
email notes
okay and and then right into that we're
gonna have the form so I'll put it like
a div here and I'll call it nodes sign
up and box and then inside that'll just
make a note to myself that this is where
I'm gonna putting the form in the future
and that's all in column two then I'm
gonna go down and make another column
and we're gonna end the Flex box right
there and just create an entirely
different flex right underneath it so go
back to my columns and the one that we
want is Flex center column one column
two like that so let's just put that
right there
and we don't want to nest it under Flex
it's gonna be right there
a sibling of the other Flex select
Center let's take a look at what we got
so far
cool so sending email notes and then the
form and then below that the two
paragraphs looking at our design that's
pretty darn close here's the two
paragraphs let me get our text selection
and copy that one so here's the text for
the first paragraph and here's the text
for the second one
cool let me fix that para you should
sign up okay and then we have after this
paragraph here we have a list so I was
put this in a ul now in atom text editor
if I hit if I hold command and click
then I get multiple cursors and this is
really interesting I can do it Li and
then I want these all to be in an anchor
tag and by this by doing this I can just
quickly make the same edits to every
line so these are all an anchor tag and
they're all lis I'm going to indent them
all once and then I'm good
I hit escape then I get out of the
multi-line cursor then I can just indent
this a whole ul to be where it should be
in the column one and I think that's
good we have that first paragraph in the
second column second paragraph and then
a ul under it with a bunch of links I
didn't put the inning quote on these
links and so they were wrapping all
strange this should work now all right
pardon the mistake cool so they have the
headline the form and then thin notes
let's start let's start styling right
now actually jump in to enclose columns
jump into home notes and hmm start with
a section news and the first thing we're
gonna do is like we usually do just set
the background so background and I've
already exported this from the PSD image
is URL images notes - BG dot jpg
and that background room size is going
to be stretched to fit the screen
wherever it needs to be so it's going to
be background cover and position the
center cool
that's that typewriter that we saw in
the PSD very good now let's make all the
text white and that's good now in this
section we have those two column ones
then bring up our Photoshop document and
show you the next thing so in this in
this section we have two column ones
this is a column one and this is a
column one but we don't have any other
column ones so we need we can target
those column ones as paragraph content
and I need to shift this left paragraph
to be aligned to the right okay
so let's say in section one indent it a
little bit and put column - one and
let's start off by doing some padding
for these guys padding padding left 30
pixels let me just put this down so we
can see
okay padding-left 30 pixels now that I
have padding left on 30 pixels I want to
go to and first child and start
repositioning all those other things
that I need to do so for example on this
one padding left needs to be 0 but
padding right
it needs to be 30 and we need to
text-align:right and we need to put that
border between them so border right is
gonna be solid 2 pixels not 22 pixels
white okay let's make the font size here
18 and the font style is gonna be italic
oh nice now there needs to be a few
other typographical changes so for
example these anchor tags they're all
there colored the original color so they
need to have a color of white and this
ul needs to be list-style:none and
padding:0 and now I'm looking at those
anchor tags again and I see that the
they have a text decoration because I
wanted to make sure that they look like
links of underline that looks pretty
good but I've got this big old area here
that's sticking down this bar this this
rule goes down so far and I'm thinking
that's because the paragraph has margin
blow it so I'll put margin zero
what is that
is it the UL okay the UL has some
margin:0 good good let's compare that to
our PSD looks pretty good they line up
pretty well lists let's change this to
be column one line height and you could
be a little bit bigger line high it
could be to start there that's gonna be
too big I'm about 1.6 1.8 yep that's
nice now let's focus on the form I use
MailChimp as a service that I that I
send out my email newsletters and and
they also milchem has a form builder
that gives me the code for a form that
will let me collect new email
subscribers and put them in the list so
I can send them emails later on so let's
go over to MailChimp and I'll just log
in here so fast-forward okay here we are
in my MailChimp
admin back back-end and how we're gonna
do this I'm gonna go to lists and I'm
gonna find the list that I send to which
is the Travis Nelson comma newsletter
these are the notes and I'm gonna click
on that now in the notes I'm gonna say
signup forms and I'm going to I think
embed ya generate HTML code to embed on
your blog so it I'm gonna click on embed
forms now I want to go to there's a few
different kinds and you can see previews
here on the on the right they're super
slim and then naked make it is no CSS or
no styling at all and then in the
options down below I can like even
narrow down even further what I want
let's go back to our PSD and look do I
want a title I don't do I want labels
yes what are the fields first name email
address and subscribe so right here I
have you know the titles let's get rid
of that
idle and then show only required fields
no I want email address and first name
so that's good show interest group
fields no show required field indicators
nope because I want them all to be
required really and then show HTML
format options nope
so I really strip this down to be super
super naked and then I'm just gonna copy
this a code block right here command C
and then come over to my Jade code right
here now normally in Jade you'd nest
things right and if I've pasted right
here we're gonna have this Holy Terror
of a mess right inside of my Jade and
until recently I was like oh that'll
never work off like put it all on one
line but I learned something recently
and it was actually from from a comment
on the YouTube channel which I learned
from just as much as you guys do if
you're not reading those you should be
reading those the way to do this is to
hit period if you hit it put a dot after
the container and then you indent
everything that's in that indention can
have whatever formatting you like in
this case it can be HTML formatting and
it will get output from Jade just as is
in this case readable HTML from for the
for the Jekyll installation okay so
that's what MailChimp is given me I'll
get rid of these two comments here
because I know where their form begins
and ends okay we have a label an input
field a label and input field and a
subscribe button now we want in our
design our label and input field to be
on top of each other
now you doing that you may remember a
while ago I did a video for PHP academy'
where I taught everyone how to make the
label kind of animate up when you click
in the field and it animated up similar
to what material design from Google does
we're not going to do that today I'm
just gonna have the label up in the top
corner all the time
but that's a good resource if you want
to add a little bit of funk to what
we're doing here but right now here is
how we're going to be doing this the
first thing I want to do personally to
help me is I want to re reformat this
these divs because it's kind of a little
bit of a mess so let's do that
okay I've briefly formatted it to make
this easier let's look at the structure
of it we have a div that comes from
MailChimp called MC embeds signup so
this is going to be the wrapper around
the whole form then we have the form
itself and then div ID scroll which
these should be inside of okay
these are inside of scroll and then they
have these these elements here people
should not fill this in expect good
thing so MailChimp is telling me but I
shouldn't mess with this kind of stuff
but I do notice that there is an input
here at the bottom and that will come
into play in a little bit but the things
that I'm interested in here are these
two things these are two groups and
inside are a label and an input so it's
a div wrapper label input that is
interesting because if I look at my
design here I nee have a wrapper for
each of these groups and then a label
and then an input kind of behind it and
then over here is the subscribe button
so let's move this subscribe button out
the classic clear get it out of this
clear and I'll take that and I'll move
it up to be in with like in line with
these other two groups and now I need a
way to address just these 33 elements
being these two MC field groups and the
submit button so let's go over here to
line 10 and and put these guys in a div
I'll call it div class equals this is
the actual form that displays we'll say
for display
and it out a little bit okay now we have
a form display and there's those two
groups that are inside and the input the
submit input I think that's good for our
markup right now let's go into our
styles and see what we can make of this
what do I call it class a form display
good old background pink to see what
we're working with
and there we are now the first thing I
notice is that this form is shrunk down
to the size of the headline why is the
headline shrinking
column two is small okay so we've we've
got this problem where column two does
not have a defined width it's max width
is 640 pixels but it's actual width is
not defined in its the width is being
determined by its content since its
flexed it's going to shrink to its
content let me try something go to
column two here and say width 100
percent okay so I do need to go back to
column one and this is going to be in a
different file this will be in our home
dot sass or we defined our grid and go
to column two here we go
and say with it's gonna be 100% alright
that's better now with the email notes
the email notes the email notes so this
title now because of its parent is 100%
this title is not a center-aligned like
we wanted it to be
so we'll say home lead and this is just
in our we're back to our section sorry
we're back to our home notes ass and
we'll say text-align:center that's
better okay now let's focus back on this
form we have the background pink it's
kind of what we want not really actually
let's look at what we want we want the
background to be this transparent white
okay background let's make you
transparent like this this method of
making the white is a little bit sassy
we say rgba and then you write white and
then 0.5 right maybe a little less 0.3
so that's a fun way of doing that
instead of doing you know 255 comma 255
comic activity 5 comma 0.3 you just
write the word
white apparently I didn't know that and
then we want to put a border on this
border 2 pixels
white maybe it's four pixels all right
three pixels it is and hit drop shadow
eight pixels and then the rgba again
black and thus 8.3 okay so we've got the
boarder drop shadow and the background
fantastic all right now see how all the
elements are vertical I want to get them
in a row so the easy way to do that is
to say display flex you know that'll
line them all up let them all up good
and then I want to add some space
between what's below it and what's above
it so I'll say margin like 50 pixels
above and below and then on the right in
the left and that's looking good too and
I think that's it for the form display
next let's jump into those inputs so as
I say input and with the position of the
inputs to be relative because I'm going
to set the labels to absolute position
to get them up nice in that corner there
and border 0 background I need that to
be transparent so that the white can
come through yeah background:none and
padding:0 blot display
form elements are usually in line
elements so let's make them display
blocks let's actually make the
background pink for a little bit I can
see what I'm doing here okay we've got
the forms below because their display
block in there inside of the MC field
alright let's stop there and we'll come
back to the inputs let's to look at the
labels because now that I have the now
that I have the input set as
position:relative I can set the label as
position:absolute and let's bring those
up a little bit okay they need to be
really small so say font size 12 pixels
let's bring them away from the edge
there so we'll say left maybe like 5
pixels why did you disappear
Oh input position:relative they're not
children of the input they're their
children of MC field group let's get
that right right now
MC field group you need to be
position:relative okay that's what we
wanted and the the overall height let's
see how I was the height of its
Photoshop document here or this was the
height of this form here about sixty
pixels tall so let's make the inputs I
ain't gonna be sixty pixels that's gonna
be both the subscribe button and the
input the input field right and now that
we have the MC fueled group the MC field
group is a direct child of form dash
display and so is the input in the input
type of submit and I want to stretch
these things out to where they fill the
space needed inside of the form look at
how big our form display is but at the
same time are our inputs are all crammed
over to the left so I'm going to use
flex and spread these out here and the
reason why I said flex to right here on
MC field group is that another sibling
of the you know of these flexed items
the MC field group is an input element
called type equals submit and I can say
flex one
now flex is proportional so you see how
it grew just a little bit and the other
two are bigger let me show you this
actually you probably don't see them the
background of these MC field groups is
gonna be a light blue you see how the
the MC field group is this whole thing
right there it's not just that pink that
we were looking at the pink is the input
field the input field needs to be with
like 100 percent or something there we
go now the pink is going all the way to
the right now we need to get that that
line right between them in our design we
have a line separating these fields so
let's go to MC field group 2 and say and
first child let's gonna have a border
border right of 4 pixels white and solid
ding gosh that is beautiful
looks great and then let's go to input
type submit and say background white
color let's get the color from our
photoshop document that's right there
and also font size I think is like 24
pixels right that's what we use before
mmm subscribe and padding on the right
in the left
so top and bottom would be zero right
left will be like you know 15 pixels
there we go it's a little bit more
padding that looks great me I was really
excited about that lets get rid of this
light blue for the background of the
boxes and get rid of the pink for the
background of the inputs and it's just
white why would it be completely white
oh it was instead of background pink is
shoot background none there we go
cool doctor did that done - Dan Dennett
intent okay now for the input I want a
state of an focus and make that outline
the outline is this blue thing you see
that blue fuzziness I don't like it
outline:none instead of saying padding
only on this one let's put padding on
all of them that way this text gets
padding but 15 is a little little
aggressive how about 10
I wanted label to line up so let's learn
it that labels that have sayings left 5
let's say left hand ok that's better
so I do want petting to be 15 on the
submit button let's do that here and
then I want font size on these inputs so
font size on the on the submit button
still 24 font to size on your text that
you're inputting should be about 18
there we go
set itself apart from be so good so good
alright that looks fantastic the last
thing we have to do is just make sure
that it works on mobile so let's go to
our emulator here and refresh see what
we got going on actually the start here
okay so so let's look at our emulator
here gonna shrink it by like a bow and
get rid of our sidebar right there it
still looks good I do imagine we'll have
some problems with the size of this form
okay the first thing I noticed is that
when the text boxes collapsed we have
the border right here and then the
padding is all funky so let's go back up
to where we did all that weird stuff
with our columns and we'll do this at
media max with 640
padding:0 looks good and first child
padding:0 text-align:left and
border:none very nice very nice thing
about this I should have some padding
right
these notes have absolutely no this this
has absolutely no padding which is not
Beunos I want playboy no not no point
you know the padding should be zero ten
not zero
it's like reset not eliminate good it
could be good good good good so as that
shrinks up it still looks good I got the
links below here looking Fantasmic
shrinking up this form though it's
getting kind of small to have three
columns it's still alright it's alright
now we have a problem I would if at 640
right there we break this form say yeah
I don't know should do it later when
does it really start looking bad around
five eighty five ninety I think five
ninety is still doable okay so here's
what we're gonna do you can go to form
display and say at media max width five
90 pixels random five ninety pixels
stop being flex flex no it's called not
display:block
looks good except for the MC field group
what you got to be doing is that first
child there let's put another one at
media max width 640 no 590 your border
right it's got to go mm-hmm put a border
bottom mm-hmm the same one four pixels
solid white BAM oh yeah shrink it down
looking good and see this this how this
ellipse is um wrapped right there we can
stop that from happening by saying and
non-breaking space like that
that's a non-breaking space there you go
so now this space between notes and the
and the ellipses will not break I like
it I think we're done let's sign up
errors too many subscribe attempts oh
I'm already subscribed but it still
works that's good this is work this is
work this is good this is what we want
so happy about this this is gonna enable
everyone to subscribe to the newsletter
and get fantastic email notes every
Thursday right in this face right or in
the inbox anyway alright big trav back
