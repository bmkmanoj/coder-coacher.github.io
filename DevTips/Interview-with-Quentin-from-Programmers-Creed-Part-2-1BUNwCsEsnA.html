place where we do website design and
development we talk about the creative
lifestyle and just try to be as awesome
as we can if you're just joining this
video now you will see that this is
video too and the first part of this
video is actually not on this channel
it's over on another channel called
programmers Creed and this channel is
hosted by my friend Quentin whom I've
just met he is really cool and we're
gonna actually be talking to Quintin
today about his channel about the work
that he's doing over there and about his
about him so uh let's say hello to
Quinton okay Quinton so welcome to dev
tips thank you so much for joining us
tell us about you who are you and what
do you do okay well as you say um I'm
from South Africa so I'm actually 21
years old i'ma students and right now
i'm studying programming and I tissot
web design development PHP mostly and so
I'm trying to get through all of that
but I also have a youtube channel called
the program is free which is where i
teach other people how to learn learn
what I've learned awesome yeah that's
how I found you because in my sidebar on
YouTube had recommended your channel to
me and yeah yeah so I was really pumped
when I saw your content it's really good
stuff how did you get into web
programming well kind of a long story
but that's okay it's YouTube yeah let's
do this so basically in school I like I
never had this approach to to learning
and new things that I do now and I used
to go to class and be like oh well if I
passed its ok you know I'm gonna worry
about doing well so I getting through
school but my marks weren't that great
so I couldn't get like any verse or
reuse or anything to to university and
my mom was kind of just like well you
never did great at school you never even
tried so
you know you don't need to go to
university what you want to go to
university ball so I had to get a job
and my first job was actually in
irrigation so like completely the
opposite end of the scale to to what
we're doing now yeah so I was I used to
got out in the fields and we had these
machines then we'd like dig trenches and
I put the pipes together and dig holes
of the speed and that kind of thing and
but like they made it sound really
awesome like they made it sound like I
was going to go on to be like a civil
engineer or something but I was just in
the farm lands digging with a spade I
kind of thought to myself well you know
this is what 12 years of high school got
me I'm in a hole with this babe is it
like I'm going to do something better
with my life and at that point I was
like well now I really need to actually
learn because you know I was an idiot in
school and I never learn now is the time
to learn like it's not too late so what
I did was I had up going out to one of
the local computer stores here and I
bought a new computer so it was a laptop
actually my first computer i have a
boards and I didn't have one at home
previously really so you never never
owned a computer before three years ago
well I did when I was really young but
um I landed like land up getting old and
broken and roads never had a computer
again this was about twelve to eighteen
never really had a computer wow that's
interesting so then what happened was I
I look back to like what what what I
enjoy most in school and I remember that
was doing writing programs because I did
IT and we did a language called Delphie
so remember that was actually the most
fun part of school that I could remember
was actually just coding in Delphie
really so you had a programming course
in in high school in high school yeah
well that's cool yeah
yeah I would be what I hear about people
who had that I'm like dang it because I
we didn't have that in my school I
really not great school right yeah my
school sucked ya know we've got quite a
few schools yeah but and there are only
like three they offer the programming or
four actually and it's only about like
15 people in the whole school will do it
okay cool so it's like good like a focus
yeah yeah but anyway sir so I was like
yeah there was the most fun part of high
school for me so I went up knows not
just got a laptop but I got an internet
connection and I was like yes that I was
my first internet connection here hey
ray yeah so um I was like okay I'm going
to learn and I started looking at some
websites trying to learn Python and
things like that and like just out of
coincidence like I was I was one day
like kind of lazy and I didn't really
know much about YouTube but I thought to
myself well what happens if I actually I
type in Python video or how to program
Python in YouTube and I that's how I
discovered that people do tutorials on
youtube so yeah actually blew my mind
because I never I never knew about that
kind of stuff on YouTube before yeah and
so so I actually landed up watching a
lot of Python tutorials I learned quite
a bit of Python and my next thing was
like okay well what do I go from here
and I realized that web design actually
or web development you've got so much
freedom because I can sit and I can
create something here I'm a computer but
I don't actually need to sell it to
anyone or I don't need to do anything I
can just upload it to a server and bam
like people can use it kind of thing
yeah so so that's where I was like yes
okay well I'll do web design or web
development and that's when I learned
HTML CSS PHP that can think i spent
about two years learning that
and then I started putting up YouTube
tutorials and how i'm going to start
your channel well i only started
uploading videos in 2012 so really at
the same the same about 2012 yeah
alright you if you if you check my
channel it will say that i joined on
like july yeah 2011 or something yeah
there's a big gap from when i signed up
and when i started uploading to for sure
yeah there's a whole lot of like stress
involved in like this is this good
enough yeah so but i wanted to talk to
you a little bit before we get into your
channel and talk to you about what is
like the program in culture in south
africa white there's a programming gold
yeah so like that that's what interests
me so much about when cuz i heard like
um I knew I knew a few people when I
used to live in England that were from
South Africa and very really cool
distinctive accent when I saw your video
right away I just like that guy's from
South Africa and I was like so like
amazed by it I've never met another
South African I've never met us how that
I can programmer so that's why I contact
you is one of the like learn your sword
so it there's not much for programming
culture there or what city are you win
by the way ok I'm in East London which
is quite a small city a lot of the
people from the bigger places are like
these lemons not a city where you don't
it is actually glass far as the city but
it'sit's race.more right we don't have
anything interesting here it's a boring
place but I like when there's there's
not too many programmers here and a lot
of the guys that that I do know that I
went to school with that their
programming in high school and that kind
of thing all left and went over to
Joburg or Cape Town which are like the
two main cities here in India Africa her
biggest ones and I mean for the most
part a lot of those guys prefer to work
alone or like if they're working as a
team like they'll get together have a
meeting for
from what I've heard and like they're
just how would meeting talk about what
they want to do go back to desk and work
and learn like they don't actually work
as groups or anything like that so
there's not much room for like a bit of
collaboration or anything with anyone
interesting interesting so you've not
worked with anybody else in the area
locally know that there is something to
be said about that like I totally get
that even though like I'm in Silicon
Valley which you know in a lot of ways
is is like the mecca right of this type
of technology we all sit in our bedrooms
in the dark and just kind of like a
program and then like in the morning we
rub our eyes we talk to each other a
little bit and then we and then we go
back to our desks and be quiet so what
kind of work do you like best you
mentioned that you did some web design
web programming and also some server
side stuff with with a Python and such
what is your what's your favorite well
PHP is definitely my best at the moment
so that's kind of my favorite but um
you'll see a lot of people actually
argue that pythons better and having
done Python I know that it's a little
bit easier but I haven't actually worked
with it as much as I have with PHP so
yeah just I'm limited to what i can do
with michael answer yeah I only know PHP
as far as I can walk around like a
wordpress installation now this is far
that's and Python nothing nothing at all
but I work in a room full of engineers
and I know that they prefer Python so
let's let's jump to your YouTube channel
know you saw these other people posting
tutorials on YouTube what would make you
think yeah I want to do that well i was
i was thinking like I want how hard
could it be you know and the answer is
is kind of hard Oh quite hard but
difficult yeah yeah so um vs ha aren't
gonna be and I tried I tried uploading a
few tutorials like I really I really
tried at the beginning but I failed
epically like I used to start a lot and
say um
yeah to leads it most of those videos
yes how many sorry how many videos do
you have now what's your upload count
111 okay so you've been practicing quite
a bit 111 is a lot so yeah that was one
of the things that I noticed also when
it the first video I saw your like
you're really smooth it seemed it seemed
like you were reading a book and we
could seem like you were reading a
script right but yeah so um so you you
got over the the jitters hmm yeah it did
took some work but eventually I started
thinking well I wonder if I can get good
at this and like that's what I'm trying
to do now I'm just trying to be better
than then I used to be before and be
better than some of the other guys like
I try yeah Pete with them a little bit
like I want to come better than the
style knots we'll see haha has your work
on YouTube impact did your work off of
youtube like have you gotten referrals
or work because somebody hurt me or
something well at first like the company
that I was working for like last year
they like they were kind of interested
but I could see that it wasn't going to
go anywhere because it was going to be
one of those things where they look at
me and go well he's young we're just
going to exploit him so I was like ah no
right yeah so what I decided to do
rather was just keep going at YouTube
myself and now I don't work I just
YouTube and I study full-time which I
never I never had the chance to do and
that's actually if you think about it
the whole reason why I started you
started learning how to program was to
do something with my life and actually
you know get out there and do something
meaningful Bronson in a hole and like
dig with a spade kind of thing yeah so I
do think that I'm starting like I'm not
there yet but I'm working towards
actually doing something more with my
life then
you know just working for someone like I
don't know um you know I don't want to
just duct work for someone like you I
wanna one day have done something that
was meaningful to some someone and and
YouTube in a sense is helpful to a lot
of people with my tutorials so there are
people that might never have known HTML
or css before yeah totally on my channel
yeah totally so you mentioned earlier
that you you didn't go to college but
night but you're saying you're doing
studying did you eventually go back to
university I'm studying through
correspondence so basically I land up
sitting bahama computer every day when I
wake up in the morning come on my
computer read some notes that the
lecturers have left and other students
kind of whatever like in a forum uh-huh
and they give us projects to do and they
give us reading that we have to do so
I've got books that are port and then
I'm obviously read from that some of
those books actually I make tutorials on
or use to make tutorials with right yeah
and then from from there like so I'm
making tutorials on the stuff that I'm
learning about and then I'm also
learning as I'm going in you three
University like just tryna get my
diploma um so what has been one of your
most popular videos so far and and what
made it so special I don't know I see
with the tutorials thing like I you
don't really get viral videos per se so
it's not like you've got this one video
you put up and like billions of people
watch it yeah it went viral but i
noticed that like the with the few
patterns and the subscriber when people
subscribe to me and are always on the
introductions of my videos so with my
series i've got tutorial 1 the
introduction and those videos will you
know gave use by thousands like I put a
video up on my new HTML
5-series about two weeks ago uh-huh and
that climbed up to about 2,000 views
almost 2,000 views in two weeks kind of
quickly right compared to you know like
I'm a small channel so you can't snot
again no viral videos it's just the
introduction videos mostly like people I
guess come and watch the introduction
they're like and they subscribe and then
I guess when I go through this but I
think some people obviously like leave
the series later on so they watch like
the first few videos as the videos go on
there's less and less you use yeah that
actually makes a lot of sense like
knowing human nature right yeah yeah um
okay so what plans do you have for the
near future for your channel okay well
right now I'm just trying to get my
month PHP series up and I'm focusing on
quality right now so my previous HTML
series bad quality like I started
shouting in the mic and fascia shouting
just could be confident good confident
and I started shouting into the mic and
like it landed up the sound was just
very bad and I think my mic might have
broken as well like it worked but it
just there was like static and start
yeah that's really funny I know I
noticed that you did redo it the series
yeah so that's why I started redoing the
series because I want to improve on
quality so there's that and then I want
to obviously just get enough videos up
so that some people can well I go
through go to my channel and watch
through all the videos and eventually
have a website of their own but not just
like some static HTML website but rather
something with a little bit of
server-side script that's kind of clever
mmhmm yeah so that's awesome that's
that's the best one I like my goal for
the short term future and after that I
haven't really thought that far so cool
so how do you sorry how do you as you
know as a
person want to be known after all this
is said and done that's a tough question
it's a bit it's a big one yeah I mean
you never figured out totally but yeah
well I'm not two-faced about like being
remembered or like being known as such
but if if people go like okay program is
creed really helped me out I mean even
if this is one guy that's like okay I
got a job because the program is cream
like that for me would actually be like
awesome it's just this guy was helpful
yeah yeah that's that's what really
that's a really good perspective I think
really cool cool is there anything else
you want to plug or talk about not
really okay great so that's good yeah
thank you so much for coming on my
channel and talking about the the work
that you do and thank you for making the
videos that you do for everybody who has
seen those again guys that watch dev
tips if you have not yet go check out
Clinton's channel it's called
programmers Creed here's a link to it
