looking at the wonderful world of
parallax on the web
parallax on the web first we defined
what parallax is then we looked at a
whole slew of examples online we then
started to get our hands on and build
out our own samples here's where we are
at the moment we created this awesome
mock-up of a clothing store called
Blackbird we created a header using a
technique that I call fixed background
moving elements in the next video we
created an effect that I called landing
elements we listen for a certain point
in the scrolling page and we would fire
off all these thumbnails which float in
and land in our layout let's continue
with this mock-up project today I want
to show you a simple yet powerful way to
display large images in a scrolling web
page in the video you're about to watch
I ended up naming the style periscope
it's pretty fun huh
well code for this project is on github
links are in the description let's get
started okay so have another like
paragraph and a headline here at the
bottom of this I'll do another special
day of here and I'll call it large
window and in that large window go to
the bottom of my sass and I'll say urge
window I'll say large window show me
what you got
how about height it's like 400 pixels
and background is going to be the image
URL images slash what's-his-face its
images slash model 1 dot jpg yep
position top center to repeat no-repeat
and then and then for the secret sauce
we'll do use this this attachment
property again a - Daz mint
um fixed now let me show you what we got
what we got what we got
oh hello okay so now our box is is looks
it looks kind of like a like a like a
what's a called like an opening a window
in the web page and we're seeing a
background and the students just
modeling off it's like really fly
sweater here I want number what was the
guy who looks like he zoomed out a lot
number two this guy is less zoomed in so
you could see his feet at the bottom you
could see his whole torso and his face
so this is cool right it's like this
little scrolling window the truth is and
just like a little 400 pixel tall div
but the background is fixed so it makes
it look like oh what is actually
happening here it looks like there's the
image is moving behind looks like
there's like a you're peeking through a
hole in you're like peeking through a
hole in in the in the in the web page I
just had an idea that's why it's like
stop times like a what if I did this
actually let's move this down move this
down from that thing above it okay um
what if I did I just this really weird
border radius is 50% porter - radius
what is the height of what's the width
of this thing the width is good 640 okay
so let's make the height 640 not 400 so
we can get a square or a circle is this
cool this is a cool idea oh look at that
it is a cool idea I love it so like the
tick is out you're like hovering over
this grid on a click on
these by some things scroll down more in
this circle of like looks like a
periscope oh it's so cool I love it
alright that is just a really quick
tutorial I just like a really quick
effect I thought of when I was making
these other things I think there's some
more we can do with this you want to do
you want to see somewhere next week you
wanna you wanna wanna all right I love
this periscope oh nice nice good work
Thanks what it fun and easy thing to do
I love that it's so impactful yet simple
to execute I have a few ideas that we
can use to enhance this little feature
but that's it for tonight this video was
made possible by these lovely patients
you've heard me talk about what's going
on in the patreon community before it's
really awesome and I want you to join us
so the link for that is in the
description below well that's it for
tonight
keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
