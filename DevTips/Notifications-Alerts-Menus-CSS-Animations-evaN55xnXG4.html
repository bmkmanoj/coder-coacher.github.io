hope you brought a clean change of pants
because today we're about to get messy
ah today we're going to be talking here
that's right we're going to be looking
at calm what you want alerts
notifications pop-ups we're going to be
looking at all of these things that's
right today we're going to be looking at
introducing new items to the page using
some pretty nice animations it should be
really fun but if it's not that's okay I
heard the treehouse has some great deals
on tech degrees the code for today's
video again is going to take place in
code pin so you guys can go check out
all of this code right now live on code
pin and similar to like the other videos
how you've been doing I've set up the
code pinned to work with Jade here if
you're not comfortable with J you can
click this little drop down and you
compiled and see some old-school HTML
and that's just fine also I'm working
with sass for the CSS and you can again
view compiled CSS and then I have some
just some JavaScript triggering
mechanisms going on not a big deal so
where should we start
okay how about this if you haven't seen
the first three videos of this series
these ones here then you should probably
go check them out they talked about what
we're doing syntactically how do you
accomplish an animation with HTML and
CSS and then the third one talks about
from the point of view of the user when
should we be using animations in terms
of usability and helping the user to
understand what's going on on the page
now I'm going to give you some examples
of that today and we're going to be
building some things out but that's a
great overview of really what you should
know coming into this video here so
having said all that let's get started
let me show you the three things that
we're going to be doing today we're
going to be talking about notifications
alerts and modal's so this first one
here these all work by the way with with
currently with CSS this first one here
is kind of like a like an Instagram kind
of a bottom bar there and if you click
on the like the note
patience button you get a summary of
what type of notifications are waiting
for you so in this case you have nine
views for comments and six new followers
and what we want to do in a few short
minutes we're going to look at this and
say okay how can we bring delight and
interest of the user into this action by
using animation let's go a little bit
down there to get a preview of what else
we got in store we have this mock mock
website called the many faces of Murray
if you click a Bill Murray face you get
notified that you click to Bill Murray
face so this is going to be talking
about alerts like something happened on
the page or like you know there's an
error maybe or you can go and do
something this would be a great kind of
alert for that and then finally this is
going to be more of like how do you
introduce a modal to the screen I
basically have a Bill Murray button and
if you click it there's a modal that
pops up over the content and it will
dismiss itself you can dismiss however
you like that's not really the point
what we're going to be doing is looking
at how do you kind of animate this modal
to help the user understand like where
it came from why it's there how do they
get rid of it once they're done using it
and so forth
all right so let's go back up scroll up
to the top of these three examples and
we'll get started with this
notifications bar here so I'm not going
to get too deep into the HTML and CSS of
it but suffice it to say that there's
when you click on each of these they
have a class added to the list element
called is active and is active will add
this little this bar here is done with a
box shadow inset with this color and
it'll make the color white pure white
instead of like see-through transparent
white and it'll also turn the background
a shade darker and and that's kind of it
now what we want to do is do two things
number one when we're changing the the
kind of active state right here this act
of these three things we want to animate
right we want to make them a little bit
more smooth so let's first jump into
that I'm going to find what is turning
is active actually I'm a scroll up here
and it's the nav Li then the the list
item that's directly in the nav and it's
getting this box shadow and the
different colors here so if we put a
simple transition on it we should be
able to take care of most of all of that
here if we use the key word all and then
just use like a 200 milliseconds good
old-fashioned ease in out and after that
refreshes let's check it out click on
this one and we can see that we're
getting just a quick fade into these
properties as opposed to an abrupt
change which is nice but what we really
want to focus on is this third button
here which gives us that notification
currently it's just on or off and how
we're doing that is by using this
notifications element we're just
changing the display to flex we're up
here let's see notification right here
is display:none by default so we're
hiding and showing based on if the
parent has a is active class on it okay
so what do we want this thing to do well
before we get into answering that
question let's just set it up right now
with an animation and property in the
CSS so animation and then we'll just
call it a note because it's a
notification that's the keyword and
we'll just say will happen over 500
milliseconds to have this thing anime up
I'm just imagining it like pop-ups maybe
spins up or something like that a good
old-fashioned easing out for the for the
timing function and with these things
we're going to use the keyframes you
want to use for words
tap down a little bit I don't say at key
frames note notice the name of the
keyframes and now that's kind of
connected to the notifications class
right above and we'll just do start out
with our frame work is 0% to 100% what
do we want the main change to be well
let's just start off by saying go
fashion opacity 0 and 1 now it should
fade over 500 milliseconds there we go
so when I click onto it it should fade
in there we go and in that that is like
the basic framework of how all the
components fit together and now that we
have that we can just get really
creative with all these things turning
the knobs trying new ideas and here's an
idea use transform and use scale to make
it feel like it's growing up and so
we'll just say scale it from 0 and I put
0.1 because sometimes transforming from
scale 0 can be a little bit problematic
so we'll go from 0.1 to zero there we
are
there you go now that's interesting
you see how the bottom arrow doesn't
feel like the source it feels like the
source is flecked from the middle like
around here and the bottom is coming out
to point at that which is interesting I
mean it that's that's fine but what if
what if it started here and kind of grew
up from that so what we want to do here
is go to notifications and do the
transform origin to be a center bottom
so that way the the origin of this scale
oh I missed it did it work the origin of
the scale should come from the bottom
let's try it's coming from the bottom
but not from the bottom of what you see
because this is an after element it's
hanging down it's coming from right here
which is good but that's not still not
what I want now you don't have to use
bottom you can use an absolute number
from the top and so let's let's just do
a quick like 50 pixels from the top and
see how that looks to us that's getting
there
it looks like it's coming more from the
bottom right let's try something a
little more stress T there you go now
let's look at like looks like it's
coming right up out of the star that's
good that's good
I like it so just by changing the
transform origin these things are kind
of manipulated in that way - they look
like they're originating from a
different place what else can we do here
well let's go rotate and let's just put
an arbitrary 30 degrees on that and see
how that works out okay
looks pretty good a little spin there
what about you know there's a really
good video that I think if we're going
to be diving into animations that you
guys should at least watch I'll leave a
link to the video in the description
below and maybe even here's the
thumbnail but what this video is this is
this is a video that Disney put out
talking about the the laws of animation
and how things move in real life and how
we should emulate the property is a you
know of the physics that in real life
and when we're simulating things like
this you know digitally or in their case
when we're creating a movie or an
animation so what am i referring to what
if we did something that was a little
bit more a little bit more bouncy so
like this is this is like a linear kind
of thing right it has a hard start and a
heart hard end but things don't do that
in real life if you're going to if
you're going to run at somebody and then
stop quickly you're going to have to
slow down first and then kind of catch
yourself and we want to emulate that
using using the CSS code here so let's
do it at 50% why don't we say again
let's go up and grab this code here
transform a rotate let's go past zero
let's do negative 10 degrees we could
also take the scale off I don't want to
make it wait till 50% and then that look
a little bit better it looked like it
was spinning too soon so now it looks
like it's coming out hitting and then
bouncing back we want to over exaggerate
it again let's take this and duplicate
it for another 70 degrees and we'll have
it come back
just like two degrees or yeah three
degrees now let's look at it see how it
has that kind of like reality-based like
bouncing like it had to stop and it's
kind of catching itself with it with it
but it has like the what does it call be
a the inertia that it has to cast to
work with there it's pretty good huh no
good another thing we could do is make
it seem like it's coming up like the the
the scale makes it looks like it comes
it's coming up from below but this would
make it if we actually moved it down and
make it look like it's doing a little
bit more exaggerated so we say translate
and translate why fifty pixels there we
go cool another thing I thought of
instead of having the opacity land at
100 or 100 let's do the opacity at like
50 that way it's coming in quicker
visibly but we still have all the motion
yeah I like it
and one other thing we can do is do
another kind of rotate rotate rotate
what rotate X rotate X is interesting
because you're not doing a rotate like
this you're doing on the X you're doing
like the finally actually doing like
this I think so let's say 90 degrees
here on rotate X and if we slow this
animation down let's let's slow it down
to like five seconds that might be a
really long time but you see how that
rotate X kind of made it come like this
whoa
looks like somebody's like releasing a
jack-in-the-box puppet from like they're
doing the crank thing I like that we can
do the rotate X a little bit more
exaggerated too we're using this kind of
disney ethic let's say rotate X to be
negative two degrees so
kind of like bounces at you comes back I
think that's good doesn't need to be we
can make up like 800 milliseconds okay
does that sound fun
I like it let's move on to the next one
so what do we have going on here we have
it's basically a toggle of this class
which which will make the opacity 1 or 0
if you click on any one of these Murray
faces so let's look at this alert and
see what would be a good candidate for
the animation when I built this thing I
did it so that there could be three main
components the first one would be the
the whole thing what is it called the
alert element which is the blue box and
the black box altogether it's this whole
thing right here that's Taylor element
then there's the icon the HTML element
which isn't which is an eye and then the
other one is this text box here which is
the black background and that's right
there and so I'm thinking we can use all
of these things and animate them at
different speeds so where they feel like
they are kind of building themselves
right let's check that out now we're not
going to use keyframes this time I'm
just going to use transitions and
transforms so let's go to the alert
element and and decide on the beginning
state so let me click it here so
obviously the first state is to have a
pay city zero and then to animate it in
which is opacity one for this this whole
thing alert element but what if we did
some cool stuff with this thing and kind
of rotated it in view let me take off
this opacity zero so you can just see it
the whole time and talk about where it
comes from okay let's do a transform and
let's say like rotate 90 degrees just
down there we go and let's do quickly
before we get too far in doses to a
transform
origin and we'll say bottom left now
we've got a overflow:hidden that we want
to take off temporarily uh on the
website I think it's called yeah we want
to see that guy thing kind of like
hanging down all right and let's say for
our transform won't have it rotate it
down and scale it down too not too far
just like you know 50% down so now when
we get it back to normal it'll be kind
of growing in stuff so let's get that
done right here let's do a transition
and we'll say all of the things
translate over 500 milliseconds is ease
in out and that should be good for now
so transition these things there and so
let's say what transition them to let's
take this transform and go back to thee
is active class so when this active
class is added we want to scale this up
to 1 and rotate this to 0 degrees so
let's click on there we go
that's what we're doing right there we
need to move it down see how the bottom
of the web page is still tucked in there
let's tuck it down so transform let's
translate translate 100 pixels by you
know I don't know let's just start with
100 by 100 okay um how about by negative
100x want to scoot it up so if we have
it going up moving it this way when we
click one Mary this will kind of float
in from the little bit off to the lip
the right so it feels like it's coming
into place like floating like that
that's good what if we did another
rotate X
rotate capital X 90 degrees and then now
it's kind of like flipping and spinning
let's do the trick that we learned that
one time in that previous video where we
let's see look at the oh dear that's not
what we want we look at this element and
the section alert and nope there you go
it is active and look at this this a
busy a curve and I want to get one of
these bouncy ones so I'm going to do
this type of manipulation rate here and
I'm going to grab this cubic Bezier and
I want to put it where was it ease in
out this is what I'm going to do and now
when it bounces up it'll it'll have more
of a mine okay so let's do the put the
opacity back together and let's see how
this all works out is active haven't
tasted okay well that's a little much
that's probably a little overactive um
go back up here and do the
overflow:hidden okay now it's boxed up
like a website again let's click one Oh
gee-whiz that's really that's a really
big bounce but we don't need to go back
into that situation edit I can edit the
curves here 2.15 is probably the problem
that could be just be like 1.5 that
doesn't need to be two-point there we go
a little bit nicer a little bit softer
maybe that's even big 1.2 it basically
if you go past one you're going to get
the bounce mmm
1.5
I'm just messing with some members right
now don't mind me
trying too soft enough that bounce that
looks good okay now let's think about
the rest of this animation like I talked
earlier about how I wanted it to build
itself so let's identify that little
icon right here why don't we say that
inside of this icon we have this um the
element of I which is the actual alert
thing let's let's move it down and
shrink it so it kind of bounces up when
it's ready we'll do that with a simple
transform and we'll say scale it down
just I mean this is you'd be seeing a
pattern of reusing these sub elements
you get different effects scale it down
like 1.2 and then we need to move it
down with within the blue we want to
move that Abell down so let's translate
it down translate why vertically and
just say 50 pixels so let's copy all
this and go to where the active is okay
is active and inside that find the eye
and give it a translate of zero and a
scale of 1 and we need to animate that
so let's put an animation on the eye and
say transition transition all the things
and do it a do it at what at a time of
you know 400 milliseconds and ease in
out is fine for this one and then here's
the thing I don't want this Bell to be
moving in while the whole block is doing
that I want it to wait so what was the
amount of time this takes us take 600
milliseconds let's use that as a delay I
think that should go let's try it out
okay I can this thing lands I see the
Bell is really small and it comes in
let's do the same Bezier curve copy
and remove ease in out and then also
another thing I want to do is opacity go
to low pay city no want one right here
and zero there okay
let's try that that's nice
this should be not as mr. Butte like
maybe four point five coming along
nicely
you clicked emeriti the last thing I
wanna do is kind of control this black
bar should I have it slide out or
foldout let's do like a like a flip out
okay so what do you called your called
text let's set the before and it be
something similar to these right not
scale will not translate either
okay nothing here won't rotate Y which
is flip out this way and just say ninety
degrees so it should be coming right at
you transform 90 degrees rotate Y yes
and then inactive will make a text right
here will say rotate Y zero degrees
let's do that looks like something
didn't happen
Oh probably the transition was not there
at all okay so what we want to do is all
pretty much the same thing this you
could say transform those are the only
one thing happening 400 is fine cubic
Bezier and then the weight should be the
what is it four point five plus four
seconds so eight point five let's just
say let's just say eight
800 milliseconds all right now it should
delay after the bell comes in it should
come in the black text should swing out
okay so what we're seeing here is it is
rotated towards us in z space but it
let's delay a little bit we'll say nine
but it's not transform origin control so
let's go in here and put a trance almost
done
transform origin nope that's not how to
do this there you go transform origin
and want to say center right and that
way it should swing out a feeling like
it's attached to that blue block
let's try No did you even see what I
wrote oh that's on the I silly bear what
am i trying to do right here okay now
let's try you whoo okay obviously it's
attached to the wrong thing okay
transform origin left the you guys at
home were like right why would you do it
- right why would I do it - right
because it's like midnight right now
okay that looks fine except for you see
like when it comes up it's like already
back there like we need to you know do
the old opacity trick to get rid of this
thing and then when it's ready bring it
in
oh that that's not what I want you guys
why is that not working is active or pay
city oh because I did the I did the
transition on transform only so if you
do it on all it'll have to all the
elements doing this the same kind of
weight so now it should be like there we
go let's wait a little bit longer a
whole second and transition should take
a little bit longer to five five
milliseconds let's click on bills phase
all right maybe that busy a is a little
bit too aggressive let's just do a quick
old ease just a little linear nice
you clicked Amory you did it you clicked
Amory guys I'm clicking marry hmm okay
so there's a lot that you could do right
here to dial in the speed a little bit
more but we're running out of time so
we're just going to continue on so this
is the last one we got it we're going to
do this let's do this how I hope you
guys are still with me all right what
happens here is when I click on Bill
Murray's head like a thank you notice or
a modal pops up and it says thanks for
clicking on this bill Murray loves you
too in keyboard hacking and the way that
this kind of works is the JavaScript
says okay when you click on this thing
you know Adhan is active to the overlay
which is the black like dark screen
around it and which contains the what's
in it so obviously it would show up too
if you hook what's in it to the active
class of the overlay and then wait for a
bit we set a timeout function for five
seconds and then say take that overlay
and remove the class is active so the
way the reason it goes away is a timer
in JavaScript it's not with CSS or
anything else the reason I did that is
so you can quickly just try it again and
again without having to I don't know I
don't know I didn't want I basically I
didn't want to build a close button but
these principles still exist no matter
how you're triggering the animation
we're just going to build the animation
let's do the last one all right the
first thing that I want to animate I'm
just going to build a C that is active
right here let's let's make a note that
it is attached to the overlay the
overlay gets the is active class and I
want to add an animation to it animation
and we'll just call it over lay and
nation there we go and you know because
we have our JavaScript timer for 5
seconds we'll just say the whole thing
last 5 seconds and it's going to use it
ease in out timing function and it's
going to be
four words I don't think it needs I
think that necessarily matters if the
JavaScript is removing it but we're
going to do that anyway four words okay
and that should be good let's write the
let's write the key frames at key frames
what I call it overlay capital a.m.
there we are and in these key frames
this is going to be pretty simple we
need to do two things we need to fade in
the dark background which is the overlay
and we also need to fade it out
again so it's it's it's really simple we
want to fade in at 0% and out at 100%
there's going to be basically the same
thing and that in and out state is going
to be a background color of of you know
this this rgba 0 0 0 0 or that because
it's just it's going to be they're just
going to have a transparent background
and because we have it set up like that
we can quickly fade in in the background
to say you know just that dark like that
that gray which is 0.3 and now we have
to say okay what are the two sides how
much are we going to move this kind of
fade in and out is that faded and not
going to be to 50% and like it it's like
the whole thing let me show you 50% so
you can see what I'm talking about I'll
be clear with y'all if I do 50% not
click it and you see how this fade in
happens over the course of 5 seconds but
the high point when it reaches that 3%
is at that 3 that 30% of opacity is at
50% but that's not what I want I want to
have it at like 15% and the other side
of 15% close to 100 is 85 so we have 15%
away from one hundred eighty five
percent so now when I click it you'll
see that this thing
is in two gray and then pauses and then
fades out 15 percent away from five
seconds and that's the whole thing for
our animation that is cool what we're
going to be doing otherwise is we're
going to be looking at this mo Dao mo da
el mo this modal also needs an animation
and we'll call it a modal marble
immersion modal Anam and we'll also say
it lasts for five seconds because that's
just what we have been doing and
basically what we did for the is active
overlay because the overlay in the modal
are like partners right they work on
this things together so we want the the
whole experience to be happening within
that five-second bounds now that we know
what we're going to be calling it let's
make some new keyframes and call it
overlay and I know we're going to call
it modal ennum what do we want to do
with this modal let's click and see what
see what's really happening here it just
pops in so with modal's you you can have
an opportunity where you can teach the
user where it came from right so let's
do this let's do the same kind of like
thing structure here for these keyframes
not do the background but let's do a you
know trans form this time we're going to
do a translate X and just move it kind
of just off the page let's say negative
two hundred percent yeah and then here
in the 15 to 85 percent it should be at
0% let's do that and so basically it
should scoot in there we are scooting in
hey Bill what's up see you bill scoots
out perfect that's exactly what I
thought would happen we can also do a
rotate so he's like gonna flip in how
about that
90 90 degrees hey Bill
whoa you can flip out yeah you're gonna
flip out let's have them coming in
instead of this way come in this way put
a negative 90 on that rotate hey Bill
looks good and then another thing we can
do is the old good ol opacity coming in
from zero to one at 15% and at 85%
starting to go out
you Jacka me bill alright opacity and
then let's let's recognize that we have
it coming in from the left and then
moving out from the left we lit blitz
let's do this guy's
copy the 100% down here and let's
reverse all these things so he's
actually leaving the other side it's
going to come in from the left and leave
from the right so there's a journey
happening yeah coming in from the left
and leaving from the right no his face
okay yeah that's exactly what I wanted
to happen sure it is
one more thing one more thing before we
wrap up on this demo let's go back to
the the idea that we had in that first
one where things have a bouncy kind of
inertia to them and have a good 15% hey
let's do a 10% and we'll translate and
rotate a little bit so this is we're
like five percent off of where it should
end up and so let's let's overcompensate
so where we're coming from 90 let's
rotate it rotate it into like four
degrees looks like a little smaller of
course and translate it to maybe
negative two hundred to four per socket
let's see if the mm is this good why is
that I have an error here
oh I don't have a property name okay so
we receive if it comes in Oh see how it
bounces in all right it's not going to
bounce leave but it should so let's do
this whole thing sim same same and do it
here for five away from eighty five so
this is going to be change the 10 to 90
and we'll just invert this to negative
four and negative four percent so it
should come in in like bounce in in it
ready to go and then leave like like
like if you're going to throw a ball you
wind up and throw it right so that's
kind of how it's going to leave to so
come in with a bounce settle wind up and
leave that's brilliant
that is brilliant I love it let's review
let's review let's go up to the top and
make these things display so we can
check out our work okay the first thing
was that we're gonna make this
notification bar bounce in I like it
could be a little faster see the things
the animation is you don't want to make
things too fast you want people to be
able to see what's happening but at the
same time you don't want to be too slow
that it's like they're like come on give
me give me the result you know like give
me the alert here this is taking too
long and in truth this is too long I'm
giving you guys probably some bad habits
right now by making these things take as
long as they do but that's going to come
down to you and figuring it out what's
the best for your application but there
is you know a lot of studies done and
the prime like time for things to happen
work where people don't get impatient
but they're still interested yeah is in
like 250 milliseconds to 400
milliseconds so I usually just go for a
300 millisecond animation and that's
usually good but like things were you
know like here where they're like
folding out in front of us there's like
some complexity there's like steps to it
so that's a little bit more forgivable
but if this was a real application like
I can't
honestly we'll probably just do an
opacity fade in yeah okay done next week
we're going to be looking at what we can
do with animation to let the user know
that the website is working for them so
we're talking about animations of timers
loaders spinners progress furs and
before we end I want to thank the
beautiful patrons of this channel who
make this production of these videos
possible what who what our patrons if
those are the questions that you're
asking right now let me let me take a
