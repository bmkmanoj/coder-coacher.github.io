overview with react components and you
are watching dev tips with guest hosts
David and M PJ we're gonna use the react
that we created in the last episode and
actually build out all these components
that we sketched out in the yet even
more previous episode okay M PJ I'm just
gonna start off here we have the class
name app and then I just want to put out
a real header yeah sure
h1 and it will has it has a title
troubleshooting we are switch keyboards
because David can't deal with my I can't
use this microsoft keyboard so we're
gonna build out of the react demo app or
whatever and we're gonna build our
playlist app that we sketched out so
first I'm just gonna hit it off by
making the title part like that yep and
then we're gonna build components
because now we're gonna do these
aggregates parts and because they are
repeatable I would like to just make a
component and add a class to them to
style and how would I add a component to
this code alright so first of all I
think we should make the title a bit
more visible yeah and we can remove the
other crap yeah
so the title it has some kind of CSS
here yes bap h1 okay this will be hacky
I apologize beforehand I will just make
something nice nice all right so now a
component how do I write a component we
already we can already see here how the
app component is defined so you can just
basically copy paste this this stuff you
know what let's type it like copy
pasting is bad for a petition so I'm
going to create a new file no no you
know you can create it in the file
so yeah not inside no you can't define
components inside of components you need
to do it here so you write outside of
the app you write class and then name it
aggregate sure extends component
precisely so just a note here class here
is not a CSS class it's a JavaScript
class that is also the reason why JSX
has has class name instead of class yes
in order to not have that conflict okay
and then I just render precisely yep so
you create this this is a render method
on the aggregate class and that is where
everything happens and then I return
some HTML exactly alright so we'll just
do a div sure and then we just put the
sub header I know this is not the best
for SEO or whatever but let's just well
it's being rendered with JavaScript so
let's go with it it's a moot point so
it's a number and a text yeah
number text sure okay so now we just
have this one and it yeah how do I call
it from that Lee so now you can not now
this is available to you as a tag Oh
like that yup
you have to close it as well like this
or can i I think you can be both cool
and I will add two of those yeah all
right
really need to make that white can I can
I just add a class name here
like that is that good is that kosher or
should I do it up here on the component
that will be weird
which one is weird to do a class down
there I don't know what that would mean
really okay so I'll just add it here
yeah lets me just create an aggregate
class like that yep but I would like to
just use Reax features yep so just like
I will style this and I will make the
curly braces precisely to define that
this is a JavaScript part that will
enter here precisely and get another one
to make a JavaScript object yep which
will have some feature like color
yep I will just put white color exactly
but because this is JavaScript that
needs to be a string correct like that
para great can you just make a segue
here and mention that why it's so nice
to use inline styles in this context
yeah because if you had defined class
name here at this aggregate then the
styling options would be somewhere else
yes exactly they would also be in a
global scope so if any other class
somewhere you just accidentally use the
class name aggregate hmm you those would
be in
inflict and you would have to hunt down
where the hell is people define this
aggregate thing if you use inline styles
that means that this is only available
here inside of the component cool so
okay let me just try this I will just
remove it so I won't use it and I will
make a style yep that will set the width
to something like 40% will this work how
magic is this cool and my CSS is really
bad how will this flow can I make this
Dave's our block blocks by default we
can change it to like inline block yeah
this looks just like here okay
everything is centered but this is not
the styling episode I just want to make
get a feel of it all right
next up is this the filter component so
we'll just create the compass' filter
can I use that or is that perfect render
okay mpj does it matter if it's render
space and the print it does not matter
it's just a matter of style right yeah
exactly it's just personal preference
like good practices do not mix the
styles but me so we're gonna have some
kind of image that's quite a div for it
first and with this we could speed the
and then we're gonna have is that how
you right yeah just save it and see if
things appear oh no because we we
haven't to add it yeah I'm can just
clean this up oh that's true we don't
need those anymore
and the filter component there we go let
me just add color to the app so
everything is white yeah but instead of
doing that can we share the variable and
the in the app sure so here in the app
do you mean like that yeah exactly so we
like for instance like define a text
color at the top of this this document
right here yeah the text color be white
yeah all right and where would I use it
just can I use it in the CSS as well
we're gonna move away from the CSS file
in general and only use it and try to
use this styling as much as possible
just to get into it instead of calling
it know it let's let's proceed and use
the text color in the places where we
want the text to be white so why is that
better than just adding it to a CSS
which is applied across because now I
feel like Oh CSS does not have variables
yeah you would not be able to if if you
did this with CSS actually let's do it
with CSS and I'll so this is how I would
do it with CSS I would just put it here
exactly so what you're doing now is that
you are applying a white color to every
goddamn
in the entire universe yes so that means
that whenever you have something that
you don't want white you have to like
make it not white yeah so this is a very
like this works it's like this enormous
shotgun approach to styling but it also
you're you're spraying color everywhere
so instead of doing that if you say yeah
I could instead just say you could
create a create a styling rule that
applied to all the things you wanted
white so for instance let's let's let's
do that let's make this a bit more
narrow mm-hmm
like apply it to only only the things
you want it to apply to I mean like this
yeah exactly
all the dips yeah exactly but you will
probably not do it to all them so you
will probably do it to like a list of
classes here right yeah so it would be
these these weird styling rules that are
spread all over the place because like I
would you like this with aggregate and
it would also be to add and filter gas
perhaps and and their playlists perhaps
precisely and this is not horrible but
you could also do it like this if you go
back to the app J s and now you have you
call this variable like default text
color and now if you go to somewhere
where we redefine that yeah there change
this to default text color instead of
using FFF you use default text color
like that yeah exactly so this is
probably something that you if you had
less in unless you would probably use
variables like this but again using
javascript you you don't have to do that
you can just actually use variables okay
so let's go with this and I would just
add it do you hate me now no that's fine
that's fine all right so we have
something
it says field to there that's just
because I don't know if we need a button
or something we need a button this be
automatically I think we should yes you
do this like an autocomplete okay
so yeah let's just remove that let's
find some kind of image eventually and
hit the next component which is the
playlist component so if you remember
we're gonna have each playlist that
we're looking at in this current view be
based on what we're filtering yep so
we'll just add one playlist here and
create the playlist okay I can do
mention here of as you notice here we do
a return and then we do these
parentheses oh yeah
and the reason we do that is that just
type it out and let's omit them and see
what happens we're gonna have an image
something in it and then we're gonna
have a sub header based name
and then perhaps we're gonna have a list
of top songs song 1 oh sorry I was used
to yeah come on B and then we'll just
apply the default like that nice so
let's try removing those parentheses
just to see what is what is happening
with those like that yep so what happens
is that react is warning us here that oh
nothing is being returned from the
playlist component that's weird it says
you might have returned on defined an
array or some other in value object then
what we have returned is undefined you
know why
and because there's a line break here
exactly yeah that yes because JavaScript
has this feature called automatic
semicolon insertion which is would you
need to be aware of so it it will you
don't have to do do semicolons in
JavaScript it will insert them for you
automatically which sometimes throws you
off so in this case if you go back to
the earlier case it will actually we
insert the semicolon after the returns
it will insert it here yeah it means
that it returns nothing yeah exactly so
when I say this is the same but the
parentheses in with the parentheses the
parent
the interpreter your script interpreter
will understand that oh there's a bloke
here like I don't even know what I could
have picked this part and just put it up
here it just looks more nice and you
have the indentation and everything
exactly this is yes so that you keep
invitation so that the day of this in in
line with the other with its closing tag
and then I would just put a width here
for something like 20 percent so glad
you did this because now I can
demonstrate another feature yeah browser
should make that look nice first though
perhaps 20 is a bit too narrow because
the layout looks weird now so oh there
that's nice nice earth alright so right
now we are repeating the color default
text color here so we have this default
style for all of these but we are here
right here were overriding it a bit so I
would like to create a instead of having
just a default text color I would like
to create a default style here mm-hmm so
a style object and we're gonna like
extend and override that albeit okay so
here I would just create the style
object exactly sighs and we would go
give that a color property just use
default text colors exactly exactly and
now we can use a JavaScript feature that
actually does not exist yet oh this is
we're gonna use the object spread
operator which is used to X when you
have an object and you want to like weld
on a property like we want to do here
that's when you use the object spread
operator and this is something that
Facebook invented and it's it submitted
as a proposal for the next JavaScript
version and it's most likely gonna make
it in because it's so here we would like
to use the default style yeah
but extend it with this with field
precisely so instead you will just
remove the color default text color here
and instead you would go dot dot dot
default dr. yeah exactly dot dot dot dot
yeah
default style like that yep cool it
works yeah so this will give you like
default style but with with welded on
okay now I want to keep this clean so I
want to have just want to do some
cleaning up exactly so in this case you
don't need the object spread operator
here you can just and I can because now
it's an object I can just write default
style and precisely there and for this
let's just do this remove oh yeah yes if
this works maybe I'm not sure we'll see
I don't think you will but oh it does
you can add several no I was is it just
not working no I think works remove
default style and see if it breaks oh
and the dot a dot this part yeah yeah it
worked
yeah because it was white quick and to
just make it look just like exactly like
this sketch we will add three more
playlists just copy paste here so right
now we have some kind of dummy data and
we're going to make that in line style
as well am I writing great in line book
there you go nice in the next video we
will make our first push to get up yeah
and github is a version control system
we're gonna talk about what that is and
why we use it so we're going to sing the
dance up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
