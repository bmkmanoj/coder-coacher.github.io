and more there are a lot of ways of
expressing length in CSS today we're
going to be talking about CSS units ah
this video is request by the deficits
patron community members and I'll tell
you more about the dev tips patron
community at the end of video but for
now let's just get into it there are 15
CSS units that are currently supported
by browsers click on any one of these
right now to jump to that spot in the
video you can separate these units into
two categories absolute links and
relative links let's start with relative
lengths relative links get their
measurements based on something else
there are three things that relative
units base their dimensions on their
parents dimensions the currently
declared font size and the viewport
dimensions so let's start with one of
the easiest ones to understand
percentages percentages are only
relative lengths based on their parent
so let's say I have this blue parent and
inside is a child and I have this box
here at 400 pixels by 400 pixels that's
the blue box and let's say make the
child a percentage of the parent so I'll
say with 50% and height 50% now the
green box shows up and I see it's
exactly 50% of the width and height of
the blue box pretty simple right so
let's take another child and put it in
here let's put 4 children in here and
make the width about 25% about 250 25
25% now let's float these elements to
the left and now we see how most grid
systems that you guys use operate just
remember to clear fix those rows now
let's see what happens if we take one of
these children and get rid of this
floating and let's just say the width is
125 percent you see how the child will
actually break outside of its parent
because it's 125 percent of its parent
so it's going to go even further than
the dimensions of its parent now
sometimes you'll make the the child 100%
and you get this perfect fitting the the
child will stretch to fill the the
parent exactly but then you'll come
along and you'll say padding is a you
know 20 pixels and then your little
child is kind of breaking outside of the
of the borders of the parent that's
because the size of that child is
calculated on the inner box and then
you're putting padding around it so to
fix that you'll just do this quick fix
of box sizing and reset the box sizing
to border box and now it will still be
100% and have its padding in there see
it has a padding cool that's percentages
so let's move on there are four units
that are based on the dimensions of the
browser viewport those are VW vh v min
and V Max the first two V W and V H they
divide the viewport into a grid of 100
units V W means viewport width if you
declare this element as the width is
going to be 50 VW's then you see that
the the width of the element is exactly
50% of the viewport so let's shrink this
viewport and you can see that the
element responds by growing and
shrinking pretty exciting huh the same
idea exists for the height so if I go in
here and say 50 viewport Heights then
the element will stretch to exactly half
of the viewport height and then when I
shrink it it shrinks as well and it
doesn't need to be butting up against
the edge of the browser like the width
is I mean there's search space above it
it's just 50% of the height no matter
where it is on the page and if you
really want to have your mind blown you
can declare viewport width units on the
height of elements and viewport height
elements on the width of units and then
be like isn't that wild you're like oh
my goodness what I can't even I can't
even alright let's get into the next one
V min and V Max these ones are a little
tricky V min and V Max stands for the
viewport minimum
or the viewport maximum depending on
which one you're using and they get
their they get their measurements from
the viewport in the same way that V H
and V W do using that 100 unit grid
system but this time they reference
either the height or the width depending
on which is the biggest or smallest
depending on which v-max Ravine min
you're using all right let me show you
what that means all right now we can see
that this element V min is set to with
50 V mins so this blue box is exactly
equal to 50% of the shortest of the
dimensions of this browser we can see
that the browser is taller than it is
wide so when I move the width of the
browser this element responds to be
exactly fifty of the viewport units
right now let me shrink this browser
from the bottom and you see the element
doesn't respond until until it becomes
the smallest dimension until the height
of the browser becomes the smallest
dimension and now the width of this blue
element is responding to the height of
the browser because it is the smallest
dimension if I say I switch this and say
V Max it's going to then respond to the
width of this element because that's at
this point the highest the longest
dimension and it will not respond to the
height until the height becomes the max
viewport dimension then the biggest
viewport dimension right there see I
don't I don't know what you would use
this for but it's very interesting it
makes more sense when you use it a bit I
recommend using it and all of these
files that I'm using here are available
for download if you're a member of the
patreon community they're just attached
right to the patreon video now let's
talk about the font relative links there
are four sizes that are based on the
currently declared font e^x and CH is
one we're gonna look at right now
I've never used these before but let me
tell you about them first let's talk
about e^x e^x is based on the height of
the X of the font family that you're
using right now why would they use the X
this is the typographic choice that goes
back from a long time the X is the is a
is kind of a boxy character it doesn't
have any ascenders or
ever and so it's usually you'd reference
the x-height when you're designing a
type family so this measurement is based
on the the visible dimension of the X so
I currently have this blue line set as
the height of one e^x let's change that
to like two e^x maybe 5e x okay now
that's all well and good it's exactly
equal to five x is stacked on top of
each other
visually let's say that we want to
change the font size to 30 pixels now
because the X has grown so does the
height of the multiplied a blue box
there now the height of the X can vary
depending on what font family you're
using some type of graphic Styles have
have like a higher X height than others
for example a modern type will have a
different X height than like an
old-style family let me show you what I
mean but pull up my inspector here and
get my magnifying glass let's measure
this blue box it's currently in pixels
rendering it 78 pixels tall if I change
this this style of the e^x element to
let's say font family serif it changes
and let's look at it again it's
rendering at 67 pixels tall so the
height of that blue box became smaller
simply because the font display style is
a little bit different and the X is
visibly a little smaller than it was in
a sans serif version wild huh so that's
that so the x is based on the height of
the X the CH element I don't know what
CH stands for still but the CH element
let me change this 5x - 5 ch ch is based
on the width of the zero element I don't
really have anything else to say other
than them then the CH is based on the
width of the zero element so if you took
this zero and kind of put it on its side
it would fit in up in the height of that
blue line let's move on we're going to
talk about REMS and m's REMS and M's
actually get used a whole heck of a lot
now m and REM are not based on any
specific character inside of the font in
fact they're not based on the font you
have at all so if you change the font
family in the middle of your layout it's
not going to break the layout but it's
based on a different font attribute the
font size so in this example I have a
class of M here this div and I've set
the font size to 10 picks for the
example the parent and then I've set the
width and the height to 1m so when we
come over here there should be a little
blue box here and if I inspect it we can
see that it's dimension is 10 pixel by
10 pixel so 1m is equal to in this
example 10 pixels because the parent of
the element that has 1m is 10 pixels now
this scales if I say to em it's going to
be 20 pixels by 20 pixels box let's save
that and refresh you see that a box
that's 20 pixels by 20 pixels because
it's a multiplying 2m is a multiplier of
the original 10 pixel example right here
now the interesting thing about em is
that they cascade so if I write here
let's just write 2m in this box and
let's put some more m inside of these
M's it's like the end there MGM is
basically MC names let's close off these
divs I'm using HTML tonight so that
everyone can follow along with basic
stuff like this okay so the font size is
going to be equal to 1 m right now let's
just change this font size to 1 m now
let's change it to 2 m sorry okay but
this is the catch though MS cascade for
example here if you set a child to say
to M and then put it inside of a parent
that's 2 m the child will multiply 2 B
to be equal to 4 M it's pretty wild huh
so you have to be careful using m's
because your layout might break
depending on where you put things in the
layout an h1 might not always be the
same size depending on what its parent
is so this example here number 5 m and r
m is one of the most like interesting to
play with because you can just change
the example
fontsize and see how it propagates
through it I'd recommend diving into
these files and just messing with them
for a while to really understand this
concept but next let's duplicate this
and talk about REMS so duplicate and
we're going to call it REMS
okay and then go down here create a new
font style called rims
okay now rims are a little bit easier to
comprehend and they do not cascade and
multiply REM means root em so they're
based on the root element if I go into
this base SAS here you see that I've
declared the root as font size 10 pixels
now I can change the the font size to 30
pixels here and it will affect the MS
but it will not affect the roots these
these bottom ones here they put some put
some line breaks here quickly move these
down okay so these rims here are not
affected by how I mess with the parent
font size so in effect they're a little
bit easier to wrangle what they are
affected by is that root font size and
also they don't cascade so even so
they're inside each other like the MS
were they're not basing the new rim off
of what its parent was they're always
going to remain the same so Remz are
used a lot in responsive design grids
when you want to change everything at
once so for example if I have a font
size here that's that's two rims let's
make it 5 rims and a width it's 5 rims
it's going to be just so much right 50
pixels is the width but if I go in here
and change the route size to be like 50
it's going to change everything across
the layout for these rims and that's
really helpful in responsive web design
when you want all of the fonts just to
kind of crunch down just a little bit
more for a mobile size or expand wider
for a larger browser window it's a
really easy way to change the whole
layout with one little declaration
alright next let's talk about absolute
links absolute links get their names
because they don't base their dimensions
on anything else right they don't base
it on the parent and they don't base it
on another font they base it on
real-world dimensions and these a lot of
these going to be great for use in
imprinting
but let me show you what we have exact
exactly here we have inches centimeters
millimeters points and pikas you're
familiar with these right in the real
world and here in this here in this
example I've set them all to be just
three of whatever so inches is 3 inches
3 centimeters 3 millimeters 3 points and
3 pikas now if you're not familiar with
points in Pike is these are typographic
terms and I don't well you might be
familiar with points actually when you
in your word processor when you say oh I
want a twelve point five a point is
actually a physical measurement I don't
know if you knew that or not but when
you're yeah when you're selecting points
in your in your word processor you're
actually talking about physical
dimensions of the printed example a
point is 170 second of an inch it's
really small so when you say three
points that's why it's the smallest one
here and a pica is twelve points or in
other words a sixth of an inch points
and pikas are measurements used by
typesetters back in the day and they
just kind of worked their way into CSS
because you might use these measurements
more in a like a print style sheet or
something like that and the last
absolute dimension is pixels pixels you
should be already familiar with pixels
are awesome the pixels even though
they're absolute dimensions are not
based on you know the viewport width or
another font size they are best thought
as device pixels because this the size
of a pixel can can vary depending on
your device right if you have a
high-density cell phone screen or a
low-density monitor like the one I'm
using here pixels are the measurement
that I feel the most comfortable
thinking in they're the the canonical
measurement of the web you'll find the
idea of pixels across all devices and in
all stacks and in fact other links map
directly to pixels you notice that when
I inspected element on a lot of the
examples that I was showing you today
they all rendered in pixels JavaScript
talks in pixels so for that reason
pixels are kind of the most commonly
used CSS units and here we have exactly
what you imagined it to be a box that's
200 pixels wide and we change it to 400
pixels wide and it's just 400 fixes
wider now
surprise fun fact my first computer
monitor had a pixel grid of 640 by 480
alright that's it for CSS units again if
you are a member of the patreon
community you can just log in and and
find this video in the in the Activity
Feed and download all of these files to
play around with and kind of get your
hands dirty with them and if you're not
yet a patreon I will tell you about that
in a second and there you have it the
CSS length thank you so much for
watching the dev tips show the dev tips
show is supported by these wonderful
people here these are my patrons as I
said earlier this episode itself was a
request from people who are in the
community and you can go to
patreon.com/scishow and that's all I
have for tonight but I want you to
