JavaScript we looked at jQuery with the
learn jQuery in 15-minute series we had
a lot of fun so we're going to continue
on with that trend for the next few
weeks we're going to be looking at
javascript and the Dom these videos are
going to be hosted by a longtime depth
tipster and patron of the show Adam rec
low
Adam and I were emailing each other and
it came up that he's been teaching an
introductory jeaious workshop to
teenagers with an organization called
node school and I thought this would be
perfect for dev tips so I invited him to
present his material here he's got seven
lessons for us for today and three next
week they're really good and I'm excited
now to pass it over to Adam I'll see you
guys after the class hello my name is
Adam reco
and I'll be your instructor for this
course JavaScript and the Dom if you
want to follow along with the exercises
I suggest you get an account of copán
over at copán do in this course we're
going to be covering the document object
model to begin we're going to look at
javascript objects and how that compares
to the Dom as we go along we're going to
be using some functional programming
techniques to make our code more
readable as well as flexible we're going
to be using event listeners to add
interactivity to the page and some
global objects and functions such as the
date object and the set interval
function so we can get comfortable using
those in our applications and the
process we're going to create some cool
projects so if you want to get started
with JavaScript and a Dom let's go so we
know that Dom stands for document object
model but we don't yet know what an
object is and I want to show you that
first because I think it'll help you to
better visualize what the down actually
is so to begin we're just going to
create a simple object and so to do that
I'm going to declare a variable gives it
the name object and then set it to curly
braces so to actually put in information
or data inside of an object we use key
value pairs so for example name give it
a key of name and then a value of a
string which is my first name
and two separate key value pairs inside
of an object you just used commas for
that now you can also put objects inside
of other objects so for example I can
put a dress and give it a value of an
object and then inside of there I can
put more key value pairs so I'm going to
put state and set that to the value
Florida so now we have an object but
what about accessing data inside of
objects and assigning them to new
variables well we can use dot notation
to do that so for example here it's
going to create a variable called by
name and then set it equal to object dot
name and if I want to see that in the
console I can just console log that out
and here in code PIN has a nice little
console here and you should see your
name in the console now now you can also
change values inside of objects and you
can use dot notation for that as well so
if I want to change the state from
Florida to Oklahoma I can use dot
notation so I can say object that
address that state and then set it equal
to a new value okay so now we kind of
understand the basics of objects in
JavaScript now I kind of want to show
you the the Dom object and to do that
we're going to change the view so go to
change view then go to debug mode and
this is going to open a new window now I
want you to right-click go to inspect
element and this is going to open up
developer tools and then the top here
the tab that says console click on
console it's already have some data here
from previously but now I want to
console dot log the document object so
you can kind of take a look at that
so let's consult log and then just put
document in there
and this gives us the HTML document if
you click on it then we'll get the rest
of that document here in the window and
all of the different properties and
values now look here we have a BG colors
which stands for background color and it
doesn't have a value and that's why
right now we have a white screen in the
background but what if we wanted to
change that value to pink for example
well we can use dot notation just like
we did before to do that so what we can
do is we can say document dot and then
BG color and then we can set that to a
new value and say pink and when I do
that it changes the background to pink
so this was just a nice little simple
introduction to Java Script objects so
then you have a better idea of what the
Dom is and how you will use it at this
point we know that the Dom is a big
object that has a set of key value pairs
that's available to us to be able to you
know maybe change certain features to
the page more importantly we also have
functions that the document makes
available to us as well that allows us
to add delete and even create more
interactivity on the page so just as an
example I want to show you how we can
create a paragraph tag how we can then
add some text content to it and then be
able to append that paragraph to the
body of the document so if I want to
create a paragraph I can just declare a
variable and call it paragraph and then
what I can do is I can use the document
create element function and I can pass
in the string P which represents the
paragraph tag now if I want to be able
to add a text content to that paragraph
I can say paragraph dot text content
which is a property on that element and
then I can give that the value of the
down is the
now lastly if I want to append that
element to the page I can just use the
append child function that's available
to us so I can say document that body
dot append child a I can pass in
paragraph and if everything works out
right then you should be able to see it
on your screen there so now we know that
there's a bit more power to the DOM and
that's available to us through these
different functions that I currently
maybe doesn't really do too much but as
we go forward we're going to learn more
about the functions that give us the
ability to add more interactivity to the
page so in the last video I showed you
some of the functions that are available
to us through the document object and in
this video I want to show you an
important function that's available to
us that allows us to input a little bit
more interactivity into the page and
that's the add event listener function
so to kind of carry on what we did in
the last video we're going to create an
element we're going to set its height
we're going to then append that element
to the Dom and then we're going to add
the event listener to it so to begin
let's just declare a variable and call
it div and then we're going to create
the div element by using document create
element passing in a string of the
capital letters div and that relates to
the div tag now let's give this div a
height because we're going to be using
an event listener that listens to the
mouse move over the dom and as you know
if elements do not have other elements
inside of them then they don't have a
height but we do want this event
listener to work over the entire webpage
so we need to set the height
of the webpage and of this element to
100% of the view height to do that we
can just say div that style that height
is equal to 100% of the view height and
then all we have to do is a pin this to
the Dom so we can say document that body
down pin child and then pass in the div
so now we have a div within the document
object and now we're going to add the
event listener which we said was going
to be the mouse move so we just have to
set div here and then we're going to add
event listener and then we just pass in
mouse move and what we get back is a
callback function that will tell us the
event that's happening on the Dom and
give us a little bit information that we
can use to then maybe add some more
interactivity so if you kind of want to
see this in kind of visualize what it
looks like event is just a regular
object so if we console dot log and then
we go over here to change view and we go
to debug mode then we can right-click
and we can inspect element and then we
can click on the console tab and every
time I move my mouse over the Dom it's
going to log out some information in
this object so what we have is a target
we have buttons we have client X client
why layer x and layer Y what we want is
client X and client Y which is the
coordinates of the cursor um in the X&amp;amp;Y
plane so X extends from zero to the left
all the way to infinity to the right and
Y starts at zero at the top and all the
way to infinity at the bottom so as you
see the numbers get higher as I go over
here and lower as I get closer
to the top left corner so what we want
to do is we want to display the client X
and client Y on the webpage so to do
that I'm going to declare some variables
first so I'm going to say VAR x equals
event the client X and then I'm going to
say bar y equals event client Y and then
just as we did in the previous video we
can use text content to display this on
the page so I can say div text content
is equal to X and then I'm going to just
separate it with a comma and then plus y
so then if we hover over this we get the
coordinates of the cursor the X&amp;amp;Y
coordinates of the cursor in the top
left corner now this is not too
interesting at this point so what I want
to do now is to kind of make it you know
more aesthetic let's change the
background color in relation to the X&amp;amp;Y
coordinates to do that all we have to do
is set the style of the background color
so we can say div dot style that
background color is equal to RGB and
then I'm going to pass in X as the R
value and then separate with that with a
comma pass in Y as the G value and then
just give it 100 as the the B value so
now what we should see is when I hover
over this the thumb is going to change
colors based on the X&amp;amp;Y coordinates of
my mouse and if we do this on the debug
mode we have to first refresh and then
we get these nice cool colors on the
page so in this video we learned that
the Dom gives us a little bit
more than just simple functions that
allow us to put things on a page or take
things off the page it gives us the add
event listener function which gives us a
callback function of the event and using
that information to then be able to add
more interactivity to the page so in the
last video I showed you how we could
change the background in relation to
where the mouse is on the screen and I
think we have a good solution at this
point but what I'd like to do is
refactor this so that we can make it a
little bit more flexible and more
functional in nature and when I mean
functional programming I'm referring to
the paradigm where you're trying to use
functions to map inputs to outputs and I
know that probably sounds a little
theoretical at this point so let's just
kind of jump in and go from having the
imperative code that we have now to more
functional code so to begin we're going
to create a function and the way that
you do that is you use the keyword
function and then afterward you're going
to give it a name so I'm going to call
this full screen and then after that you
give it two parentheses now the
parentheses take in arguments and I want
to give it one argument that we're going
to pass in when we instantiate it and
I'll show you what instantiation is
later when we actually have to create
this element now after you pass in an
argument then you end with these two
parens and inside of the main curly
braces inside the curly braces is where
our functionality will be so since we're
just creating this fullscreen element we
can then take all of this here and we
can cut it and then we can paste it and
tidy it up and because I'm passing in
the element that I want to create here
that is what is going to be passed into
this so when I instantiate the function
or call the function then what's going
to be put here is the string capital div
and that is what is going to be passed
into here okay I'm going to get rid of
these comments and so instead of div I
guess I can still call it div but I'm
going to call it a new element just to
give it a new name new element and then
it gets appended to the down using a pin
child so what we need to do now is we
need to return new element because this
is what's going to be taken in from
another function so we have we create a
function to create an element and we
have the element we have the Styles but
now we need to pass that element on to
the event listener so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to create a new function
and I'm going to call it input and what
it's going to take are a few arguments
so it's going to take a input type it's
going to take in a element or I'll put
something different like Dom element and
it's also going to take a callback and
just as before we take the curly braces
and just to kind of explain callbacks
are what's used and a lot in
asynchronous programming and because the
addeventlistener is an asynchronous
event the callback is going to come in
really handy later on and you'll you'll
kind of see what I'm saying as we as we
go further along and just to clarify as
well
asynchronous programming so for example
the the a diva
listen our mouths move so whenever I
move my mouse is going to send any vent
to this callback function pass it in
here so then we can use that data and
information so for example getting the
client x-coordinate and the client
y-coordinate
well when my mouse is not moving there's
no events that are being fired off so
there's going to be some time that
passes and then you know sometime
afterward you know could be any time and
once I start moving with my mouse again
then I'm going to start getting events
well because it's not at regular
intervals that's considered asynchronous
programming so what we can do now is we
can cut this out and we can paste it
there and I'm going to delete that I'm
going to tidy this up a little bit and
I'm going to get rid of console dot law
so full screen now this element we're
going to be passing it in to this
function and it's going to be our Dom
element so here I'm going to put valent
element and because we have an input
type which is going to be mouse move I'm
going to change this out and put it as
input type and so we're getting the
information here and because we want to
kind of extract out what the output is
going to be we're going to cut this but
before we do that we're going to create
another function called output and so
inside of here we can put what we want
our output to be so X be
so because this is an asynchronous event
we don't know when we're going to be
getting these events so as you saw in
the previous video when I counseled out
logged this information and I moved my
mouse on the screen you can see in the
log that these events are getting fired
every time I move the mouse so since
we're not going to be able to get this
information synchronously we use what's
called a callback and what I'm going to
do is I'm going to pass in the Dom
element I'm going to pass in X I'm going
to pass in Y now this information can
then be used and utilized to then be
able to put what we want on the output
and so when this input
it's instantiated we're going to be
calling this callback and so in place of
callback we're going to actually be
putting in output so just imagine that
this is output and output is now going
to accept an element and x and a y so
because we know that output is going to
be called with these three arguments we
can then put those arguments in here and
I'm just going to call them element x
and y and then in our function we can
say element element there and then X and
Y is already labeled correctly so we
don't have to change that and here is
our our new functions so just to kind of
give a brief overview again of what's
happening we have a full-screen function
that takes an element type and like I
said when we instantiate this we're
going to be passing in the string
capital div and what this is going to do
is it's going to create the new element
it's going to give it a height it's
going to pin that element to the
and then is going to return that element
that we have now the input is going to
take an input type which we said was
going to be Mouse move then we're going
to accept that Dom element that we're
going to take in and then we're going to
call a callback and the reason why we
need to use a callback is because this
addeventlistener
is asynchronous so we just need to
whenever this event fires we need to
then capture that event and pass along
the information so we need to pass on
the Dom element we need to pass on x and
y so a callback function which is going
to be output and output is then going to
take that element take the X take the Y
and put that into the Dom so if we want
to wire this up what we can do is we can
say input and then so at this point
we're instantiating this function or
we're calling this function so we said
when we instantiate it we need to give
it an input type so we're going to say
mouse move and we're going to give it a
Dom element which is going to be this
function fullscreen passing in the
capital letters div so we can say full
screen and then capital letters and then
like we said previously we have a
callback and we know that our callback
is going to be output so I can just put
output here and if everything is working
correctly then we can see that it's
functioning as we expected on the screen
so this is the refactoring of the
previous lesson to make our code a
little bit more functional in nature now
it's not totally perfect reason being is
because we have some side effects so a
side effect is basically when you have
input and you have unexpected output now
this wasn't here and all did was return
a new element I could expect that what I
get in return
is going to have a height of 100 and
it's going to be a div for example but
because I have this side effect this is
what kind of doesn't make it a appear
function and somewhat goes against the
rules of functional programming but we
can overlook that for now and so we have
you know as best we can use functional
programming to refactor our code and to
make a little bit cleaner and what's
nice about that too is maybe instead of
div I could put another type of element
here instead of div so it could be you
know maybe I put a I main because in
html5 we have main tags now so it could
be main for example instead of just div
and this could be clique so this would
be looking for click events instead of
mouse move events so then when I click
on the screen its changing based on
clicks and not mouse move so that's
what's really nice about functional
program just allows us to map our inputs
to our outputs kind of separate concerns
and then gives us a little bit more
flexibility to change you know what what
kind of events and interactions we're
trying to create wasn't that awesome
Adam is a really good teacher and
putting this video together I realized
that I mess up way more than he does I
don't know what that says about me
anyway I said earlier the atom is a
member of the patreon community this
community is a group of people who
believe in what we're doing here at dev
tips so much that they donate an amount
of their own choosing for each episode
to the show and all of the money that
the patrons give is fed back directly
into the show and I'm able to buy extra
equipment to make better videos and also
to pay Adam for the videos that he's
making for us patrons of the show get to
see these videos early and they get
extra videos and they even get a private
podcast and monthly video hangouts and
there's also a live 24 hour dev tips
chat with a bunch of people in there
kind of
all the time anyhow join us at
patreon.com slash dev tips and I'll see
y'all next week keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
