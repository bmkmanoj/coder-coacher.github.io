Nielsen and this is depth tips for
designers this is the first video of the
channel so I thought I'd started off
with a bit of a series I call html5
basics for funny cat pics and angry
YouTube comments before even the World
Wide Web there was the Internet but what
was that like
well I looked it up let me tell you it's
quite interesting
the internet was birthed during the Cold
War it was a way to send intelligence
from one nuclear bunker
to another but in 1969 that network was
opened and computer nerds everywhere
celebrated as they were able to find a
way to tie all their nifty little toys
together loopy boo-boo-boo-boo-boo I
want to take you to a magical faraway
place so it's Anna in 1999 a British
inventor and computer scientist named
Tim berners-lee proposed a document
which outlined something he called the
World Wide Web along with this idea for
a worldwide network of connected
computers Tim berners-lee also created a
language in which documents for this
network would be created and managed by
people just like you and me the language
that these documents were written in was
called hypertext markup language HTML
HTML was kind of novel to the Internet
in those days as it was a human readable
language not a program language for
super computers but a language that was
human readable that we mere mortals
could read and understand to be fair the
web pages were something very similar to
how we think of Word documents something
to be shared and edited and collaborated
on and more of a conveyance of
information than a stylized web
experience that we have today in fact
the first world wide web browser shipped
with a code editor built inside the
intention was that all of the documents
across the worldwide web would be
editable by pretty much anybody at least
that's what I understand it to be there
was an underlying philosophy in the
beginning about standing on the
shoulders of what had come before
HTML 1 or the first version of Age
Gmail was very loose and free-flowing it
wasn't a lot of rules there wasn't a lot
of meat to it for example the language
HTML itself wasn't even very novel those
kinds of tags already existed in
something called sgml
which is another acronym which stands
for standard generalized markup language
the truth is there never was an HTML one
the first official spec was HTML 2.0
which was written by the IETF which
means the internet Engineering Task
Force hello these acronyms they never
stop now you can see this happening
again as a theme in a lot of ways the
IETF was just standardizing things that
have already been done for example the
market leading browser of the time was
called mosaic and included the ability
for authors to embed images with an IMG
tag HTML 2 didn't invent the IMG tag it
just made it standard this ragtag band
of hooligans this task force was
eventually superseded by you guessed it
another acronym w3c stands for the World
Wide Web Consortium there was a flurry
of updates until HTML 4.0 the w3c
focused on something called X HTML 1.0
xhtml 1.0 didn't add anything new to the
language but again it's standardized and
formalized a lot of the things that were
just happening in the wild you led the
way for a much more strict syntax
firstly I really liked XHTML is the
first time that anybody told us what to
do in a very clear way before that we
would just look at view source of
everybody's websites and see a hundred
different ways to do the same thing it's
very confusing you actually had to
declare if you were going to make a
strict document or a transitional
document which was kind of like the
bridge between html5 and XHTML XHTML
wasn't a large departure from HTML but
it was the first step with version 1.1
of XHTML started taking very purposeful
steps towards converting HTML into
actual XML which is an entirely
different language it was around this
I'm the internet explorer which was the
dominant browser of the time
you guys remember internet explorer I
remember me and my little brother
sneaking and out and staying up way past
our bedtime just to download Internet
Explorer 5 it took like all night
internet explorer which was the dominant
browser at the time was just like nope
I'm not going to do that so if you
decided to write your code in XML I was
like 80% of the entire web couldn't even
see your document so it didn't fly
didn't last very long
so while the w3c continued on the path
to XHTML enlightenment a number of
representatives from various different
browsers started getting together and
discussing things they formed a group
called web hypertext application
technology working group and as you may
have guessed they use an acronym for
that the what look while it may seem
that there's a lot of fingers at the pot
at this point this group is instrumental
in bringing about a lot of important
change they approached it totally
different the first group that we talked
about the w3c the way they operate is
they have a committee is about things
they ratify by consensus there are final
documents if there's any disagreement
about it they discuss it at length and
argue about it forever the what would
does it a little differently all of the
decisions end with the voice of the
editor who is the leader of the group so
what happened the w3c was kind of
floating around trying to get those
things done and make everybody happy but
the what would was able to move very
fast get a lot of things done in a short
amount of time it may sound like a
democratic versus a dictatorial
situation and a lot of ways it was but
the w3c was getting mired with this
XHTML idea and it seemed as if they were
losing touch so the what would took to
very familiar directions they focused on
web forms and web apps and you'll notice
that these are two things that are very
important in our web experience today
web forms are the only way that you can
buy anything and web apps so the only
way that people can provide a service to
you via the Internet
so in 2006 Tim berners-lee remember he
invented the world wide web he admitted
in a blog post that the attempt to move
from HTML to XML just wasn't working
that night you could hear the sound of a
million nerds cry it took a while but in
2009 the w3c officially dropped XML is
the new format and in what looks like a
shake hands and play nice move the w3c
and the what would join forces and
started working together on something
very new and very exciting called html5
now this brings us up-to-date and at the
end of this first video next week we're
going to talk about what html5 is what
it's not and how you can use it today
give you a hint you probably already are
so obscure I subscribe to the channel
