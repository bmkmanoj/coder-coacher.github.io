for dev tips I'm so excited that you
click the play button on this video last
week we did a video about CSS floats and
strangely enough I decided to put on
some headphones and use what's called a
speech jammer and it messed my awareness
up of what I was saying and it maybe
wasn't really funny maybe it was super
annoying it was entertaining for me at
least and so there you had a video about
it but in the process of making the
video I stumbled passed a few of the
main points that I wanted to make in the
video so today we're going to make a
video that touches all of those points
we're going to talk about CSS floats and
some of the things to be aware of and
how to use them properly and I recommend
you still go watch that video because it
talks about in the context of grids and
I don't talk about that much in this
video at least I'm not sure because I
haven't done the video yet we're gonna
do that right now so let's just jump
right in right now we're looking at code
pin code pen is a place where you can
create little the column pens but it's
just HTML CSS and JavaScript and you see
the results right here on the right as
you code so what I've done is I've
created a few sections that can describe
the floats that we're working with here
so first of all I want to introduce you
to the idea of nothing being floated in
this case I haven't an image that's
inside of the paragraph here and it's
not being floated it's just chilling
inline and images are naturally inline
and so we notice that the the image just
kind of acts as if it was a character in
that string of text and just pushes the
characters a little over to the right
and makes room for itself it sits on the
baseline
but the the text doesn't float around it
or wrap around it as you might hope to
do to receive this no stylish float so
when you look right down below that we
can see that this image has been floated
left now right here I put a
class of float:left on the image and
then I have a corresponding CSS selector
a float:left and I just love it left and
I put a margin on it so the result of
floating an object left within a
paragraph is that the whole the whole
paragraph will wrap up around it let me
show you some pair okay you see the text
below it there how it just wraps down
below that's because the image isn't
there anymore and so this wrapping
effect is a result of floating it left
floating right is the exact same thing
just the other way so it floats right
image floats and wraps around it as you
might expect
now you can float to objects within a
paragraph and here's an example of that
now the interesting thing to point out
in this case is that the dev tips logo
or the depth tips avatar here is leading
the float and if I go to the markup I
see that the dev tips image is the front
for the first one and then this image of
my face is the second one and they're
both floating left the dev tips logo
goes left and then the face and then the
text floated around it and when they
float right you see the opposite is
happening but did put the logo or rather
the image that was named first that's
floated first and it comes first in the
market is leading the foot meaning it
floats right first and then the Travis
face and then the text is floating
around it
now these are floated right as you can
see by the class of float right here
just scroll down a little bit more and
we can see that if you don't put words
in the paragraph I inted the box so here
we have pink for the background of the
container this orange is the padding and
then I put red for the border student to
see all the elements of this container
and how it reacts to the image inside of
it if I have no text and no floats in
this container it just acts like you
might think it would the image is inside
of a box and nothing special is
happening I'm going to show you the
market for that no words no floats we
have a container in an image
that's pretty simple next I'm showing
you a float:left with no words now this
image is this it's the same markup is
right up here except for now I have a
float:left on the image now take a look
at what's happening to its container
when you're floating an image inside of
a parent container remember how the text
would just float up around it well the
same things that happen the same thing
happens to its parent container it just
collapses you see how it just floated
right up there so the image floats left
and the parent collapses if I had no
padding and no border the height of this
container element would be zero it would
basically not exist in terms of the
space that it takes up if you have a div
we know that a div being a display
element a display block element will
stretch all the way across the screen
and but if you float it look what
happens here I have as div and I floated
it left and I put the class of stuff on
there because because you know sub sub
does it just makes the font size there
and like grading so we can see what it
it is but what I want to show here is
that the floated element the size
collapses it's as small as it can be so
so when we float an image or sorry we
float a element like a div it will
naturally collapse as opposed to a block
element which is naturally a hundred
percent width of its parent so let's
talk about what happens when you have
many floats I put a clasp on here called
box wide let's see what box wine does
box why does a width of a hundred
percent that's the key there and now I
see them floating many objects and
notice that they're not stacking one to
the left of the other what they're doing
is the float is wrapping down when
there's no space available to the right
of an element if you're floating left
into the
you're floating right if there's no
space available the next floated object
will wrap down okay that's what these
blue boxes are doing they're just going
down below it looks as if they're just
block level elements but the truth is
they're floating left with a width
defined as 100% now this is an
interesting thing to note because when
you go into the next example here I'm
floating many objects and they they they
form a grid dot next line dot dot dot
next line
Daffy Duck Duck Duck and they're all
floated left but they line up and when
the when they've reached the end of the
parent watch what happens when I make
this box bigger see how they float right
up into the available space that there's
no available space they've the collapse
down now this is a technique that's
really important when you get into
responsive web design we can talk about
that when when the promised grid video
comes out next week the component of
floated objects is that you can clear
them so we have floats here to find and
then I also have the clear class and I'm
clearing for this last box here the last
box here has a div or a class of clear
on it now look at what happens every
time this area will not get taken up by
this box when you put an element but
when you put a declaration of CSS
declaration of clear it will start a new
line it will not float up and create
that connection right there and that's a
key to understand of how to really
control floats so when we see that we
what's the next exam an invisible non
floating clearing object what that means
is I stuck an extra div in here with a
class of clear and I didn't flip it to
the left or so so it does not have any
height and it's naturally from 100 cent
width but it's not floating left anymore
and that little div is creating that
clear which means that no more elements
will float up around this these floated
elements now look at the parent
element of the container of these
floated elements it wraps around the
container stretches to contain its
children when there's a clear right
before the end of that container okay
now this is ID used to do this a lot
back in the day when creating websites I
would create a new div and then I would
just style it right aligned equals I
would do that a lot and this little
element would be my little tool to clean
up my floats and that way like extra
content in the next section wouldn't
float up into these boxy area and get
all messy well there's been a really
smart bunch of people and one of the
most recent people to give this some
some brain activity as a guy named
Nicholas Gallagher in the open if his
eye would open up in line uh his website
says that we have this clear fix hat and
he he really really smartly uses the
pseudo classes of before and after to
add those into the box if you don't know
what a pseudo class is I'm not going to
cover today but it's if it's a really
cool and important thing you can do a
CSS and modern of the website design
where it can actually add an element an
invisible element to the Dom it's kind
of called the shadow Dom but anyhow this
element he sets to clear so we don't
have to add this extra weight to the
markup like I used to do and and even
this clearing object right here if you
can't get the elements to naturally
clear themselves this is an option to do
this clear fix so let me show you the
code for that
he says if I add a clear fixed class
then before and after I'll add the
content and make a display table and
then on the after one I'll clear bolt
which is the same as this so it's
clearing it's creating a
element after all the floated elements
and clearing it and the result is that
my my markup is really nice and clean
here I just have the container and then
all of my floated objects and then
there's there's an invisible guy being
created right here and that is what is
floating or sorry but that's what's
clearing this whole box of the whole
mess of floated objects okay that is all
I wanted to cover to clear your floats
when you're done with them it's kind of
like picking up your room after you make
a mess and I'm gonna leave this code pen
up my user name is Travis Nelson check
out this code pen for the examples that
I'm showing you today and see you next
week on dev tips thanks everybody for
