second episode in the series where we're
literally remaking my personal website
I've never done this before it was
really interesting to complete the first
episode and like review it and edit it
and like look at the changes in
assumptions that I went through as I was
just kind of going through the discovery
process I think the discovery process is
kind of the most important part of
designing right when you think of a
designer you probably think of somebody
who's good at making beautiful things or
making even usable things right but
that's actually not the case right the
difference between a good designer and a
great designer is and they think can
they think about the problem can they
identify the problem right can they
identify that which needs thinking about
it's so easy to to look at the you know
the cool thing of the day the new the
new trend or the new pattern or the new
framework or whatever and say yeah that
kind of fits what I'm trying to
accomplish with this project maybe it'll
work and kind of just go about trying to
muscle things in together but the
difference between somebody who's gonna
really make a great experience for his
or her users the difference between a
good designer and a great designer is
somebody who can think about the problem
think it through before the visual and
the UI and you know all of that work
even starts the designer has identified
like we did in our last video designer
has identified who is that the owner the
client the owner of the project
and they have identified who is the
audience of the project and having these
two identifications they can then
determine what is important to each of
those parties and then then after
through all that discovery bring what
they know and all their skills to bear
on finding a great solution that meets
both of those parties needs right so
that's kind of what I guess I didn't
plan on that when I was a review of last
week's episode and that's what we did
last week right we went through the
discovery process and we discovered a
lot about who I assumed would be the
audience from my own website and then
thinking them through and thinking out
loud I actually narrowed it down a lot
tighter and I think that that's gonna
that's gonna bear a lot of fruit as we
as we go along
ah in the last video we spent a lot of
time going through the discovery process
and we came out with what I think is a
pretty solid content strategy right
those values those things that I feel
that I can offer people on this website
now we want to focus on giving that
content a home and we're going to start
by doing wireframes now I usually do
wireframes with just you know a good
old-fashioned pen and a notebook but I
generally tend to stay away from digital
wireframes entirely I have a really
strong distaste for them but maybe
that's just me the purpose of my
wireframes are to give myself a good
direction for the experience that my
visitors will have when they're visiting
my website now because I'm in charge of
the copywriting and the visual design I
can take all these three elements write
the content the UI the visual design and
build them up all together in tandem
because I I really feel that they start
to inform each other as you go and I
think that's a big benefit that we have
in your project if you're not
responsible for everything you may not
want to do it this way I know some
agency trained people who really prefer
to have all the content buttoned up
before they even start designing but I
have the luxury of flexibility because
I'm doing
all myself so I got my notebook and I
got a pen I got my brain let's hammer
out a few ideas okay before we start
wire framing we want to keep in mind the
features that we outline in our last
video that we wanted on the home page so
I'm going to write them down here on the
left side so I make sure that I don't
leave out any one of those parts so we
had the about excuse my handwriting we
have YouTube
we have mentoring we have the articles
we have a vine and design then notes and
that's the newsletter and after that
podcast and then finally a way to
contact now the design that we're going
to be wire framing here if to
accommodate these content sections or
content types
or at least links to different pages on
the website depending on how we want to
architect the design where these this
content can be accessed right so that's
very very important to keep in mind now
I'm going to start wire framing on the
right side now you'll notice that my
notebook is really small it's just a
little small guy right here and I'm not
using a big fat heavy marker some people
like to use those fat markers and you
know whole sheets of paper and make
really big wireframes but personally
this is just me you know you guys can do
whatever you like but I feel more
comfortable making these small little
thumbnail drawings and and I like them
because you don't have to focus on
details you just make a lot of quick
ones what I'm thinking about right now
is I'm looking at all these different
content we have one two three four five
six seven eight nine we have nine
different content types
and I'm certain that I want this to work
on mobile as well so I'll just start
right there usually when I'm doing a web
layout I'll just draw a three parts
a rectangle and I used to draw I've
explained this before I used to draw the
bottom rectangle but I don't do that
anymore and the reason is the websites
you know websites that we design these
days are infinitely long right so I'm
going to run I'm going to need more
lengths at if like you know like if I
only get to like a about YouTube
articles and vine and you have to draw
more boxes and I've crossed them out
anyway
so the three sided rectangle here I'm
just going to start at the top I want to
have like my logo here actually my logo
is a little box but either way and then
you know it might be interesting just to
have like a really really simple just a
two-column grid but these are like these
boxes that have a simple label on them
maybe there are different colors and
then when you when you roll over them
maybe they do something interesting
using different types of animations and
reveal different content underneath you
know like maybe it's a in the case of
the articles it would be like a few
articles and then like a c-more button
or something in the case of the design
it'd be a few thumbnails whatever just
moving along the next one uh how about
we take let's do the same three
rectangle a three sided rectangle and
we'll throw a logo up in the corner and
we'll have a menu that's a you know with
the hamburger style and this would be
interesting actually if we did like a
full header video because I happen to
know a little tiny bit about video
production that's a skill that I've
gained in this past year and then I
could still do this kind of like grid
but it would be also an interesting idea
if we could mix it up a little bit more
and kind of do it asymmetrically so
maybe this is the about maybe this is
the YouTube
maybe this is mentoring you know I mean
you just kind of carry that on but the
idea is like there's like either an
autoplay video behind here or like just
like a ghosted image with a big play
button and then it can be like hey
what's up bro don't try this do you even
Jade you know let's keep going
I really like this idea of a big video
so let's do another three sided
rectangle and I like that big video but
instead of doing this this like really
slab heavy boxes we could architect the
design of the content down here to be a
little bit more conventional right like
maybe like you would see at a at an
agency right where they'd have like the
three here oh right
this is about and there's like a text
box there and then if I'm in to actually
have something interesting going on
where this and that and that and that
these ones here are all about teaching
and that one is about the work that I do
professionally it's kind of like an
introduction and that's an action or CTA
so what about if it was like about me
and then teaching and then like those
different ones here like links to
different pages or something and then
and then design and that's like maybe
like a grid or you know something like a
gallery type of thing and then a big
contact button or something maybe a form
that's kind of cool
hmm all right let's go a little bit more
avant-garde and we'll say big huge block
so it's like really heavy set text right
at the top and maybe it's going to be
like this huge content area which could
be images it could be like copywriting
but then we're going to have a
navigation off to the left of that
that's pretty understated and simple but
the understated and simple simple nature
of it
contrast it against this big heavy block
here will kind of really help it to
stand out and it'll be like when you
click on it the content inside that
could rotate inch and switch out for
something I don't know
well let's keep moving that's
interesting all right another three
corner rectangle I love those three
corner rectangles here's a really
interesting idea what if it was like a
big splash splash image and then we had
these kind of angles coming down but out
of the angles was okay and there's a
logo and then the splash splash image is
behind it it's kind of like ghosted or
tinted but then out of the angle maybe
like shooting at an interesting
direction are like navigational items
and then they're in this like little
crease
hmm maybe they could slide around oh
maybe they're actually and you like
hover over them and I slide out but but
the but they would reveal like in this
bottom part could go move in and out and
it would like here's the title of the
section so it would be like YouTube but
it would be got cut off here you know
like this kind of move me has a heavier
shadow or something like that and here's
some content and then like a CTA here a
CTA this is a call to action that's what
CTA means a call to action is always
going to be the most important thing on
the page a call to action is going to be
a button it's going to be a submit form
it's going to be a Buy Now it's going to
be a contact me it's going to be that
call that you give to people to perform
an action it every time you design a
webpage you want them to do something
with it right if you if you design a
webpage that they just visit and look at
and then leave well you've lost the game
that's it that's that's a failure
so making space for these call to
actions is pretty important and I know
that I didn't do that over here but
actually I did wreck right here would be
a call to action within their contact is
a call to action each of these would be
a call to action to change out the
section and then like in each section
would be like you know depending on the
content of it but anyway I just wanted
to point that out just thought about it
right now call to action let's try
another one
let's go back to right now we have this
sidebar and a logo at the top and right
now we have caught a navigation down
here in this strip but what if like each
of these big areas was like partially
ABS obstructed text
like you know like about and it's like
halfway covered you tube and and so
forth and so on all right let's try
another one
um wonder if I'm zoomed in enough is
that better
zoomed out too much the other ones maybe
okay um what if okay okay what if we
took this kind of like narrative of
these different things that I'm offering
and kind of like put them in like a time
line if you will like make like like a
sequential kind of situation where we're
starting
we have my logo here and then we're
going down and you know that's the about
and then this is like the YouTube and I
could have like a youtube logo in there
and then down here is on a mentoring and
I'm like when you when you hover over
whatever it is you know have like a
really like a an interesting you know
hover state you would grow or like some
kind of decoration would happen and then
and then when you let's cut the page
right here sometimes you can just do
this and it will this cutting here
signifies that you know it's either in a
different state of the same page or it's
further down the page or whatever but
let's say you've clicked on it so it's
in a different state now this this
timeline that we're designing could like
like slide over right so now it's coming
from the side right here and you know
whatever is in it and it's like
made a box like a flag unfurled you know
like floated down like this and let's
see what's in these things you know
these were visited to sign up for the
newsletter so these are the notes and
explaining more about the notes here and
then here's the next section and then on
and then if you click it again they
would move back into the center or
whatever I don't know what you guys
think about that I'm just asking a
camera anyway um that's cool I like the
idea of you know taking the time instead
of being like here hit you in the face
with a bunch of options or here's like a
bunch of whare this is interesting and
it's different from those in the way
that it kind of steps you through the
process of understanding goes like you
know we've stated that the goals are for
me as the client to be able to convey
what I do and what I do right now and
what I'm trying to develop my personal
brand to be is that of somebody who
offers help
I want the Travis brand to be somebody
that can you know either through dev
tips teach you how to design and build
websites through my mentoring give you
like career guidance and advice or or
through the notes you know like a
weekend weekly bit of inspiration or
thoughts or anything like that so so so
I like this idea of like stepping you
through the process of what of what the
Travis brain idea is I like that let's
work with that a little bit um I just
had a good idea right now
the website kind of looks like like this
and then it has this line down the side
here is in the logo it's a TN it's got
like a slogan here and then in the
middle of the page is this navigation
right currently it's like articles notes
design or work and then like there's a
contact at the bottom what if I kind of
kept this box I've always kind of liked
that bar and also I like the idea of not
having to redesign the whole brand but
just kind of realign it to a new way of
thinking and I could take you know in
the same way that I'm stepping through a
story here I could step them through
like a literal story of I'm just
thinking about that but like a literal
story of what the Travis brand is so for
example I could be like hey I'm Travis
what's up here's my face and and then
like I also do YouTube here's a YouTube
video and talk about YouTube and like
maybe there's this arrow going from one
section to the next kind of just like
stepping you through and this is a
continuous sentence you know like
favorite like leaving off trailing off
sentences the next one is YouTube and
then a mentoring okay so like mentoring
let me just draw I know this is going to
be a long one
okay so the next one is like mentoring
so to be like a telephone I don't know
oh how about like faces of people that
are saying you know I like testimonials
because I've been getting testimonials
from people that I've mentored and stuff
and you know like eating those CTA is
right so like watch watch dev tips and
then like this could be like you know
set up a call CTA and then that's cool
and then after that what is it the
articles mentoring articles vine
articles articles could be interesting
too right now I have that kind of like a
what's it called a masonry jQuery
masonry kind of grid but you know what
if I just like had the description of
the articles and then like the see more
CTA and then it was like here's the like
most recent three right and then they've
got images here and if you hover over
them they do some type of action and you
can see like the title of it or
something I don't know and then you got
the arrow huh
the arrow here point to the next section
which is vine so I can just the vine is
easy you put a vine right there right
they have their embeds you know I can do
vines and you're still talking yeah that
mixed up and what what else is there
this is fun I think this is good a vine
design and then noticed and podcast
design is easy right like I just want to
kind of showcase that cuz I don't even
keep my design on my website I keep all
my design work on dribble and Behance so
I'll just put like drib
and be Hance just like a grid basically
right just like it's a gallery and I
want to cut off the page right here and
start it right here
okay so I've cut off the page and it's
starting again up here isn't this
awesome with with sketching you just go
so fast they could have just really
developed this really good idea and each
of these things gets its own unique
layout really quickly see vine is cool
dribble behance what's next
is it notes mmm notes and podcast so
notes is going to be simple I mean
that's going to be just a sign-up form
right so name email signup form and then
maybe like some explanation of what the
notes are for and that's the CTA right
there and then was that podcast maybe
it's got a picture of me and Laos and
like our heads are cut out like like
cartoon like a itchy and scratchy it
looks like little sunflowers but anyway
and it's like listen to Travon lows late
nights at rive and lows and then a like
maybe like somebody wrote a review about
it I don't know okay and then the last
thing is just contact right oh yeah okay
contact I don't want to have a forum on
my website I think I'm just kind of
getting past that stuff I just want to
have my email just a really big link the
huge chunky email link
I think this one has a lot of meat in it
I think there's a lot that can be done
with a with this idea and I like I
really like the way that the narrative
is is basically a sentence right so like
on my current website my about page says
something like Travis is trying to grow
up and then and then and then I could be
like Travis is trying to grow up but he
makes YouTube videos instead and does
phone calls with people and designs
things and like kind of that's how I
could use that that idea of a sequence a
sequential narrative to take people
through this is pretty cool I'm excited
maybe I'm like saying things over and
over again but this sounds pretty great
to me and you guys can't see my face you
can just see my finger so this is like a
happy dance ah all right well welcome to
the rest of the garage but um I mean
there we have it with just like you know
20 minutes in a notebook and a pen and
just a few thoughts you can quickly
generate a few ideas and some of them
are pretty good and I think that I'm
going to I'm going to go into Photoshop
using this last one as my starting point
and even in Photoshop um next week
you'll notice that I'm not going to be
just like following this weird wireframe
that I made in three seconds but I'm
going to be like using it as a guide to
work through ideas so the designing is
not done the the concept is not done
it's just refined right so it's kind of
like making a sculpture you have this
big block of unn it's just focused
if you guys are seeing like the grills
part of the studio anyway you have this
it's it's like making a sculpture you
have this big block of unrefined granite
right and as the ideas become more and
more clear to you you're chipping away
first big chunks of bad ideas right is
this like the last video we discovered
is this website supposed to be for
promoters is it supposed to be for
potential employers I thought it was but
we just chipped away those bad ideas and
large chunks are falling off of this
statue and the sculpture and and you
know I'm using these other wireframes to
to chip away other bad ideas and these
are smaller more nuanced bad ideas and
they're falling down and you know and
even this this right here the one that I
like the most it's probably a bad idea
and as I go into Photoshop more of those
details will begin to crumble away or
sorry more the bad ideas will begin to
crumble away and reveal more of the of
the good details and even then it won't
be finished because even as we move into
doing you know coding and in publishing
it still won't be done it I think that's
the beautiful thing about design is that
it doesn't need to be done it doesn't
need to be complete it just needs to be
better and better each time and that's
like this iterative kind of process of
design that I really enjoy so anyway
next week we are going to take this
design and breathe life into it bring
bring color and context into it by using
visual design I'm going to take you
through step by step and how I use
Photoshop to design I'm not going to
rush through it like like the last
series I did what I just did like a
sound montage or something like a speed
speed design like it's probably going to
be a long video maybe a few hours long
video I don't I don't know
depending on how fast I can make
something workable out of this but I
want to show you guys the keystrokes
that are involved I want to take you
through a few of the weird you know
tricks that I know or how I resize
images like all the shortcuts everything
I really don't want to skip on that
because that's been one of the most
requested things in the comments for a
very long time Travis can you show us
how to use Photoshop or how you use it
to do your designs or something like
that so anyway I had a really blast I
had a really wet I had a really fun time
you can't I'm babbling if you can't tell
how excited I am about this new design
I've been holding off on you know doing
this kind of exercise work until we can
record it even though I've wanted been
wanting to do redo my website for a
while and so that's why I'm so excited
right now like this is this is happening
it's we're doing and so next week and
then do Photoshop and going to make
something beautiful out of this as weird
black and white sketch that we just did
