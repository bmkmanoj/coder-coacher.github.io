called parallax on the web parallax on
the web in the first part of this series
we looked at 20 different examples of
parallax existing out there on the net
right now and you in the comments you
guys link to like 100 more it was really
insane so much good stuff if you haven't
gone and checked out that video check it
out but make sure you read the comments
are so much good stuff there since then
in every video we've been recreating
different types of parallax on this
theme here it's a clothing store called
Black Bird you can get the code for this
project broken down by video on github
right now so far we've done the header
here and these images which float in and
land on the layout we've also done this
thing called periscope which I love and
today we're going to look back at these
thumbnails here and add some parallaxing
hover events what we're going to do is
when you hover over the thumbnail we're
going to animate in from the left a
product label and it's price point at
the same time we're going to zoom in the
thumbnail image itself two things going
on at once different directions
lots of action kind of like a Michael
Bay film alright that's it let's dive in
shall we
the first thing we got to do is go into
our markup and find all of these figures
and we're going to add an element right
onto the image called
fig cap teal fig caption for this first
one I'll just call it a black bird
that's my brand name black bird sweater
you know and I'll say it cost $135 and
let's make that in a strong tag so I
take this figcaption and I want to
duplicate this for every one of these
other elements here except for you know
number three is going to be a black bird
jacket and number two is going to be the
trousers alright so let's go do it again
I'm going to move these guys around a
little bit so we can make our grid look
a little bit nicer okay this look good
it's kind of nice to have these these
labels right under it it looks fine how
that is that's cool clothing store
clothing pigs let's put some space under
clothing pigs mmm
margin bottom 100 pixels there we go
okay so what I want to do is hmm figure
is relative and is showing okay so let's
go to the fig caption fig caption and
make its position absolute and we'll
make it go to the bottom zero pixels the
pixels and left zero pixels and I want
to put it in a box so let's say back
ground black and color of the text is
going to be white and if that's true if
we're going to put it in a box we need
some padding on that box so we'll say
two pixels and like eight pixels oh
we're good good the font size needs to
go down because it needs to be like like
an elegant brand so make some tiny fonts
font size let's say 11 pixels
yep that's right okay um in the figure
the figure image seat you see that
little space right here let me show you
what I'm what's bothering me
here's the image and then here's the the
figure the image is actually smaller
than the figure and the reason for that
is because images are inline elements so
I want to make this one display:block
make the image a display block and it
should fill out a little bit better yeah
now now that the figure is you know
flesh with the size of the image that's
making this size of the figure okay so
hmm do to do let's move
the let's move it up from the bottom
about 10 pixels that's cool um okay so
that's going to be when what I want to
say what I want to say I don't say I
want to say when we when figure is
hovered over that's what we want to say
and however what's going to happen
figure hover we want to take that fig
caption and say left 0% and then we want
to go down to here on the left and make
it actually 100% left negative 100%
yeah let's put an animation on that or a
transition transition all make it zero
point three seconds ease in out okay and
then we'll take a what do we want to do
the figure needs to be these things are
all like sliding outside of their boxes
the figure needs to lock everything down
it needs to be over flow hidden okay and
now when you hover over it the price
will come in and the name will come in
that's cool that's cool but let's zoom
the image up to like we wanted so image
display:block the image is going to be a
let's say trans form scale one point do
you want to zoom in or zoom out what is
zoom in all right so it'll be it would
be like one transform scale one and we
want to translate over image we want to
do that one point two and we want to put
that same transition on it so that it
will not just snap to scale one point it
will it'll ease into it
all right let's test it out oh yeah now
I have a zooming and but kind of I like
that but one thing you have to do more
with figure is put a cursor:pointer
and that will give it a little finger to
make it look like it's a link even
though it's not a link but we could
easily make it a link if we changed what
if we changed figure 2 to an anchor or
you can just wrap to an anchor around it
which I kind of don't like but yeah so
this is cool this is what I wanted to
show you we have three three different
methods of parallax they have this first
the header which is obviously like the
most strict sense of parallax we have
these these gentlemen here which which
land on the page as we scroll down and
then we have this periscope which I just
try my favorite it's so simple it's like
the easiest one out of all these things
but is like I think it's the coolest I
am so cool on and then what else we got
oh yeah when we hover over these guys we
have what I called hover hover we call
them thumbnailing maybe he's ooming in
too much one point - let's make it one
point one
I like it what you guys you guys think
yelling illegally I like it yeah I like
it like it
in the next video we're gonna return to
that periscope element I made and make
it even cooler I'm so excited to share
with you subscribe to the channel if you
want to be notified when the next videos
come out and of course this video would
not have been possible without the love
