Mackenzie child and this is episode 5 of
5 the final episode in the dev tips Ruby
on Rails from the ground up series ah
last week we built our rails application
and this week we are going to take that
code and deploy it live on the web using
a hosting service called Heroku if you
haven't already gone through and built
the rails application from last week
just a pause this video go back do that
and then meet me back here and we will
go through step-by-step on how to get
our application live on the web so let's
jump in alright guys so now we are going
to begin the process of taking the
application we built in the previous
video and deploying that to a hosting
service called Heroku there's a few
steps we need to go through first of
which is getting our application under
version control and up on a site called
github if you aren't too familiar with
git or github I've created a video on my
site called get started with git and
github I just go to Mackenzie child dot
me and search in the videos for getting
started or get started with git and
github and this covers the basics of
what you'll need to get started using
version control so first thing I'm going
to do is back in the terminal I'm gonna
run git init to initialize a git
repository and then if I do a git status
you can see all of these files from our
application are currently untracked so
I'm going to do a git add dot to add
everything do another get status you can
see all the files have been added
alright so I'm gonna do a git commit -
am and I'm gonna say initial commit
alright so now we have made our first
commit next thing we want to do is go to
github and I'm gonna go to my personal
profile and then I'm gonna click
repositories and create a new repo so
I'm gonna call this a dev tips blog
whoops that seems to be taken already
say I'll do MC
tips blog how about that all right
cool so I'm gonna create a repository so
the next thing I need to do since we're
pushing an existing repository is just
copy this line get remote pad and then
the path to get let's paste that in the
terminal hit enter and then if we go
back we need to do a git push - you or
gin master get pushed - you origin
master all right so that pushes up
everything from our application now if
we go to that so wheat our app is now
under version control and up on github
so we are going to be pushing this up to
a site or a hosting service called
Heroku Heroku is fantastic it's free to
sign up free to get an application live
a basic app but they make it super duper
simple to scale your app as it grows if
you have yet to create account I just
click sign up for free go through the
process of creating account then the
next thing you want to do is go to tool
belt
Heroku comm what this is is it's gonna
allow you to manage your account from
the command line so based on what
operating system you're using I'm using
Mac OSX and it detects that by default
so I'm going to download the tool belt
and let's go through and install this so
hit continue install then enter your
password alright so that was installed
let's make sure everything works
correctly so so as once installed you
have access to the Heroku command line
from your command shell I heat the
terminal login using your email address
and password you used when creating your
Heroku
so it says use a Heroku login so if I go
ahead and do Heroku login it's it
installing some plugins needed for the
CLI enter your credentials so I'm going
to enter my password or in my email and
then my password alright so it has
logged me in perfect
so from here let me and I quickly close
out of that back in the terminal let's
do a command called Heroku create and
this is going to create the Heroku
application and then what we need to do
from here is we're gonna run a command
called git push Heroku master and what
this is doing is it's taking our
application from github and pushing it
to Heroku based on the master branch and
get so let's that run that command ok so
if you are following along and rein that
command you did get in there I did go
ahead and do that on purpose just to
show you how to fix this so the air is
because locally we have gem installed
sqlite3 Heroku does not play nicely with
sqlite3
it needs a few gems in order to work
properly so if we jump back into our
sublime and open up the gem file there's
a few things we need to do to get this
working correctly so right here the gem
sqlite3 that we're using for our
database let's copy that and remove the
comment as well then down at the bottom
we need to add that to a development
group so we'll do development do and
then add that and then we need another
group specifically for production and
then inside of here we need two gems the
PG gem or the PostgreSQL and the gem
rails underscore 12 factor that Heroku
uses so basically what this is doing is
we are going to be using the SQLite
three database locally and then the PG
gem and rails 12 factor on Heroku so if
I say that this is not in our
application just yet we
in command called bundle so that it will
install those gems on our app but if you
only do bundle you may get air so let's
throw - - without production so this is
going to install everything locally -
the PG gem and the rails 12 factor gem
so hit that command it's going to go out
and install all the new stuff on your
system and let's do it get status you
can see we modified the gem file in the
gem file lock so I'm going to do a git
commit - am and I'm gonna say added PG
and rails 12 factor gems for Heroku get
status whoops get status
alright let's push that up get push
origin master get push origin master if
I could spell correctly there we go
alright so now we should be good to go
if I push up this to Heroku again by
doing git push Heroku master it's gonna
pull what's on github and deploy it to
Heroku so this time we should not get
that error okay so I believe everything
worked correctly you can see right here
it deployed to cryptic deaths sans - 2 6
3 7 0 Capcom Heroku automatically
creates a random URL for you but you
also have the option to add a custom
domain as well so let's copy this and
view our application so you see we're
sorry something went wrong we can view
what went wrong by running the command
Heroku logs so what is happening here is
we try to view our application but the
post table that we created locally
doesn't exist yet on Heroku you have to
think of local and Heroku is two
different things so what we want to do
here is do Heroku run rake DB : migrate
and what that's going to do is it's
going to run our make raishin files and
create the table database and that error
should go away all right so it created
the post table so if I go back and
refresh beautiful so let's test it out
create a new post my first post on
Heroku great post beautiful so
everything is working correctly I mean
you see if I can edit this just say like
hello world update awesome everything
appears to be working correctly so we
have created a simple yet functional
rails application and we have deployed
it so it's live on the Internet anyone
that you shared this link with can
access your new application all right
