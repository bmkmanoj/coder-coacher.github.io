get up just kidding you're not going to
get a punch on the face you're going to
get you get like some coding video in
your face ah today's video we're going
to go back into CSS animation so we've
been doing for the past few weeks and
today I want to show you how CSS
animations can help us step the user
through a user flow and help them to
anticipate what should be coming next
for them and how things are related to
each other you'll see what I mean about
that and also I want to show how we can
use addition and subtraction of classes
to add and take away animations and
we're going to start this tutorial off
in code pen of course like we've been
doing for the past few weeks and I did
as much as I could to set this project
up Saluki go through it as fast as
possible because I don't want to waste
your guy's time but let me just walk you
through where we're at right now and
then I'll go through and show you how I
plan on animating this project so what
we have here is a three paneled kind of
form if you think about it like a three
step form and here on the right is the
rendering of the code and we have these
three cards for step one which is the
name and email step two would be the you
know the answer to the question would
you rather and then step three is kind
of like a confirmation and we're done so
there's three steps to this form and we
have a what's it called a pagination up
at the top here so let me walk you
through the mark-up for that so of
course we're using Jade because Jade is
great and the header here is just this
bar here which is right here oh you have
three spins is for one of each of these
dots and if it has a class is active
that means it's orange now these next
three one two three step panels I call
them bodies modal bodies they are
wrapped in a class called modal bodies
and each of them is called a modal body
and then subsequently they have modal
body step one and lower body step two is
showing is a class that I'll use to
control which one is visible at any
given
moment and then I have the content for
the for those modal bodies so basically
there's three modal bodies inside of a
class called modal bodies and then we
have a text center rerun button here to
rerun the the flow once it's done so we
can like see the animation happening
over and over again so that's the HTML
and this is the current output of the
HTML and styles as we have it over here
in the sass and we just have a whole lot
of you know visual stuff and styles were
buttons and forms and things nothing is
too too critical to our animations that
we're going to be doing until I get down
to modal body so one of the things I'm
going to do is I'm going to take the put
the position and I say absolute so now
they're all in the same place right see
step three is right on step up top of
step two which is right on top of step
one and they're all anchored to the very
top right here and now I'm going to take
them all and put display:none on all of
them and then I'll again reference that
is showing class to say display block so
that's how I'm going to have only one
showing at a time by using the display
property to control it and that's kind
of the end of the sass as we have it
written here I also have some like for
not really great JavaScript written but
it's doing a few things we're looking
for a click of a button and then when
that happens we're going to grab a few
variables and then I don't need a
console.log anymore and then we're going
to send those variables on to a function
one of two functions depending on what
number of step it is so what it
basically means is if it's on step one
and you click it it's going to remove
the is showing class and put it on the
next one and it'll do that twice and if
it's on the third one that's kind of a
little bit different it'll take that is
showing and remove it and put
the first one actually it won't do that
I wanted it to animate the whole thing
away and then have that rerun button
come back there's a few things to notice
even further than just the manipulating
the is showing class let me bust open
this inspector to show you exactly what
I mean so if I highlight this slide here
you can see all the three slides right
one two and three
actually let's get it let's get it on
step one refresh get that back on step
one slide one okay so take take peculiar
note can I bump up the okay yeah I can
make these bigger alright so take note
of what's going on here because it's
more than just the one class is showing
so we have modal body modal body step
one two and three and then the class is
showing now I'm going to be moving the
class is showing but amidst all of the
moving of that single class I'm also
doing a few other things I'm adding a
class animate out to step one as I want
the animation to trigger to move it out
of the way and then I'm going to switch
the is show in class to modal body step
two and then add an animate in class for
a certain time and then remove the ni in
class so let me click this start button
right here and pay attention right here
to this these classes there's going to
be a lot of dancing around already just
see that do it again and you'll notice
the difference between step two and step
three we have this two classes animate
in and animate out happening relatively
quickly and again you saw what's
happening up here it's nothing too
surprising we just have the element the
panel or the steps here the removing
themselves and the next one coming in so
there's a brief time in between them and
we can use that time to perform
animations
right so the idea that I'm trying to
show here and I want to get it synced in
is that we're adding classes animate out
and we're setting a timer and then we're
removing the anime out and is showing
and adding animate in to the next one
and this is this is pretty important
because remember we did a few animations
previously and if you don't I mean the
animate property in CSS will trigger
when a new element is unhidden wind
display:none is removed from that
element and it's visible then the
animation will start triggering but if
you make something display:none
immediately no animation will trigger
even if like you wanted one so you have
to put the anime out class in there it's
pretty important and we'll see that in
just a few seconds so we'll see what we
can do with the animate out class I
think what we can do is say well we want
to put an animation on it right so let's
just write our animation and our
animation we'll just name it out easy
and we'll make it last 300 seconds it's
300 milliseconds by default but we can
adjust that in a few seconds and we'll
do ease in out good old standby and we
don't want any delay on it but we do
want to say four words because we want
the ending of the animation to stop on
the last frame instead of resetting okay
so that's good that's harder animation
out
let's do actually you know all these
kind of I have three of them I have
anime out anime in and animate up in
that's easy and animate up that'll be
easy right so I just need to make three
sets of keyframes now
at keyframe
what are we doing this Oh to name it
look this is going to be out okay so
when something animates out let's do a
transform I wanted to translate it
translate why and I just kind of like
wanted to drop right to true keyframes
I'd forgot how to do keyframes for a
second so we get started 0%
I'm going to go to 100% so the ending of
phase of this translate is going to be
like I want it to go
you know like 800 pixels down from the
top and this actually has to be indented
and then we're going to start at
transforming from zero so the animation
is going to go don't move any pixels to
move it 800 pixels down I'm going to
animate it damn let's just see what that
looks like right now there we go
see that was easy and the second one
comes in let's quickly do an animate in
here because we already know how that
set up very similar to keyframes out but
they're going to be in so zero percent
transform how about a little bit
different let's flip it in from the top
similar to we how we did those drop
downs was a little bit different
we'll say rotate X I always give these
two mixed up rotate X 90 degrees and
we want it to end with zero degrees so
that's in which correlates to the anime
in class which is temporarily put on
step 2 when it animates in so this is
going to drop down and this next one
should ding it - what happened all right
now I'm just getting mad I can't see it
I don't know what it is
wait I think I know what it is yep ok ha
ha ha that took so long
ok so here's why here's why that didn't
work for so long is because I was not
adding the is showing class until after
I removed anime in is showing class is
the class that makes it display:block
right anime in it wasn't displaying
block when the whole animation was going
and by the time I wanted to remove
animation in I remove it and then add
the display block right it needs to have
a display block to even show so I added
display block to anime in I probably
should actually do some work on this
JavaScript to make it more compliant but
this is a quick quick fix that I'm happy
with right now okay so I had this idea
of doing these rotates these 3d rotates
let's see how they look ooh that's
interesting but I also want anime in to
be what was it transform margin
the reason is a transform origin
top-left because I didn't like it
spinning in the center I want to feel
like it's flipping down from that head
so like this ok that's coming from the
front what if we do negative 90 there
you go so it's like a calendar dropping
off and flipping out dropping off
flipping out what if we did oh and by
the way for rotate X to work you have to
go to the thing it's on which is modal
body and then go to the parent of that
and say perspective a thousand pixels
that's how you get it to actually look
like it's rotating in 3d space otherwise
it's going to not it's going to be very
flat otherwise
so let's look back at the enemy out I
think the enemy out can be a little bit
better let's do let's do a rotate thirty
degrees
no that's where are you starting huh so
let's end it copy let's end it if 30
degrees and then start with zero degrees
and let's take that transform origin and
put it also on out so it has a so it has
a M actually we just put on the body the
transform not transform body mobile body
so I'll put that here so that it'll
apply to all of those states ok so you
see how when it falls it kind of tilts a
little bit that's pretty cool but we can
make it do a little bit more dramatic
tilting like it's being ripped off or
like chopped off so let's let's do this
take it to
thirty percent maybe and still we are
going to leave it at translate zero so
we don't want it to fall off yet but
let's rotate it to 50 so it's going over
exaggerating see how that goes so it
should like hinge down there we go
oh that was cool it a little fast
so let's take that animation and slow it
down to 600 all right that'll do it and
for this last one enemy up this one
actually doesn't happen to the body let
me show you open the inspector here
inspect this guy okay so here's the
modal wrap this is the one that gets it
so this animation happens to the the
modal body but this last one get gets it
to the modal wrap to animate up somewhat
the whole thing to just move out of the
way a little bit and so what we'll do is
instead of doing animate why don't we do
something like trans form translate y-
500 pixels or something so it'll just
jump up that way and rerun happens and
we remove the anim up when we click
rerun so it comes back down we get a
start again but when it comes down we're
in step 1 so that's how we kind of have
that we can move translate and rotate
rotate is so much fun 30 degrees
okay so that's it that's the whole
animation I wanted to show you guys how
to use animation property to animate
things in and out and that's going to
come down to a lot of Jay s look at
these lines here and notice especially
in step the function called step two or
step one right here okay this one
functions step one
notice how I'm using timers to say
remove class and add class animate in
and enemy out so it's all like it's like
a thing you have to be careful with when
you're animating like transitioning like
the last one you can just say transition
out and transition in and that works but
you can't make things display:none with
transition but you can transition
opacity and stuff like that so that's
fine but to animate in and out you have
to use class switching and some kind of
like you know fiddly bits JavaScript so
take a look at this JavaScript here if
you're interested in how I did that take
a look at the sass and take a look at
the Jade as well and you know what you
could do if you wanted to as a challenge
you could take these these steps here
and go into the CSS go to the anime in
and out and just like re redefine these
keyframes and make make some funky
animations on your own and see what kind
of fun stuff you can do and then link
those down in the comments down below
that'll be fun I love checking out you
guys's Forks on my code pin it's always
great thanks for watching this video I
hope you enjoyed it leave a comment down
below with your you know Forks of the
code that we did today I want to thank
the patrons for always supporting the
channel stop on by at patreon.com slash
dev tips to learn more about that
patrons enjoy dev tips chat early videos
weekly hangout so a community hangouts
and other things like that so be sure to
check that
over there and man I'm just so glad to
be back this is exciting we'll see you
next week on next Monday so keep on
hacking so limp
let me through okay cool so let me walk
you through the markup for that it needs
to flip in animate in ah why would this
be bad rotate X and do I spell it wrong
somewhere hmm we do like a different
kind of transition and see if that is
working and then I'll know that the
names are all connected but not put some
for reason that the transform is working
wrong so this this should animate over
300 milliseconds let's see nope that's
not even connecting something's wrong
I'm sure you guys can see it at home
right now you guys are like dude why are
you being so dumb Travis I can see it
you're like shouting at me I can't see
it right now you're bad indenting
somewhere I'm not getting any errors all
right now I'm just getting mad I can't
see it I don't know what it is hmm
wait I think I know what it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
