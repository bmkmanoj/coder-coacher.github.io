application to the Internet you're
watching dev tips with guest hosts and
PJ and David
we wanted to do this using Heroku yeah
we said that because Heroku is this
thingamabob service to put all kinds of
applications on the Internet it's nice
because it's very easy to use kind of
it's free if you have a very small
application which is very nice when
you're doing this kinds of projects
where you just want to throw something
up you have to create an account at
Heroku I think yeah authenticated with
her github account but yeah maybe yeah
it's possible that you can sign out in
with your github account but either way
yes great on Heroku account somehow and
then you will end up with something like
this but much much smaller I don't I
think we can do this using the command
line so we just have to have a hero Pia
yeah exactly I don't think that we will
ever need to view this to be honest
there we go first option this one now I
don't know the first actual option
download and install yes oh you can do
it with homebrew let's not assume that
people have homebrew yeah so we just use
the Mac OS installer yeah oh yeah we
have assumed that you have a Mac if you
don't have a Mac it's very easy you just
take the computer that you have you
throw that away jump to the terminal
just right here okuu and see if that
does something it does links it does
thanks just to make one thing clear
probably you had it before right because
we hadn't you haven't signed end or
anything
no that's just working magically no I
had it before yeah okay so probably we
have to sign in through your account
details and stuff that's true now we
need to figure out how to deploy this
normally this can be a little bit of
fiddling involved with this but there
happens to be a Heroku build pack for
things that are created using create
react app the specific build pack
reactors create react app
someone made something here's the build
pack one thing with development is that
it's a lot of googling I like a lot so
and you google things and you basically
try to figure things out so this is not
something that we know about before I
just peripherally knew about the concept
of that Heroku has sort of this thing
called Bill packs we just search for
that
so let's hit quick start and sure
requirements are met what our
requirements hope your command line
tools this is the terminal a free
account we have that we have yet we have
node we have create react app and we
have done that okay we've done
everything create react app F name we've
done that we entered the directory we
have initialized get with this we
haven't made write create the app yeah
this get in it by the way that is stuff
that if you use a command line forget
you yeah you that's command line stuff
but we don't use the client line we use
to get win desktop application okay so
let's just hit the terminal oh okay
around that okay yes quickly create a
torii I go up there okay we'll create
another screw it was a better place that
has to be taken though no it hasn't
oh it wasn't okay again next step get
add the files and commit so basically
this says that this command created some
files and now we want to add those to it
it is created some files it created the
Heroku app instance remotely mm-hmm okay
so what is so we this is just because of
the init actually this is they're mixing
two things together here we don't they
are I
creating a git repository and adding
files to it and things we already have a
git repository where things added here
yeah so I think we could possibly just
do that one get sushi Roku master so
this means that we're pushing it the
master branch to another remote that is
not github precisely it is he wrote
there Heroku server yeah and this
command set up everything that is yeah
exactly it's it up it did set another
remote so remember what I said before
that get is decentralized so we have one
get get one version one we have the
repository on our computer and they're
post story also exists on the github and
now Heroku also has set up repository
for us for this application on on their
service that one is empty at the moment
so we're going to push to that I could
actually demonstrate if you just we're
gonna do some git commands here I'm
gonna show how you use get without the
desktop application videos right git
remote I think a less like that yeah now
get promote this right get remote yeah
so there we see that there are two two
remotes see if you're right get remote
dash V for verbose you actually see the
the URLs here so the heroic remote is on
Hiroko Hiroko calm and the origin remote
is on github.com slash mpj precisely so
we go yeah push Heroku master precisely
so only we push the master branch of our
repository to the remote repository on
Heroku and since here it returns a lot
of messages yeah so what it does here is
that it we spent when we create
to the application we specified a build
pack which is a build pack specifically
for the create write or create react app
and that is another advantage of using
something like create react app is that
we get this kind of infrastructure
somebody has created a way of telling
Heroku exactly how to serve this this is
also things that you could figure out on
your own but at this point we kind of
want to use high level tools that gets
us going as fast as possible and when we
when we start learning this more if we
do at some point in the future where
instead of going from the ground up
we're gonna take this big thing that we
both and we're gonna break it apart into
its components and learn every component
one by one this is actually the the way
I personally prefer to learn because I
find it really hard to get things to
stick in my head unless I know how they
fit in the grander scheme of things so
if it's possible I want to build like
the big thing first and then start
learning the little things about what I
did afterwards only this is very fast
but for some reason for others because
of Murphy's Law which is that everything
always fails
if you can't github is having some
Network issues anything really slow so
it's not our connection because right
now we see that Heroku is it works just
like this exactly also what we run into
when we were doing the the appointment
was so slow
lots of times looking at deploying on
scripts running and if you like looking
at the 20 scripts running you can watch
that episode this is a future we should
be waiting for our computers waiting for
other people computers reduced
interconnection is 500 gibbets and
Heroku is running on the
which is an infinite or service and we
are still waiting for several minutes
for this to run another impact
Gaithers hopefully this will be faster
when you do it otherwise we're making a
horrible recognition right know that you
could drive to Starbucks and come back
to put the coffee on the grinder again
yeah yeah recording this at
high-definition great joy to Heroku
alright should we run the Heroku open
command yeah you can like its if you see
here on its we can just go there yeah
you can go there or just write the
shorthand Hiroko open but does this work
it did not it worked it works but the
what is this why is one like I wonder
this when we started doing this hmm
why is a background gray I've no idea
what it's what does that come from
because I don't remember I've u squared
react up before and I don't remember it
being gray it was actually
that showed me Firebug for the first
time which was the predecessor which was
a installable Firefox 2 back in the day
III don't know why it's wise gray you
just inspect the body I did right now
local host now it's white what what oh
okay we have to redeploy no yes we do
but we need to fix it locally - yeah
okay so just here we here we have an app
it's live and you can share it with your
friends - see this small text field but
okay just alright we need to fix this we
need to give it a background okay so how
would you do that if you're against CSS
I would actually do this particular
thing in CSS because you want the body
styling makes make sense to go in the
CSS I guess you have to add the
background color in both the body and
the HTML I think why is it not happy I
know yeah because you have not written
anything perhaps okay and background
color cool perhaps in some darker shade
let's just do it but this is the remote
app oh there we go
okay cool so let's let's commit that
three gray cool so all right so we can
push orange in there we shouldn't be a
now we're pushing to get up github and
since github is sorted down and this
will take a good God big music why does
this happen when we are recording this
never happens by the way github is one
of the most reliable things in the world
overall hi
okay so github seems to be done but you
know what at this moment doesn't matter
because our repository is it's
decentralized it is decentralized so we
have the entire repository on our
machine and we can push from our machine
to the the repository on Heroku just
switch here yeah come on sure all right
that didn't help now I think you have to
we should be on master on our own branch
on your own so that's correct but I
think that it's this one that we want to
change okay right-click that or
something you know what let's use the
command line get push master right
unfortunately Heroku will still need to
pull things from github so it won't help
us much
no but we're done we have something up
and rolling here and it will hopefully
update sometime we
investigating reports of connectivity
issues to github.com and related
services so there is actually something
something going on it's not just us
let's go out some coffee yeah
done finally right okay so did it is it
correct no yes yes all thank us
I think it wasn't a shingle oh yeah all
right ah okay
so this looks needs alright so we just
deployed our application to the internet
it's now available on the internet and
we have like this way of deploying it so
you might notice here that some of you
might be used to have some of you might
have done something like this before and
then you you it might be that you use a
shared hosting thing and you use FTP so
we didn't do that here we deployed
directly using git there wasn't any FTP
involved here at all and we didn't need
to setup any shared hosting we didn't
need to sign up for any service
whatsoever
we just ran a hero cook man and pushed
it and we had some snags with very slow
github but it's the work in the next
episode we're going to populate the
components with some data that have them
actually do stuff and you can watch that
episode here it's gonna be amazing
