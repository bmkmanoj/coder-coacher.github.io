welcome to dev tips my name is Travis in
case you haven't recognized or figured
out check it out I'm in a hotel room
tonight tonight is hotel room coding
night and a jump on a bit a little bit
once upon a time I created a design for
a music app and I had a sign-up page on
my website that if people wanted to know
more they could sign up and learn more
and when I had developed it they would
be notified well as it came to pass it's
not developed c'est la vie but I have
this mailing list of a few hundred
people that I want to let them know
about dev tips so they can join our
community here and I'm going to send
them an email and I thought hey wouldn't
it be fun to code an email with you guys
so you could see a few concepts and and
kind of practices that I'm using when
I'm coding email things like responsive
techniques and messaging strategy and
all of those good type of things I'm
going to start from absolute scratch I'm
going to go on this desktop here and
create a new folder I'm gonna call it
email and I'm drag the email folder into
my espresso to create a project out of
it and espresso has done that we have an
empty project there's no files in it
let's create the first file which is
going to be called emailed HTML it could
be called anything it doesn't matter
this is not going to have a rigid folder
structure in fact I'm not even going to
create a CSS folder or an images folder
these are very few of each of these so
the first second thing can do actually I
have a thumbnail of the video oh it's
going to be a video mmm I have this
thumbnail here and drop it in their
project as well so I can get it off my
desktop I'm going to start with straight
with a blank
at HTML page and we're going to do
everything we've learned when I say
doctype HTML and period and then I'm
going to say HTML closing HTML head head
in the head I'll put a title see I told
em ale for my homies and then uh make a
link to my stylesheet stylesheet and I
know you're thinking you're thinking oh
no a stylesheet in the email you can't
have external stylesheets and email well
you're right but that's I'm not actually
sending this as an email so you know
cool your jets bro what we're gonna do
is I'm going to create this it's easier
to work with external style sheets and
so that's what we're going to do to
create email then later we will do some
magic and put all those styles in the
actual markup that we're writing here so
uh it'll be styled CSS done okay now I
need to go to my body I need to make a
body and then ok let's pause here now an
interesting thing to note is that uh all
of the work that I just did will be
deleted I don't think that's interesting
to note right now it will become
interesting later but I know it and it's
like a spoiler alert it's gonna be
interesting spoiler the new file style
dot sass yeah yeah yeah yeah okay and
then I'm gonna drag this folder into my
code kit so that will compile the sass
for me and I'm going to make sure that
the output path is not in the CSS folder
it's just in the root that's where my
style sheet is pointed to right here
see cool okay style dot sass now here is
probably one of the most important
things you can do
don't style the body at all leave the
body absolutely normal
don't die like okay here's what you do
you write a div and you've class it like
something like email container container
sometimes I talk to my fingers don't do
what my mouth says so I end up looking
like a guy who can't talk and write
because actually I'm a guy who can't
talk to write email container is the rap
for the email message it's actually let
me just change that to make this more
specific email back ground yeah now you
understand I'm saying I'm not using the
body as like - I'm not using the body as
a hook to define any font sizes or font
styles or even background colors like
the bat the email background div is what
I'm going to be targeting as the lot
that is the most ancestral type of
element in this document and then I'm
going to put the email good to do its
caps lock its give class email container
container okay
now let's just actually go in before I
do any styles let's go and describe the
email that I want to send I I made a
video for this email so I'm imagining I
haven't designed it all we're going to
design it right here in the browser I'm
imagining it's going to have like a
headline and then it's going to say are
just going to a thumbnail and then it'll
be like some description text below just
a short line or two and then again a
really good called action below that and
then below that like you know the
regular footer text or something like
that so doop actually there's something
called a pre header here if you are not
familiar with pre hitters that's okay
this is like hardcore email jockey kind
of lingo right here pre header now in an
email a client like if you're going to
your Gmail application there's going to
be the subject line and then after that
there's going to be a few lines of text
and these are usually the like the first
few lines that you've written in the
body
well those few lines are really
important because they're going to help
the user of the email help the email
recipient know whether or not they
should just delete the email outright or
pass it around pass it by or something
like that so we want to make sure that
those few weaken we want to make sure
they can take advantage of that
opportunity to share the a good choice
of words for those few words so we often
call that a pre header it's just like a
little bit of text and sometimes we
actually use CSS to to hide it I'll show
you what that is like right here okay so
a pre header I'm going to say a long
time ago
I'm for you signed up to learn about
music I designed for iOS I have some
news for you smiley face okay now I have
preheader this will be the first snippet
of text that you'll see even before you
jump into the email and I can use CSS to
not hide it like a display:none or
anything because that wouldn't work for
our purpose of being a pre hitter we can
you know make it small and check the
color not very visible so that we can
make the emphasis when they do open the
email beyond the email message right
okay so the email container is going to
be the email container is going to be
the the container that is being
responsive it's growing or shrinking
depending on the browser size now an
interesting thing about emails is you
know the strategy has has changed quite
a bit recently for good emails a lot of
people are using the old strategies
you'll see like I got an email from
American Airlines today like confirming
my flight number out here it was
basically they just emailed me a web
page it had header links that have
navigational logo at the top it so much
so much so much but um
so let me show you what a modern snappy
looking email will look like it will say
of an h1 up here and I'll say hi I don't
really notice I'm not really good at
crafting this language right here I'll
say hi do you members I haven't like
written these guys I pretty much ever
they just signed up and I just like
keeping their names in the list for no
reason I don't know so I'm just going to
try to move them over to a place where
I'm actually active which is here on
this YouTube channel hi do you remember
signing now okay I'll say three I made
this video to my no I'm gonna cop it
edit this copy it's not very right now
and then I'm gonna actually put the
image here image source and it'll change
but right now I'll call it silly bear
and then it's a really big image and
then uh after the image I want a few
goodness paragraphs right um
actually maybe I just want to move this
to the pair
no no no not okay and then and then I
want to put another all the do the class
of CTA and in there I put the anchor tag
right and I'll make this ref to the
video on once I upload it to YouTube
I actually want to put the image in a
hurry too because I'm sure they're going
to click on the image instead of the
link down there and I think both of them
should be clickable so I'll just put a
link around that half so we click
through it okay um let's make some quick
styles to clean this mess up the first
thing
when actually I'm going to do max wet
that way if they have a smaller screen
it will shrink and I'm just going to say
it's going to 500 anyway now let's make
sure all images are max width of 100%
and save that and this time there we go
okay now I've got something to work with
email container is 500 pixels wide and
so that we can see it let me make the
background pink actual width on so let's
say here and I want to make the
preheader look like this too so I'll go
pre header and then I can put @e x TX 10
dot DL container okay so I would an
extend does it's in SAS it just takes
actually I'll show you what it does it
it'll it'll double up on the selectors
that give those properties so we're not
like so we're not being wasteful with
our selectors they are with our Styles
there so it's just a SAS thing and this
is not a SAS tutorial so I won't cover
it very much but that's something to to
look at but be careful with them because
it can be a little funny sometimes and I
also want to make the the pre header you
know I want to make the first before
that I want to make the background email
background yeah
I'm gonna make it um
he feels like I'm like a monkey and I'm
gonna give it some padding why am i
giving it padding yeah me good padding
tight pixels no not 2010 yeah that's
good and then I make this background
and color and I want to change the
default text to font family sans-serif
because it's cool and modern see what I
did I just change the text color to the
background color so the text basically
disappears but it's still there and when
you see this on the pre header text it
will show up there and so this is the
text that they're going to see that's a
super super sneaky trick and I want to
font size because it's taking up a lot
of space for no reason
font size uh five pixels sure and then
pre header in it so let's go oh that was
all that you know what that I want to
put that on the pre header okay and then
the email container it needs to be
centered trying to say margin:0 pix auto
so the top is top and bottom zero pixels
but the left and right have Auto so it's
going to center that container because
there's a defined with a max width of
500 so let's shrink this down and it's
like holla
check me out or shrink down so I'm
responsive now an interesting thing
about responsive in a responsive web
design you have a lot more to consider
than email you notice a lot of columns
ya like different you know is the logo
gonna be too big and you shrink this
down and stuff with an email it's a lot
a lot a lot easier generally you know
you best practices you you should only
be using one column in your email you
know like 90% of the email that I
received I receive it on my phone and so
I just keep on scrolling it I have too
many things to look at you know one
column generally is better for like most
interactions that people have on the
internet so that's we're going to do so
when I say this is a responsive web
design like honestly what I'm talking
about is that it's using mobile-first
practices and those mobile-first
practices are extending into the desktop
viewing of it it looks good on desktop
you know that's that's my goal so yeah I
want the email container to be a
overflow:hidden and on the border radius
hi I us to be 550 no don't shut down
what I don't know how to compute their
pixel okay save yes you're nice aren't
you okay okay okay now we have a P and a
div class okay so let's take a look at
this paragraph take a pink off actually
make it white and look at this paragraph
i'ma say you need margin of 20 pixel
yeah that's pretty sex how about your
font size is 16 pixel uh-oh
pixels pixels okay oh he already was 16
pixels default browser default there's
no reset here yeah these are all the eat
the whole styles everything else is a
browser default um let's make them
centered Center uh text-align:center
and then color let's make it a little
grayish er 666 is always a good gray and
line-height what's cool about a line
height is if you don't use a value type
like px for pixels or em4 M I it will
just do a multiplier of the so 16 if I
put 1 the line height will be 16 if I do
1.5 and stretch it out a little bit I
wanna make these like 18 18 that's good
and then font weight can be 300 oh
that's a little nicer and if they don't
have like a light version of Helvetica
or Arial on there if there are PC um you
know if it doesn't matter but it's just
progressive enhancement if they can look
at this nicely it will display nicely
seems really naked watch this video if
you're gonna email the head of my face
it's just said watch this video I don't
think this is very well designed but
that's another story
okay and then we're going to look at the
CTA so CTA class I'll be on it
to text the line
Center and then I want it to also be
margin uh Mia 2020 is so good for
margins
it's so nice now we're going to take
that anchor and let's
text-decoration:none take that
underlying off let's say the back oh
let's make the display a inline line
block so we can like put some nice
padding on it
oh speaking that's background background
I want it to be a nice rich cool blue so
let's look at blues um blue hexes I
don't even know if that's something to
that will return any good results blue
hex okay we got shades of blue huh
okay there's some nice blues I like this
one yeah we did codes blue alright save
wow that's nice color white padding 20
BAM I'm gonna say 10 20 so if you do a
shorthand for padding and you do so okay
so padding you can put let's do some CSS
learning for you right now
I'm sure you already know this because
we're talking about structure and stuff
in the scene in this video but I've
never covered this in any depth tip
before that uh people so a shorthand for
like things like margin padding border
radius and a few other things that that
have like defined whatever so if you do
one one value it will atribute that same
padding
to every side in this case padding-top
heading right padding-bottom and
padding-left
if you do two padding's so I'm going to
do 10 20 what we have here is the top
and bottom we get 10 left and right get
20 and it's just the same as doing this
right see the same so in the here we're
doing like you start at the top and then
count like clockwise so top right left I
started right bottom left and that's
what we're doing here this is shorthand
if you do a 15 like this would be top 10
right 20 bottom 15 left 20 that's what
that means
so it's a little weird that's the CSS
short hands for pettings okay I don't
want to make a border I don't like this
blue now was it 5 if you don't like a
blue you can go into the inspect element
this is cool and click on this number so
I'll hold shift and click on it no ok it
does it wasn't sure if that was just
chromed this okay so H SL h SL is the I
mean this is the same code in h SL that
would give us that hex that I put in
here but now that I have an HS all I can
just edit it so a hue saturation
lightness on a key PQ key the saturation
lightness I want to make it a little bit
lighter to make it like a 30 I'm sorry
darker Oh 70 a 60 it's a little too
light bro ooh that's a good saturation
okay and then what do I do
let me turn it back into eight then do a
hex and grab it and put a patch in my
code that's a lazy man's way of changing
your colors and the lazy programmer is
the best programmer because they will
just find the easiest way to do any hard
task so this is our email shaping up
we have our preheader text up here and
it's hidden it's really small it's but
it will show up as the subject line
redesigned redesigned music app from
Travis Nielsen will hot well Oh what did
I just do will not redesign will hot
alright alright headlines aside I want
to change all this headlines and
probably I want to put something above
the image now that I'm looking at it
where's that image h1 hey you guys yeah
something like that that looks really
great you know what I do I'm going to
take that center center and I put it
just put it on the ball container so
that the heading we get centered to and
then I don't really have it on CTA
either cut down my codes so yeah I think
that if that is a good hit line this
would probably be a pretty good email I
mean it's short and sweet straight to
the point it's responsive it's gonna
look good on a phone it's gonna look
great on a phone oh my gosh it's gonna
look so dang good on a phone and then I
want to put a debt other crap that I
have to put with an email so I'll put
that right here and this would be called
a div class glitter junk and it's like
my address and unsubscribe
wink
uhh
I want to do that extend again down here
footer clash junk
extend for my extending up
container and then I want to turn the
background I don't want it back okay and
then I'll make padding 20 cause 20 is so
good and then five sides make it ten cuz
know anybody click the unsubscribe
okay maybe twelve though not generous
and then I need to make those lakes so
you're gonna be a link you guy hey yeah
I was make this the color links
everywhere
Boop now it looks good okay so that's
how we do awesome
email layout now for the extremely
important bit I need to take all of this
style and I'm gonna make actually I want
to duplicate this email right here
duplicate and I'm gonna put it I'm going
to call it inlined
and I'm gonna chop off the head
and chopped off the body style copy
female in line and Oh actually I need
head body still not time to chop it off
it's time to put a styling hit that's
what I wanted to do still be Travis
style that's what I want to do safe okay
and then I'm going to run over here
to the Internet and I'm gonna say
Internet give me a search find me the
CSS in liner and it's by MailChimp yeah
beaker okay so with this cool tool does
it's a cool tool it'll allow you to
paste your h2 just what it says here
paste your HTML and then MailChimp will
will take all this see it CSS and make
them inline styles and you want to strip
out the style text for sure convert it
boom oh that's not it it's down here how
does the confused about that we do redo
the UX on this page so copy and then
everything delete it paste the new one
in okay
notice that every style here is now in
line right and this is so important
because this is so important because a
lot of male clients will ignore style
tags outright Gmail as a web client it
actually cuts the head off so I'm going
to come in here I'm just going to do it
preemptively because I want to make sure
that I can stand on my own two feet
without my body whatever so that's this
is I want to make sure that this email
is good enough to for Gmail to whatever
cuz Gmail's the top email client there
is science behind that
oh look look that what happened
why did litter jump not see I'm saying
like you gotta keep watch of that I'm
going to fix that anyhow so this email
now is primed for me to plug it into an
email sender like MailChimp or the other
one campaign monitor whatever and then I
can send that off to oma homies and tell
them about this awesome video so when
they click on this thing thumbnail
they're going to get a super fun video
to watch and it's going to be similar to
this video except we're not even closely
similar at all I'm not even going to be
in a hotel room I'm going to have a
super fun time sleeping in this bed and
you guys have a super fun time doing
whatever the heck you're going to do
after you watch this video ba
hey everybody welcome to dev tips
Wow welcome to their tips I'm in a hotel
room</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
