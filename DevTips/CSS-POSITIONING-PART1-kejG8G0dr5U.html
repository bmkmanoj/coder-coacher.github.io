for dev tips I am excited to share with
you this this subject that I'm sharing
blue I'm excited to share with you this
subject today it's called CSS
positioning now this is an often
requested subject on the comments of my
channel and I've tried the truth is I've
tried to record a few times about this
subject but every time I do it just gets
like really really bad actually and I
think the reason for that is that it's a
nuanced subject so not that it's like
complicated or difficult but it's
nuanced so I have to talk a long time
about all the nuances and it leads to
long videos and I don't want to make
long videos because I don't think I
might bore you guys or just you might
check out and miss the cool stuff so um
the videos I've been trying to talk
quickly to get all the content inside of
a shorter video for you guys but it's
just it turned out to just be a muddy
confusing video so without further ado
let me direct your eyeballs to my screen
here and I'll show you what I'm talking
about so we have CSS positioning and
there are not only four positions but
there are four main positions that
you're going to use 90% of the time and
they are static relative absolute
positioning and fixed now today we're
going to chop this in half and cover
we're going to have two videos when I
cover this in two steps so today we're
going to talk about static and relative
positioning and then after that we'll
come back and we'll talk next week or
whenever the next video about absolute
and fixed positioning
cool with that said let's take a look at
static positioning static positioning is
a type of positioning that you will run
into a lot even though you may not know
it so let me show you what I mean by
that here I have a
and a regular HTML document and I have
just the only important things here or a
div called granddad a child that called
dad and then this is kind of be us I'll
just put a class me right so it's I'm
the span here this is my dad it's my
parent container and this is my great or
my granddad because it's my dad's dad
so I labeled them with those classes so
that you could understand the
relationships of what we're talking
about so anyway oh I want to show you
the first CSS position that you're going
to run into like 99% of the time and the
way I want to show - let's look at this
I'm just going to inspect element here
and I'm looking at dad if I go over to
the computed style that will show me all
of the styles that lead my element to
look like it does whether they're
defaulted or specified by me so if I
come in here and I want to see all the
defaults because I haven't I've
installed this at all sort of defaults I
want to run down to positioning position
I can notice that it's static the reason
I say that you're going to run into
static the most is because it is the
default state of all HTML elements
position static now if you have been
doing any coding so far or have you been
hanging out with us
remember the html5 series that we did or
that I did and I talked about yeah I
talked about the default positions and
and I talked about it in terms of
actually I talked exactly about this and
I wrote it on my face I think but I
talked about it in terms of display so
if an element is either display block or
inline it's still position static weight
but you can expect the flow if as if
it's called the position static you can
expect it to flow just like it would
that I
and earlier in the other video even
though that video is not specifically
about positioning it was about display
types but you can rely on those display
types if the position is is on its
default which is static I think I've
talked about this enough now there are
also another four properties that we
need to be aware of that hold hands kind
of with the position property and so the
other ones are called the directional
properties they are the top left right
and the bottom okay so if you declare a
CSS property like let's say you declare
something as relative you can then use
these other properties of top left right
and bottom to move things around and
I'll show you all about that in just a
few seconds but before that I want to
show you the default State of the
position property and the directional
properties so the default State as we've
just looked at it for the position is
static and for the directional
properties they're all going to be the
same they're all going to be Auto so if
if something is top auto that means that
it's kind of undeclared and it's going
to act in its natural state let me show
you just I'm just going to run over here
the top and show you it is auto so you
can check you can check the default
state of anything by using this
inspector it's really handy and that is
the normal that's the defaults right so
position static all the directional
statements all the directional
properties are Auto there we go
if you declare a directional property on
a element that's a static position like
let me show you okay so we're on dad and
we know that it's a position is static
and I say top oops
top 400 pixels nothing happens
nothing happens at all but as soon as I
declare that position
relative to where to go it went 400
pixels up this world what come back or
down actually it was pushed down okay
let's talk about relative now so
relative is another positioning
statement that you'll use quite often
and you're going to use it in a way that
you may not expect right now and I'll
explain myself okay so we have to really
be aware of where things currently are
and how they flow together so here I am
I am the span that's me got a class of
me and save that out and I want to talk
take me and make my position relative
and I'm saved
and here we are we would leave me I'm
Venice doing this this is me let's take
a look
my position is relative okay is there
any displays anything happening to it
any visible change
well no not at all but as soon as I'm
start let me put a top here of 50 and
the left of 200 as soon as I start
declaring things on it background okay
I made the pink background so we can see
that guy as soon as I start declaring
the visit the directional properties on
a relatively positioned element it can
it starts moving around so left you can
see how I'm just moving it around and
tabbing and whatever all over this and
you can see that it's moved from its
place where it should have been which is
right here to follow the positioning
that I told it to top left or top 50
left 40 now what's interesting to note
about this is that the natural flow of
the other HTML elements in this case
this paragraph are still respects
being the position or respecting the
area that this element would take up if
it was not moved right there's a big gap
is what I'm saying here yeah so that's
that that's it I guess that's it for the
video today we want to make sure we
understand that the relatively
positioned element will create a gap the
flow of the Dom will still respect it as
if it had not moved and if I put here
let me change the top here it'll just go
right on top of things and if if an
element has a position statement on it
for example relative it will sit on top
of everything else in in like the in the
stack and the Z stack the things that
are coming towards you like that z-axis
it will just sit on top of things even
though that's anyway hey thanks guys for
looking at this video and it was only
eight minutes but hopefully I'll edit it
down yeah boop-boop bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
