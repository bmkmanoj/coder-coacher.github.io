dev tips and this is my podcast co-host
Carlos so I have a podcast Carlos and I
have a podcast called late nights with
travel oh yes and this is the cantina
this is where we host and record our
podcast and what we do on the podcast is
we talk about creative principles living
life as a professional in the industry
and how to do it in all that stuff okay
if you are not familiar with our podcast
i really recommend it um it's at Travon
lowes.com you should super check it out
and then like if you if you normal check
it out that's not enough yes I mean is
super check it out super check it out
super check it subscribe and go to your
friend's phone subscribe there to
subscribe on your friends phone so what
we have right here we're gonna play a
game we have a little Bowl here full of
like kind of words and stuff things that
I wrote and we're gonna pick a topic and
we're gonna do a Google Trends search
that's cool I've had no clue you've
never mess with this this is a really
great way to like decide on what the
podcast about haha good you know like is
is this subject trending let's go all
right hey how do you play the game
thanks for asking um we pick we pick a
topic and we type it in and before we
hit enter we have to decide do you think
it's going to trend over time we're
trend down over time okay and you can
add multiple queries on to one chart
okay so you have to say like it's above
or below what was there already okay
okay so the first term is responsive web
design oh I think it's obviously going
to trend up I think it's gonna spin
since gonna spike around Oh doesn't show
a date does it look it I think it's
gonna 20 live around four years ago yeah
okay here we go Dada 1120 low oh that's
good but it's trending down oh that's
what I had google trends responsive web
design is trending down I guess everyone
figured it out figured it out okay now
it gets interesting we have to decide on
where these next things will plot so you
add with that button right there oh this
is so cool yeah yeah all right this next
is a technology for building websites
called angular and
you lar angular is is a Jo is a
JavaScript library and your site is this
popular more popular than responsive web
design where does it show up so is it
turning up or down and is it above or
below responsive web trending down yeah
above responsive and that's a pretty
good guess i would say i would say the
same thing are you trending down but
above response okay here we go
Oh lado responsive way above responding
up so we were halfway right we're in
2011 for them angular design no this is
look at that that's it I love it so it's
so much more popular than it dwarfed
responsible is quite easy you can even
see it yeah all those spikes that we saw
in responsive web are like just little
little babies that's crazy angular is
killing responsive web design ok web
designer web designer web designer so
that that's an interesting one because
it's very generic so it could have a
high volume it could have a high volume
uh I'll say that it is web designers
trending flat okay can we do that yeah i
mean but our chart starts at two
thousand five but we could say i'm gonna
say web designer is not as big as
angular okay it's bigger than responsive
web okay but it's uh yeah a flattish i
don't think it's like spiking okay is it
below or is below angular above okay
yeah given now I think I think anglers
probably higher than webs at angular
killed responsible and yet to hear go
you should play some music for this ah
well I gave me dramatic Oh running down
over time it's trending down over time
there was one point where it was higher
in 2005 mmm and then there's no it you
know what's interesting is angular is
like a kind of a generic term you could
be like I don't win it win was angular
the library released right around 2013
again yeah yeah which is what i waiked
so we guessed it right though kind of
even kind yeah it's generally going down
yeah yeah it's on a downward trend yes
but it sits above responsive web I'm
surprised I'm really responding recent
really surprised by responsive web
design I know I really am yeah and that
it's dwarfed by everything else bye bye
bye uh no one cares anymore magnitude of
you know what I because
Squarespace and wicks and all these
other companies have taken care of
responsive for you maybe they call it
mobile web design mobile web at Google
we say mobile ready or something okay
mobile first mobile first is like a
tactical development but like we like if
you see a search result below it will
say like has a mobile version or I
forget what it says all right mmm we
should we should get rid of one of these
okay let's get rid of the bottom one get
responsive yeah okay I think you can
have up to four of the charter one time
do do do believe you all right um let's
add web tutorials web tutorials web
tutorials I think this is gonna be below
even responsive web design web tutorials
I think this is gonna be so responsive
is gone I think it's gonna be below web
designer yeah it'll be below web
tutorials always did not exist but I
think it will be trending up though mmm
also turn it down okay oh yeah yeah
yeahs really think oh it's the yellow
one it's trending down it's generated
below web designer so you were right on
both counts ah i was wrong i was hoping
for an up no because that's what I make
I mean web tutorial I'm thing it's not
okay here's one adobe flash a dog adobe
flash adobe i think that it will trend
down and then spiked up in the last the
last two weeks cuz they just changed the
name of it to animate them why would
they searched it if it wasn't search it
so trending down I think it's gonna be
so I think it's gonna be worse than
responsive web design with it works okay
here we go my guess these are the flat
line across the flat line beneath yellow
wait wait wait no let me change mine I
think there's gonna be a spike around
when 2006 when I phone log yeah yeah
yeah okay go ahead let's go for that
2006 do to do to you I'm so nervous this
bad internet connection is like so tense
what oh I'm in the wrong business that
killed hangul er which was our leader
dwarfed angular oh my gosh i need to
make flash tutorials you should make
flash tutorials look at that they can
flex obviously I need to make flash
tutorials right there's like it's
trending down well yeah but look how big
it is dang what the flip day if you
hover over the nodes you can see
sometimes you can see like articles like
let's click on an mmm I don't know maybe
they changed it buddy like sometimes you
can see like an article that was written
on that day and like just to verify that
it's time yeah thing adobe flash daddy
not i wouldn't guess it I was but I did
guess that there would be a spike around
what did I say 2006 right here doesn't 6
boom to thousands that's exactly what I
said dang I didn't think I didn't expect
how big it would be no okay that's what
should we can add another one there that
was insane I that was crazy here's one
html5 okay html5
who do you think with this one give us
your prediction my prediction is that
i'm gonna go i'm gonna go heavy here and
that's more than flash bigger than flash
I think html5 zero bigger than flash
2013 there'll be a spike in html5 is it
13 uh yes um I don't think and it's
still trending up I just don't even know
to think adobe flash killed my
confidence in anything that I know uh
yeah 2005 okay I think it'll be bigger
than flash why not whatever you need
music yeah what a flat like jeopardy
music yeah what if flash is just like up
where's html5 purple purple it's it's
bigger than bigger than angular angular
so if adobe flash was not there it would
be the biggest one but at the end you
see angular is getting bigger it is and
flashes trending down side and get rid
of flash let's just because we need to
make room for more that flash kill I
cannot even believe is chewy should we
keep that one no because everything else
is gonna be so small compared to it okay
that's it's crazy to know that that is
so crazy flash tutorial flash tutorial
yeah there you let's get rid of
something else too let's get rid of web
store yep web tutorial I will keep web
design us like a web designer web
designer baseline startup whoo I think
startup is gonna get huge around 2007
yep yeah 2007 gets huge and it's still
trending up ah yeah yeah I think it's
gonna be bigger than then adobe flash
was okay here we go
yeah oh it's cold tonight this is cool
Oh starting startup 20 it down pretty
aggressively around two thousand and six
five two thousand five and six that's
why blind and then start speaking up
around 2015 it's coming back up yeah but
it was flat it didn't like really that's
crazy but Wow let around the same as
html5 okay will you look at that Google
trend yeah i was thinking I'm saying
still I was saying the reverse the
startups right everybody's writing about
startups all the time TechCrunch all
wrong dad goodness uh WordPress word I
don't know the history of wordpress
wordpress i think is going to be huge in
2008 and then it's gonna come down but
not really i think it's still gonna be
huge i think i'll be huger than anything
we have here yeah there you go mmm
running up I don't know bigger than
everything in trying I think it's gonna
be smaller than web designer purple oh
that's humongous o.o bigger than startup
bigger than anything wordpress big type
in what was the other big one what do we
flash flash get rid of something in time
adobe flash your to another flash oh my
god i can't believe it oh your lashes
like oh I don't even isn't that thing
dead hasn't have been dead oh my god my
baby you're just writing so many
articles about how dead it is oh there
you go there you go dang so WordPress
and flash board workers and flash so I
need to make flash tutorials and we're
close to Tory yeah i'm gonna guess is
like a learning for me I'm learning a
lot I'm getting rid of angular which is
now the least which was a leader for a
while okay getting rid of England's I
web design courses okay you notice that
these are all like dev tippy I'm trying
to like figure out like that what is the
landscape but I think this would be a
fun game to do it in web design courses
okay yeah I don't know so like it seems
that my courses like the purchasing
courses on like Linda or something ok I
think it's going to fall I think it's
going to gradually rise and get huge
around 2000
and 14 okay get huge you think is bigger
than anything we have here no no no okay
above read above start up if it said if
it said tutorials not courses i would
say bigger here we go around you guys
gonna be bigger than red okay yeah yeah
Baron read us smaller than belly flash
smaller than startup red is startup or
design courses is non-existent it's a
flat line it's a flat line okay ah I
think I think that one's a little
specific anyway there you go alright
here's here's one Toby flat UX design oh
man what do you think oh that one's
gotten popular like that's like that's
like a you I'd watch hop the hot phrase
right like a keyword or the industry
kind of hot oh yeah you x ux designer ux
design ux went big 2012 I think it's
started trending up till the 12 I think
that's a good guess do where do you
think is gonna be those like above above
I think why should i it's about flash
you think imma flashes are we going
we're biggest ones you think it's gonna
be the biggest this is biggest all right
it's as big is big here we go ah yeah
uses this is my career where is my
career it's a flat line like this little
bump we should start looking for jobs
different jobs oh that was those but a
ridah send these bigger ones they're
making us look bad let's get rid of
flash forward press flash and WordPress
gone and we know we know about them
they're big whoa here's another
technology okay react Jas oh okay this
one's good I think this is 2015 yeah
that came out like that but yeah I came
out like last year like that yeah that's
good react Jas yeah and these are not
perfect like maybe somebody wrote an
article this has react j/s and it's not
even talking about the alleged it's
imperfect but yeah um so I think it's
going to be I think it's gonna be higher
than everything here yeah and and trying
to grinding up yeah I'm good with that
it's recent recent tech we got it bleeds
so far below everything wow we suck at
understanding the climate of our
industry that's what I'm learning to sew
angular angular's what's up what's a
lieutenant angular was killing react
because angular and reactor company yeah
yeah yeah okay it's very better name try
it try um what's the other one try um uh
sort of the p ph me know you said um
poly something no dang it okay app
development app develop men app
development I don't know I don't know to
expect app development let's say it's
it's gonna be flat and then it's gonna
be one of those ones that are just too
specific right yeah yeah it's too
specific see a little bump to a specific
little bump to specific and a little bit
there you go you got it yeah okay um
this is a blank sheet of paper Oh css3
oh okay css3 what do you guys think css3
say
I think it's gonna be bigger than html5
yeah and that's the blue one okay it's
gonna be bigger than startup I think
it's gonna be bigger than all of them
and I think it's going to be I think
it's gonna trend up around 2012 13 and
it's gonna peek around 2,000 in 14 or 15
and come down right now a little bit
down there you go that's a very specific
his bigger peeking hopefully I
understand something I want to do I just
want to know something well you're right
about the P the P I got the peak kind of
right and if I think have you removed
startup and what's the blue one html5
yeah maybe the P could be a little bit
more dramatic um but I i did not get the
scale right you did not react and app
development let's get rid of those years
are gone css3 css3 css3 all right what's
next oh here's one this is fun not like
here's one this really recent okay adobe
XD ooh just released so let's see what
line let's see what their cloud is like
oh wait adobe XD is actually the name of
their in-house design team okay yeah so
it i will say huge peak bigger than
startup else i'll say now yeah just like
like today yeah i'll say a small little
peek okay like what's the other one app
development I think it'll be between app
development and the blue 1805 that's the
law evergreen yep nothing okay come on I
mean I don't know if it's been a lot
long enough get your clout together haha
web professional mmm specific to
specific right yeah flatline I bet let's
just check it out let's get rid of the
next one mm-hmm lens with flatline yeah
there you go yeah flatline get rid of a
few get rid of html5 just clear the
board clear gonna clear the board oh the
board okay the next one says content
strategy content content it might be
super specific but since we've cleared
the board it should register is a
journey in competitive space is it
trending up or down a straining up I
think it's training up I think it's
gonna I think it's going to start
trending up around 2014 4 yeah
here we go fair housing in 13 till about
11 is when it started training up so
yeah I still got a good trend I think if
you put this next to angular it'll be a
flat wide world yeah see the thing about
google trends is that they don't tell
you absolute numbers they just tell you
proportions yeah so like the the Tet the
tip of this is 100 the bottom is is 0
right they don't tell you I don't tell
you they'll tell you scale let's do web
design ok web design that's general
that's generic it's gonna be bigger I
think it's gonna be bigger than content
strategy by a magnitude ok a magnitude
is it trending up hmm I think it's gonna
it's gonna peek around 2013 web design
Oh 13 that's how that's a little early I
think it's gonna peek around 2013 is
probably right yo third right peeking
out their screen but not come down a lot
not come down a lot but it's gonna be
way above content strategy no why does
my my career always look like all the
all the young people who are into stuff
they're gonna be panicking yeah what I
would do my job is not gonna be there in
the future that's true my job wasn't
there when I was a kid either right dang
so chosen for its big chosen for 2004
was the heyday of web design yeah that
was the heavy weapons maybe do you think
it's because we have all these all these
fractions of web design now I thinks I
feel like visual design like content
design you have uh you interaction
design yux yeah pyx interactive design
yeah yeah ix designer what's I let's IX
information information architecture
that's I a high okay okay get rid of web
design oh my god you actually actually
get rid of everything okay clear the
board hey this one's gonna be so funny
all right dev tips emptive all right dev
tips um
you're gonna trend up I think it's gonna
be training out is gonna be a hockey
stick hockey is gonna be flat lining for
a long time till 2000 2015 15 yeah there
you go I mean even if it shows up it
might say note not enough whoa thousand
five or is it dev tips is it's a general
term it's I'm just gonna use before so
this is dev tips since 2004 got a lot of
action 2004 more than you have now no I
was doing not doing for what it was your
secret yeah more more than you are now
okay anything we put on that is gonna
flatline it okay okay which is good
let's put something on it let's put
something on top of it uh try to try to
grab something here okay i was getting
those good I don't know this one's weird
design jobs people search for design
jobs right uh yeah things going to our
fears of course there you go yeah I
think setting up ginning up turning up
oh no training kind of down into these
Peaks they're like no yeah yeah so it's
seasonal edit it is c-pillar searching
more in the beginning of the year maybe
yeah yeah whoa that's cool yeah that
becomes really obvious when you search
for something like back to school or
something see like these like annual
peace yeah that's really cool that's a
cool insight google trends is amazing is
it is amazing design okay design has
designed jobs in designing design is
gonna be way bigger because that could
be fashion designing a furniture design
way bigger way bigger so blue is gonna
become a flat line design is gonna be
trending up and and it started to the
right i'll say i start trending up till
six yeah i mean from the start right
yeah here yeah i think is gonna be huge
this is i can be like a flat line up
here oh that's not bad they see it like
i was writing with a blue and this is
trending down though isabeli it's coming
up I don't know if that's a good enough
trend to say it's coming up but it's
it's holding it's like a wordpress
wordpress yeah
how did wordpress do i remember it was
bigger than flash for a bit okay yeah
yeah that's your scare scale whoa my
goodness what design design jobs is
still even smaller now well over that
okay so WordPress and design so does
that design is so generic that it could
be anything anything philippines Nepal
Pakistan Sri Lanka Lebanon Singapore
nindiya these are like the highest these
are the countries that search these
things the highest the most yeah whoa
well right clear that's good somewhere
in the right industry design is a good
design you could say search for humans
like that we're good we're good on that
we're good we're good clear it ok put in
put in html5 okay 05 yeah and then put
in css3 okay I'm setting this one up ok
ok now do SAS SAS s let's get sassy
okay okay it's a programming language
okay sad gas is not gonna be as big as
either you think uh maybe bigger than
css3 recently starting in 2014 starting
in two thousand fourteen and a half 14
is a half trending down in August what
turning down I think trending no okay
you think yes I think up I think that
there you go come on yellow good answer
good answer shutting up trending up
training up and it's bigger then css3 it
is see what read it again what I kept
beat what happened here css3 2004 no
sass 2004 it's bigger than was that loud
without like when it was released maybe
like there's a new thing go Sergio yeah
can maybe I don't know you could be all
right um senem okay let's uh we have two
more that probably don't belong in these
sibling clearing I'm clearing yeah clear
clear and do this is this is fun just do
okay do um podcast okay that's the last
one do no that's not the last one that's
all podcast so I think it's going to be
up into the right starting in 2014
mm I'll say 2007 ready okay there you go
I mean I think exist until 70 I was
going further back 2005 holy moly i was
expecting flatline most the time it was
in like two years three years ago the
only reason it i know this is because i
read on the wire that book I gave you
the other back in i read i never write
until i read like three pages they talk
about when podcast first launched in its
history and how is a huge thing but I'm
interested to see is how this does
against design yeah do it which was our
biggest one that was our biggest one
mm-hmm okay uh-uh butts design you can't
trust it okay so you can read what it
shows award preston wordpress was the
biggest yeah there you go did we ever do
ux design no so that's wordpress okay
war is over over ticket okay Oh leave
those 200 I just had one more it's kind
of silly but I just I was thinking of
everything related to dev tips okay uh
patreon hey I just it's probably gonna
be a flat line but I just wanted to like
I think it's a flat line yeah i was
thinking of like what does depth it's
all about patreon we have a patreon
community so small and then I think
trending up i think is trending up we
probably want to remove those other two
there you go that's trending out oh it's
got a nice little trend up there yeah
it's gonna let's take a look at it
remove those other to see how well we're
doing make it look nice make it look
nicer hey look we want it to win I'll
patreon
it's good it's kid wish you I wish we
compare that to responsive web design
okay let's zoom mobile Oh mobile mobile
web mobile web mobile mobile yeah mobile
web ready yeah yeah I think it's not as
big as more work I'm always bigger and
it's trending what training up 2014 look
at that all the web two thousand seven
thousand seven I phone so what do we
learn today we have learned that we
don't know anything we don't know it and
it's impossible to know thing it's
impossible to predict you know if you're
looking at this and thinking like oh
like as a content creators YouTube
creator like I could look at trends and
like say like oh what's hot right now
what should I make and what are people
searching for it and while that's true
yes I mean obviously it would inform you
i guess a little bit but i've noticed as
looking at my the content that i have
already created yeah in trying to
predict what is going to be a popular
episode on what is going to be you know
whatever right I never can you never can
predict it right it's always the
craziest thing that will just like that
one is really popular did it are you
gonna do are gonna do flash no I'm not
gonna do a flash it or what WordPress
yeah someday okay you got it all right
well uh thanks for everyone for watching
this video if you watch the whole thing
