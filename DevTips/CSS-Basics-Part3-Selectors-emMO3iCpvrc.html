babies come from me to the last week we
had Lowe's in the studio we talked about
the cascading nature of style sheets
that was one of my favorite episodes we
recorded so far I hope you liked it if
you haven't watched it I recommend going
back in time and doing it last Monday
good luck with that
also in case you missed it I uploaded a
blooper reel from that video we had a
lot of fun time around here I guess I
just wanted to prove it check that out
so this week I want to go a little bit
more crazy on CSS and talk about a super
important idea called selectors
selectors are used in CSS to identify
specific HTML elements in order to give
them the styling that they need so let's
say we have two little happy buttons
here one is a cancel button and one is a
submit button now we need some way to
tell CSS that we want to style the
submit button to make it look a little
bit more exciting so here's what we do
in our HTML document we can add some
special attributes you remember
attributes right those are the special
key value pairs that we talked about in
part 4 of our HTML 5 series if you can't
really remember that I recommend going
back right now and refreshing yourselves
don't worry we'll wait the first of
these special attributes is called an ID
and it looks like this
the second of these special attributes
is called a class and it looks like this
okay so let's talk about the differences
between these two special attributes
starting with IDs each webpage can have
only one element with any given ID and
only one ID can be given to any specific
element now classes are a lot more
forgiving you can have multiple elements
with the same class on any given page
and you can even have multiple classes
on one specific element I'm throwing a
link down below to a great article on
the subject on CSS tricks com make sure
to check that out it makes everything
really clear that's not too complicated
great now that we've applied these
attributes we could use them to select
our HTML elements in our stylesheet we
select the ID by using a little pound
sign and the name of the ID like so
pound button means find that one element
whose ID name is button for a class we
use a dot followed by the name of the
class like so dot button now this means
find all of the elements who have a
class name of button and a final way of
selecting an HTML element is just by
using the tag name with no special
characters in front of it like so this
says find all of the anchor tags this
element does not require that tag to
have a class or an ID like duh okay so
here's an entire style so you can see
the selector in context with the rest of
the style here we are selecting all the
elements that have a class of button and
making their backgrounds blue and their
font size 18 pixels easy enough huh cool
well this is just an introduction to
selectors they can get very very
complicated and very very very useful
and complex and maybe beautiful depends
on who you're talking to
next week we're going to take a look at
the parts of a style declaration to make
things pretty these are called
properties and values okay that's it
