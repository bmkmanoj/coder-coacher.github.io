last video we spent a lot of time
getting our development environment
ranked it's really important to enjoy
your workspace and your tools but now we
need to spend about 10 minutes making
sure that the file structure of this
project that we downloaded while giving
our environment right Thank You shakey
Shane we need to make sure that the
files in this project are exactly the
way we want them also so we've got some
cleaning to do this is like literally
right where I left off okay I guess
let's just start here this is the
layouts default HTML file in my layout
so this is going to be like the header
and the footer basically and this is a
header and footer that I didn't create
and I don't want
I didn't plan for them they're not mine
I don't care about them let me get rid
of them and they're stupid that's stupid
they're all tabbed wrong and stuff so
let me just read tab all of these things
okay now in Jekyll this little content
tag is going to be key so I'm gonna set
up the header actually that is not the
header it's the head the head tag and
the body is in in my mind it's just
gonna be a naked body and I'm gonna
inject all the content I want they're
using partials that I write in Jade and
I may come back here and stick in you
know like links to J's files and things
like that but you know whatever a good
starting place for for the default
template cleaned out most of the garbage
here
next let's go into the let's go into the
sass we have the CSS here let's put it
into our gulp task here and actually
let's just rename this project to and
we're gonna call it design plus code
that's what this that's what this series
is called so mmm a CD out of that and
then CD into desktop
design cool that makes me happier now
it's called design postcode so the first
thing I'm gonna do is go into my tools
and get rid of reset I didn't like it I
don't want it I don't even know why it's
there so basically I have if you look at
all of this I have zero sass except for
I can even delete this except for this
main dot s CSS and it's just importing
that whatever so let's go into tools and
add those tools the first thing that we
want is normalized I'm gonna search for
that normalize dot CSS so you can
install it with NPM which might be
interesting but I don't really want to
as a package I just want it as a you
know plain old CSS file so I'm going to
download and save link as designing code
I'm going to put it in assets CSS tools
and kerplunk there goes okay now it's
here in my tools and refreshment tools
normalize I'm gonna change it quickly to
s CSS so that I can import it the reason
I did s CSS instead of trying to change
it to sass is because it's already
written in CSS and s CSS is a subset of
sass and blah blah blah blah so that I
can import it so tools normal eyes and
save that the other thing I want to
import is bourbon bourbon and you import
the whole folder and then they will file
you on a target inside of the folder
bourbon is bourbon so so tools in
bourbon bourbon so I'm going to go into
my terminal and CD into what is this
assets CSS 0 0 - tools and then I'll say
if you don't have bourbon already you
would write a pseudo
installed bourbon and that would install
it on your machine it's installing
apparently I already have it but
whatever and then oops I'm not done okay
now it's done two gems installed
wonderful my bourbon was out of date
bourbon - V huh whatever okay I already
have bourbon so now that I'm in tools
I'm gonna say bourbon install now it'll
basically just install the new directory
into tools refresh this folder yeah and
this file here bourbon is the one when
I'm importing right here oh that's about
wrong vo you are burnt oh yeah bourbon
cool what else do I need in my tools I
think that's it for my tools for my base
there's a few files that I want here
let's create a new file and I'll say
underscore base and the reason I'm doing
that is because I'm gonna fill in my
base and then let's take a look at what
what does my normal base look like I go
to github and take a look at the o go to
the dev tips take a look at the what is
it
starter kit assets CSS base base index
and forest alright so my normal base is
just like some yeah it's like some
paragraphs and some links and stuff
let's grab this stuff okay that's good
that's good for base good base and then
the other one VARs is like where I
stashed the variables or that I wasn't
put those at the top no I put them in
bars
a new file underscore virus dot SATs
okay two files in the base 2000 tools
and modules are gonna make as we make
them and as we need them and main ok so
that's that's pretty good for our assets
let's run CD - - - - I think that's no
CD dot dot ok nowhere and design a code
again let's let's run cold let's see
what we get
so get any errors is what I'm looking
for alright I'm noticing that it says
buy here then that's it let me inspect
the element respect that element in here
style sheets main is not working why is
main not working no I see that that just
didn't compile I wonder if that has
anything to do with our watch statements
down here oh here we are ah see the
sasquatch is four so it won't compile
any SAS unless underscore s CSS is
changed so that's wrong it needs to be
something more like assets what is it
CSS and then kind of basically anything
in there right
alright let's quit our server and then
reco up stuff here
so main.css is working I can come in
here to it and go into like for example
base now go into VARs let's see here and
change the background color from this to
light blue and then there are blue right
perfect and change it back there we are
perfect again to perfect in a row that's
fast to gosh 48 milliseconds that's so
fast alright let's look what else we
wanted to change and get ready for our
big debut in the next video our config
file we're going to name this site well
it's just my site so called Travis
Nielsen and murk down we don't do any
work down that's fine Haider
exclude and index cool wow what a night

we're ready to make babies my websites
dank every time hey this is the part
where I thank my patients patrons are
the wonderful generous people who make
these videos possible these are the
patrons right there now as patrons of
the dev tips show they receive special
special treatments you know they could
have watched these shows a few days
early and they also get to see bonus
videos that I don't post to the regular
regular channel here so it's quite nice
for them and if you want to learn more
about the benefits of being a patron

option for you I'd love to have you in
the in the dev tips patreon community so
please check that out and keep on
hacking I'll talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
