invited to circles conference by one of
my favorite dev tipsters Joey Bergeron
hang on it was three days of getting
inspired learning new skills meeting
incredible people and just chowing down
on awesome BBQ in the great state of
Texas I carried this GoPro around with
me and look for ways to capture the
experience sometimes I was really
diligent and recording everything and
sometimes I just forgotten had too much
fun and I wish there was a good way to
not share that talks themselves because
it's you know not my conference but to
share the experience of being inspired
by these these speakers some of my
favorites were halina Price who talked
about her career as a photographer and
said something that really stuck with me
she said tree every success is temporary
I also enjoyed James White and Danielle
Evans Ted carpenter Larry who vodka and
Dan caseiro were just awesome and jeremy
cowart made me cry for reals it was
incredible anyway I want to share with
you what I was able to from the
conference so let's roll the tape let's

lift your head up and receive other
really cool things going on that people
are doing and inspired you to not good
