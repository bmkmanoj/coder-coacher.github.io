CSS ah I've been doing design and code
for a long time I mean I actually used
tables in layouts for paying jobs in the
in like the late 90s as a teenager and
the reason why I bring this up is just
to illustrate that I've seen a lot of
changes in the industry one of the
changes about coding websites that
excites me more than anything is the
fact that we are less reliant than ever
on graphic editors to create production
assets for our websites what I mean is
like you know there was a time where if
you wanted a box shadow you had to
create nine little pings you know and
cleverly place them around the box to
create a box shadow look it was just
frustrating and difficult but really we
didn't know any better you kids have it
so so good you you have no idea
now you just write one line of CSS and
you have this awesome dynamic box shadow
that you can you know tweak and change
on the fly it is seriously magic like
border-radius gradients like it is it is
a beautiful world that we live in right
now and it keeps getting better today
we're going to be looking at the next
evolution in browsers taking work away
from graphic editors today we're going
to be looking at CSS filters let's jump
in before we start looking at the CSS
filters let's talk about browser
compatibility as we look at this chart
here we can see that there is some
pretty fair support if you're
discounting ie and Opera Mini chrome
goes way back Firefox goes back to
versions Safari to versions opera one
Android is current ie no and edge so
keep that in mind when you're going to
be messing with this stuff the reason
I'm showing it to you today is not
necessarily because I expect you guys to
be using this stuff right away but that
they're so cool that you should be aware
of them I started first started messing
with them about three years ago I've
never used them in a live project but
they're just there's like a really
awesome thing to be aware of and I think
that they will in the future change the
way that we
design and style our websites so with
that introduction and keeping this chart
in mind let's go to our code so there
are a bunch of CSS filter properties
available to us and it really depends on
how we want to use them and in which
combination that we can have some really
interesting effects so in terms of our
setup here I have an image displayed on
the right it's being borrowed from
gratis ography and then right here I
have a comment with all the available
properties of the CSS filter and then
right here
I have an image with a CSS property and
value of blur so let's uncomment this
blur and you can see right away our
first filter is taking effect we have a
blur and blur you can use any link so
here's two pixels we can change that to
20 pixels and we're going to get a blur
this is a Gaussian blur it works similar
to how it does in Photoshop that if you
think of a pixel of the image and then
you want to blur it it's going to like
choose the radius of like so that the 20
pixels that I'm taking is like how far I
want the mix to go so right here is
going to be 23 pixels this will be 2
pixels this is how far you want the mix
of the blur to go and turn it off you'll
see I go back to nice tight crisp image
all right so that's that's a blur filter
you can use you can use inches as well
because why not
0.2 inches and you can use all those
kinds of links okay so that's blur let's
go to brightness you're going to use
from 1 to 100 100 being completely
bright zero being completely black or
dark or not bright and 50 being pretty
bright too but you can see how using
these these integers I'm able to change
the brightness of this of this image we
can also use percentages so let's say 4
percent is going to be a lot less but 40
40 percent bright it's gonna be pretty
dark 100 percent bright
is going to look like exactly what it
should be and then I think you can blow
it out by going beyond 100% ok that's
brightness so let's say contrast
contrast is similar to brightness it'll
take the same inputs being percentages
or numbers it's changed it to 500
contrast is high contrast and we can
also turn the contrast down by lowering
it below 100% so if you want like a
really cool like hipster Graham filter
you're probably going to use this a
little bit next one we're going to do is
grayscale grayscale will desaturate the
color so you can still see the red
because we're at 50% here but we if we
go to 100% grayscale it will knock out
the red now all the color completely
turn it into a black and white image 0%
grayscale is going to give you a full
color that one's pretty simple to
understand but you can also use numbers
as well but and we're going to use
numbers from 0 to 1 so if it's like 0 is
going to be completely full colored and
then 1 is going to be completely black
and white but you could say like 0.5 to
have that that 1/2 right so it's going
to be numbers or percentages with
grayscale next is invert invert will
invert the color so 100% invert it's
going to reverse all the colors so
everything on the color wheel remember
to color wheel we'll just jump to the
other side of it and the what's
interesting is that you can do
percentages of invert she's really funny
because if you hit a 50% invert
everything will meet in the middle of
the color wheel which is just like a 50%
gray it is nothing but on this side of
the invert you're just kind of going
closer to gray and on this side of the
invert you're coming further away from
the gray center towards the edges of
full invert next thing is opacity
opacity right now it's completely opaque
we can take it down to 70% opaque now
this is the completely the same as just
saying regular opacity like 0.7 why
would you use one over the other
well you don't really need to but an
interesting thing is that using filters
sometimes browsers will hardware
accelerate them so using filter opacity
at some future point might even be a
better idea than using opacity because
the browser will be able to handle it
better because it's hardware accelerated
meaning that your CPU is handling the
opacity instead of the browser itself
just a small detail not really necessary
to worry about it but you know it's
something that you could consider in the
future
next let's talk about saturate right now
we're at 70 we can go to 40 and it's
desaturating you're sucking the color
out if we get down to 0% it's going to
be completely black and white so 100% is
what like the image naturally is and
then we go beyond 100% to get a really
saturated kind of like poppy look you
use this in an Instagram filter as well
next let's talk about sepia sepia image
is like that yellow kind of stain kind
of old feel look to it it's a very
specific filter I mean you could
probably recreate it using a combination
of these filters you can turn it down by
doing 50% so you'd do something like
this and then like maybe a inset box
shadow and then all you got you all of a
sudden you up early bird filter from
Instagram alright let's jump to the next
one you rotate now this is an
interesting one because we're no longer
using see all these ones were done with
you know lengths or percentages or
numbers or percentages this one is going
to take an angle so you can say degrees
and what this does if you can imagine
the color wheel and you have a pin point
at like true north and that's the color
that you're at all the colors map to
that we're just going to rotate the
color wheel and your pin point is going
to stay there and we're going to kind of
rotate it around so how many degrees are
we rotating it will result in how far
the hues kind of like move right you
mind we're talking about the three
attributes of color of HSL we'll talk
about hue saturation and lightness
lightness is how bright it is which is
the brightness filter here saturation is
the saturate filter and here rotate is
that one Silla it's interesting you can
and also a for a pasty you can you can
cover all of the HSL A's
right here and it's very interesting
thing but hue rotate is is is really a
unique one you can have a lot of fun
with it it's pretty cool today they
included that there so you're going to
use angle with hue rotate now next is
drop shadow and drop shadow takes the
arguments similar to what box shadow
does which is going to be offset from
the top and bottom zero pixels 20 pixels
and then we're going to talk about the
blur like 30 pixels and then the color
black so you see this box shadow here it
looks I mean this is exactly the same as
a box shadow so why would you use filter
over box shadow well there's a really
really interesting and useful attribute
of filter is that it will not just look
at the shape of things but it will look
at the Alpha Channel as well so for
example I made this image right here of
the dev tips logo and it's just a white
ping but because it has an alpha channel
going on there the drop shadow will
conform to it so this is a ping image
and you see it's just a white logo of
dev tips and we can change the drop
shadow of it see what's happening there
60 pixels blur let's say let's just
change back to 30 and then let's change
the opacity here RGBA want to be a zero
zero zero black and 0.4 lighten it up a
little bit so you can do a lot of
interesting things you can add drop
shadows to text you can add drop shadows
to images you can add drop shadows to
CSS shapes and this is a little bit more
robust and intuitive then box shadow
which will just outline you know the CSS
box that everything is in and put a drop
shadow on like for example if I were to
put this in box shadow style you just
get the square of the image but but
filter drop shadow does a whole lot more
to enable you know like how how well
that drop shadow is actually applied to
the image in the way that you would
think it should be you know really cool
so these are all the awesome things that
filters can do in one
last thing I want to mention is that you
can actually load up your filters and do
multiple things at once so for example
let's say contrast and bump up the
contrast they're also blur it a little
bit by three pixels and we'll also take
the he rotate over a little bit about 20
degrees so you can do all that in one
CSS filter declaration and you can just
keep on adding them and making like
really interesting effects with with
images and you can also do these with
SVG's and a few other things but this is
a basic introduction to CSS filters if
you love CSS filters or you're just
excited about the prospect of using them
