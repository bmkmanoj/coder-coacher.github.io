is dedicated to everybody who watches
this show at work I know who you want ah
before we start the show and ask is
anybody else going to VidCon this
weekend if you are hit me up on twitter
at dip-dip show and let's you know hang
out for a bit also before we get started
I want to say that this series that
we've been doing lately has been the
most tiring but one I've ever done
there's a big difference between like
coding and talking about a few snippets
and then trying to code an entire page
on camera I feel like every week I'm
working on these videos to the last
minute in fact this is the second time
that I recorded this entire video I
messed up on the audio it was it was
really bad really frustrating but but
it's also been one of the most inspiring
video series that I've done here on DEP
tips you guys have been so awesome with
your likes and your shares your comments
are awesome and helpful and you know in
fact if you're watching these videos and
you're not reading the comments down
below you're missing out about half of
the value right away indeed a few of you
have even gone out of your way and
directly contributed to the project that
we're doing via github pull requests and
that is where we're going to start our
episode today so instead of moving on to
the next part of our project I want to
stop for a bit and talk about
collaboration over github and look at
the pull requests that have been
submitted by you guys also I have a
short list of things that I myself I
want to fix up and kind of get in order
before we move on okay super fun times
let's do this okay here we are with our
project up to date we have the header
here the About section that we did last
week and the footer so a lot of the
things that we're doing this week are
building upon and kind of refactoring
these things that we've done previously
so if we go to our dev tips github page
we can find our project that were
working in right now called artist theme
in the artist theme we have a few pull
requests now there's a lot of things I
wrote down earlier that I wanted to kind
of refactor for this next video and you
know not surprisingly enough it was
anything that was on your guys's mind we
have a few poll requests here from a few
people who wanted to help the project
and I'm really excited about it so let's
take a look at the first one the first
one is from Kahlua 13 and Kahlua is
let's take a look at the changes here's
the commit Kahlua is adding a using a
mix in from bourbon
of the order order instead of writing
the standard CSS as using a mix in which
what output the different vendor
prefixes so that's pretty cool and I
definitely want that so I can just go
ahead and just pull in this commit right
away because I know that it's exactly
what I wanted so go back and go to the
conversation and I'm going to merge this
pull request cool so that's merged into
our project so the artist thing we could
see now in our in our about sass that
it's now going to be using the order
mixin
so it's just that easy to collaborate on
github as long as I know what I'm doing
and I know that these are definitely the
changes I want I can just incorporate
the help that that Kahlua 13 is offering
so let's go back to those pull requests
and in the clothes section I can see
clue a 13 is here now this there's
another one here update about SAS comm
and I actually as I mentioned in the
intro this is the second time I recorded
this video I did pull in and accept this
change from ISA 3 or I set 3 I don't
know how you anyway and I set 3 helped
me out with the the enth child numbering
and so what that's talking about it is
here
I have it set to let's look in the About
section I have for example learn
learning here set to skill 10 and we can
obviously see that it's not 10 it's
actually nine and
that's because when I translated this
for loop I didn't put I didn't use I
didn't count up one and when I wrote it
out longhand I counted that for that by
saying plus nine instead of playing
saying plus eight but I needed to
account for that in the for loop so I
need to put like a way to number to push
this up one because it's a zero index so
let's take a look and see how that was
done by Issa three is the three where's
your commit there we are added the plus
one inside of the inside of the eye so
that's really cool I so I said that I
did already
commit it but then I uncommitted it just
to make this video I don't know kind of
a headache actually um but let's go back
to the pull request now this is not it's
my my name because I committed it again
but we're just going to go into ESA's
commit and we're going to merge that in
and say thanks a ton cool so now these
commits will be merged in to our project
so let's take a look at the oops
includes the assets the about SAS and we
can see that okay see that for loop has
a plus one on it so that way when this
Luke runs it'll say instead of you know
running nine here and stopping when I
ask it to do ten it'll run nine plus one
even though it's a zero index so that
will work for me I've already tested it
um now let's pull from my application
called tower now tower is an application
that I use because I don't really like
the command line I'm not very good at it
when it comes to get I'm getting better
but I'm not I'm not there I can only do
a few things so a tower is pretty great
I'm going to pull from origin because
already merged in those other a pull
requests and should go smoothly great so
well the first thing I'm going to see
when i refresh this is number one this
should be should be all the way to ten
how it was because we have that plus one
and which want to verify that looks true
and our refresh okay yeah that's exactly
what we wanted now the other thing that
was fixed was the order mixin right here
so if we go into our about sass we
should see that these are yeah they use
the mix in from from Bourbon that's
exactly what we wanted cool cool cool
cool cool cool now we're going to pull
in this last pull request by I Moritz
here and let's take a look at what he
has done if you remember from when we
made the visual design I put a let see
and like an overlay effect on the logo
of the footer to like give it this like
really cool colored effect but you know
when I coded it out I put just a like a
forty percent black on the logo but I'm
moretz's had a really clever way of
getting that to look just how I designed
it let's look at how he did that the
first thing he did is pretty clever
actually took that HTML the logo HTML
that we have and just change the
extension and made it an SVG now what
that is good for is because of what he
does with it now in the footer sass we
can see that he's using the SVG as a
background image you can't use an HTML
document as a background image that's
why he changed it to an SVG now we also
have a multiple image background here
the URL I sorry the SVG and then there's
a comma and then the URL for the hero
image now when you have a multiple
background image the background image
that's closest to you is going to be
first in a string and then and then the
next one is going to be behind that and
if you have a third and a fourth and you
add commas and the more that you add
after that they go they go further and
further away from you so the closest to
you is the first one and the furthest
from you is the last one and they stack
up in order but also every other
declaration has to have that same
order so the image is going to be 50 by
50 pixels while the background size but
the hero background is going to cover
and background position blend mode
okay so blend mode is actually the
secret sauce of what he's done we're
gonna say this logo to SVG it gets to
blend the background blend mode of
overlay and the URL for the hero
background you just get a background
blend mode normal cool and then the rest
in here is just kind of cleaning up
spacing and stuff because we're removing
the actual dot SVG in the HTML and
moving into a background image so he has
to make considerations for the logo size
like he's scooting the text out and
stuff like that right here it's good in
the context out a little 80 pixels so
that he make room for the background the
background of the logo and then same on
the footer HTML he's just kind of
getting rid of the HTML the footer sorry
getting rid of the logo in the footer of
the eighth of the markup here cool that
looks good so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to get so so notice that where
I'm at I'm at his forked version of the
dev tips thing artist theme in it so
it's I'm audits artist name I'm going to
grab his URL right here and we run over
to my github client I mean I'm going to
tell the github client I want to track a
new remote repository I'm gonna name it
I'm or it's it doesn't really matter
what I call it this is just my local
reference name and I'm gonna put the URL
and it should pull it down cool so it
pulled down so now I'm like basically
just I'm aware of his remote repository
I'm not doing anything with it yet I'm
just kind of Noah's there and when I say
to my local guy I say pull he's gonna
ask where I want to say pull from I'm
Moritz and pull it in and let's go look
at our changes
now if I'm right if I'm right the footer
should look something like this
it should have a overlay style on the
graphic instead of the dark grey that it
is now so one two three let's press
refresh cross our fingers and go oh man
look at that
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous so
he did it it works looks pretty good I'm
excited I'm happy with it
um let's pull it in so I'm gonna go back
to github and over to my pull requests
and click and merge green button for the
wins confirm cool so this has been
pulled in merged right now and closed so
when I go back to my pull requests
nothing is open and I'm going to go in
and pull actually I'm going to not track
I'm or it's a repository anymore I'm
just going to pull directly from the dev
tips repository which is called master
because it's mine pulling it in and I'm
gonna go here refresh everything should
still look good nothing should have
changed because um you know I didn't
change anything but I just wanted to
make my local work sync up with the
remote repository and that's kind of
where I'm at now like this is the most
current version anywhere on the planet
of this repository and it's on synced up
with dev tips repository that's cool now
I'm really excited that you know you
guys did this so I mean this this theme
I mean dip tips is kind of like I don't
know grow it a little bit instead of
just me talking to a camera like like
you guys are watching the videos and
sharing them you guys are commenting on
them really whoo the cool things giving
tips and you know to each other and
asking really awesome question that
everybody's kind of chipping in and
answering it so it's really cool to see
and now it's like one step further that
it's not just Travis I spoke myself in
third person not just
um kind of making this thing in front of
you it's so cool because it's actually
one step further you guys are now part
of dev tips I just can't express how
cool that is so I have a small list here
of things that I've done sorry I have a
small list of things here that I want to
do for this refactor and you know the
majority of the big things were actually
taken care of by these three heroes um
but there are a few more things so the
first thing is like write an actual
paragraph that lorem ipsum is lorem is
lame it's um ha ha ha little design joke
so that's what I'm talking about is
right here see this this placeholder
text is just placeholder text it's not
real I can't get a good sense of how
this is going to look when somebody uses
in furthermore I can't make a good
recommendation to somebody of how long
and what type of you know content they
should have if I'm not actually filling
it in so I want to write something here
to kind of give you guys a Q as in as to
what you should be filling this space
with so let's run over to the about HTML
and take care of this for real and it's
going to delete all of that and let's
see alright um capitalize a sentence for
starters
Travis specializes in making things for
human people most of the things he makes
are like computery stuff they're digital
interfaces that sounds better than
computer e stuff maybe but I want to
talk about a few the other interests I
have um he also puts effort into
crafting I do I do music I do the music
for deaf tips I have like a pretty big
interest in this type of this auto or
I'll die like that
I call them my next um next level beats
and also YouTube right and also YouTube
videos about making codes happen alright
um that's a pretty good paragraph so I
mean I don't want to talk too much about
like the tone of writing but your copy
matters right I mean if your client is
gonna read these things and gonna read
yours he's read a million of them so you
have to stand out with just like a
little bit of you know a little bit of
personality so when I run over here and
refresh it what's that's pretty good
it's only four lines there's a lot
shorter than my placeholder text was and
it kind of you know cinches up this
space here so it makes it a bit more
scrollable oh let me put this
oops I put this
make things for here people honest put a
bold in here so I can add villages I
like that lead luckily it looks Java is
Chaves travel eyes Travis specializes in
making things for human people most of
the things he makes her digital
interfaces but he also puts effort into
crafting next level or level next level
beats and YouTube videos about making
codes happen cool so I want to hyperlink
these things up digital interfaces I'll
link to my my brand my website so ah
what am I so bad at highlighting stuff
right now alright a riff that's gonna be
HTTP trust oh so calm and then next
level beats will also be highlighted
I'll just link that up to my soundcloud
um HTTP soundcloud.com / Travis space or
- Nielsen the wait is they only account
I have this space or - and then uh
YouTube videos
HTTP oh whoa hey ref hey Ref I'm
youtube.com slash user slash dev tips
did you guys know the name of this
channel is actually dope tips for
designers the initial idea was to make a
channel to help designers to get better
at coding but turns out more than just
designers want to know about code so
that's you guys
okay plus refresh over here and see what
happens okay it looks cool but one thing
right like these links are blue they are
blue they're blue why are they blue
they're blue because let's get rid of
all this mess here they are blue because
our base is defining our links as link
color link color is defined in the tools
in the VARs actually this is still in
base link color alright so what I want
to do right away oh I know that I want
to move this up here and that way I can
make link color an accent
now it's refresh good nice gold color
cool looks really good
I think I really like that my face is
even gold oh speaking of which this face
is kind of serious and it doesn't like
really portray the tone here so I made
um have this other image of my face
which is kind of silly face but in fact
I call it the trap ATAR I use this space
for some accounts I don't use that
instead here you know everything should
be considered like with the tone and
stuff and where's my rabbit our face
image oh this is in the CSS weird why'd
I do it that way
to me about
is it a ping but why is that our travitt
our time J thing Oh what is it doing
there so what's going to images okay
there it is okay so sure this is just
pointing out a big problem that I had
actually with that I just kind of I
didn't do it right I didn't do it right
now look at this image here's what
here's what happened this face look at
that it's a square image with a circle
in it like so the image is actually
circular but I know that like the whole
site is based on you know like circles
and stuff so like why would I leave it
up to you know leave it up to whoever's
gonna put their face in here to get it
wrong if not that you guys you dev
tippers are going to get it wrong but
generally if we're building a template
for somebody you want to take the like
the obnoxious choices away from them or
early fit obnoxious tasks right not
really a choice I mean it is but like
you you know that the style of it is
based around hard lines and circles so
why would I have a squared image there's
no squares or anywhere else so let's
take a look at making this making this
proper oh I just noticed this when I
tried to change the URL the travitt are
that the travitt are is actually in the
sass right here which you know it makes
a lot of sense if you're going to be
deeply controlling the if you're you
know if you're going to be editing the
sass but if I want to make this as easy
as possible I want to level these things
out I want to bubble these things up to
the configure file really so check this
out somebody's already defined the name
they already find the description in
your email avatar dravot r dot jpg okay
save that go into the about and we're
going to cut this all right face image
and also okay well first let's run into
the about HTML face image
then I know what you're thinking you're
thinking whoa travis has gone crazy he's
doing an inline style and you know what
you're probably right but the point of
this inline style is that it makes it
easy for the next person sorry that's
not what I wanted to do it makes it easy
for the for the user who just wants a
quick template for their website to fill
in a quick configure file and all a
sudden boom they have a beautiful
website so here's how we do this now
because it's in the configure it's this
is a site-wide um I already talked about
it when I did this but it's a site-wide
variable so I'm going to say site dot
have tar and I actually only did the URL
of it let me say here yeah so I want you
say background image URL travitt are
that's the part that needs to be
templatized not this part right is that
right
there's your bright refresh nope didn't
work why not
background image slap slash site avatar
oh I know I um whenever you mess with
the configure file it's kind of is just
like a jackal thing you know just
Jacqueline you have to go into your
Jekyll and quit oops
come in options or ctrl C to quit press
up to get that last thing you wrote back
and press ENTER to basically a restart
Jekyll now you might think oh that's
just stupid but you know keys to
consider what's happening here Jekyll is
running Jekyll uses the configure file
once to set up the site and it's done it
doesn't read these things every time so
it makes sense that we have to restart
Jekyll again so when I restart check
alone first refresh there should be my
face dang it where's my face okay at
least I did the did it right here URL
assets image travitt are jpg why is that
now we tra VI turay the ITA our image TR
AV I ta
oh that's weird I have URL URL inside of
this background image what did I do
oh that's weird
I'm sorry I'm kind of an idiot okay and
background image and spell my goodness
you guys watch this stuff and you're
like yeah I knew that the whole time you
but you're watching the code you're not
seeing me being an idiot in my bedroom
late at night okay that should be better
these kind of mistakes or just because
I'm you know whatever and you know
you're thinking I caught that way before
Travis did
we'll look buddy you're just smarter
than me okay this is a you know I'm
dumber than you think okay now one thing
I know is I want to kind of get that
circle back in there and that's really
easy to do and are about or it sorry
about SAS we're going to do Boreas fix
percent and done cool so that's good
that all looks super fly another thing I
want to do is I want to make this stuff
easy again so configure file I want to
do this blurb now the cool thing about
um I mean the cool thing about the cool
thing about this can fix stuff is that I
mean you can do all of you can put
markup inside of of this so if I I mean
you know what I mean that's pretty cool
right it doesn't need to be just just
plain text 'ok and you can put strong
tags you can put links and stuff in the
configure and then when i put i go in
the configure here and i right mustache
mustache site dot blurb mustache
mustache save or restart my server
because I remember that when I'm doing
Jack Lee stuff and I edit the config I
need to restart my server but look at
that it's done like you know changes it
just
anyway so this makes it easier for
somebody coming behind me to you know to
customize this theme I'm going to write
their own blurb right here I mean
ideally they'd only have to edit two
things right like a settings sass which
I have was called bars maybe I should
change that to settings and you know a
configure file for the for the content
content and style that's cool right they
got to go in here and change these
labels but we're not going to take this
too far
great let's go back over and take a look
at move the color depths they use okay
did that did that h3 general style okay
so what I'm talking about here is I have
an h3 in my About section h3 is a
general more general kind of style it
shouldn't be here
this is too too specific of a sass
document for a general thing like that
so I'm gonna go into base and put it
under my body
yeah that's pretty easy that's just what
I wanted to do because it doesn't make
sense because there's other you know I
mean there's there's other sections so
I'm going to have HD h3 that need this
exact same style but I was hogging in
the style about about dots a so it's
dumb in a world worked out the same
really but but for legacy sake and for
having clean organized in modular codes
sake we're going to make sure that the
declarations and the styles for specific
things go where they're supposed to go
and no anywhere else so alright did I do
this the profile image should be easily
replaceable and not a circle or not a
circle graphic I think we already did
that configure easily replaceable
travitt are okay cool the header image
should be easily replaceable also okay
so that's going to the background BG
dash image is going to be what what what
are you going to be
um header dot since this guy hero alt
let me pause this I pause this I just
noticed this is kind of lame I have this
really cool cool cool a graphic style
here and then at the top of is boring
grey one what am i doing what am i doing
so why don't we just merge the code for
both of these and kind of like take care
of it like like we should and and then
we'll go back into making sure that this
image header is easily replaceable one
to show up and both of them quite easily
so this is how we're going to do that
we're going to go to the footer where
the where the where the school stuff is
and I just noticed something I want to
change here I want to call this
background image and I want to call I
want to make another declaration called
background 3-peat know - repeat no -
three-peat and then I can take that off
here and the center Center you already
taken care of right here but you know
the reason I did this is because when
you do background image of the short
hand like this like as it was it can be
a little bit conflict II with background
size and not sure about background but
background size can be sad if if it
thinks that background is not including
it I'm just talking stupid right now but
background size can be conflicting with
background shorthand so I'll break
everything out and to like throw long
hand phrasing so when I say background
image right there just so I can be safe
and I'm going to take this and X go into
my placeholders I'm gonna call this
placeholder BG IMG or - oMG and there we
are now go back on my footer and go at
extend PG IMG now nothing should have
changed right here
nothing should have changed in the
actual rendered CSS code
the only difference where is that
rendered CSS where'd you go oh you're in
sight let me show you the only
difference is that instead of the you
know footer there's nothing where's the
footer code okay
instead of that footer right here having
the background style for it it's going
to be right here right you just moved it
up it took though it took these styles
and moved them under the placeholder
selector of a - background image this
doesn't benefit us as is but I want to
make this snippet of code reusable so
when I go over to header where's header
stats I can get rid of these two things
and I can write at extend background
image so when I go back over to CSS we
can see that here we are this compiled
our selectors on top so they're both
using this same declaration right here
now I can control them better because I
want to have a same image in both of
them and let's do that if I want to say
background image is going to be um hero
like this which I do config okay
then that means that I need to take
again this background image out of the
sass and put it in the markup similar to
what I've done here with the face uh
face left header
it's getting late I'm my brain is
slowing down like a header this is what
I want no yes right here
okay style background-image:url a slash
assets slash image slash mustache
mustache site the dot was it background
image BG - IMG and then mustache mush -
ooh actually that needs to be the second
one the first one needs to be this is
getting complicated uh I'm going to have
two images and that first one's going to
be low ago I don't have a logo to find
here that's another thing I need to do a
logo and you're defined as what logos
SVG now this may seem like I don't know
I mean at least I hope you guys don't
think I'm going crazy by doing all this
in lining styling but but honestly this
is going to make it easier for for
people who come after and start you know
inputting their own images here it's
going to make a lot make it a whole lot
easier for them exhibit just one central
place and then it will propagate
throughout the site we're doing a little
bit of like the hard lifting right now
so logo dot SVG logo nope yep yep so
and this actually needs to be deleted
all right cross your fingers let's see
what we did is good uh it's not let's
restart our server that's what it is
hopefully restart Jekyll and oh good it
did work
look at that super beautiful I want to
do the same to the footer
and in the footer SAS we can nope that's
good and then in the header sounds a
header says where are you that'll looks
good we just need to remove from our
placeholder the images because this is
now in the markup so let's refresh and
you look fantastic
and you look kind of good your have bad
margins but that's understandable that
was going to happen anyway if we do back
much copy from placeholder it's this guy
right here just needs to be overwritten
boom and then we want to say it's going
to be 20 pixels from the top refresh
there we go
so ah you look beautiful you look
beautiful we're all beautiful and these
are easily defined by a user who comes
in here and says background image is
gonna be here Oh
logo is going to be logo I'm going to
reorder these things logo background
image avatar blurb um and then all right
all right here this is how you comment
stuff
like that okay Oh beautiful beautiful
okay what else did I need to do the
header should be easily replaceable got
that done the header image would be
defined in a settings sass there is no
settings assets bars so Travis that was
just dumb but also I defined heading in
in the app config and I kind of like it
there because I'm doing the logo right
next to it
bourbon order was taken care of our pull
request icons space around okay let me
show you what that is these icons I
noticed they're they're like a little
tight now I just looking at them and I
notice that I use the wrong I use the
wrong CSS for this right here I wrote a
flexbox space around right if I let me
just turn this thing colors you see
what's going on yeah pink okay so look
at that see that space right there there
is a flexbox area to where I can like
make this pencil and this play button or
the YouTube play thing all the way to
the edge and then it'll just give me a
little bit more space between everything
right now it's getting half of the space
right here and then you know have you
know one one one one so I'm not
explaining that very well but watch if I
take space around and make its paste
between its spaces out better right
that's the difference and I like space
between better so I go to go to Macias
where our use about sass and instead of
saying space around I want to say space
between that's what that is and refresh
and it looks good looks good alright I
like it okay alright next on create a
render
folder okay this last item is the last
thing we're going to do tonight thank
you for everybody for paying attention
and hanging out this far if you enjoyed
this video please share it with
everybody who else needs to see it and
this whole series there is a link there
is a playlist where all the videos of
this series go into and that can be
easily shared on Twitter if you liked it
please do that so I want to create a
folder called underscore rendered and
what this is going to do is help
everybody who doesn't want to run Jekyll
locally so I got a lot of comments like
ah I want to get this CSS but I don't
want to render I don't want to run
Jekyll oops not that move your trash but
I want to run Jekyll can you can I you
know this and that so um yeah sorry guys
this is what I wanted to do underscore
in 3rd and in here I will put it
actually all of this content actually
not all of it but most of it no not much
now what I'm doing with this is I'm
tricking I'm tricking Jeckle because
Jekyll will upload all this stuff but it
won't include underscore site in fact if
you look at my get ignore file wherever
the heck that is I can't see it it will
tell you look at my get ignore on on on
github getting more says that we should
ignore anything you know that's in the
site and that's that that would happen
anyway even if I didn't define it and
get ignore file but um underscore
rendered is going to show up now and you
guys can like watch if I launched this
in in chrome it will just be well what
do you know it didn't work
oh gosh I'll tell you why this didn't
work that's because the images are
absolute - assets and there's no watch
this is what I meant to say that's what
I meant that's what I meant
so you're going to have to fix those
when you if you want to download this
directly from the rendered files but um
you know it's it should be a lot easier
for you than than downloading The Naked
Jekyll installation and then running
Jekyll because you just want to see what
we're doing and follow along so this is
going to have all the rendered CSS in
here assets you know just it's just
going to be the CSS you guys can follow
along and see what we've done if you
don't want to do sass and you don't want
to do Jekyll that's there for you and
