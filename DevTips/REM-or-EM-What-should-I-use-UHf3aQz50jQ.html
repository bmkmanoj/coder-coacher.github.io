tips a few weeks ago I made a video
called CSS units and the things we're
talking about this week are directly
related to what we talked about that
week so you might want to go back and
check out that video already if you
haven't or not I'll never know but
coding Santa will is making a list in
that video I covered all the different
types of units that you could follow a
number within CSS so things like pixels
inches vh percents M's Rams all that
kind of stuff and in the comments I got
a really great question that I think
would make for a great discussion today
Georgio asks yo trav if you had to
choose one or which one would you choose
the most REMS or Em's and I told him
that as with most questions once you get
a bit of knowledge surrounding the topic
it just depends so today I want to
explain what are some you know in my
mind good opportunities to use one of
the other REMS or MS I mean literally in
preparation for this video I sat down at
a code editor for two days just to get
my ideas straight so don't just take my
word for it you know crack open your own
code editor roll up them sleeve ease you
know take it for a spin and see what you
think but right now let me try to teach
thousands of people something that I
just made up yesterday no just kidding
it was the day before that
yesterday's example we're gonna be using
code pin code pin is awesome because
it's available via the web turn nets and
you guys can find it right now there is
a link in the description below we have
a very simple page layout established
already I mean we have a headline here a
paragraph and a button and what we're
gonna be doing is looking at how each of
these can apply different units
different aspects of their style to make
a really good and scalable design
that'll make sense in just a second
before I start designing any text nodes
I want to establish the fundamental kind
of baseline font size for the page to do
that I target the root element with this
special selector it's like this are OoT
root now that will target the root
element and I'm using sass so I don't
need any curly braces let's say font
size and I'm gonna use pixels right now
16 pix
very good very good and so when I view
compiled I'm gonna have an error the
reason I have an error is because using
SAS I knew that I need to escape this
colon here so I'll just put in an escape
in front of it now when I have you
compiled you should have route font size
16 so I'm kind of making a point of this
because I want you to understand why
there's an escape in front of that colon
right there normally you'll write it
with how the call in there is route font
size 16 pixels so the route font size is
16 pixels and that will set the kind of
like tone for everything else we're
going to be doing now that I have the
route established I'm gonna go into the
individual text nodes and kind of set
the tone for them and we're gonna start
with the h1 and I'll say font - sighs
let's do - 3 R M REMS are relative to
the route size so 3 REMS time 16 3 times
16 is 48 so we literally have a 48 pixel
dimension text size right here for the
headline hello there you look nice well
sort of before we go too far you see how
this the text is spreading all the way
across the body I don't like that so I'm
gonna write body and I'm gonna give it a
width defined in in REMS so if I say 16
times 40 whose big everything that's 640
right and and then I'll just do margin
50 pixels Auto Center it why did i do
rim right there I did REM because if
we're gonna be changing our font size
like let's say we're gonna bump this up
to 24 hour our whole page will scale up
did you notice that our h1 scaled up to
3 times the font size and then our or
even our body width which you could say
like oh that's kind of an analogous to
the grid if you're using a grid in REMS
that would scale up to so everything
just jumped up really fast or 16 again
and we're not having any weird resizing
and stuff in fact let me show you this
this is kind of a cool trick if I hit
star in CSS that means select everything
and I'll put trends is shown all in
300 milliseconds ease in out this should
be fun
okay now let's go back here and say 24
again
everything's jumping around and
animating it's fun 16 okay let's go down
to this body text and you know the font
size size I just want it to be one rim
and I'm doing all of the text nodes
themselves in rem you know and I'll
continue that pattern with when I go to
this anchor tag here anchor actually
what did we call it call it button I
want to do font size why am I putting a
0 in the - one REM and nothing has
changed let me do a few quick other
styles to this button to make it look
like a button text
now notice that I've used one REM for
the text size the font size of the
button and then for all these other
things I used one pixel and this is the
old trav speaking and let's see what
would happen if we bump this back up to
24 for example what happened in this
button here it still looks like this
this border is is one pixel wide well
what if we did this border 1 M so let's
change back to 16 okay it's still
ridiculous so let's say you we have to
do it we have to make a little
calculation here if I want the border to
be one pixel at 16 pixels when like the
rim is 16 pixels then then I have to do
1 divided by 16 which is 0.0625 I think
so that's that's the m's but that's
based on m's right so think about this
for a second this border width is coming
from this number
not this number because it's because
it's m's not REMS so if I put it at REM
right now nothing changes because font
size right here is 1 rim but what if I
put this it makes this all the buttons
at 4 R M so the the border itself
doesn't change even though the button is
just so the gluon text is so crazy big
so that's why I want to say I'm gonna
make this button the border based on M
right because M s are based on the
actual font size of this unit so we're
being kind of like atomic here we have
the font size based on REMS which is
based on the baseline of the document
that we set up but all the things that
are attached to that button I want them
to be on m's because I want them to be
associated with the with the atomic
structure of the button itself right I
don't want the
order being being styled based on the
document of font sizes and this is the
whole point of the video the whole
emphasis of the whole video is that I'm
thinking that the REMS should be on text
nodes and that m's should be on things
attached to the text notes for example
look at the padding on this button it's
all wrong that's because it's in pixels
but if I put the padding top as one rem
and the padding here is 1.5 rim it
doesn't really change much because REM
is associated with the document level
kind of styles the root up here right
but I don't want the padding of a button
to be associated with the root so again
I'll change it to M's and look at how
much more sue did these things are to
the button itself let's say padding top
is gonna be 0.8 m/s and then you can be
0.26 good okay and now in this when this
button goes up to like four rims the
padding is still proportional to the
button itself right let's see if we can
do the same with border-radius
so let's take these pixels and say if
we're gonna have so 1/16 is 0.65 and
times that by 3 pixels that's what we
want to get that's gonna be 0.1875 m's
now our border-radius looks good big and
small let's change this back to 1 rim
see man
ooh this button this button is just
making me feel so good right now
it's making me feel so good I love it
ah yeah for the last thing I want to
show you is just how to control these
things all to make them really effective
on on mobile so right now we're working
on the desktop I'm sitting here with my
big monitor and it's all very big and I
want to make this a more comfortable
read for people who are gonna be on
mobile right and I don't want them
squinting at how small this text is so I
want to change what it normally reads at
from 16 back up to
24 now this is going to be what's normal
and then I want to change it for desktop
kind of override the font size at the at
the desktop level so I want to say at
media min-width let's say 800 pixels and
this is just because I have a big screen
I want to show you an example if it was
gonna be mobile probably do like 640 or
maybe like 700 pixels but whatevs so
what are we gonna do when the browser
gets smaller than 800 pixels let's
change the font size of the root element
to be back to 16 that's when it gets
bigger okay so when it gets smaller we
move this browser and smaller we get the
nice kind of comfortable reading on your
phone and everything has scaled up
alright let me put some padding on this
padding is one rim yeah so everything
scales up and it's nice and comfy so
this button looks good in proportion to
itself so I hope that this was a good
example of what's been going going on in
my mind about the question of when do
you use rims when do you use em and when
do you use pixels these are my weird
ideas on the topic and you know usually
