traveled back in time to make my parents
fall in love it I mean I'm here to fix
some codes but I'm still time-traveling
ah no really look at this beard crazy
huh
consider this video three point five in
this current series for those of you
watching this series week by week you're
gonna be like what is he talking about
now but for those of you tuning in for
the first time and watching the playlist
in order you're gonna be like whoa look
at that beard he can time-travel it's
come to my attention that I made a
mistake early on in this project and
it's a subtle one and so it makes sense
now that I look back on it how this
mistake occurred and this is how it
happened number one I showed you how to
make a site using Jekyll but I used the
Jekyll new command to show you how to do
that number two when I set up this
project in video number four I already
had a lot of the site structure already
completed but I did not show you how or
why I set up my folder structure this
way and thus I broke the axle of time
but I'm here to fix that that's what
we're going to do right now I've created
something I call the dev tip starter kit
here we have just a very very basic
index.html and we link to the essential
files like my main CSS I'm including
jQuery too and I have a script page set
up called functions J s also I have it
set to where it's going to be a
responsive website by default saying
that the device is the device width and
we have a favicon a link set up already
now you can put the title in there and
just start coding right here now let me
show you how this folder structure is
set up as you can imagine images is
empty because there's no images in this
starter kit and the JavaScript folder
here has the jQuery that I talked about
and functions is ready functions has a
document ready statement saying that
after the document of the Dom has loaded
we're going to begin executing any
functions that we have here now we've
never talked about this in dev tips yet
but it's ready for us and we're going to
be talking about it soon in fact on our
artists theme but that's way in the
future remember
here we are in the CSS now this is
probably what I skipped over the most
and here to fix it so we have two main
ideas here number one we have a bunch of
isolated folders that will help us to
kind of keep our code really clean and
separate and easy to find what we're
looking for and then we finally have the
main dot sass now I think we called this
all dot sass in our artist theme but
it's the same concept in this main dot
sass we're importing the index for each
one of these folders see they all have
an index now this index is an important
page because what it does is import
everything else in the page now when the
index imports everything in the page and
then the main imports every index and
this all compiles down to one single CSS
file which is exactly what we want we
want the browser to only ever have to
call one CSS file from our server thus
cutting down significantly on page load
time now the folders that I have here
will start at the beginning tools in
tools I put all of the kind of CSS and
all the libraries that I'm not going to
be touching generally so I have
normalized here which will give me kind
of just the standard you know browser
resets that are that are really
important for every web project I have
here bourbon which is important it's an
important sass mixin library for me I
use it all the time
and what I really like about bourbon is
that it's there just mix-ins they they
are not pre compiled code if you run
bourbon right like we're compiling our
sass none of this is none of her bed
right like bourbon didn't prescribe us
to have any output so if you include
bourbon into a project but never use any
of those mix ins it will equate it to
not having bourbon in your project at
all if you don't use it it equates to
nothing and there's no problem in just
leaving it there so I include it in
every project and I use it when I need
it it's really great to have I've made a
whole series about bourbon you guys know
how I feel about bourbon love bourbon
also I have here
the last in the last import is the fonts
now this will change from time to time
but generally once you have your fonts
set up for the project it's not going to
change and here I'm just showing you how
I imported the Google font face the
Google font open sans as the font face
so it's going to be the default to the
projects now after I have the tools I'm
going to have the base there's a base
index which includes first the VARs the
VARs are the variables and right now I
just have a bunch of color set up here
like the primary color what does the
text going to be the accent color the
background links selections you know
like when you highlight things with your
mouse so all of these are set here and
you can add tons of tons and tons of
variables to this as your project grows
and you use these variables throughout
and then in base this is the first time
that we're actually writing CSS that's
going to output in in our project so I
have typography presets talking about
headline statements paragraphs and
different type of graphic elements and
then I have the links setting the link
color and selections and then some basic
body styles including setting the font
family for the project and the
background color and that type of thing
cool so that's the base now the modules
mod I have nothing in the index yet I
have nothing here modules are going to
be very very project specific thing
they're going to be like what is the
header look like or what does a contact
form look like what does a you know what
is a pop-up modal look like or what is a
confirm message or an alert look like
these are all going to be very
contextual to the projects so I've set
up the folders but I haven't done
anything in it and if you don't ever put
anything in it and use this thing it's
still fine because there's nothing in
the modules index it's still compiling
to zero so it's not going to take up
space it's going to be fine and the same
goes with pages that's the next
subfolder here so this is where you
going to put your styles that are
specific to the about a page right of
your website or the contact page or the
features page of your product or the
you know the homepage are going to have
very specific styles to that page not
their modules but the page itself like
the structure and layout well that's
going to go here in the pages area
sometimes I call it layouts I think
actually in the now I'm thinking about
it in the artist theme we don't have is
this just one page so I have this being
called sections is basically the same
concept again so the naming is a
slightly different but the concepts are
still there this is this is how I do it
okay this has been a tour of the dev tip
starter kit I'm going to upload this on
to github so you can download it and
kind of follow along as we build out the
artist theme project that you're
currently watching this is a you know an
interjection dove episode in that series
or you can download it and use it for
whatever you like it doesn't matter it's
a good starting point
in general for making small websites so
that's up on github for you to download
right now but before we don't this video
I want to show you a few tips on how to
use it okay so the first thing is you'll
notice that in the index.html all of
these links have a slash before the word
asset this means every time that the
asset is called
it's going to start at the root
directory and then work its way back
even if you're in a sub page like if
you're like this is the index right now
but if it's like slash team or company
and then that index you can still do
slash assets because it'll jump back to
the root and then find the main dot CSS
in order to use it you have to be using
a server right like a web service you
can FTP this up to your server and that
will work just fine but to do it locally
you have to run a local server okay now
one really quick and easy way to do that
is to use this application which is a
free download called pre pros it works
for both Mac and Windows and the vit and
the free version has a server built into
it so when you do load this project into
that server it will start up a blank web
page and it will be hosting so these
route calls to the CSS to the JavaScript
to you know all your images and stuff
those will
work properly if you download this Deb
tip starter kit and then try to open the
index.html right there it won't work the
links will all be broken okay it's
important that you have a server running
and there's a few different ways but
this is probably one of the easier ones
especially if you don't want to touch
the command line right just yet also
another really easy way is to use Jekyll
like I showed you in the last episode
right where that's what we're doing with
the artist theme and it works out just
great but right now I'm going to show
you with pre pros so I have my dev tip
starter kit and I have pre pros open
here I'm going to drag my project onto
the pre pros window and it's going to
just launch a project right here all I
have to do is go down this little globe
right here and then it will open this
project in a new window so let me show
you that I'm going to inspect the
element here and then open the for
example the head and you can see that
this is the HTML file that I'm looking
at up here in fact let's just say
see how that pops up one another another
nice benefit from pre pros is that it
does live refreshing or Auto refreshing
so on every save it's just going to
update your HTML page without you having
to switch to it and press refresh so
that's quite nice but it's just it's
just an added benefit the real the real
feature that we're looking for is the
server here so um hmm let me show you
that the server is working and then the
assets are included so I'm gonna go over
here to the resources frames localhost
and I'm going to check that my scripts
are all here that's my that's my
functions
that's my jQuery and my stylesheet
that's my main so it's all working you
can see that the style is all there and
this is how you do it
so again just to cover all the all the
touch points it's on github you can
download it using the link in the
description below and also it's a you
have to be using a server and I
recommend using a server every time you
code locally even if it's a Jekyll
server if it's a pre Pro server if it's
a HTTP simple server using using Python
ah I'm going back to the future' guys
this is it I'm out thanks for watching
and you know leave a comment if you have
any questions I know this is weird that
I'm like making why I'm making three
point five video and we're on like
episode number ten in the future but I
just wanted to show off my beard to the
people in the past which is you know you
guys watching this for the first time
anyway much love take it easy talk to
you soon watch the next video I don't
know bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
