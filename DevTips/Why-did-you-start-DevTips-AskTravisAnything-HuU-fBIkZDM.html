podcast name was late nights with trav

hmm but this episode that's going to be
happening tonight is extra special
what's so special about it this evening
we're hosting the world premiere of
design disruptors on the red carpet at
the historic castro theater a
documentary by envision right and vision
made a documentary they did it is the
world premiere tonight mm-hmm we're
going to be on the red carpet talking to
people the people who are featured in
the film the people who were involved in
creating the film the people who are
involved in financing the film we're all
we're going to be there front row and
we're going to bring those discussions
that video footage straight to you and
you can find that on the facebook feed
of envision and it's going to be
starting at five p.m. pacific time time
uh-huh so it's going to be live facebook
video louis and i are going to be
hosting it's going to be incredible but
right now we're going to answer an ass
travis anything question so i have a
question for you lows I'm ready this
question comes from torana vir Baines
terrain of your asks i'm reading this
that's why I'm looking down here guys
can I look down there too you can make
no you oh my god you make eye contact
while I am making this sound you
distract them with your beautiful eyes
yes here we go I'm curious to know why
you started dev tips and what is it that
keeps you going you have a full-time job
a family probably a whole host of other
responsibilities that were not aware of
and despite all this you're still able
to create such amazing content all
thanks turn taranta beer so I'm going to
talk about why I made dev tips but then
let's both talk about like what keeps us
going on the various projects that we do
okay let's relate this out
do it all right so first of all why did
I start def dibs the story is actually
pretty fun I used to work at a company
that did like analytics for online video
all online video we're talking facebook
video Twitter video vines Instagram and
YouTube as well when we started out we
did this we have his tools that we're
building for youtubers and as a designer
I feel it's important to understand the
people in the process that I'm designing
for right and I was not a youtuber I did
not know what it was like to upload a
video to YouTube so i made a video and
uploaded it to youtube well i decided
that i should get into that process get
into you know like was it like to answer
the questions of people who watch the
videos what does it like to stress over
the release date of the video so i kept
on going and depth tips kind of just
rolled out like that mm-hmm and it's
been quite a right wild ride we just
passed the third year anniversary just
last weekend at VidCon oh that's right I
registered the name dev tips at VidCon
on the show floor that's really cool I
remember you were jazz when he came back
it was jazzed yeah closed jazz hands
alright so question is what keeps what
keeps it going what keeps you going on
two projects that you do Louis um what
keeps me going is knowing that I can own
the project in its entirety no matter if
I am a junior designer straight out of
school or a senior designer or design
lead the understanding that i have full
influence on the project is what keeps
me going now are you talking about like
side projects on your own you're talking
about things that you would handle
professionally at your occupation for
your employer i'm talking about both and
and so for my employer knowing that I
have full influence on on anything that
I touch is fantastic and I keeps being
going and it took me a while to realize
that I'm not a puppet or you know the
person that knows how to use design
software that I'm right I have real
influence on design solutions so that's
what keeps me going right now mmm and
then on the side and like I own my
projects cuz their mind yes yeah yeah
it's kind of easier to sew ownership is
a really big driver for you it is
that's great yeah I like how you say you
can have ownership even though it's the
work is for your employer we talked a
little bit about on our podcast
previously on one episode that if you
touch it you own it no matter what it is
because you put your stank on it all
that's thing you put your stank on
anything then people expect you to
follow through and so it kind of like
basically what you commit to is your
legacy is your name is your grant your
brand exactly right for me what keeps me
going is a myriad of things we talked
about in a previous ask Travis anything
about how to avoid burnout and I
mentioned that you know you can avoid
burnout you can keep working you can
keep working hard as long as you believe
in what you're doing okay and I believe
in dev tips I believe in trav and lows
and when we get emails or more messages
you know like you know thank you because
you've helped me get my job or my first
website was published or you know like
even I'm just starting out and this is
making it easier for me those are those
are all really great messages and help
reinforce my personal narrative that I
build about the work that I'm doing that
that it is intended to help others mhm I
feel incredibly fortunate to have the
opportunities that I do in life and I
feel almost all most responsible to help
others to receive the same and dev tips
is a great outlet for that and so is our
podcast and so that's that's where we're
going to end this ask Travis anything
ask trav and Louis anything oh yeah
that's right and be sure to to come join
us tonight this this day is not over
like it's literally in just a few hours
we're going to be on the red carpet

having a fun time introducing you guys

here at the premiere the world premiere

specific questions for them then you
