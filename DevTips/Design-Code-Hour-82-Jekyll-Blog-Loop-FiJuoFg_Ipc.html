design and code my personal website in
12 hours in the last video we marked up
and styled the articles section and in
this video we're going to be using the
power of Jekyll to add posts to our blog
and use a Jekyll loop to pull them into
the home page this is really cool this
is the main reason we are using Jekyll
now as our site builder so let's get
into it
alright we're picking up right where we
left off in our last video and our job
right now is to create a space where we
can can start to build articles and also
get those articles looping through here
and so we want their thumbnails if I
just hover over one of these things we
see that we want the thumbnail and we
want the name and the date so we need to
build a loop as well that pulls this
information from the articles puts it on
our page so let's start with just let's
start with let's start with let start
with the articles in Jekyll you to build
articles you go into you just create a
new folder and you call it underscore
not in assets no no no no you call it
underscore posts now posts is a magic
folder in Jekyll anything that you put
into posts becomes content for an
article let me take you over to Jekyll
and if you go to Jekyll there's great
documentation about that go to a
documentation section and the link here
writing posts now this will give you a a
template for the naming of the files so
let's grab this here let's just grab
that there and I want to add a new file
and I want to name it this so the naming
structure is that the year the month and
the day and then the name of the post
and then you could the extension can be
either MD for markdown or dot HTML
whatever you want so I'm going to use
markdown and then in here
I need to put something called head
matter to talk about head matter in this
thing here we are
head matter head matter is a is a Jekyll
and it's not Jekyll it's a it's a yam
all thing so you need three dashes and
then three dashes inside of those three
dashes I'm going to put some very
important key value pairs the first one
is the the template or rather the layout
the first one is that the template that
it's going to be using so when this what
does it call this blog post is rendered
right it's going to create an HTML page
for it when it's rendered where's it
gonna place that content so you need to
make a layout for it and we're gonna use
default now what is default when you go
back to here to layouts and click
default that's what that is so it's just
gonna stick it in and here like naked
it's gonna be very boring but you could
make one you can make a layouts you know
a template that's like you know
specifically for blog posts and it would
be you know special it would have like a
blog header or something like that and
in there in here you would say layout
posts right but we're not doing that
we're just what Zee okay we're just
doing default the next thing I need for
for my purposes is the the title and
this one I'll call a new year I guess
New Year's Eve New Year's Eve Eve is
awesome and then the last bit of
information I need is that we talked
about here alright so I have the date
that's come from that comes from the the
the name of the file itself and I have
the article named New Year's Eve is
awesome I just need the thumbnail
s'alright thumb nail
that's nice both um now and I need the
URL to the thumbnail in this case I have
already loaded here assets images posts
thumbnails so I have post - one
thumbnail that I can just use right here
it's this lady's face and where was it
here we are
I'll say post - one dot jpg or no this
is a pink all right and then in each of
the in each of these blogs you can have
content so I'll just write hello world
okay so now we have the layout the title
the thumbnail and then we have some
content in our post let's just command W
to get rid of that page and then command
W get rid of the inventory and let's get
rid of all these templates or these mix
in templates here and bring back this
down into here now we're gonna do we're
gonna make a Jekyll loop a Jekyll loop
works like this so I want to go inside
of the article wrap and I want to grab
the thing that I want to loop which is
the article thumb right I want that
thumb to repeat itself for however many
articles there are and we're gonna just
make a liquid loop like this and we'll
say for however many posts there are in
my site dot posts make this loop and
then right here will write
and for see what we've got great so we
just have one face and it's still the
same styles as everything but there's
only one of them and hover is not
working for some reason
why are they're not working however Oh
article MIT is not a child anymore in
our paste it got messed up all right
cool cool cool so I'm gonna make a bunch
of articles to fill up this space here
now these are not gonna be real actual
articles just there like throw away text
files to show you guys how this works
and then later on I'll go and get my you
know get all my files from my old blog
but let me show you how it works I
actually created a bunch of meaningless
text files right here and named them
accordingly I'm gonna drag them into my
new per oggi my new progeny for every
one of these projects notice that I have
13 of them because I added 12 and have
13 so I have this like weird extra one
here I don't want that weird extra one
so I'm going to go up into my loop and
I'll say limit 12 and if there's extras
they'll just not be shown beyond 12 and
then the user can use this see all
articles button right so we want to keep
it at 12 because 12 divides well by 4
and by 3 also and it looks good looks
good looks good so let's do this loop
the first thing we know is that the the
who are these things called the
thumbnails are not going to be film eree
they're gonna be in my assets image and
what was it the path is going to be
posts thumbnails
posts um but nails slash and then we're
gonna use the the ancient art of it
nothing and we're going to use this tag
which is you say post thumbnail and
that's just calling in the thumbnail
which if we go back to any of these
posts is going to be right here so it's
going to be post dot thumbnail it's
gonna post it's gonna call in that that
image right there next is we want to say
the article name is going to be very
similar
what was it post post title was it title
title yep and then this last thing is
going to be post dot date and save and
save and fresh and save in a fresh fresh
come on you come on what happened
where are my thumbnails assets image
posts thumbnails post thumbnail post my
date
it's all wrong okay here's what went
wrong I calling the object of post but
up here I said for posts but it should
be for post singular basically whatever
I say right there after the four is what
I'm creating an object of later on down
the road so now here they all show up
because now it's post and I'm calling
post title so that's what happened there
now each of these have a unique date and
a unique title see this one and it's
kind of own title the rest of these have
same title cuz I just copy and paste
them let's figure out this date date
date date let's say liquid date so
Jekyll uses the liquid templating
language so I just googled liquid
template date liquid for designers that
makes sense
and find the date date syntax reference
for date so the date filter on a liquid
tag looks like this you put the bar and
then date and then all these little
doodads here so we go like they s and
then we get on the date now I get the
date written out Monday July 1st 2013 I
don't really want the day of the week so
I don't need to come a coming here and
if I do a capital y see how it says 13
if I do a capital y it gives me the
whole year it's a 2013 that's exactly
how I want the date format it cool and
one thing I noticed before we move along
too far I noticed that when it's wide
these article they look ok with the
titles you know but when it gets to TV
this is no good this is no bueno there's
a few things that we can do to help that
number o number one sorry number one is
we go to this name and we'll say a lion
height like 1.2 like 1.8 so check it out
first
looks like that and they don't hit one
point huh and it looks like that so it's
gonna be a little bit tighter and that's
okay for a headline but it doesn't fix
everything so what we need to do is we
need to find the point where it becomes
unbearable which is I don't know they're
right about right about there 999 okay
so we're gonna make a new mean ear query
there Mary worth an affront that time
and
max with max with is going to be 1000
well look on say 999 because we're like
that if you want to be so specific so
999 so if it gets smaller than 999 what
do we want to do I'm gonna take these
article thumbs thumbs take the article
thumb and make its width no longer 25%
25% is 1/4 which means there's 4 so we
wanted there to be 3 in the row make
them bigger make them 3 in a row
make them three in a row and then you'll
have more space for the content and it
and also like excuse me hiccup see this
right here when he gets too small the
bottom would you see that do that it
shifts up there's all this space there
that would not happen if we had three in
a row so we want to say with equals to
33.3% that's a third and when I save
come on show me some love
article thumb is a specificity not right
should be good
should be oh it's his max with with the
dis max would do this okay uh-oh silly
okay so we have four and then come past
999 and then we have three so we're not
gonna have that gap at the bottom and
also these are not going to be too small
that you know our thumbnails not gonna
be able to show us all that love in of
the title the title 11 that we need cool
and then let's look at it when it gets
to mobile that is freaking large so
let's do this
we'll say max width and min with our
mobile sighs so 640 pixels that means
that means it's only gonna be limited to
642 I'm sure what I mean let me show you
let me show you right here see this
green that green is the media query we
just wrote so if it's inside of that
green
it's gonna have three three articles
wide if it's outside of that green it's
going to have the four so it goes to the
four the three and then back to the four
when we hit mobile now and back to
iPhone sighs whatever
you can't hover over an iPhone anyway it
doesn't matter cool so I wanted to take
care of that and that's took in care of
straight tooken you know a straight
tooken curve and that my friends is how
you add articles to a Jekyll
oh and let's click one and see what
happens nothing happened I'm glad I
tried to click it let me show you why so
what I need to do is go in here and go
to that ref and say post dot URL that'll
do it because each post has a URL now
when I click this I get that hello world
fantastic alright that's it for this
video
in the next part of this hour we're
going to be adding a little bit more
pizazz on to onto these articles and
that was cool did you see that part
where I was like typing and stuff and
like things were happening on the screen
yeah man that was like the best I'll see
you tomorrow for our 8.3 where we add
some unnecessary but fun sparkle with
JavaScript keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
