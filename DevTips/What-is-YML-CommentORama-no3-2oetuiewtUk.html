here at the train station waiting for
the day to start I got an email just
like two seconds ago from one of you
guys who asked hey dude what is yello
you keep doing Jekyll and likethere's
head matter in the top and we have like
a config die yama like what is yeah
Mille and you know pointing out that I
haven't even explained that yet that's
true that's valid I think the reason I
haven't explained yet cuz I don't really
even know man I did a quick Google
search literally what is yml and I
learned it is pronounced yeah mo kind of
like camel and it's a data serialization
format so it's we human readable so the
idea is to convey information to
computers you want to say like header :
hetero a that tells the computer that
your head or whatever that header is
should be a heteroatom it seems kind of
some simple the same time is pretty like
vague and I think that's kind of the
point yeah what can get a little bit
more verbose than what we've been using
it as you know like you know doing lists
and kind of grids like like matrix
matrices and things like that but again
it's all just like getting the data into
a human readable format so like when I
show you guys on dev tips you can
understand it like this header is the
header jpg that's really easy to
understand and the computer can also
really understand that so I think that's
the kind of the main idea behind the
amel it's just a format that humans and
computers can all gather around it's
probably a really poor description I'm
sure there's somebody else in that
watches depth of understands better than
I do what the animal is so if you want
to know more about yeah well read the
conversation and the thing probably
there's going to be some comments that
are better than what I've explained here
in and that's totally fine with me
learning just as much as you guys are so
I guess it's been another comment Oh
Rama we've been a while since we've seen
one of those and thanks for the question
and we'll talk to you guys soon
keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
