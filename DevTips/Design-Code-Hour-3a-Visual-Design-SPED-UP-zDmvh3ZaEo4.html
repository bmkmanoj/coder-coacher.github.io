of our three in this series design and
code my personal website in 12 hours we
use Photoshop to build out the look in
the feel of the project the original
video is about two hours but here we can
press it to about 10 minutes I recommend
watching the intro to that video
mostly because I have a moustache in
that one this version is for those of
you who are less interested in the
actual visual design process but still
want to maintain context for the rest of
the series so without further ado here
is the speed design for the site that we
will be building for the next little
while oh yes and the music that
accompanies this next section is
provided from one of my very best
friends in the world
HB you can find more of his tracks
heartbreak mode calm
you
you
we now have a picture of what we want to
build that's really all it is isn't it
this is a picture of something that I
would like to build someday
it's Pinocchio before the fairy it's the
Tin Man before Oz maybe next week we're
going to look at the technical aspects
of the project we're going to look at
the technologies and languages that
we're going to use to to bring this
picture to life join me then for the
project set up and until then keep
painting pictures of things that don't
exist yet hello welcome to the end of
