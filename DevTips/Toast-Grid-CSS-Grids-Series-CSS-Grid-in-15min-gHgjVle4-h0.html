gonna be looking at toast the
self-proclaimed insane in no-nonsense
CSS grid ah toast is brought to us by
Dan Eden who is the same person who
created animate CSS and baseline J s
he's a cool guy I used toast for a job I
did recently and I want to share with
you what I learned about it I was
looking for something that was simple
and easy to use and toast really fit
that bill wonderfully I chose toast for
two reasons number one it was small and
not attached to any larger framework so
it was really easy just to drop inside
of my work and have it work work number
two is that it has pixel perfect gutters
not Remz not M's not percentages we're
talking pixels and that's actually kind
of rare in CSS grids and that really
intrigued me so I wanted to try it out
all right so like I said it's super easy
let's just get started
as I said toast is simple and fun so all
I'm gonna do is head over to that Google
home page here and I'm going to Google
toast grid the first result is the one
we want to go to and it's just the
explanation of how to use toast grid
pretty darn simple I'm gonna go into the
github repository there's a link on the
bottom so I'm not even going to download
the whole repository I want to keep this
as simple as possible so I'm going to go
to the S CSS folder and you could either
just I mean click in here and just
highlight the whole thing is what I did
and copy and paste it into a new file so
I in my repository here on the Left let
me show you how I got this working out I
have a sass style and I'm importing
toast grid toast grid is exactly a
mirror of what we have here on the
github repo
sass is importing that toast grid and
then I have a few overrides like the
body I changed the font I put a
container around it
here is my index and you can see that
it's just a regular a regular HTML page
with the container and I'm using Jade by
the way Jade is a really simple way to
write HTML markup everything that I do
here in Jade can be replicated with
regular HTML so you watch out when I
save it Jade it outputs it as HTML see
it's just a div
class of container and then I have an
include here inside the container and
this is where we'll be working in this
include it's just a blank jade file so
the SAS imports the toast grid and then
I have a few styles like for the
container I have a few styles set up for
a box and tall and tinted you'll see
what those mean in a few minutes but
what we want to focus on is toast grid
CSS and grid markup Jade pretty pretty
simple right now okay so we're gonna
start our demo by writing out the Box
class this is something that I invented
it's just a 20 pixel tall div with a
background color in it now we're gonna
take this box and stick it inside of our
grid and chop it up in a lot of
different ways and I'm gonna use this
box basically as content you know ideas
to show you how to use this grid so with
with the toast grid you want to create a
wrapper around all of your columns the
wrapper in toast grid is just simply
called grid this is by default and then
the columns you'd write grid underscore
underscore column and then to identify
how big the column is going to be you're
gonna write this again grid underscore
underscore column - - and then you would
write one dash of - to write one of two
and that's going to give you a half a
half measure of the of the grid but you
need to put your box inside of the grid
okay so now you see that the box is kind
of contained inside of a half column if
I made two of these and duplicate this
here there would be two columns and
there you know contained in there you
could do the same kind of idea here for
a lot of different kinds of combinations
of columns let's say I want three of
five and two of five see now it's a
little bit different I can make this two
five one and 105 okay easy now these
column groups here these of five of 12
this is completely controllable and
what's nice about toast grid is
that there's a lot of awesome defaults
that are easy to change for example the
word grid here I'm not exactly excited
about this use of the word because what
if I want to do copy and paste that what
if I want to two grids and it's not
exactly two grids it's one grid you know
but you're just like having two
instances of it so I really like the way
that that foundation uses the
terminology of row so I'm just going to
change this to row here and then when I
go to here I'm going to use row and row
and then watch when I it'll be kind of
fixed up a little bit better so that's
what the row and now now it's a row and
also this right here grade column grid
underscore underscore column I think
that's a little bit too much for me I
just want a regular column this is also
similar to what foundation does and I
just like their terminology better so
instead of grid unrestored column column
everywhere I'm just gonna put column
here we go yeah actually I was do a find
and replace of grid underscore
underscore and move it all there we go
so now should be working fine and it's a
lot less blah blah blah blah blah
those are the the way that you can
override the ream the naming of
everything now let's talk about column
groups there's a preset in here also for
column groups column groups are the of
part right here so where it says 3 of 5
now if you were in like let's say if you
had the bootstrap grid by default this
is what bootstrap grid would give you
it's just 12 columns all the time but
let's say you wanted a 12 column and a
16 column grid so you can do really
really weird
asymmetrical layouts now none of them
work right because there are none of
them are 12
let's fix them
okay and I'll do like six or twelve six
or twelve to be half alright do you
understand I'm saying so these column
groups can be a very powerful thing and
you can easily set set up what the
defaults are going to be here using
using this variable here called column
groups
if it were me like I probably never use
anything other than twelve twelve is
like one of the most divisible numbers
and then if you want to be you know do
that those kind of really intricate like
kind of asymmetrical kind of grids you
can do maybe a five column grid or a
sixteen column grid to get something
unique but you know like a two column
grid the four column grid you're I mean
come on twelve is going to handle that
please fine and you're gonna get like
half the CSS output right so remember
that this is SAS and it generates CSS so
controlling things and being purposeful
about these controls up front is going
to give you better results in that in
the end okay so enough talking about
that let's go on to the next example the
next kind of setting here is the gutters
in the introduction I said that one of
the cool things about toast is that they
have these these really pixel perfect
gutters which is very uncommon in grids
they usually have the gutters that are
measured out in like m's or REMS or even
percentages but these ones use pixels
and I love that because if you're gonna
get a you know some art from a designer
they're not using the REMS to make their
gutters in their design they're not
using percentages they're they're using
pixels that that's that's the truth so
this is a little bit more realistic
to kind of know how this works but
anyway check it out so I have 20 pixel
gutters right here and I can easily make
actually I had to do this in that in
that when I said recently that I used
this grid this is I changed this gutters
to sixty pixels and it's just as easy as
that look at that 60 pixels there they
go these things disappear to his 5 1
and ten and let's make that to you and
four okay so sixty pixel gutter is
pretty ridiculous you're not gonna use
that all the time but like I was doing
this job and the client had designed
sixty pixel gutters and instead of being
like oh how many rims is that or like
trying to like figure everything out
it's so simple I went ahead and changed
it to 60 and easy done and notice that
the the ends are not changing just the
gutters in between them so I think it
handles it really well I like that idea
from from this grid one of my favorite
features
okay so gutters and there's also this
idea of pushing and pulling which
honestly I don't think I've ever used it
on a production site to do pushing and
pulling but pushing and pulling is very
similar and you can turn them off on or
off now why would you want to turn them
on or off well again that's that's
saving the output in the CSS so if I
never have used pushing and pulling in
my designs and I don't expect to
I would I would turn these off but let
me show you how they work so I'm gonna
say call - - push and I want to push
this a - of 16 and what this does is it
just kind of like puts extra margin on
the one side of it so if I move this
over to here it would push the the
second column over to units of the 16
column to the right now pull is is very
similar in the fact that it puts a
negative margin on on the thing all
right tinted on this box this is a style
that I made up that will just change the
box to blue so you can see that the the
column the center column is being put
pulled on top of the the column to the
right let me put this one as tall so you
can see that it's actually going on top
of the the box to its left now why would
you want to do that let's say you have
like some overlapping elements like I'm
thinking like a
twitter twitter avatar overlaps on top
of the you know the the header where
they called the cover image or whatever
on top of the layout things like that
you just want sometimes you want the
layout to impact each other and that's
how you would do that i don't know again
i never really used these things in
layouts the toast grid is responsive and
i want to show you that but before i do
i want to show you a little bit of like
the weird extras or the fun extras that
come along with it so let's say for
example we have this pull here I can go
call - - a line bottom a B and it will
just bring my column down to the bottom
it's aligning it to the bottom which is
pretty cool and I can do call - - am for
middle and if I put if I want to do the
middle I want to do it on the two ones
that I want to go to the middle now the
one on the far right is in the middle
and this is a really great way to like
align forms or you know like if you have
like a line of text and then in the next
column a checkbox or something you can
be aware that you can align things
vertically as well as horizontally with
your grid so called - - a.m. or called -
- a be align bottom or line middle are
really great classes that are built into
toast to help you do that another
interesting one is let's just duplicate
this row here and scoot scoot let's make
it
I'm just doing some quick work here
let's just make it three columns of 12
so it's gonna be four columns wide no
three now I have this four column grid
here in the middle I want them to not
have the gutters so I go to the row in a
right row - - no - gutter and now that
will strip away all the gutters that we
still have four columns but there's no
space in between all of them so you can
have you know like if you want a
seamless grid of images or like I don't
know if you just for some reason don't
need the gutters in that specific row
you can easily do that and if if I wrap
out this row you know how you can have
multiple rows and I've been kind of
doing definitely a rose for every time
that you can like put you know these all
in one row and they're their gutters
went away too but they are acting as
their own row because of the math that
we're using and also notice in this one
row in row 7 right these are all
together in one row now that I'm using
different layer different column groups
see check this out these are three of 12
and these are 8 of 16 all in one row
that really doesn't matter that's just
going to dictate the size and honestly
like like 8 of 16 is the same thing as
as 6 of 12 it's like it's the exact same
class actually that's creating those two
styles anyway so what's next okay here's
a cool one let's take the note gutter
off so you can see better in here so we
have in our boxes less and less number
these boxes so you can see what's up
three four okay so we have four boxes
here one two three four and you can see
that they're numbered let's say that for
some reason I want to reorder the
columns this is pretty cool you can say
if you want a column to be treated as
the first or the last so let's make this
column number to show up before column
number one and we do that by saying
column - - d4 display - okay - first now
the columns are reordered and number two
is the first one to display and I can do
this the same thing let's go to box
number three and right column - - D for
display - last and that number three
will go all the way to the end so now
our the order of our columns is 2 1 4 3
and but in our source ordering it's
still 1 2 3 4 but we're just displaying
them differently by using these handy
classes the next one I want to show you
is just is really quick it's just
centering so I'm going to read - I'm
going to duplicate this this row and
instead of having all of these columns
here I just want to have a centered
column so I still want to keep the size
of it
and I'll write column - - centered now
that column floats in the center and you
can still control the size of it right
here by doing you know whatever so toast
is a responsive grid right out of the
out of the box so I'm in here in my
device emulation in my my developer
tools in chrome so by default when you
get smaller than 700 pixels of your
device all of your all of your grade
columns are just going to be single
column wide the question is how do I
stop that well you have to target the
small or medium and kind of override
them it's a little bit backwards nuggets
out it not exactly mobile first but it's
not too hard so let me show you with
this with this wrote the numbered rows
here let's say I want to take this row
and still keep the minced columns when
we get into the the middle range of the
of the media queries I would write
column - - M for the MIT firm medium -
one - of 4 so the thing to keep in mind
is that those those column groups that
we set up don't necessarily apply for
the media queries here these are going
to be set to 2 3 and 4 columns and also
1 so now these will be in to distill the
the 4 the 4 columns as we transition
from large to medium the difference
being that your
they're gonna be handled that way by
different classes now they'll still
collapse after we get to the small now
if I still wanted it to kind of have
some effect in a small let's say column
- - s - - - of - four I can do one of I
can do one of two all right go on to
this one do the same now when we get
into our small you'll have this two and
three B on one row and it's collapsing
this way so there's a lot of variability
you can build into them using using the
media queries also you can go into the
toast grid and override where you want
the meat queries to be so right here
these breakpoints are set to 704 80 but
you can change them to you know whatever
is more comfortable for your design all
right that that's kind of a brief
overview of everything that you can do
it's very flexible very customizable and
the best thing is that it's simple and
lightweight like let's take a look at
how many lines this outputs in my CSS
styled CSS is what 300 lines and that's
including everything I wrote so it's
about 300 lines which compared to other
frameworks is pretty lightweight
understanding how to use grids as a
whole is an essential design skill and
being able to use a variety of CSS grids
is it's a pretty valuable thing to have
as a creator I really enjoyed using
toast but there are other grids out
there that will do similar things with
more or less complexity you know it's
kind of like a kind of like a spectrum
not all grids are the same so you should
try a lot of them before you decide on
which one you want to stick to for the
rest of your life do you understand the
sub context of what I'm saying here
Jenny he's no good for you there's like
one Jenny watching this at home in like
how did he know anyway there are other
CSS grids out there this is one video in
a series where I talk about a lot of
different CSS grids be sure to check out
those other videos links are in the
