Travis and this is the YouTube channel
where we discuss the nerdy things in
life if you like this video make sure to
share it with your friends so prove it
sit down how cool you are and let you
have great taste now on with the program
today is a really good video it actually
stems from a video I did two weeks ago I
showed you guys how to use a random CSS
property attribute or sorry random CSS
property in value called box model and
we talked about how to use that property
to make really interesting buttons why
buttons I don't know they're they're
pretty important part of the Internet
there are the things that you click and
but I got to thinking you know after I
published the video I answered a few
questions in the comment section and I
realized that maybe I brushed past with
a few more nuanced and interesting and
kind of important things to understand
about box-shadow
and more thought about it the more I
realized I really wanted to dig in and
teach you guys about the box model box
sizing and how they relate to box-shadow
so let's dive in and start with the box
model now I have a bunch of markup
already written and a bunch of things
are just hidden so one by one I'm going
to reveal them and talk about them the
first thing is going to be the box model
here is what I'm showing you as the box
model so the green bit is the content
when you set a width of anything in this
case the width is like a 200 yeah so the
width is 200 this green bit the actual
content area is this is the space that's
going to take that width the blue bit is
the padding if you set the padding
that's going to come in here and that's
going to be added on to the content so
in this case it would be 20 pixels on
each side
of the content of box which is 200 so
there's going to be a 240 pixels from
here all the way to here and zoom in a
little bit 240 pixels from here to here
next in the box model you'll have a
border and the border also adds to the
overall size of the box but it's added
upon so this is a 2 pixel stroke and so
you're going to have 200 pixels for the
content 20 pixels on each side so that's
240 pixels plus an additional 2 pixels
for the border stroke so this is going
to be 244 pixels wide from border to
border then after that you have the
margin the margin is represented by this
coral color and it sits on the outside
of the border and then here we're adding
another 20 pixels on each side so this
is the box model when anybody talks
about the box model they're talking
about how these elements of content box
padding border and margin relate to each
other and what you have them programmed
to be now you can take a look at the box
model of any object like let's take a
look at this heading here and if you go
to the inspector and go to computed you
have the box metal model written out
right here so the content box padding
border margin and the border and margin
now in this case we don't have any of
them set other than like this has like a
margin bottom of 50 pixels and the
height is calculated here so we can see
what the effects will be in the DOM and
you can do that for any element on the
page let's take a button up here inspect
it so that's that's the it's got some 5
pixels of padding on top and bottom
we're sorry margin it's got some padding
22 and 14 looks like they have some
border here nearly a pixel all right so
that's the box model for the next
example I've taken a few of these boxes
and shoved them inside of a container to
show how these box models how these
boxes relate to each
so in this example there are no borders
on these boxes all of them are floated
left there 188 pixels wide with a 10
pixel margin and then the parent is
going to be 600 pixels wide right so if
you add them all up together 180 plus 20
is going to be 200 pixels of the box for
the each of these units which is added
all the other is 600 so they fill the
parent perfectly there's no room there's
no wiggle room built-in right there if
we add one pixel that line will break
and they'll start to collapse under let
me show you what that one looks like
this nest next example is the exact same
thing except for the boxes here each
have a one pixel border now just out one
little pixel causes these boxes to fold
so this is why it's important to think
about the amount of space that your your
elements are going to take when you're
laying them out on the page before you
get get really too far into it you have
to think ahead how many you know am I
going to have some border on it am I
going to how much padding is going to be
inside of these boxes and you know or
else things like this could happen now
I'm going to scoot down over here to the
lesson box and this is what we're going
to do a little bit of work now the thing
that I didn't tell you about the Box
shadow property is that it itself is not
calculated in the box model at all it's
just considered as decoration so watch
this box shadow that's nut shadow box
shadow zero pixels zero pixels zero
pixels one pixel in black
see it looks like we've added a border
on but we don't have to worry about
those floats folding under because the
border which is actually a box shadow is
not calculated is not even considered
inside of the box model calculation
that's a really cool way but there's
actually a better way we can do this
because instead of rendering a shadow
which the browser has to calculate okay
how big is the shadow how far offset is
the shadow how blurry is the shadow we
can just tell we can use a border which
is really quicker for the browser to
render so if you're concerned about
browser performance as you most likely
should be we can tell the browser how we
want it to consider the box model how we
want it to calculate it so by default it
calculates from the content box and then
adds padding and border and margin right
but what if I wanted to say hey you
figure out the math I'm just going to
tell you that I want this box to be 180
pixels out to the edge of the border I'm
going to add any padding on what I'm
going to add any border I want you just
figure out what it's going to be and
this is how we do that we go to say box
sizing border box and border one pixel
solid but now we've just changed the way
that the browser thinks about the box
model and everything lines up perfectly
so that's another way it's going to be a
little less taxing for the rendering now
that's only going to really matter if
you have a lot of elements doing this
just for three like this it doesn't
matter oh I thought of another way that
we could achieve this you know stroke
around the box without having to
recalculate the the shadow or the the
box model and it's with using an outline
outline one pixel solid hopeful
Oh whack see an outline and I'm not
really sure what the benefits are or
drawbacks of using it outline if you
guys know leave a cleave a comment down
below and tell me which one you use most
often or give us any tips ok that's it
all we got for today guys I appreciate
you watching the show for watching
remember to tell your mom I said what's
off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
