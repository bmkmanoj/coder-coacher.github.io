ah yes today is a fantastic day
especially here on the internet in the
YouTube we're looking at another set of
poll requests from the community to the
artist theme let's not spend too much
time talking about what that is we've
already seen what progress are but I'm
so excited to look at them and it what's
cool about them is when I look through
your port quests I'm like oh that's a
great idea like I'm like learning so
much and I want to share that with the
rest of you guys who are not browsing
the poll requests on the artist name you
don't need to UM you're saying if you're
not you're missing out Oh anyway
here we are let's do this this is
awesome a lot of these are really simple
and obvious kind of things that I
totally just missed in the videos and
you guys are picking up my slack so the
first one here update index.html what
he's doing is this and this one is from
Jay Grimshaw Jay Grimshaw is just
updating the the character set from what
I had here a little bit more complex and
kind of outdated to the more you know
simplified and h2n html5 kind of
friendlier version and I don't need to
test that I kind of know that it's that
it is what I want so I am just going to
go into his what's it called oh he gives
an explanation I asked him to you know
explain what the difference is but he
explains it and I think it's good I'm
going to say cool bro merged and I'm
gonna merge whoa oh I should
okay I'll put my cool bro merge right
here there we go
merged now let's go back and see what
else we can do okay forgotten the title
and the liquid loops this is funny I
didn't realize this but I had actually
forgotten to title the website so the
whole thing the whole time up here it
says localhost that's because there's no
title in the in the site so right up
here head title it's blank so what this
see is this his real name the her his or
her his real name people been Nestle
been okay this guy vipul been Sal says
that we should just put the settings
title right in there and that's a
fantastic idea he also comes in and you
know all those ten spans I put there for
the the skill units he reduces the
markup abut a bit by writing a liquid
loop which you know I didn't know about
and that's fantastic I'm learning so I'm
going to accept this right away to merge
and I'll say great additions thanks so
much
comments confirmed ok done next one
fix the face image graphical bug and
make oops
and make some SAS files easier to read
ok so a lot of what he's doing here is
just kind of like taking these
repetitive background repeat' background
sighs background position and using the
SAS shorthands of background repeat'
size position blend mode right and
that's cool he does it a few times and
down here it gets really beneficial when
he starts actually uh like like right
here and stuff he fixes a problem here's
the problem that he was fixing when I go
down to my face and I squeeze this
browser in know look at that circle it
becomes like a oblong squarish kind of
rounded square and that was a bug that's
my mistake and I was planning on going
to fix it but you know with with
community members like you guys I don't
even have to fix this stuff you guys are
picking up my slack and it's awesome so
okay so yeah here it is fixing that
saying that I don't know wait where is
it
removing whit auto is what's gonna fix
that I think anyway I don't even have to
worry about it you guys did it for me
let's commit this conversation merged
Bam Bam super commit this is really
helpful super cool Denso next clean up
hacked CSS oh I'm going to skip this one
this one and this one because they're a
little bit more involved and actually
want to talk to the two contributors
custodian and Zee design they did so I
mean these three can be three pull
requests you can see this one is 39
comments we've been talking through a
quite a bit but they've done some really
cool work and I want to save those for
later a little bit this video is a
little bit more of like the quicker like
like fixing my mistakes and just kind of
like things like that video um dude to
do so that's these three adding a
description to install this is really
helpful so what what Ricardo is doing
Ricardo is from the last video that you
know our Italian friend Ricardo makes a
really cool you know a description in
the readme for people who are just
finding the artist theme or you guys
coming from like helping you guys to set
up and install and get started with with
your install I've read it it looks good
it sounds great
so I'm gonna I'm going to accept that
one
thanks Ricardo alright and next we have
make the inline SVG parent element make
the inline SVG fill the parent element
by default okay so what he is talking
parent element so what he's talking
about is right here you'll notice that
my mouse turns into a pointer right
about there and coming in there
I cried well there so with like a square
like this big which is really weird
um and what's happening is the actual
SVG is poking out of its parent so its
parent is just this little square and
the actual SVG like container box is
poking out really far and what custodian
does oh he has a video well how helpful
is that like a little gif
oh I see what you did and I like it cool
custodian thank you so much for doing
that that's awesome so we talked about
it a little bit and he kind of fixed
that up so I'm really excited to have
that
thanks so much for being incredible
spellcheck I can't even talk much hmm
okay confirmed optimized SVG again
custodian you are incredible do you have
a real name custodian nope so mysterious
bro cleaned up with SVG go so that's
cool just made our file size smaller
from 5 kilobytes to 2 kilobytes saving
me some sigh I don't even know - right
nice save like it's like a basketball
game really good football game like nice
name a super duper I'm super I don't
know why this is funny I'm sorry super a
cool moves is it caps lock okay super
cool moves such stupid
sorry custodian for this stupid comment
that doesn't make sense but I just
merged like 5 things ahead of you and
now it's just kind of getting ridiculous
okay uh just fixed a spelling mistake so
this is hmm this spelling mistake is the
name of the scrolling function and the
scrolling function was contributed by
aerial Safari and you'll remember that
video like three or four videos ago that
was after we made the the About section
in an aerial Safari contributed this
kind of auto scroll feature for our
navigation which is such a cool commit
but I'm not sure see I didn't I didn't
fix this myself because I didn't know if
it was like I don't know where aerial
safaris from like if this is how you
spell scroll or if this was an honest
spelling mistake but either way we're
going to fix that just by saying yup
wait merge can't automatically merge
just
fix it why can't emerge oh we have a
conflict did somebody else fix it hmm
let's move past it I'll ask him to pull
in the other I think that's what happens
since I'm pulling in a lot of like
things right now I think the reason that
that was unable to be actually let's
just check I'm curious now let's check
our artist themed assets yes did
somebody already fix that smooth scroll
nope huh
well either way I'll talk to him and
maybe he can pull in and recommit and it
should work because I don't want those
conflicts baby pull requests okay
adjusted the settings blurb to use
markdown and make the settings um well
easier to read so what's your name
sometimes they have their actual name
here sometimes is theirs they're kind of
screen name but busy and busy Bezier and
GUI does wrangly I don't know how to say
anybody's name I looked I feel so
ridiculous when I try to do things but
anyway so what uh what this gentleman
does is makes it so the blurb that and I
use them I use a standard HTML markup in
the blurb he makes it possible to use
markup which may be easier for people to
read who are not super code savvy which
I'm not sure if they would want even
this theme because I mean you know
Jekyll and the whole video series that
we're doing but it's cool and and I like
learning I didn't know that you could
markdown a5 stuff in the middle of so
this is cool like so these pull requests
are not just to like make things awesome
er but also to teach me stuff cuz like
I'm learning so much from you guys I'm
not even joking about it so I like this
let's do
I will accept your commits sir that
sounds like a good message
I will accept commit sir I like it I
like it like a lot okay we have four
left uh I don't know why this one didn't
work contributing guidelines and so so
these two are similar and they cover one
of the same topics so I want to talk to
both of the guys that did it and figure
out who they agree which which one I
should pull and then this one
contributing guidelines I really like
the idea custodian wants to make it make
like contributing poll requests like a
little bit more formalized but he is
also adding vagrant and bundler which
would like a little bit more setup
complexity there and I wanted to avoid
that so I want to talk to him and then
clean up the hack CSS you guys check out
Z designs commit here I'll put the
commits in the video it's so crazy
it's got like 19 files changed he's
adding several different animation
options he's he's like doing so many
different crazy things yeah anyway we've
been talking a while about all of his
his changes that's it for this video
we're just doing pull requests today and
come back on Monday for another
full-length video we're going to be
start we're gonna start doing the what
we're gonna start doing the the next
section which is like this is the
section I don't know check back on
Monday for the next video because it
should probably be great a little like
resounding affirmation of what we're
doing here it's your problem
great all right guys keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
