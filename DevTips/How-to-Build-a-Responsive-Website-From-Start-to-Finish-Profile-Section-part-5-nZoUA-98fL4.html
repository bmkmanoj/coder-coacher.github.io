this is dev tips and this is where we be
learning codes at on the internet on
YouTube ah this is the fifth video in
the series called how to make the most
awesome of and professional responsive
portfolio website in the planet from
start to finish so that's what it's
called or something like that and we
have gone through everything I mean if
you haven't watched the video series up
to this point you really should take a
look at it here's the here's like a
little icon that will say well you know
click on the playlist because a playlist
is where I keep all the videos up and to
this point we've covered you know like
how to have empathy for who you're
designing for we've covered how to how
to map the the architecture of a web
site out in in your mind and create a
document for your clients we talked
about sketching and visual design we've
done some some setting up of our
platform Jekyll and we're going to be
using Jekyll and if you haven't used
Jekyll or don't know what Jekyll is yet
take a look at that video it's it's in
the playlists and the video is actually
on another channel called PHP academy'
that I sometimes make videos for because
they're cool and Alex is really cool so
check out those video today is the fifth
video in this series and we're going to
be coding out the About section okay
this is really exciting but before we do
before we get too deep into what we're
doing today I want to point out that all
of the code that we have been creating
and that we are making from week to week
is on github so if you go to github.com
slash dev tips you can find this
repository here called artist theme and
that's what we're working on right now
so in artist theme are all of the files
and all the code that we'll be doing
week to week and I upload the code as
soon as I'm done coding it so quite a
bit ahead of when the videos come out so
those of you who are subscribed to the
repository or subscribe to dev tips or
follow the repository or whatever the
language is on gap you will know about
the code a little bit faster or sooner
than everybody else who is waiting for
the videos to come out on Mondays so
that's kind of a nice thing
and also the the Photoshop document
that's used to create this this website
the visual design is also included in
the repo so you can get that for free
and then when this project is done on
github it'll be free to you know
download and kind of change and put your
name on it whatever I don't care let's
jump into our project tracker
application called Trello okay so we
have last week we did the header and
footer and so there in the Q&amp;amp;A section
because we need to go over it once we're
done with everything and make sure the
quality is pretty good currently this
week in the development column we have
the About section the About section is
going to display our personality we're
going to use headshots we're going to
use icons of our interest or personal
interests and I'll teach you how to
create the icons and export them so
they're really nice and scalable we're
gonna also you know have a little blurb
which is going to be a value proposition
to the people who read the website so
they can know what you're about and what
value you can add to their company if
they were to hire you for your services
and we're gonna do also is the skills
kind of like um you know like a bar
graph or something like that now you'll
notice that none of these features or
sections or none of these features on
the about page are ground-breaking
they're all very very common for
freelancers or portfolio kind of
websites that's because these are the
things that your clients are going to
need to know in order to hire you so
obviously we should put them on on the
website um a lot of the the patterns
that we're using the visuals are I mean
they're all very common this is a very
trendy looking website so things like
bar charts for your skills or circular
avatars icons of interest these are
nothing is groundbreaking here but I
like to think that the way that they're
displayed is quite you know simple and
nice and easy to understand and so let's
just let's just get on that in fact
let's look at the visual design here
this is what we're going to be doing
today
it's the About section so there is a few
assets that I need to gather like Maffei
some icons here I need to I don't know
how to write anything tonight but I'll
try to write something you know and have
it proper so you guys can understand
like what is a good thing to
say about yourself actually that's a
pretty important thing for you guys to
say I mean we can have all the design
and all the visuals you want but if your
message is kind of not good then it's
going to be less successful that's for
darn sure and then we have that that
down here we have that that graph I was
talking about of the different skill
sets we'll talk about that when we come
to it because I'm using Jekyll the first
thing I want to do before I get started
on this About section is carve out the
space where I can work meaning I'm going
to create a document for me to hold my
kind of the About section that I'm going
to be creating blah blah blah okay so
let's start so I'm going to run over
this includes folder create a new file
called about died HTML and I'm going to
go to my index go to my index file and
I'm going to use Jekyll to inject the
HTML that we are creating into this
document now there if there was some
questions a few of them in the comments
of last week saying Travis do we need to
use Jekyll in order to follow along with
this series the answer is no you do not
you do not you do not I am using Jekyll
because it makes things a little bit
more organized and simpler and tidy
right so the the work that I'm gonna be
doing the HTML and CSS is going to be
injecting itself in I mean it's just the
output of Jekyll is normal HTML and CSS
if Jekyll does it HTML and CSS can do it
without Jekyll right so don't worry
about it but I do use and I do like it
because it helps to make things
organized and tidy and clean and and
easy to use and understand and also to
read and edit later on okay so the first
thing I want to do is take that About
section and inject it into my main index
HTML document I do that by saying
include dot what is it called about dot
HTML cool now when I run over to my
index.html so this let me just introduce
you to the document so far we have the
header here we did this last week and
then also the footer I have this dummy
paragraph here right in the middle so
that
you know I can have like a just some
evidence that there is something in the
body but now I need I need to know that
the HTML is working so I'm gonna go
write some dummy content in here I'm
gonna say yo mama so fat that she jumped
and got stuck hmm
that's what it says okay so if that
sentence shows up in my in my output
HTML then we're working it's good okay
so let's refresh and look at that there
is our awesome grade school schoolyard
dis right there mmm okay and also I need
to carve out a place in my sass that I
can write these styles for the About
section so I'm gonna go over to section
so everything is really organized here
tools base and we went over these in the
last videos I'm going to make a new
section called underscore about dot sass
and then I'm going to go into my
directory and import that done okay
now we're good so we have the index and
we don't need to look at that anymore
so we have our about dot HTML and our
you know that's the sections see good
good okay there that's the about sass
that I wanted to have
okay now Jekyll is going to compile our
sass for us and Jekyll is also going to
you know organize our HTML for us this
is really exciting now we are ready to
code now I've talked in a few videos
before about my approach to writing
markup and in and it's simply this you
need to see what you're trying to build
in your mind or on in our case in a
Photoshop document and describe it
describe it with code and think about
how things work and and lay them out
verbally with your markup so we're going
to be looking at our Photoshop document
here first thing I do is I see this huge
area and I want to block that sex
for myself and I also noticed that it's
all kind of in a grid here you see these
blue lines this is a grid and I'm not
going to use a grid traditionally like
you may think or hope that I'll be using
it but I want to be mindful of these
things I mean it's not really like it's
much complicated we have a few items
that need to float against each other
it's not like a huge complicated grid
but we can see visually that we do have
like a lot of space here between the
elements in the margin the edge of the
page and and so forth in fact it looks
like nothing is going outside of of this
what is it 780 pixel wide so let's keep
that in mind okay the first thing I need
to do is block out this area come on so
I'll make a section and the first
element inside there is the header which
I'm going to say this is an h3 and then
below that we're going to have a lock-up
of my face in the middle and then some
interest icons on the right and left now
I'm thinking right now I'm pausing
because I want to consider how these
things are gonna you know layout when
you're in mobile there's I'm seeing two
options one is that I could have the
head the head shot kind of remain where
it is and remain the size that it is and
how big is it 200 pixels yeah it looks
200 pixels um and then below that like
have a have a lock-up of four of those
four icons that's one way to do it or I
could just kind of like shrink
everything in you know like make the
head smaller wrist as our browsers get
smaller um now why is that important to
me because that's important to me when
I'm doing the markup right now because I
want to think about the order in which
I'm laying out these elements and these
objects I think what I'm going to do it
actually actually I think what I'm going
to do is a
the face first and then and then arrange
them with flexbox so I'll show you that
so the first thing I see here is it is a
division called
face lock up I don't know sometimes I
have really good class names and
sometimes they're just stupid this is
probably a stupid one face lock up so
this is just reminding me that this is
the area of my faces and it's locked up
with these other icons the first element
is going to be a div class face face -
image maybe and then after that I'm like
oh another do icon - pencil and then
there's four of these so I'll just make
them a pencil mouse it is a hot summer
day tonight I'll tell you that much
browser I'm sweating and that's like a
little video playlist so I'll just say
that's a video okay uh that looks pretty
tight yeah that's good
and then here is I'm going to grab some
lorem from this widget that I have
called Laura Fi it is the best coupe
that out right there and then I'm going
to take the first sentence and put it
inside of a strong tag notice how the
lead sentence is like a little bit
bolder a little bit bigger so I want to
just take advantage of that and that
kind of emphasis this paragraph is kind
of long I'm going to be around here and
then after that let me talk about need
an area
class we'll call it skill lockup
and inside there I'll do my skills okay
so let's start styling right here I know
that I haven't styled the skill locket
but I want to talk about a little bit
about that later
oh yeah let's jump to the browser and
see what we have ready right now
oh nothing but I have an error our
Jekyll's not running let's take a look
it Jekyll is saying no you can't run
because there's a valid CSS selector oh
this is all in the CSS page hahaha that
was all in my CSS document okay now it's
all in the in the HTML document let's
refresh our okay there we are
that's much better okay last time I set
a placeholder right here this guy and I
called it like small something let's go
to our placeholders in our base and it's
called small bold so in their sections
of the Empire bout we want to say the
our h3 this is a at extend placeholder
do I get a placeholder small bold okay
that's that's exactly the way I want to
except for I want the color to be a
little bit different and that's fine and
I say um color accent I'm going to make
a I'm going to make a color called
accent I want to put that in my VARs
right see I got a error running in the
area because the accent is not created
yet so let's go create accent color let
me sample what accent color should be
grab that hex right there copy and then
I'll go into the bars file and make some
color make some far so this is what is
called accent
now when we run it our Jekyll should
compile nicely because that sass works
and the headline is going to be that
color so I'm going to build up these
variables slowly over time because I
want them to be a place that when
anybody uses this theme they can open up
a few documents that can open up the
configure file they can open up this
variables foot file and it'll be a place
for them to make it quit a few quick
changes and have dramatic results
propagate throughout the site okay this
h3 also needs to be text-align:center
and okay that's good for the h3 now
we're going to jump into one of the more
complicated parts of this section the
actual of lockup of what I call it what
do I call this thing face lock all right
face lock up what's a buddy okay let's
take a look at this and we wanted to
note how big our face lock up area is to
begin with it's never going to be wider
than 780 pixels right so the face
up I'm going to say max width is 780
pixels and that's cool and then I want
to use a Bourbon to create a display
flex so I want to turn this thing into a
flexbox
which will help me kind of arrange the
icons and spaced them out really easily
and then um we have to do some work and
actually go get those icons so let's get
them the first thing shouldn't be too
hard or is it the first thing is
actually my face so let's give that get
that face
so to extract layers sometimes I do this
and it's really easily I just select the
layers I want and duplicate them but
into a new document and then there they
all are alone I press command command
shift question mark and I type trim and
then I find the trim feature and trim
says where do we like to trim away on a
trim away the transparent pixels from
the top bottom left and right as soon as
I hit okay I have a document that's
trimmed all the way down to the bare
bones of the image so it's a easy export
from there now my background is white
but I don't yeah so I'll make it a jpg
so that it could be smaller look at that
it went down to 13
kilowatts it went down to 313 kilobytes
from was it from 60 something is a pain
yeah so JPEGs give you a lot better in
this situation and this is uh here we
are site nope assets image I'm going to
put it in this and call face face JPEG
okay and then the other thing I need to
export are these icons so let's get them
how did I do this grab illustrator oh
yes we're doing exporting as a SS SVG
again look at the size of these circles
I think there was it a hundred pixels
nope not you the ellipse it's a yes
those are 100 pixels wide so um I want
to create a new document in Illustrator
that is 100 by 100 okay and then I'm
going to select these shapes with
Photoshop control and control copy
control paste and then I have a shape
here I can put it any color I want just
gotta make sure I get the shape
completely for coffee and another
pasting here this one's pink
so sometimes design can be very
laborious and kind of tedious and slow
this is what this is
I'm just gonna do the process you know
and you serve our orange okay so I have
all of the shapes kind of centered in
this document it's 100 pixels by 800
pixels so I want to keep the boundaries
the same on every shape even though they
are kind of not the same dimensions on
the individual shapes but the document
boundaries will be the same and that's
important because I want the shades to
kind of fit together well visually so
the first thing I'm going to do is grab
these other shapes and delete them and
then I'm going to command save the
command ship save and I'm going to save
this what is this one Mouse and I want
to save it as an SVG save it to my
desktop save okay good
yep and command Z to get my other ones
back and hose to a pencil this time
delete everything else all right we have
exported all our shapes and now we have
all these SVG shapes here on the desktop
now I want to open these all up with my
code editor not my other thingy and I
want to make files make places for these
and I already have a folder here called
icons
so the first thing we'll make is new
file you know call icon slash pencil dot
HTML done and I grab my pencil pencil
document here I think that's it yeah
copy and paste again I want to find that
view box and delete it cuz it's annoying
for me I don't really understand if I
just know that it bugs me and then the
new document icon slash browser dot HTML
okay get the browser copy paste and
delete that few bucks save closed
browser
got it okay icon one more time
icon what is it video dot HTML sorry
this is boring guys but this is real
life this is really what you got to do
just got through these little Boreas
tasks sometimes if you're good enough
you can find a way to automate this I'm
just not that good video does Figi done
and then the last one is going to be
icon slash what is it Mouse browser oh
my god Mouse html's okay icon mouse copy
copy paste delete the view box
done alright we have all our icons as
SVG's this is really exciting let's plug
them into our markup as partials and so
let's go to our about HTML and right
here we're going to put a curly mustache
% % totally out mustache that guy and
right include icon - PNC a
nice you know okay and then I'm just
going to paste that guy that's kind of
going to write those mustaches and this
one's going to be mouse and this one is
going to be browser and this one you're
gonna move that's my youtubes up did it
let's check out our browser refresh it's
centered that's bit did eat anything
even happen let's look at our inspector
element try to find our lockup no
nothing happened drive an error error
includes pencil HTML P L oo oo guys okay
I need to write the path the heat is
getting to me I swear it
alright now we should have like a bunch
of space and then all those icons act
that's the face like a pencil
so I'm trying to figure out why the icon
itself is making is not picking up any
beautiful has a path as a fill color
what did I do wrong maybe because I put
it as let me just take this display off
okay so that's what it was the display
flex was we're not ready for the flex in
our displays yet okay
Oh strange so the first thing I want to
do is get that image working so if I
look back I have my face in the middle
of a circle that shouldn't be too hard
and that one is called face image okay
class face image
it's going to be a size 100
border-radius 50% and uh well siz this
guy i get background but why did I save
it as a circle I guess I don't care
about the border radius if it's already
a circle background:url assets images
face dot jpg
weird the 200 ok there's my circle face
and then these other guys are called
what they call icon - pencil okay I'm
going to teach you a guy's a selector I
have taught you this before but if you
do bracket bracket class with a carrot
up means if as long as the class
includes any of this which is icon space
okay so that's that's going to be all
four of these even though they all have
separate classes they all have a class
name that includes the characters set
icon - this is this is selecting them
all and I want them to be size 100 so
they should be a lot smaller now okay
cool
now let's see if that display flex is
still gonna mess us up okay
it did not hmm good good good good
okay let's do the background um so we
can see what our space looks like what I
want to do is I want to order this
what's it called just order three that
right
maybe I have to I've never used in order
before so this is kind of new for me as
well so I think maybe I have to
designate the order of everything else
as well so icon - pencil you're going to
be order number one okay looks like you
did that and who else is in the house
icon - mouse number two bronzer
you know three or four that change
anything
yeah it okay yeah it works this is what
I wanted to do a whole time I knew what
I was doing the whole time and you guys
just thought I didn't know what I was
doing but I actually did
hahahaha all right let's take our face
lock up and just Center that we're going
to use margins a margin of zero Auto and
center this pink block here and we want
to dis disburse or we want to kind of
distribute these icons and the face in
in like an even kind of way line items
in the center that should distribute
everything in the center yes that's what
I wanted and then I wanted I think it's
called da okay if I remove this pink
area I can I no longer need it this is
exactly the setup that I wanted it's
exactly this few spacing issues with the
top and a few spacing issues or a few
like background images issues here so
let's grow this guy here and we'll say
the background and you'll say the we'll
say back ground the color is going to be
the VG color and I'm going to go to find
the BG color in my VARs BG color
and the BG color is going to be ladies
and gentlemen drumroll please whatever
the heck that is copy paste do you know
that is what it sounds like when you
paste
all right there should be squares okay
cool and that's round round that out
with a board radius board radius 50% bro
all right whoo oh my gosh look at the
order that's way out of line why is it
what okay well so the pencil is last and
it should be first and this first it
should be last okay oh except didn't
change with this supposed to be it's a
video okay so you see the order there is
okay that's what we wanted now I notice
all these weird colors these weird
colors are the colors that I exported
from so we need to go back into our our
markup that gives us these paths and
delete those delete the attribute that
gives us that fill color because I want
to set that fill color in the CSS and if
it's written up in an attribute in line
that will override my CSS because it's
much stronger okay so in the about in
the icon I want to say I want the back
wrong
oh no the fill oh no fill
I need to say the path fill is going to
be what my accent but ah right oh this a
little darker than accent oh there's two
kinds of accents here the pound go to my
VARs accent - light and this is going to
be accent
yes yes so my this my head 3 is going to
be accent - light all right now let's
look at it ah yes looking much better ok
so let's talk about sizing looks like we
have a hundred pixels here from the top
yes okay so the h3 needs a padding top
of 100 pixels great and the face lock up
actually let's just go from the thing it
should be what 30 yes and 30 bottom so
let's say padding 0 and 30 pixels now
this should look a little bit better
ooh yes nice nice sexy white space ok
next thing I need to do is get this this
about section in gear and let's take a
look at how big it should be from this
blind of this line is about six hundred
and twenty pixels about a third of the
page so what did I call it
it's a they call it anything P class and
you know I'm gonna wrap it in something
a div class because if you have more I
don't want to put the class on the
paragraph because what if you have more
paragraphs I don't know what you're
gonna do I don't know how much you plan
on writing I would recommend you
something really short but I don't know
what you going to do so I'm going to put
all the paragraphs in one thing and I
call it class blurb div and then indent
okay so in the blurb
the width needs to be the max width you
know what I'm going to do I'm going to
do the max width once I say 620 pixels
I want to put some padding on it of like
10 pixels on the sides is 10 picks 10
pixels but I just want that padding cuz
I don't want those too I don't want the
characters the letters to touch the
sides of the phone when you know it's in
a mobile phone sometimes you see that
people like oh yeah it will just get
smaller that's true it will get smaller
but the problem is like you don't have
any space around your text and it's just
it's really amateurish so I want to put
some pixel I think 15 actually is good
padding on each side of that 620 and I
want to margin:0 auto so I can get it in
the center there okay great
now how much space from the top do we
need about a hundred right no about 50
so that's going to be 50 Otto and the
oops not 500 silly px and another 50 I
guess okay cool now the font size is
quite large it's 24 font size is 24
pixels and yeah and the strong should
normally be bold anyway boom
oh my life that is just beautiful I want
it to be centered text-align:center oh
yeah so good okay
but I want actually the weight font
weight to be 300 and then I hope that
the strong remains bold okay good that
looks a lot
that looks really sexy I like it okay
and now
let's let's pause there let's not go
further and let's talk about this let's
talk about that what's happening there
we don't want that so let's add a the
bottom of this section of the faces and
stuff I'm going to add a media query say
at media screen and max width of and how
big is this is it but if you have your
inspector open and start moving your
browser any of these like little pixel
dimensions at the top so it was like 640
right yeah it starts impacting around
6:00 starts looking like jump around 6
650 say 650 650 pixels what do we want
to happen when we get past six fifty
pixels what do we play about six-foot
okay oh gee that wouldn't happen okay
cool all right now what do we want to
happen when it gets past 650 pixels I
want the header to be a bit top and I
want those bottom ones to collapse down
now if we look at what we have going on
in our markup we have the header as this
div at the top and the divs of pencil
icon stuff now look the icon gives right
here are down below in a cluster so I
think the display flex off of that
parent then we should get pretty close
to what we're looking to do so let's say
that when that happens we'll take dot
face slash lock up and we'll make the
display block
see ya
yes now we want to text-align:center I
want them all to be like centered so
these divs need to be
display:inline-block and that way they
can follow my center command but they're
all being in line here so the div of
what's this guy called face image
display:block but it's not what people
do one's been centered after that Willie
what's it called what am I trying to do
here I'll try to get the face centered
and then these four below and then if
you gave a smaller like in a four grid
the face is a div right what might work
is this back ground position
and then with the width needs to be 100
sent up with Auto and the
background-repeat:no-repeat boom oh my
god oh did it did it nailed it
and I also want the margin bottom to be
a little healthier say 30 pixels and
these guys here these guys need to have
a little bit better margin to ten each
ah that's nice that looks good so when
it gets smaller this guy will be
centered these four will spread out like
that when it gets even smaller than that
those shrink up let's jump down now to
the next section that I haven't even
written the markup for and write down
markup the skills markup so in the HTML
I have the skills lock up outlined here
um I want to make a div called skill
unit and inside there I'll have my div
class skill label that doesn't even and
then down here I was thinking I'll do
these liens but I think I had another
idea that was kind of fun um div class
skill icons or something and then in
here I'm going to write um spans
I want ten of them one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten
cool uh let's do how many of these eight
eight of these units then school unit
all right now I want to get eight of
these guys one two three four five six
seven eight
that's a lot of skill units but that's
okay we got a lot of skills
the first one is communication
second one is organization third one in
it that's about right don't google it
come on google it
yeah third one is learning fourth way is
teaching planning
a visual design UX design and program
now I want to talk a little bit about
the actual language that I use for these
labels you might see in a lot of these
kind of places where people will say ah
I'm good at Photoshop
you know like 80% or 90% and my also go
to illustrator and InDesign I'm good at
making logos in and websites I'm good at
jQuery or you know HTML and CSS 3 or and
sass you know and they'll and they'll
pick out specific technologies to
emphasize and that's what that's ok you
can do that but what I've done here I
think is a little bit more elevated it's
a little bit more mature it shows that
it shows the potential employer or for
or potential client that you're thinking
on a little higher plane right I'm not
talking about the specific skills like
do you think that your employer cares if
you're good at Photoshop no does not
care the employer the employer cares if
you're good at understanding users and
giving them what they need the employer
cares if you're good at communicating
with his team right so these things that
I've chosen to kind of point out in my
skill set are more elevated a more
grown-up more mature right and I think
that if you you focus on your technical
skill set it shows that um you're new to
the game it does when you jump out of
college or your schooling and and what
you've learned is technical stuff I've
learned Photoshop I've learned this
programming language whatever and that's
what you highlight on your resume or in
this case on your portfolio website
after you've been around the block a few
times you realize that those things are
not as important as you thought they
were the important things are are things
like are you able to learn quickly are
you able to organize yourself and be
organized by other people are you able
to communicate with teams and work
efficiently are you able to you know
plan and I covered the technical things
by yes I can also do visual design now
my employer doesn't care if I do I use
Photoshop or sketch or ufi design
visually design straight in the browser
doesn't care but I can do visual design
that's what I pointed out I can do UX
design user experience and I can do
programming I just had program because I
want it and then when we talk about what
does this mean programming like oh it
means I can do HTML CSS JavaScript I can
do sass and the jQuery and on and on and
on so just that's just my thoughts on on
these things now let me show you what I
was going to shout through so the plan
that I had was to do these bars and I
thought that was going to be a little
those going to be fun but something a
little bit more challenging would be to
do a little bit more stylized
presentation of it so let's jump in the
About section here and go down to my
skill lock up skill - Lakhan and our
skill lock up is going to be let's say
700 pixels wide max width is 700
and margins will just say for now fifty
pixels and auto run into a few spaces I
like being at the bottom of this
document okay a skill lock up looking
good looking good
cool these labels are pretty much how
they should be I think unless they
should be a little lighter nine nine
nine yeah okay just throw the color in
there uh you're gonna be $9.99 guys ah
much a little bit more subdued subdued
and I don't have a title over this
section it just goes into what it is
okay let's do 100 yeah better okay um
now let's talk about each of these skill
units skill unit you're going to be 50%
wide
I don't want it okay so I just think I'm
just thinking right now in my mind about
how I want these things to be organized
so that they collapse well and I think
what I want to do is I don't want to do
a very flexible way so I'm just going to
define it a hard width on these skill
units because I know that my line the
line below below them is going to be a
fixed width and then I'll just let them
collapse in right okay so it'll be like
a straight column of them instead of
like a two column approach so the width
is going to be seven hundred divided by
two which is 350 pixels and oh we're
gonna do floating down left let's see
what we got there
yeah we got to do a what is this thing
called oh yeah clear fix I
I said that a the clear fix was a hack
in the last video and I was just talking
on my but it's not a hack uh and I and
the fact that it's not a hack was
generously pointed out to me in the
comment section
I do read again I do read every comments
and respond to everyone that I can some
of them I can't because like there's
just no reply button I don't know what's
up with that YouTube but whatever so
we're floating left and um I have these
skill units here the skill icons so
let's make a skill icon each span is
going to be display:inline-block
and the size of this skill I con I think
is going to be let's say 14 pixels and
margin actually let's not do the margin
I want to show you something when you
just when you put something
display:inline-block it's going to act
like a bunch of characters in a
paragraph or a bunch of like images
stacked next together it all going to
show the same baseline but they're going
to be stacking in line they're not going
to be doing like this like you expect
okay it's for the background yeah
background color as what what's the
background color background cool yeah
things background color right okay -
okay so this is it this is interesting
so remember we've ever here where I
broke the line that's what this break is
for so there's there's like five 15
pixel icons here and 5 here and then
they're actually responding to this
markup that's route so there's like this
bug with inline block is that if if
they're not on the same line in the
actual markup they're going to have this
gap between them which is it which is a
bug it is a bug and I don't I don't know
if there's there is a plan to fix it or
if we're just going to have to like
understand it and deal with it but the
way that you fix it one of the ways you
fix is doing this font size on the
parent 0 there you go boom okay
and scale icons with a margin bottom how
big is this Oh 30
cool now I can go over here to my fans
and give them a margin margin right of
two pixels that's not how you do
marching right there you go and on them
do border-radius
50% so I want them to be able school
little circles I want to put the pseudo
element of after in here by saying and
call it after content nothing
display:block size if they if these are
each 14 pixels I want to have two so 10
going to have two pixels between target
watch these are 10 pixels by 10 pixels
and color or background white border
radius is going to be a circle so 50%
and margin two pixels okay now this
should create a little white dot in the
middle of these dots to create the
illusion of a circle yay we win so why
do I feel like I haven't won a little
bit of space between two pixels 0 and 30
ok you know it's nice and then I want to
crease actually
I want to put the margin on the actual
units here and say five in between each
other so they spread out a little bit
better there you go that looks good okay
now what I want to do is I want a way
for who's ever manipulating this
document later on to easily indicate how
many of these circles they want to be
activated or filled right so how should
we do that
hmm let's make it a class and so we'll
say skill icons and then we'll say
active
eight so that they rate themselves an
eight rating rating rating is good
rating an eight rate eight rating active
eight score eight skill a skill eight
that's what I want skill eight okay so
say and skill - eight span and then if
your skill eight span want to select all
the spans so I say enth child this is
kind of a complicated selector here and
child of n plus nine see if that's right
your background is going to be accent
drum roll please oh I got it backwards
but I did get that count right so check
that out so all of them are not accented
except for the last two so all we need
to do is put this as the accent color so
make them accent colors by default and
make this one back was a BG color and
then see we got okay so all of them are
by default skill levels pro level and
then the eight here is why we counted up
to eight cool I'm so excited about this
now what I need to do is take this
pattern of the skill level and kind of
like manipulate it out and I want to use
sass to make this easy for me to write
so I'm gonna come over here and go to
sass - Lang and then documentation and
I'm just going to scroll down here and
find the four loops now here's how you
write a for loop in sass so this is
formatted for SCSS but we won't hold it
against them it's just with the poverty
they're popular kids want we'll just for
make this format this quickly for set
for for sass okay so from one through
ten I skill - whatever number it's on
and then us this right here span um and
then this needs to be the number that it
is on okay is that that makes sense to
everybody
what this is doing and this doesn't even
matter what I want to do is be
background Koon okay what this is doing
is it's a for loop so this is creating a
new selector every time we run it and
it's starting at 1 and going through 10
so every time it goes through a loop the
the the placeholder of I will be
replaced with a number of one through
ten depending on how many times it's
gone through so the first time it'll
output one here will be skill - one span
and child n plus one is background color
all right now and then on and on and on
so when we get to eight it'll be skilled
- eight span and child and plus eight is
background color this so I want to go
check it in the CSS to make sure before
we kind of show you in the browser oh
yeah see look a skill lock up skill
icons skill one span one should get this
one so now that's interesting if it made
all of these new selectors with new new
properties I wonder if we can't still
make this a little bit more dry now bear
with me if this is kind of stupid and
annoying and we already have it working
what more do we need something then
something that already works but what if
we made a placeholder out of this and
then we were able to to make this a
little bit more dry let's try that so
I'll go over to my place holders
actually I'll keep the placeholder in
line because it's very unique situation
and it's not a global selector I just
want to condense this a little bit more
I'm just being nippy like generally you
probably wouldn't even go this far but
let's do it just for the kids about and
we'll say placeholder skill - color is
background color background color and
then we'll say at extend that I wonder
all right hold on to your butt's let's
see what we got haha look at this it's
all those selectors stacked upon each
other and then just one
CSS property of the background and our
background color so what this does is it
gives us like a really tight markup so
so some people okay
let me just address some people you guys
who say that they don't like cents
because you can't control the output and
they like I like to be I like to be in
control of the up okay number one SAS is
not going anywhere
deal with it it's here to stay so you
better get on board or like you're going
to be behind and you're going to you're
going to wish that you had gotten on
board earlier and number two you can
control the output in a very very
detailed way in fact even possibly even
better and easier than if you were
you're writing this all by hand this
would be so annoying if you're running
it all by hand but look how easy it was
to output all that by SAS alright I'm
climbing off of the pulpit now let's
apply these classes to our various skill
sets and see how easy it is for the
people who come after us or who are
using this theme later to to kind of
demonstrate their skills so in a
communication I would say my skill is
like I'm rocking at 9:00 on the
communication and then of skill on the
organization oh that's going to be a
seven so I'm super good organization but
it's still a little bit organized skill
level learning is tanks I love learning
skill level teaching is a I'll put that
into six because I kind of suck at this
game planning skill equals we learned a
lot of plans we just leveled up there
were seven visual design skill level is
five four five skill level of you at UX
design is um eight and programming skill
is um 109 let's go
six per variety now I'm refresh oh yeah
we have a really cool like stylized
indicator of where we are at in the
specific departments that we've already
alluded to let's add a media query here
at media
screen and brynn max width equals Oh
what I say for something 545 41 pixels
take this skill lock up and make the
width be what to 70 exactly and it's
already centered so that should be just
a nice line of these things as soon as
this gets any smaller than it is watch
this
OOP there we go so when that's on your
mobile phone it'll look like this is a
nice column of here there you go
I'm really happy with that okay um let
me show you guys a review of what we got
we have the artists theme header that we
did last week and here will be about me
with some icons that are vectors you
zoom in a lot I mean if this is on a
retina yeah what the heck of that this
is on a Retina display these are gonna
look nice and juicy um a place for you
to write your dumb things about yourself
and then this is the thing that we just
did cool I'm really happy with the way
this is turning out I hope you are too
and hope that you know your eyes are
following along and coding this out with
me I think that's going to be the best
way for you to like really understand
the nitty gritties of what we're doing
is to type it all out yourself and kind
of get your head around it thank you so
much for watching thank you so much for
being a part of what dev tips is and and
I'm just really happy to to have you
here and tune in if you have any
questions like you do just leave them in
the comments down below I try to comment
I try to answer every comment that comes
my way while we're still small I can do
that and then
check out github.com /dev tips to get to
download these files and please if you
do have fun with these videos if you
like it if this is if this is what
you're excited about share it with your
friends please and share it with
everybody else like your groups and you
know you're on Facebook or whatever
Twitter that you think will be
interested in this because I would like
to share this with as many people as I
can a lot goes into this a lot of
preparation a lot of effort and my voice
gets dry and I show so much people's can
I think I'm talking too much I really
appreciate you guys I just I don't want
to stop talking about how much I like I
like the fact that that you guys are
into this and that sometimes I feel like
I'm the only one and then I met and I
met you guys on YouTube anyway I'll stop
talking Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
