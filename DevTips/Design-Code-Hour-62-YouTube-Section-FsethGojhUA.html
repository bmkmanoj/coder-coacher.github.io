let's build my website ah thanks for
tuning in this is our 6.2 in a series I
called design and code my personal
website in 12 hours today we're gonna be
working on the YouTube section of the
home page it looks like that if you
hadn't noticed I make youtube videos and
that fact is absolutely nowhere on my
current web site and today we are going
to fix that today we're going to be
doing a few things like creating button
styles we're going to be embedding
flexible video and we're also gonna be
adding parallax for a little bit of fun
so let's get started alright in our last
video we did the About section which is
not necessarily an About section I guess
it's more of a hero section it just sets
the tone for you know the rest of the
the design to come but now we're in the
next section which is the YouTube
section so we're going to be moving on
moving on moving on done this next
section is really exciting because it's
about what we do here on YouTube it's
about us so this is like this really
special part in that okay so we have
let's try on the grid so we can see we
got we have two columns Center together
pretty straightforward we have a we
called it the home lead class for the
text right here and we have a new live
to live to create a button that's new
and and also we have to live to add a
but to end this video here and this
background of other thumbnails behind it
should be fun should be fun so let me
show you how we're gonna start okay so
we have to go to our sections and
basically create a new section new file
and it's gonna be in Jade files on call
that section - YouTube
Jade and in that section let's go grab a
column and I think we did reflect
centers what we want so we're gonna put
a random flex center right there now we
have to go to our index.html and add add
this Jade file and do that right or at
the YouTube section and do it right
under the about YouTube saved and saved
and let's see what do we want to do next
oh we're gonna name this section on
YouTube cool
we also need to create a new new file
and we're gonna call this a section
YouTube and let's save that we're gonna
save that as um let's see in assets
sections um - YouTube sass
that's what I wanted and then go into
main dot sent us a CSS and add that here
under all about okay so we've got our
home sass cutter section Jade added into
the sass say add it into the index so
let's do a quick test here back home
pink is okay so perfect is showing up
right right here right where we wanted
it but we don't want to do the
background pink that's just silly
business let's look at the content in
the Photoshop it says okay so the
sentence starts here Travis is trying
to grow up but instead come on grids but
instead spends his time teaching
everyone how to make websites up on
YouTube so we have two columns one is
for the b'doop b'doop
oops right here leave it what it's
called video thumbnails and one's gonna
be playable and then we have one column
for the copy and the CTA but remember
back in the day a few videos ago when we
made the grid we said that we always
wanted our CTA to be on the bottom when
when it collapsed so for example right
here this one has the CTA in it and then
when we collapse this this grid the CTA
will be on the bottom see us on the
bottom and not on the top even though
it's on the left and the way that we do
that is we put it on the bottom that's
right okay and this is gonna be called
home bleed and there's a there's a
there's a class on this these ones that
are in the CTA I think it's called order
something okay order first is the class
that we want to use so column one order
first now see what it says teaching
everyone up there it is it's on the
right now or it's on the left no so it's
on the left and then when we squeeze it
down let's do some squeezing squeeze it
down it's gonna be on the bottom because
okay it's gonna be on the bottom because
what we want is those thumbnails to be
you know when it's in mobile well those
thumbnails be above it and then below it
the headline and then blow that their
call to action fair enough
cool let's do let's do the background
I have created the background already
and extract it is so I created the
background in the design it's like this
red with the YouTube logo in the dev
tips logo and I call it YouTube
background gif it's not an animated gif
it's just a gift because it was a good
file size for me so let's call that here
image da its new RL is the cash - images
you too - BG gif
save save okay and then after that I
want to like move it around in size it
the position is a pretty simple position
center vendor Center there you go and
then for the size I want it to be again
cover I just liked our I like it too
much I think cover and the on this
section the color the font it's like the
dark color I want it to be to be white
so now we all have white colors on our
text okay okay okay very nice very nice
the see this little detail right here in
the design where it's out dented that's
really good detail
that's called a hanging hanging hanging
graphics that you you'll see that often
times with like a quotation you know
like if you're quoting like this is the
coolest and there's like that hanging
quote right there it's called hanging
quote I don't know if it's coming a
hanging ellipses here but what does call
it that
hanging ellipses how do we do a hanging
ellipse as well well we want to add a
special bus so not all of them have it
right like like this one it's not gonna
have a hanging ellipses although
technically it is but like design wise
it's not and then you know this one is
so so some of them are like this vine
one and this but you know the one here
is not and the one here is so we want to
add a special class to to that home lead
if we want it to be hanging and we'll
just call it out then did because that's
what it's gonna be so go class out don't
it
copy that um and I want to add this to
to the type harder if you're so third
base SAS find home lead or they've a
homemade die put in home from not find
oh gosh I I did have put in Harry if I
if I could if I say home lead and out
indented I want to have a property
called text not tag text indent and
we'll say 1m just to start us off let's
look at the design get you back here
we're looking right here I'm going to
save it and see where the indention went
okay great so a guy indented one amp
let's do a negative one am silly bring
it back out okay it's a little bit too
much let's take you down a little bit
how about zero point mmm eight it's good
maybe that's a little bit much what's
seven seven seven five that looks pretty
good
let's put a line up to it see how it
works and so maybe he maybe too much
still but I'm worried about this
everyone what's my design look like did
everyone hang there does it put down
let's leave it there we can go back and
mess a bit later on if the other ones
down below I have a hard time with that
style but here's a problem without
denting if I make this squeeze down for
a for a mobile design looks good looks
good looks good
fine whatever fine fine whatever
fine I'll know that's all we're we're
dented right
we're dented so let's do out dented and
media will just say that max width of
640 again and we want to take the out
dented and just remove it text indent
zero okay so now when it gets into
mobiles mmm it's gone no need to talk
every time just just win it just when
it's like you know it's a detail we want
we have the luxury of having it there
looks good to me okay next we want to go
back to let's close this and close close
this close all right next we want to go
back to our home and we have another
element here that we have we want it to
be oh it's like it's gonna be an anchor
tag a link and the ref is gonna be in
here and the class is gonna be called a
home CTA CTA means call to action so
this is going to be a button I want you
to click it I want to call you to the
action of clicking my button it's hard
to make it look awesome and our design
calls for it to be to be this type of
awesome a white box awesome and the in
the text inside of that says watch on
youtubes oh I know they're rough right
now the URL of my youtube channel is
HTTP you to you rube tube column slash
dev tips for designers save okay so we
want this white box here
want the white box does it spans the
whole length of the column and I think
it does every time I think it does every
time so so so so so so so so this is a
module kind of yellow don't put that in
modules so let's open up our sidebar or
modules in our first module
congratulations new file buttons dot
Sesay ish and then we want to open up
main sass - so that we can add buttons
in modules so that's to touch month.you
delays slash funds save and exit
okay so buttons buttons let's talk about
butt ends what did I call the button
here let me give it a class home CTA
where to start their home you know
sometimes you would think that like hey
Travis wouldn't you make like a very
very general button class and then you
know make the home CTA be an extension
of that maybe you know but like the only
thing I have a design for any button it
is this home CTA so I'm just gonna do
what I have design and then later on
when it gets like the internal pages or
something else I'm like you know what I
needed but a like a generic button then
I'll return to this page which is a
buttons see you notice that I didn't
call it this the SAS finally didn't call
it home CTA got SAS I called over
buttons so home CD gives it one type of
button and just you know according to
this design it's the only kind of behalf
so far and there are variations of it
from section to section of
mean by that like here it's white or the
blue here it's blue Hawaii here it's
white with green here it's you know any
like here's one that's like attached to
a form that's gonna be interesting that
will be interesting
all right so let's do this home CTA home
CTA what's your DNA well your delay is
your font size is gonna be used at 36
no it's 28 font size it's 28 pixels and
you're gonna be we want to what we said
we want to stretch the whole width so
your display is going to be the block
but II need that already and background
I'll say the default will be white and
then we can change it on a section to
section basis and text-align:center let
me see if he is working out all right
now move this move this down this up
okay Oh Center okay
watch on YouTube good good I need some
padding I don't want to pad the right
and left because it does span the whole
width already the but I want pad the top
so padding um let's say let's just start
our stupid one M and then zero why would
I do one M because oh that's why also I
want to take let's take the line height
and put it at something like one because
you know padding in line height you have
to kind of work with them both to get it
good get a good mix because like what if
I did well you know what if I had to
like what if I relied only on line
height right and I didn't put any
padding in but like here let me show you
what if I did this but then I did like
this right that looks nice sure
whatever thinking that looks a little
bit better maybe maybe that looks good
would have whatever but the problem is
is if I had you know I want you to I had
a long text raining inside my button
just just for example I wouldn't do this
but you know if that were the case look
what happens because my line height is
so ridiculously long so it's important
to set your line height at first and I
said one and one that's probably too
tight see it's too tight so let's go
like 1.25 you know yeah that's good and
then we want to add padding's to the top
and bottom of that once the line height
is set I said 1m it's a little bit
extreme
how about point 0.5 M half of an M how
about 0.4 m yeah that's good now let's
go back to that string and get that
remove your feet okay and that looks
good to me looks good okay we want to do
Oh
actually one of the big things is a box
shadow notice this design has a pretty
pretty significant box shadow and
actually let's just look directly I'm
gonna show you guys how to translate a
box shadow okay let's look at how to
translate the Photoshop files box shadow
drop shadow right here into CSS okay so
we have we in in Photoshop will use
angle and distance in in CSS we use X
distance and Y distance so the
the X distance is actually zero because
the angle is 90 so state zero pixels and
then the white white distance is four
pixels and the size is the kind of glar
is eight pixels and the and the opacity
is black zero zero zero zero point four
right okay my beard is gone let's just
continue coding all right one oh six
point six I don't like it
how about 0.4 I do like it fantastic you
know what this needs now a little bit of
transition will help that out quite
nicely transition and let's say all 0.15
seconds make it quick
ease in out see how that looks wonderful
except for the color of this button is
the default color of every button I want
to change from section to section so
what I might do is run over to my
YouTube sass and say home - C ta color
is going to be this YouTube color there
we go nice bright red and it doesn't
change when I hover over it fantastic
this looks good the next thing we're
gonna do is get rid of this lorem here
and add the actual video strip let's
look at our design we're gonna add this
video strip behind it here and the
mark-up that I need to do to enable this
design is I need to create a container
for that video strip which I'll just
call video strip conveniently and I'll
show you how to create the video on top
of it in just a minute so for the video
strip we'll run over to our YouTube SAS
again actually let's just close out
button
room for YouTube's ass and create a new
line called video strip let's make the
background pink so I can see it and then
we'll give it some dimension by changing
the position of it position:absolute and
top:0 the width will be the whole width
of the parent and we have to define the
width again because we made it absolute
positioned with a 100% the height will
be 100% - okay something's going on
there that is breaking out of the the
column that we want it to can be
contained by so right here we see in
this market that the video strip is in
column one we neither take column one
and make that position relative so let's
make a new style for column one and make
it position relative okay now our pink
is contained within fantastic so it's
our height or our top zero we want to
accommodate for the margins so same
margin negative fifty for the top and
bottom and then you know zero for the
left and right now because we've cinched
up the margin top we need to bring it
back down to meet the bottom of this you
know the opening of that container so it
needs it needs we need to add basically
another 100 pixels just like that but
that's not going to work we need to wrap
it in the calc function the CSS calc
function which is probably the most
awesome thing in CSS right now watch
that see it does math on the fly live in
your browser I love it calc function
take the hundred percent of this height
and add a hundred pixels to it and that
is it's it's going up top to bottom
fantastic and now to do the background
and let's just remove the background
color
for the background you want the image to
be the URL images video strip dot pink
yep great and then let's say for the
position we want to Center it and then
put it at the top fantastic and then
no-repeat and then this is this is gonna
be important here because the this image
is actually just a little bit too big so
so why don't I shrink it down using size
as well shrink it down maybe say like
fifty percent okay too small how about
sixty seven seventy I like seventy okay
seventy percent you know would be really
cool right here do you more the parallax
series the parallax series where we did
the you know the the things that
scrolled depending on your scroll why
don't we add that so let's open our
functions file and let's just comment
out the the ready function there and
we're gonna make a new function that's
based on the windows scroll so alright
function inside of that and now inside
of this window scroll we'll just we'll
just make a function called YouTube as
YouTube vid scroll something like that
make it a function and then grab that
name come down here and here's where the
actual code of the function is going to
be
function youtube vids grow okay cool now
what's going to be in our function well
the first thing we need to do is capture
the variable of the W scroll remember we
did this we did this before it's gonna
be pretty easy so I will say when this
window is scrolling with the first
function right here
capture the position from the top how
far did it scroll so we'll scroll top is
the is the how we're gonna write that
let me show you how that works console
dot log till the use parole all right
check out my console when I scroll here
we're gonna see a number this number
that's showing up in my scroll is how
far from the top I have scroll to my
browser now that we know that number we
can just do a really simple jQuery
selector right here select that video
strip and just do CSS and mess with that
background position remember we set the
background position right here to be
Center top don't we set that to be that
Center zero pixels and now we can use
background background position to be
what do we say it was Center zero pixels
semicolon okay so the zero pixels is
where we want to focus so let's quote
this out put two pluses and then
basically just put W Scroll in there so
so now that background image will be
equal to how far we've scrolled down
let's see if that works
Oh weird okay so it's we do want to
repeat first of all first of all we do
want to repeat you see how the no repeat
is we want repeat repeat why okay it
looks kind of cool it's like the
background like these what do they call
them thumbnails are not moving with the
rest of the page it's still out of sync
it's still a parallax but if we go to
the functions and we write instead of
being scroll pixels so equal to how far
we scroll down we just put negative
scroll pixels it'll be the the reverse
of how far we've scrolled down in
negative numbers yeah I like that a lot
better what do you think close our
functions for now and jump back into the
Styles get rid of pink all together okay
so let's take a look at the design here
we have the design and we need to find a
way to embed that video onto the Play
page and make it playable I have an
embed code for the video I want to put
it inside of this Jade document here and
I want to put it inside of another div
and I'll call that flex video does that
sound familiar
flex video it should let's go over to
foundation components flex video now
foundation CSS framework has a lot of
great things going on for it one of them
is the very smart way that they did the
Flex video now if we do a really quick
inspect element on their move flex video
here player let's see okay there's two
there's two things we want to pay
attention to want to pay attention to
the iframe and the class of flex video
so flex video I'm gonna have this let's
go into our project here and add a new
file
into our modules ii will call it flex
video sass and then we need to add that
into the main dots as to don't call it
flex video
and that's in two modules all right
let's say flex video and basically just
let's just steal this copy and paste
all right looks good but they have a lot
of stuff that we don't really want like
this margin-bottom stuff don't need that
overflow:hidden yeah padding-bottom we
do padding-top but no well yeah okay
don't need any of that stuff and then
there's this iframe which we need to
grab and it looks like this
all right while we're still in code let
me just explain what we're doing right
here so flex video class is going to be
a wrapper around which we put the embed
that we made for example how we've done
here with Flex video and then inside we
put an iframe now the Flex video class
in our SAS says that the Flex video
wrapper will have a height of 0 and its
position will be relative and the child
of that here's the iframe it will be
position:absolute top and left 0 height
and width 100% so it will stretch to
fill whatever the proportions of this
are now the secret sauce right here is
this padding bottom the padding bottom
67% that is a special secret sauce the
secret sauce that's a special kind of
trick in CSS that the padding top or
bottom percentage is equal or is based
off of the width of the element right of
its parent element this will actually
maintain an aspect ratio right now a
67.5 let's take a look at that I think
it's gonna be a little bit too wide okay
so that's meant for like a videos that
are a little bit wider than what we have
let me let me mess around with it we'll
get a good proportion here we want to
look at the Flex video okay so 67.5 is
not what we want we want about right
there
what is that 56 all right fantastic
oh it's great but it's not exactly what
we want see it needs more room let's
take the call 1 here and add some height
to it
we want it to be about let's look at the
design here in Photoshop move about four
hundred five hundred and forty pixels
tall
is that true 540 pixels tall that is
pretty tall we don't need to be that at
all how about five hundred
oh that's five thousand five hundred
it's still a little bit much how about
four hundred I think that's reasonable
but now we have to make these elements
centered in okay so we'll say column one
because both of these things are column
one right here
let's make them display flex so that we
can Center their children align items
okay so that's not at all what we want
we want to dis we want to si flex
direction a column that way it's more of
yeah there we go and then we'll say just
give if I justify what content Center ah
there we go
now that is looking snappy alright let's
put that drop shadow if we refer back to
our design there's a pretty hefty drop
shadow on this video its target the Flex
video but it doesn't not to be it
doesn't need to be the the modular flex
bit video this needs to be a modifier
within the or does this thing called the
home a YouTube section right so inside
of YouTube section will grab flex video
and we'll put a box shadow on it zero
pixels offset maybe like four from the
top
and then want to spread to be really
hefty like 40 and then this is gonna be
actually this is gonna be the blur we
have T blur and then a spread of three
to make it just a little bit thicker
around the edge and an RGBA will just
say like you know 0.5 that looks
actually pretty freakin good
no but I'm looking at it how about this
it looks a little bit small this video
right I mean we can cook and play it
right here hey everyone what's up my
name is Travis and this is dev tips this
video is it's beautiful
I miss my beard anyway um let's say
trans form scale transform scale how big
do you want this to go let's say we want
it to go like a whole 50% larger well
that's big I like it let's try this
that's good - mm-hmm I mean do it I mean
do it so we want to get big but now we
have this like impact in impact
happening right around here and we don't
want that to happen so let's take the
type of column that we used here in our
design and make it not the the centered
one flex center let's do this one here
which is spaced around
space around is it yeah it is okay
that's cool so now when we're large
looks good but we squeeze it in and it
gets a little tight right there and
that's okay what we can do now is now
that we know where it gets tight or does
it get tight on nine nine nine nine nine
ninety four nineteen nine eighty eight
let's just do this go to youtube and say
at media max width and order to say nine
eighty eight pixels let's just say 1985
a little bit nicer hmm
transform let's basically this this
right here and we'll put it back to one
so it's so big and then it goes back to
one and then it breaks for mobile and
then it gets big again because that's
the way it works now when we're all big
let's take we don't need this the the
strip behind us right now so let's go to
video strip and say at media and our
magic a magic media query is at max
width 640 right
yeah 640 pixels and let's just say
display:none
okay now we still have a big video and
it's playable and it's looking spiffing
hey everyone what's up my name is Travis
I'm talking you listen you listen I
don't know what do you guys think that
looks pretty good right maybe we can do
this media query here again and say when
when were at this size you know we can
take away that height the the the huge
like mandatory height and they just let
the natural borders kind of handle
things in fact let's make it also the
display:block and so we can do this
padding you know add some chunky chunky
padding there 50 and 20 looks good looks
good but now we've got too much padding
right here so let's say because right
now we're selecting both of these
columns if we do and last child will
narrow those two selections of those two
columns down to that just the bottom one
because these are two columns or stacked
together like yonder we're just gonna
select this guy last child and then just
change the padding and just remove it
from the top right so top will be zero
and then left and right 20 and then
bottom 50 pixels it looks good it looks
good all right let's pull it out and
look at it looks good looks good looks
good looks good okay so now a few words
about the weirdness like with the
mustache the weirdness with like the
change there's some there's probably
some like if you go back and look at the
video there's maybe like some like
historical discrepancies i uploaded this
video and only 20 minutes of it got
uploaded the first 20 minutes of it got
uploaded and the other
you know the rest of it did not got cut
off I don't know why it's maybe it was
me maybe as YouTube I'm not blaming
maybe it was you I'm not blaming you but
it could've been you next week we'll be
