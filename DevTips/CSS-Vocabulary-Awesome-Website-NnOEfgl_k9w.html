I'm so excited that you tuned in this
Monday morning it's been such a crazy
week I was able to publish a video on
PHP academy' it was really it's like an
hour long video it's a really long video
but it's so cool because I was
explaining bourbon and I've used bourbon
here a few times but I really dug into
bourbon also included in that video is
an interview one of the creators of
bourbon so I had a really great time
making now check that out right here I
really think you enjoy also if you
haven't already check out this video
here which is a video of when I went to
the dribble meet up at Yahoo sponsored
by Shopify I talked to the jeweled
co-founder Dan cedar home I talked to 10
other professional creatives about how
they got their start in the industry and
you know giving tips to people you know
who are out there who are looking to
make an impact in this industry so a lot
of cool stuff is happening but I wanted
to quickly share a cool tip with you
today this is a website that I found
called pump Linette slash P slash AB
slash CSS / k over there so this is
called CSS vocabulary it's so cool you
can just walk through here and like
here's a bunch of vocabulary terms and
it will highlight the the corresponding
items here on on the Left we're gonna
learn the difference between a statement
and a rule set it'll highlight the
comments media type like so this little
bit right here is called a media type
for this whole little thing is you know
what qualifies as any one of these four
things a media query at rule so this is
really cool to go and understand the
different kind of like nuances of of CSS
because in order to talk intelligently
about these things we have to know you
know how to refer to them correctly and
this is a pretty cool thing I'm like
when I first found this thing eyes just
like stared at it for 20 minutes just
clicking all these things and be like oh
that's what you call that like like I
didn't know for example
didn't know that this was an expression
and like these are like nuanced little
parts of things like this is a media
type
this is an expression media features
like this I think this is so what I'm
recommending to you is to spend some
time on this there'll be a link down in
the notes below and go through and brush
up on your CS vocabulary even if you're
a seasoned pro I'm sure that you'll find
a tournament year or two that will
surprise you that you didn't know it's
really nuanced and really detailed so I
recommend that that's all I'm gonna
leave you with today I'm working on some
bigger stuff for the upcoming few weeks
and I'm really excited to talk to you
then anyhow take care of your buddy I
love your faces bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
