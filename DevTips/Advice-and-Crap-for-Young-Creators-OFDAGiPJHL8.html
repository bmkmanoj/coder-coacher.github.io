1:30 in the morning and I just got
finished wrapping up some editing on a
video that's going out about values and
properties and CSS and I wanted just to
talk real quickly about a few thoughts I
had about an entirely different subject
so I had an interesting question left in
the comments today for skillet 25 said
it would be cool if you did a video on
tips on getting a job in the computer
field and what to do when what to no
kind of thing there are so many options
out there okay fair enough um so first
of all let's talk about what kind of job
so for me I'm a designer and the do
front-end development as well
so I can talk about those kind of things
I can't really talk about what it's like
to be on the path to be a full engineer
or like a program manager or something
like that
skillett asks what to do and what to
know so a lot I first start with what to
know I would recommend to know what you
want there's only one person that can
ever answer that for you and it's you
and it's okay to change your mind from
time to time as long as you do have at
any given time a clear definition of
what you want after you know what you
want the next important thing to do is
to know where the people are that can
help you get what you want are they on a
specific social network are they hanging
out a specific club or venue an art
gallery perhaps or maybe a a cafe or
cool kids go to whatever do they live in
a specific City for myself moving out to
San Francisco was one of the biggest
things I did in my career just
surrounding myself with other people
that are have the same goals and have a
name vision for their lives as I do it
was it was a huge for my career once you
find out where these people are that can
help you get what you want the next
thing is to find out what they want and
how you can give it to them the only way
you can get what you want from somebody
is by giving them what they want and
having a synergetic relationship okay
now that you know what you want uh let's
talk about what you should do now
everyone's going to be different but
I'll tell you what I did and what worked
for me be a self-starter and try new
things all the time try your hand in
music and painting in sculpture and
woodworking try writing poetry child
writing long-form prose try public
speaking
try crafts a try try philosophy and
psychology and building relationships
try to understand all of these things
when you try these different things
whether they be related directly to your
field or not they always circle back and
enhance you as a person and thereby
propel you and help you to become the
type of producer or creator that you
want to be in that same vein you have to
really be insatiable you have to think
about this kind of stuff all the time
every minute of the day when you wake up
in the morning think about the projects
that you're going to be doing that day
as you're doing the projects like really
invest your mind into them and when you
close up for the day and go to bed and I
think about what you accomplished that
day and what you're going to do tomorrow
to further your goals every goal that
you have can be broken down into a daily
step and if you just move the needle in
even the smallest way every day you're
going to look back and you're going to
see mountains
behind you meet people who have the same
goals as you and learn from them but
work harder than them be a passionate
maker make things that directly
correlate to your path and things that
are tangential they all they all relate
and they all benefit you and be
passionate about it every time that I'm
interviewing somebody for a position the
number one thing I'm looking for is if
they're passionate about what they're
telling me don't give up you will want
to because the things that you're going
to produce in the beginning are gonna
suck and you're going to think that
you're not very good or that you never
will be but it's just the it's just
learning that's how it is
you have to create a mountain of work
under you before the good work starts to
peak out you really just need to work
through whatever you're struggling with
right now there's going to be a time
when you're still struggling and still
fussing with the work that you're trying
to accomplish but you'll look back at
what you did six months ago even two
weeks ago and you'll think wow look at
how far I've come but you just need the
experience so don't give up try to make
a few show-stopping projects and make
sure to put them where people can see
them if they can't find them there's no
use in making the middle so publish
publish often publish everything that
you haven't and be honest about it about
what you're doing and about like the
process that it took and what your
thoughts are about it if you don't like
what you're doing make more stuff make
more stuff try new things and look at it
from different angles but really try to
focus on a few show-stopping projects
and put those in front of everything
else do not wait for projects to be
given to you or assigned to you every
job offer that I've had in my life
has been a direct result from
self-initiated projects learn how to
talk to people and how to talk about
your work and once you learn that
don't ever stop talking about your work
everybody that you know should know that
you are what you make and that you're a
maker try to limit distractions
do you watch too much TV do you play
video games do you chat on the phone or
browse Facebook limit all these
distractions it goes back to being
anxiously engaged in on the work that
you're trying to do and pushing the
boundaries and the needle just kind of
moving the mountain every day even a
little bit it's not going to work
it just won't because the person right
next to you will be working harder than
you and the last bit of advice I have
tonight anyway is to surround yourself
with people who want to see you succeed
and who are invested in your happiness
there's no way you can work as hard as
I'm talking about and do as much as I'm
talking about without this there's no
way all right well that's it this has
been a really weird kind of two o'clock
in the morning
sober talk I hope I've answered some of
your questions for skillet thanks for
asking the question and I look forward
to seeing you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
