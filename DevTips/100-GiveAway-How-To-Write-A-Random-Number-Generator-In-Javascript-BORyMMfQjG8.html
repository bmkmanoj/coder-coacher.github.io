generate a random number but first let
me explain why
aha a little bit ago the dev tips
channel marked his way across the
million view line this is a very big
deal to me I asked you all to send in
videos of yourself for claiming the dev
tips motto of keep on hacking you should
check out that video it's flippin sweet
today we're gonna select one of those
dev tippers to win a $100 gift card and
we're going to do so by writing a random
number generator in JavaScript okay so
I'm gonna start with just three
documents I already have set up the
index.html style dot CSS and winner J s
the index.html is just this little short
snippet of markup here we have a winner
box when our text in the winner's name
and then there's three styles just to
make it look like this read winner text
and then the winner's name inside of a
box and then here in the winner's j/s I
already have an array built out with all
of the names of the people who submitted
the video so what we're gonna do is
going to make a new line here in the
JavaScript and let me just kind of
outline what our process should be first
we want to generate a random number then
after that apply that number
to the HTML layout okay so it should be
simple so let's try the first one
generate a random number so first we're
going to create a function and we'll
just call that winner okay now here's
the content of the function we want to
generate them random number so when I
say math the capital M that always
throws me off random okay let's put a
return in front of that all right and
then whoops come down here and make a
console log and then inside of the
console log will write winner and make
it a function and then if we go into our
console on our web page here and hit
refresh save it and refresh okay we're
gonna get generate a random number
between 0 &amp;amp; 1 and hit refresh a few
times you can see that always just
generating a decimal number with a
decimal point between 0 and 1 so what we
need to do is take this return
math.random here and put some tricky
kind of math on it and kind of
constrained the 0 to 1 number that it
gets returned and convert it into a
number between 2 or 2 ranges okay so
let's say for example we have 10 items
we want to convert this random number
into a number between 1 and 10 well
here's how to do that you say take our
first from our max number 10 and minus
our minimum over 1 for those both in the
parentheses because going to do that
operation first and then you add the
minimum number 1 all right so let's save
that and see what pops up in our console
now we have nine point nine I'm nine
point three and nine point nine seven
four we're getting a random number
between 1 and 10 just like we wanted but
the number has a decimal place on it and
we want a whole number we want a whole
integer so what we want to do there is
take this whole operation of math and
put it in parentheses
put a function on top of it another
function called math.floor now that will
take the decimal place right off so
seven to nine okay good so our function
now returns a random number between 1
and 10 but we don't necessarily want a
random number between 1 and 10 we want a
random number between a range of two
numbers and we want to specify that any
time when we call the function so we'll
put placeholder arguments here of min
and Max and we'll go into this little
function we wrote and everywhere words
at n will write in Max and everywhere
there's a 1 or write min okay so now
we'll say winner will have to say the
min will be 1 and the max will be 10
let's say that Max is 20 now when we
call that function it's between 1 and 20
this could you could put this at
anything now 1 in 60 all right now that
we've got this we want to learn how do
we can apply that number to our HTML
layout and find the winner so again
we're starting with this this variable
of dev tippers and in the variable has
an array of all the names of the people
who contributed to the tip tip video and
I want to take one of their names and
apply it and replace these question
marks in here so I'm going to do is I'm
gonna use regular JavaScript this is not
jQuery and I was actually given a lot of
help by a dev tip or Timo to write this
out for me so thank you so much Timo
we're going to start with finding the
element here and this is just an HTML
class of winner's name so we'll do it
like this
document dot query selector
and then parentheses and in there we're
gonna write our class name it's in its
winner's name now that we have our
selector written we will use the
operation of inner HTML and then equals
and we can write anything here and that
will kind of insert the string in here
so if I say hello it should yeah right
here so now I need to get that random
number to find me one of these random
names inside of this array so if I put
the the variables name that holds the
array is called dev tippers and then the
array number let's say number eight this
is not the winner this is just an
example of how this is going to work
number eight is gonna be David Vasquez
okay so now I have to get replaced this
eight with a random number and we're
gonna use our function called winner and
we'll say we want the random number
between zero and however many there are
here and we can find out how many there
are by using Java Script length so we'll
say dev tippers dot length all right
that's it
now when I hit say if my browser is
gonna refresh and we're gonna have the
winner and actually let me comment this
out and hit refresh so we can start with
the question marks okay now when I hit
refresh on this document we're gonna
find out who won the $100 giftcard for
contributing their video to the dev tip
community video again if you haven't
seen that go ahead and watch it it's
super fun everybody is awesome and at
the end of the video I talk about what
the phrase keep on hacking means to me
but without further ado here is the
winner
yak here that's it so thank you so much
for watching guys I hope you learned a
little bit as we select the winner of
our of our giveaway and yuckier send me
a message or leave a comment in the
it's below the video of how I can get
ahold of you and get this and get this
gift card to you thanks again to
everyone for making 1 million views a
reality I'm so proud of what we've done
together remember to keep on hacking my
friends in your code in your life in
everything never give up keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
