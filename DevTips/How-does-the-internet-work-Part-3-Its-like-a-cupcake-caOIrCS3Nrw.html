my name is Travis Nielson this is dev
tips for designers a YouTube channel
where we talk about website design and
development all that kind of stuff now
this is the third and last video in his
series I call how does the internet work
okay last week we talked about
organizing our projects and that's
somehow like putting these paper things
on a tray but now it's time to fill in
these HTML documents with our well-honed
markup skills don't spill pop it in the
oven I don't know okay this is what I
wanted to talk about
if the cupcake base itself is our HTML
the frosting is the style so let's use
our deliciously well-structured CSS to
add visual dynamism and interest to the
web page and finally we want to sprinkle
on some interactions using a healthy
dose of JavaScript but don't overdo it
and as we look at the cross section of
our scrumptious web page we can see the
three distinct layers our base document
is the HTML if we needed to we could get
away with nothing else but it would be
kind of boring so on top of that we can
see the stylistic later is applied to
CSS it adds interest and dynamicism to
our web page it gives us boring old
cupcakes in life and finally the details
which make it unique and fun the
JavaScript which has a layer of
interaction JavaScript enables us to let
the user interact with the page like
clicking on an image to zoom in control
a slideshow or get notified that a
message has been sent
super grade and that's how a web page is
made first you bake the HTML spread on
the style and then you sprinkle on the
JavaScript
