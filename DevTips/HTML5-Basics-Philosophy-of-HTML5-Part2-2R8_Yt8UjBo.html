this is dev tips for designers a place
where we get together and talk about
really nerdy stuff
this is video 2 in a series I'm calling
html5 basics in our last video we talked
about the history of html5 so you can
miss that go back and check it out we
noted that one of the hallmarks of this
language is that it cycles through a
progression of ideation and
standardization over and over again HTML
has the tendency to grab anything that
works and adopt it into its official
specification in this way its
evolutionary rather than revolutionary
so in today's video I want to talk a
little bit about the philosophy behind
html5 why it does some of the things it
does before that I want to talk about
the launch of html5 and what made it so
different than everything else that had
come before
I remember when html5 was presented to
us as a design community it was the
first version of HTML to have a formal
brand including an official logo a
branding site marketing efforts case
studies and even spokespeople one of the
things that makes html5 so special and
this may be conjecture on my part but it
seems to be the html5 is intended to be
the last numbered version of HTML and
that this version will just continue to
adapt and morph from now on this is
similar to the trend we're seeing with
browsers and other software where
they're dropping their numbering schemes
in favor for a more agile approach where
things are updated and revised as they
go along
one evidence for this crazy theory is
the doctype and we'll talk about that
later but every version of HTML has had
a numbered declaration in the top of the
document when we look at the doctype
declaration we see that it's not html5
there is no number it's just HTML so
let's talk a little bit about the design
philosophy behind html5 as we discussed
before html5 was built on the shoulders
and the lessons of what came before it
so there are a few guiding principles in
the design of the
which support existing content this
means that there's no zero year if you
created a webpage that existed before
html5 it's very likely that your web
page is still valid today in fact most
of HTML 4.01 survived in html5 and again
we see that pattern of standardizing
common conventions another principles do
not reinvent the wheel meaning if
there's already a widespread way that
developers use to accomplish a given
task even if it's not the best way this
should be codified in html5 to put
another way if it ain't fix don't break
it
I mean it ain't broke don't fix it
whatever
another guiding star of html5 is to get
the format out there as quickly as
possible without worrying about
theoretical problems this is exemplified
in a principle called the priority of
constituencies which says in case of
conflict consider user / authors /
implementers / specifiers / theoretical
purity meaning that the most important
person in this hierarchy of people that
make up the web is you the user that's
beautiful
because of these principles html5 is a
lot more loose than the XHTML
holier-than-thou
strict syntax hTML is as simple as you
want it to be and at the same time very
large in its scope it's applications are
as infinite as the imagination ok that's
it for video 2 in this series called
html5 basics now having a foundation of
the history and philosophical principles
behind html5 next week we're going to
jump into some code we're going to look
at something very important called the
DOM and we're gonna have a small
discussion about semantics before we
wrap it up with this video there's a few
things I want to say number one thanks
for sticking with me these first two
videos have been really rocky to produce
it's really hard to stare into a camera
and talk I'm not used to it so thanks
for that a lot of the information found
in this video and the
comes from the excellent and
easy-to-read html5 for designers by
Jeremy Keith I really recommend it it
goes a lot deeper than we have here and
it's probably easier to understand I
tend to babble and make stuff up
one more thing this channel is just
brand new I've never done anything like
this before it doesn't have a lot of
love yet so if you could show a little
bit of love and subscribe here on
YouTube
you'd much appreciate it
and leave a comment if you want I'm a
lot lonelier than you think I am</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
