a beard
well now it's obvious hey it's me guys
Travis from dev tips I'm here in my
bedroom tonight because my wife is out
of town on a trip and I'm here with the
kids so I can't go down to the garage
and record when the kids are sleeping in
their beds because what if they wake and
started running riots inside the house
and I'm unaware and you know start
stabbing themselves with scissors and
you know peeing on the floors I don't
know whatever kids do so I am making a
quick tip for you guys I found a cool
thing that I've been using for the past
little bit and it's really helped me
with when I'm coding responsive web
designs so when you're coding responsive
sites you use media queries to create a
little breakpoints and usually to test
those breakpoints I'm actually grabbing
the edge of the browser and yanking them
all around like a madman and now it's
not exactly easy to to target you know
the width that you have and on to it to
emulate specific devices like iPads or
mobile phones or whatever but I found
this really cool app in the Chrome App
Store that is little assist us with this
problem so um here we are at the start
page of my google on my Chrome I'm gonna
run down here to the webstore and the
app is called
dimensions
don't mention it be better if I could
spell okay so I'm going to add dimension
to Chrome and here it is on my home page
or my start page added it's pretty cool
what I can do here is a I just and it's
cool because it'll show up offline or
off online or offline I don't need to be
connected to the Internet to use this
even though it goes through Chrome so
and that'll become cool in a moment so I
can go to any old web page that I'm
going to grab this URL here of this
design that I know is pretty cool and
responsive and type it in and click test
now I have a few preset widths that I
can test and I can see that this thing
collapses easily do a phone on a white
phone the tablet it looks a little
different a wide tablet and in a desktop
size looks quite different between the
three or four different resolutions and
I'm just with a click of a button I can
easily snap my browser width to the size
that my viewer would be looking at I can
even use this handle bar here to drag it
out in between these breakpoints and to
see you know where line breaks and and
just kind of the fiddly bits of doing
responsive design so that's the awesome
bit about this now you can do this with
any website on the internet and see how
they hold up and you can also use it to
test your own websites now usually when
you're designing your coding your site
it's gonna you're gonna do it you're
gonna develop locally obviously right so
here's the thing when I click on this
home page it opens up in
in the browser but you'll notice that
the file path is file colon slash slash
users home desktop like it's the local
path on my hard drive and when I tried
to throw that into German dimensions I'm
gonna copy that paste that into here
look what happens we get an unresolved
for the DNS so I can clear this URL out
you can notice that it says enter the
URL HTTP or localhost now that means you
can run local files but it has to be on
a local server or still so let me show
you quickly how to do that if I open up
terminal and I can CD into the drive now
a program will do more fancy ways a real
programmer will do more fancy ways of
finding it folder but there's this cool
visual trick is you to CD and then you
just drag your directory on top and it
just gives the path to that directory so
it's really easy and then hit enter and
now your your terminal is pointed at the
directory that contains your site no you
don't have to download anything special
you already have this built into your
Mac and I believe your PC - it's a this
little line of text says Python - M
simple with a capital S HTTPS or HTTP
capital S server so this creates a
little little server that runs locally
on your machine inside that folder so I
hit enter and it'll do some thinking and
notice it says it's surfing on port 8000
so if I go back to this tab and I write
local host port 8
there you go little horse localhost port
8000 now I have this website that I'm
working on and I don't have to drag it
around like I used to I can just take
that localhost throw in dimensions here
and test it out in the different browser
widths
this is cool I really like the way this
works yeah
so that's just one quick tip for today
to use dimensions to work easy easier
faster quicker on unresponsive designs
now this has all been one take that's
why it sounds kind of horrible and I
don't know what I'm talking about
but what else is that gonna say oh yes I
would still recommend that you after
you've done your design work here I
wouldn't rely completely on this
although it's it's gonna be fine but
always check your work in the actual
devices because you never quite sure
unless you see it on every device that
you're targeting so yeah that's all I
have for you today
I'm Travis Nielson this is dev tips and
today we learned about a Chrome
extension called dimensions hope that
was helpful if you have any questions
leave them in the comments below and see
you next time guys thanks for stopping
