start by talking about Dom traversal
this means we're going to walk around
the page looking for different things
selecting them and making them have red
borders and our familiar with our
selectors and also the CSS method or the
red borders now let's get really
specific about how to move around the
page so we have the h2 selected let's
select all of the children of the h2 and
make them have Slee SS borders well the
children is just that one span so that's
how you do that but what about the
parents of h2 now that's going to grab
all of the parents going all the way out
to the HTML document but we can limit
where it goes to let's say for example
we want to just stop at the section now
only the section that's wrapping around
the h2 gets selected and applied a
border onto it now let's say the h2 is a
sibling siblings of you know what are
all the sibling elements of the h2 well
those are all the paragraphs right and
you can even you can limit the
paragraphs let's say even the first so
let's say the siblings who are
paragraphs and the first of those so you
can so you can use that selector
knowledge that you gained in the first
few videos but what about this instead
of saying first there how about saying
last here has another way to traverse
through the Dom right or our first here
so let's put this all together and make
something like really weird and
complicated let's say let's use that
parents was it section and then what's
the what's like a sibling a sibling of
the both of the section that we're on is
going to be let's look at the HTML so if
this is the section that we're focusing
on a sibling would either be DS script
tags or even the header here now the
script tags are not going to show up in
the document because they're hidden but
the siblings let's say we can say header
now the header will be selected now keep
in mind that we're starting with the h2
so you can you can never do this in in
CSS where we're starting with the h2
selecting out to the parent and then
moving to a sibling which is the which
is the header
that's just far-out man that's that's
blowing my mind but how about this let's
take it a step further and now that we
have that header let's say how about the
children of that header and select those
so now we have like that h1 that's not
even like remotely related it's like a
second cousin twice removed of the h2
that we started with over here in that
crazy dr. Brussels is so powerful with
jQuery and it's easy now we're going to
look at event binding this is the fun
stuff this is what makes all the
interaction possible with jQuery so
things like clicks hovers things like it
like inserting a cursor into an input
field like keystrokes all this stuff and
this is like the magic method is called
bind that that's that's the guy right
there so the first bind I want to show
you is you put a little quotes in there
and it's called a click and after the
click this is it's a little bit more
advanced everything we've done so far we
did it with kind of animations we're
going to say function and in and then
inside of the function is where you put
all that stuff so like if somebody
clicks on the h2 what happens well we're
going to use this again which is the
jQuery key word for whatever is focused
on whatever the object is let's use that
toggle that we learned and change it to
a class of blue so when we click the h2
we're going to toggle the class to blue
let's save it and then start clicking
click click click so every click I give
it toggles it back and forward right
that's because it's bound to the click
that's awesome and this is a great way
to do toggles to do slide-out menus to
do menus tabs everything like that this
is all they're all with like the bind
here and a shortcut for click is to not
you don't even have to write bind you
can just write dot click
although it's recommended that you use
bind but you can just use click like
this and it's the same thing right I
probably use click a lot more than a do
bind but you can also do hover right so
now I'm just moving my mouse over it and
I'm getting that reaction because it's
not bound to the click anymore it's
bound to the mouse hovering over it what
about this one this one's going to blow
your mind if I go
the HTML and I say keypress this is no
longer a mouse thing if I'm just like in
this document and I press any key is
there going to toggle everything in the
HTML to blue so now all these keys that
I'm pressing is like a laser show and
I'm just switching the class on the HTML
element turning everything blue isn't
that exciting stay with me now ah love
just clear it all right after these 15
minutes you have all the tools you need
to understand just what the heck you're
looking at when you see some jQuery
we've covered all the basics to further
your study
I recommend spending a lot of time on
the jQuery Docs actually you can get to
those at API jQuery comm they're pretty
good and they're easy to read and
understand most everything really that I
ever learned about jQuery I learned
reading the doc so check those out it's
a good resource but the best way to
really learn about something is to begin
applying it you will quickly pick up
those little tips and tricks and tools
that will make you proficient when
you're using what you learn daily the
best way to do that is through
project-based learning and that's why my
killing it with jQuery courses that I'm
currently developing take the
project-based approach we're going to be
making image sliders modal's menus and
more but the difference is that not only
are you going to be walking away with
working customizable projects that you
can begin charging your clients for
immediately but we're going to be using
these projects as a study in how a
programmer thinks through a script and
what are the resources available for
when you hit that brick wall or how to
debug your code or how to think about
your code from a user's perspective and
how to set yourself up to quickly learn
any JavaScript library in the future
so yes the course is about jQuery but
also so much more so when you go to
killing it with jQuery calm
you can sign up to be informed about
updates as I go along little snacks of
value and bonuses that I'll be setting
to everybody as I gear up for the
release later this year and if you're
watching this now later
after the course has already been
released will go to killing it with
j.crew calm and start killing it with
jQuery right link is definitely in the
description below I'm Travis and this is
dev tips I'm sure of it
I'll see you next Monday keep on hacking
okay okay okay killing it killing it
with jQuery killing it with jQuery
killing it
with jQuery killing it with jQuery
killing it with J query no how do you
say this how do you say killing it with
jQuery without sounding stupid killing
it with jQuery killing it with jQuery
killing it
turn jQuery talk oh that was a mess geez
alright a nitro gun killing it with
jQuery
killing it with jQuery yo killing it
with jQuery up your artistic killing it
with jQuery Oh killing it killing it
killing it with jQuery killing it with
jQuery that's that's the winner that's
the winner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
