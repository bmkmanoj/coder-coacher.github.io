you had a few things that you wrote down
you wanted to talk about and I have a
few ideas so oh good um my lash look
your list yeah so
of all thank Sir Bobby for making me a
good developer like us like I started as
a programmer and I'm like I have no idea
what web design looks like like I shot
it I started on YouTube a stud like ah
first of all I'd I don't know I find
like hmm i don't know what's the town
that a little last week in review level
up top so I find that channel first of
all yeah fine level of tots and I'm like
these tutorials are cool but it goes
over my head because I'm not a web
developer kind of person yeah Scott's
really good yeah I have a kid I
understand it but then I was like trying
to basic tutorials about CSS and all the
stuff but I was trying to find some CSS
tutorial TI get and then a pioneer your
video on the right side on the side
where YouTube and I'm like just like it
that was like the series the eighth
video man ana child video of the season
like Snicket and like this is with stuff
I need answers yeah okay the awesome
website I'm like just note it down and
I'm time is it like 24 top of the day

like calling the networks and CSS stuff
all the sudden I just know the dog I
have a notebook over there I don't know
I know down everything like what is this
property where is how it works how this
works and then I'm good now um me and my
friend started a web development company
yeah he's from USA yeah and we started
getting some clients and it's cool I
think that's so great I guess but it's
like that is what it's all about him I'm
so excited that I could play even a
little part in in your you know your
excitement in your success that's really
great yeah i mean i also told my friend
about you he's like thats cool man um i
started the programmer and I think
programming isn't made for me because it
socks humming is dead you have to wait
like Glenn idea inside you're gonna come
and hit you in the brain I'm like what
the next step I'm gonna make I have no
idea i'm gonna make to a thing that's
not for me yeah i could think and stuff
and making myself if you can give me a
PSD and you want a website like I can
big that thing in code it's good you
know it definitely is a different
approach yeah yeah so so I have a few
questions about you cuz i'm very curious
about you you've been on you've been
hanging around dev tips for a few months
now and everyone everyone told me like
Bobby why do you come on all over the
place I can't keep calm I just I watch a
single video like four or five times and
I'm like a next part I'm like I was
busying something and then I like
something and then I just come in it
that video game and this commanded I
feel like I'm in that video I don't feel
like I'm de I'm the viewers something up
you like that I'm in that video i doing
some stuff there this standing there and
doing something like that look so yeah
so we've never talked to face to face
before we've sent a few emails and we've
talked a lot on the comment section but
i'm really interested in like who you
are like what was a where are you right
now where do you live i'm in new delhi
india oh I'm 19 years old now not good
night in still in 18 but next year I'll
be 19 cool tell anyone ever now so what
what is it like how did you become
interested in web development as a as a
as a field I like like 12th grade like
my high school I have no idea what I'm
gonna do i graduated in my school with
accounts like commerce classes
I have no idea of accounts for daddy bad
marks like great in that I mean and then
I I have no idea what I'm gonna do up to
my high school and a sit back and relax
and I have no laptops back then i got my
first laptop in late two thousand today
like in december and then i was i got my
internet connection and then I was
trying to find like all these two works
and I have no idea how come video breaks
I was like hey can you help me with this
but then I started like I just searched
all over the place Google is always my
best friend I mean like I started to the
programmer take admission in an
institute to learn programming but it's
not my type i just left k like ruderman
huh yeah no I mean in India education it
isn't that good thing it just wastes of
money that's why I left it I left my
college Oh interesting not that good my
friend is like you you are next to each
other like left in your college isn't
steve jobs think like okay that's for
you yeah and then i started was there
like youtube videos right I natal it was
there a like a something you saw or was
there something that you heard or did or
whatever that like really gave you the
spark like what set it off Alice obvious
I was the key person from like when I
was nine my dad's got a mobile phone and
it was like a black and white phone like
I don't know it was two thousand six or
something India and black and white
phone that I was Iggy kind of present
shanna the like fun stuff how this thing
works and I'm like this thing is awesome
all that makes something like this and
then i have no phone still now like my
high school to my high school I don't
have any phones I was I used to take
I friends phone and I like just try to
make some stuff on it try to make it
like optimize it took longer battery
life or something like that I was kind
of greedy person and I got my netbook
and has no like no graphic design
graphic drivers for 64-bit of windows so
i hacked the original drivers and make
64-bit once I put it on my blog if it
was a hit I got like 10,000 views per
day really yeah but I forgot to renew my
domain name and decide it down no no you
couldn't get out its tip I'm still there
ok yeah often so that was that was it
like you you got internet famous by
hacking your your netbook yeah yeah it
was not hacking but I just do some codes
and stuff like that I don't know I don't
remember it now interesting so I had a
question about what is it like in New
Delhi in like the inn in the web design
industry is there a lot of people that
you know they're interested in this
thing or is it kind of you in their
videos doesn't know what you're talking
about or like what is it why people
think I'm crazy I'm this they don't
understand what I'm doing they're like
what you do any room all the time
sleeping last thing else I was sleeping
alright that's good in New Delhi in I
don't know about a whole new delhi but
in my town people like just chasing the
jobs for money they don't know what
they're gonna do they just need like 30k
40k or like 50k jobs they don't care
about the money is the only thing that
matters yeah but that's the biggest
argument between me and my mom my mom
thinks you have to get a job now you're
18 plus you have to manage your own
bills and like pop I have to focus on my
career I have to do this thing I was
like you're not doing this you're not
doing anything you just wasting time on
YouTube you watch funny videos that are
like that
okay mom I got you so the idea of the
idea of doing something for a career
that you love regardless if it pays you
a lot of money or a little money it's
kind of like a newer idea something that
you'll hear a little bit more in the
West and you do where you're from am i
right yeah so how do you have to pay but
people like just give me money and I'm
gonna do that but to me money matters
but not that much I want a good carrier
with good people around me that's it I
don't need that much just a little bit
money and a good life who influenced you
or where did you like pick that kind of
a ethic up because that that's pretty
unique it sounds like amongst your peers
your your videos like i watch your
videos and I go very depth like a watch
like five six seven times if I they
didn't get it that's that's why I got
that kind of vision and that book that
you recommend in that video like
inspirational I don't know remember the
name on the book i read it like full
book and then next part of that book and
it gave me some inspiration like that
kind of inspiration really that's outta
me you just I was going in this
direction you just came and just push me
into the distance that's my life Wow
soon I was still I was confused back
then but you played a major role in my
life to be honest I said no that's
that's really cool to hear um that's why
I'm super fan yeah yeah so I so I
definitely consider you one of like the
biggest other is a week yeah juice and
I'm yeah like beer you're like you
comment every video multiple times you
like definitely in there it's really
like your this disguise Hammerman I'll
be cheese don't comment anymore
I don't need anymore not again no that
that's a that's not sure I really
appreciate your your support like it
really means a lot but to hear that like
depth it's means something to you more
than just entertainment or more than
just getting like a little bit of you
know tips or I don't know this is really
cool I don't anyway so um what is your
what's your ultimate goal then in in
doing this like not just YouTube but in
doing web development for a career like
what do you want to do what do you want
to be I want a sad hire a huge company
in web development that gives affordable
web development for everyone because I
think everyone needs to be online now
it's like chykie either geeky of
everyone launch to one's website mm-hmm
and I don't know I just want to give
affordable websites to everyone maybe a
blog their business website or something
like that that's why it be started the

hello and i just want to say to
everybody that's watching this video if
you do have questions use
the is the question app here and then
also I have a hashtag that I'm that I'm
watching called dev tips one on one if
you want if you have a question for RP

this during this live session sorry to
interrupt you there but you're talking
about you have a business partner in st.
Louis and you guys have about 10 or 12
clients now yeah and finds my friend is
watching it I think he said she just
texted me like avi avi avi okay and
what's your friend is watching these
name is York Meyer oh this is Luke okay
awesome yeah cool well best of luck to
you guys so um you just want to your
goal is then just to build out your
business and continue what growing and
servicing people and settle down a USA
because it's just my dream so you're
doing extreme okay you do want to come
over to us yeah especially la la San
Francisco yeah it's I so I working at in
industry within the tech industry here
in San Francisco where we we do have a
lot of people from India but it's also
that is like everywhere in the world
yeah well yeah firstly we have a lot of
people but I was just thinking about how
I always hear that it's very difficult
to get to get into the US with them you
know FIFA lot yeah so best of luck on
that like I do know the way and do not I
have no idea what I'm gonna do to south
on USA that really doesn't matter you
can't like like you're the kind of guy I
can just feel it like if you you know
you keep working on it keep on having
the enthusiasm that you have you'll be I
don't worry about it I'm sure we'll see
you yeah maybe I'll be are you doing
like missing lotion I'm here now oh if I
don't get any bees or something I just
go for a tour to sent Silicon Valley
that this country yeah that would be fun
it's it's a it's a nice place
uh we got a comment here from Tim he
says USA I'm probably going to move to
SF in cali that's pretty awesome where
you're from Tim comment that if you can
um now I have another question for you I
p what other channels do you watch you
mentioned level up cuts is there
anything else that you watched it to
improve your def skills no not really
but I want like learn Khan Academy to
learn angular yeah but I'm no idea what
I'm gonna do with angular now because
these days I'm just working on wordpress
site because all the clients is fond
foot press yes hey the funny when you
check to learn something jiggle is very
handy but what pisses blood press
everyone knows that WordPress is such a
big deal especially when you're
servicing smaller small companies and
like the snows was it like more like but
pace is something that everyone
understand not so much techie or
something it's just simple that's right
using social media like any other side
Tim's from Washington State that's close
not very far man um we uh yeah like I
have definitely on my idea board to do a
whole series on wordpress but I just
feel like there's like all these little
things that are just kind of like
jumping in front of it you know like end
yeah and also I want to kind of wait
until the new year to start like a
bigger series because voice race is not
much to learn about but if you just
start working on wordpress just small
just digging up some small codes but it
just like small codes can help you to
learn everything like I started just
with function stock PHP but now I can
dig everything in WordPress not that
much but basically I can dig everything
yeah WordPress has a a pretty a pretty
shallow or learning curve right like it
doesn't take a lot to get working with
it and there's a lot of things you can
do to just get running so I think it is
a really great platform for people a
better people have no idea how do you
get
started with it that's why people think
that we need a specific tutorial to
start something like they need a
starting point we just want you to give
them a starting point and then they can
learn everything I think you're right
about that I do oh I'm out the gate now
tell me about some not development
channels that you watch what do you
watch for just entertainment whatever I
romanatwood and romanatwood flocks is my
favorite like I watch it every day yeah
and what's that store dad Devin
Supertramp and there's so many challenge
that I want simple sexy stupid and what
about humor I'm like I'm I'm cuddly
cheaper guy but just because of this
background noises but they're not
actually yeah I don't know it just look
at some time just guys are magma noises
I don't make any youtube videos okay cuz
ya in New Delhi so I either I see that
Stuart edge and Garrett from overboard
and um I've not met Devon but I know two
people who know him pretty familiar yeah
Gavin is great man he's like you make
that that kind of videos like I never
seen that kind of videos anywhere yeah
he's kind of a big deal in YouTube yeah
that's pretty cool um we got a question
here from Tim he says in the upcoming
year do you think you could put together
a collab with another YouTube like PHP
Academy and build something big like a
social network where the audience of
both YouTube channels could stay
connected Wow uh sure oh I have a
question why don't you monetize your
channel because everyone is earning I
don't you why don't I monetize my
channel yeah um let mean it's all good
sure let me let me answer Tim's since I
read it out loud and then i'll answer
yours um okay so uh why don't we build
something okay so that's a
that's a really cool idea but it's also
very ambitious and Alex who does PHP
Academy and myself we have like
different kind of goals that I want to
take things when i started dev tips i
wanted it to be a very quick you know
like every video was like three minutes
was the goal like to be this quick tip
action I've seen those you gotta videos
like some of videos like I delayed in
now I know that I find that a one video
is deleted in playlist all right you're
you're starting videos it was like
there's not that much like the content
is getting better and better now that's
some guarding videos it was not that
good but it's like professional you like
you camera shy think in the starting
yeah see you you kind of nervous it was
me out not now you're like what yeah
that's just like you know buddy you do
it enough you get you get more
comfortable with it but um yeah yeah so
I mean when I started dev tips I wanted
it to be just short short like quick
things you could do to get better and
just kind of like be tip tip based but
um it quickly progressed into like kind
of like lectures like full full serious
you know like html5 series CSS Syria
this big long one those videos are cool
I mean just to get started those videos
in necessary like you have some idea to
get started yeah I I like having one is
recommended yeah I like having those
videos in in like the history so when
people ask specific questions about why
you know the box model or something I
just kind of like I just kind of like
point them to it and it's really helpful
to have those kind of as reference
points um so to quickly answer your
question Tim I don't think that
something like that is in the works
because that would take a lot more
commitment then I have time for too much
time because you need to like
collaborate at the same time and you
need to make some specific videos that
combines you yaar goals and its goals no
time yeah mess yeah and like we're both
work full time and he is in England so
we're like we're like like an eight hour
difference um yeah so it's like when we
communicate it's like through email and
like we're definitely like separated by
but you know like half a day um yeah
anyway so um I don't think like
something like that is in the works for
me I don't have any aspirations to build
a big network or anything like that I
just want to like make friends that's
not know what I've seen so many
youtubers they like they just get like
thousand followers and they just
monetize it yeah yeah so okay so maybe
two to answer your question up here what
why don't I I monetize um I don't have
anything against monetizing I think that
like people who work hard should be a
paid for their work if it's like
appropriate um but I just kind of
haven't found the right angle for
monetizing dev tips I I know that I
don't want to run ads on it because um
because I'm very I'm a very controlling
person I like to know everything about
what I do and I like to be in control of
every aspect of the production and and
kind of like if somebody comes to dev
tips and then I show them an ad
especially if I don't know what it's
going to beat or it could be a select
number of things I just feel uneasy
about that so but there's other ways
that um you know when the time is right
that I could I could uh you know
monetize million when million
subscribers like you wanna earn this
much and for the first stop the
monetization that you're like I've been
looking at I've been looking at things
like patreon or do you know what patreon
is happy ah a challenge is like a it's a
cool it's really cool it's like a
service um we're super fan like you
would go and and kind of be a patron of
my work so for example you would you
would pledge like a dollar for example
for every video that I make and if I
make three videos that month you
you would give me three dollars and yeah
I got you so if a lot of people it's
like Kickstarter basically right yeah
Kickstarter for content but yeah so I
mean that's an option that I've been
looking at it and I've talked to the CEO
and a few of their sales people and I
really like what they're doing I think
it's really great but I just haven't
found the right angle yet and also I'm
very busy with tips day to day so like
to take to think of it like a long like
a like a like a plan is is not haven't
got it yet but I'm not saying I won't
and there are other options to like for
example if I do a sponsored video like
if I do a video for another company
explaining their product like I've done
I've done videos for a cactus remember
cactus and they were awesome and they
sponsored that video by giving licenses
to their product so i could give them
out to you guys and I have another one
coming up just today I got an approval
from another company that wants to do a
sponsored video that I'm going to be
doing some giveaways there to do that's
pretty exciting um oh thanks Tim he says
before I like to go i like the same
thing you know the cuts and keep it
going all right um so yeah that does
that answer your question about the
sponsored nature of dev tips yeah and oh
my did it takes to make a video like to
me it's like forever I can make videos
to make a video yeah my taked you it
takes quite a while yeah like so
everything from the ideation process
like thinking of what is a good subject
I mean I get a lot of I gotta get a lot
of suggestions and I keep I keep track
of all of those but the one that I see
more you know they influence anymore but
like that that's like one of the hardest
things is deciding what it's going to be
about and once I decided it's going to
be about a right the whole script out
like long hand like I decide on
everything i'm going to say and then
i'll record it like like it's like
depending on what it is so like like the
one that i did with PHP academy' the
music player just yesterday like I I had
to build the music player
first and see if he would even work you
know so I come so it takes a long like
takes time to like design and develop
those examples and then go back and
disassemble them and then rebuild them
for everyone and then editing and kind
of like putting in the sound and like
making different takes and it does take
quite a while it takes a whole week for
one video can you just wait a second
grandma's calling me yeah that's good i
know why that's not fun anyway I respect
what you're doing Oh while he is gone
I'm gonna read some of these questions
here uh one of the things I liked about
your Jekyll tutorials is that it allows
you to focus on the front end and not
have to worry about all the other stuff
that's from from Bobby Bryant yeah I
really like Jekyll Bobby because it's
like the right amount understand grandma
oh no where else don't they just don't
care of me doing that's okay while you
were gone I was answering a question or
at least responding to a comment um I
just to finish up there Bobby like one
of the reasons i do like Jekyll is this
it's just the right amount of geek for
me so right amount of nerd so like you
can do things with loops and like a
pseudo database um and like kind of like
make this kind of like templated
experience but i like it like just going
into that that like ultra front-end HTML
CSS javascript and you're good you know
like there's a there's a little bit more
to it but that's why i really like it
yeah i like normal guy with a knowledge
little knowledge of HTML CSS and
JavaScript can make a tickle thing yeah
definitely a yeah yeah I'm not like the
template system because if you make like
normal HTML stuff you have to make like
all the stuff every time when you make
it I'm like normal like normal blog it's
offline that normal bug you have to make
everything like a header again and again
you just copying page button technically
just need to put those curly braces and
then your header that simple yeah like
it I really like I used to do everything
WordPress I I did I did
lot or WordPress sites and then when I
found Jekyll I haven't really made a
wordpress since then i'm also going to
make it site for me on check out like
everyone wants a portfolio site like are
you really a developer you need your
portfolio's and i'm like okay i'm gonna
make one yeah good i'm gonna think i'm
gonna use your theme pack the oddest
theme for me good yeah you can do i hope
you do like that's what it's for um I
know a few people have used it that I
know and I've seen it in the wild
sometimes like oh like somebody will
send me a link to it on Twitter or or
email and I'll like see this kind of
like random like version of it like but
it's green or blue and it's like you're
like you're like here's my color college
now yeah it's kind of cool i don't know
like just to see it out there in the
wild but you didn't expect it yeah
that's cool people just want to
customize it and just push it i might
these not yours its mine exactly yeah
that's what happened like when i started
i started hacking like templates i
started longer and I used to have
templates yeah Mia not circle I mean I
mean well a minute that's how everyone
starts yeah I did my fair share of like
inspect element you know view source
that's that's how you learn that's how
we grew up first of all when I started I
like why this inspect element thing is
here I think first of all I thought
browser I just random stuff you just
need to go on google so it's something
and open it it's that simple but when i
start learning and it's like huge market
of things the different browser
different compatibility and it takes up
all the time just eats my time if I make
something good on google chrome chrome
is like awesome thing if you get if you
can just make something it works every
every time works and chrome but your
mozilla and internet explorer I think
that value should be muttered by me
don't like it I just don't like it
nothing works on it you have to like big
yeah I don't know dude other thing takes
takes 10 minutes of chrome take like 10
hours of internet explorer just to fix
it it's amazing Cory it's really bad now
but it was it was so bad before like
because I've stopped I've stopped
carrying about six and seven but before
I drop those we stood we used to have to
solve for internet explorer 6 it was
just so the worst thing in the world
like I wanted to quit being a developer
just because of internet explorer but um
well we move on yeah cool that's cool um
so again you guys who are watching this
live if you have any questions there's a
Q&amp;amp;A app and I'm monitoring the questions
here um I can't read spanish i don't
know spanish but uh you do Eddie can I
yesterday I do hang out with egg and
he's he just said it up a fool fancy
background and am I in you so cool not
me did like look so professional like
pixel perfect yeah that's awesome so my
friend and me all these argue about it
was hot to learn web designing back then
in like late 90s can you explain how hot
it is explain how hard it was in the
late 90s yeah my friend is like choo
easy because there was not too much to
learn I'm like it was no resources to
learn that thing that he announce yeah I
think I think both of those statements
are correct it was like it was you
couldn't do a lot so there wasn't a lot
to learn and also like things moved a
lot slower so like now it's just so fast
like you feel like you learned something
that you're still behind but back then
you would like learn something and you
kind of get it and like it would be good
for like a year or two you know and then
like something new what happened but
like when I'm about uh I stepped away
from design for a few years but when I
came back to it in two thousand and
three or four things had changed
dramatically
so that's when like I was I was
introduced the idea of CSS and kind of
like that type of thing like functional
javis like like like jQuery and like
when that came out and stuff like that
stuff just like really really changed
the way yeah yeah after at all the stuff
together and just take it in yeah yeah
yeah I mean before that we were like
honestly it was so bad we were designing
with tables and I know it cables I don't
know why I hate tables like that 90's
developers like I hate table should be
honest I don't like it pretty much I'm
like I don't know what it is well tables
yeah I know she please I'm just you're
using tables for table particular data
you know like should exit actual kinda
same yeah yeah that's fine but like we
used to do layouts like a table like
your your first row of the table would
be like the header and like it was
pretty insane when he would nest tables
forever like I can't even imagine that
yeah like II there was no float there
was no like no grid nothing just tables
tables tables tables inside of David
that was pretty wild and like I was so
good at tables to like I was like really
really doing my talents it just healed
by CSS ya blew my mind when I was
introduced to CSS because I saw um I
think it's still around that the website
called this the SS Zen garden and the
idea there was that they had they had
one page like one HTML markup and they
would have they could switch out the
style sheets and it would be like a
different website every time because
they would just style it completely
different and you could like make your
own style sheet and submit it and it was
like to spread the awareness of the
power of style sheets and get people to
stop using a table page layouts and
stuff ya vas big hot it's cotton and CSS
a thing yeah so like when you guys start
now like the younger generation there's
there's a lot more to two
grasp onto Achille yeah and and get
started you don't need like a college or
something you just need a connection and
a phone a laptop it's true it's all on
You Tube everything like every single
thing is in the ghoul like from a pen oh
 everything easy that's right that's
right that's cool did you have any other
questions for about the channel depth
tips or I have crazy for myself like you
know but kinda questions i asked like i
don't i don't know people like when you
are so dumb question or like that's what
i am used to Adam Gellin questions don't
worry but did you have when you started
even you started you like you always
have like dumb question all the time
like when I was doing something I got a
dumb question invite her to email you
how this thing works go watch that video
yeah okay sir I'm like I know that video
is there but by this email you like
sorry sorry that don't worry very well
yeah that that's crazy man cool so did
you have anybody you yeah yeah there's
so many questions okay listed a few more
before we close out what's up okay so
how do you got started with designing
you started in designing a development a
design kind of I I oh when I was young I
was in a rock and roll band and so I
started designing t-shirts and posters
and and the album covers for my band and
other bands and then eventually it kind
of branched out and I did websites you
know and ask I helped other bands with
their website for this guy um I went to
or to it I took a few classes for for
design i was i was a print designer for
a long time I designed advertisements
from like colon kids in that school
well I know how to make website you like
cool kid in this book this guy only this
guy know how to make websites it was it
was fun yeah we were in I wasn't a rock
and roll band and made some websites did
art and painting and stuff you know but
yeah so I am i was i was doing print
design for a long time so like magazine
advertisements and like posters and
brochures and this that kind of thing
you know design i've seen your work on
behance and it's like awesome i'm i'm
also following you there okay I didn't
know that no I hey that work is kind of
older I haven't posted a lot of my work
for the past like two or three years
because I don't know why I don't know um
your basic adaptive you like a flooding
every video on Mondays yeah dev tips
keeps me very busy in terms of my
portfolio it's actually funny like when
companies talk to me and they're like
okay so like where's your portfolio and
stuff on as well so what I do you know
like that's not a portfolio what are you
talking about no but if they can watch
one video they're like you're the man
you just just redirect them to that
playlist how to make an awesome sight
yeah that would be fun that's cool yeah
so that's how it started then um I
started with YouTube because I joined a
company as a designer and we we help
youtubers make better videos and friend
Heather of it checked out that I'd like
to be to blur lab yeah like that that's
right check it out like analytics like
Google Analytics kind of like that yeah
you chew you do I checked it out and so
what do you think of angular and
backbone oh I don't know yeah I I think
they're really cool they're used I mean
they're really great when you're
leveraging them to use that make
application level stuff um most of the
work I do is extremely front any so we
do use angular at work and and I mess
with it a little bit but mostly
I just kind of does I do a lot of design
so like Photoshop stuff and then like I
I will a lot a lot of times translate
those designs into markup and style and
like of interactive JavaScript patterns
that that the real programmers and the
real engineers that my office can use um
when they're when they're coating
everything now into the application so i
don't really touch a lot of that stuff
and i know it's like super popular I
know I totally should get more into it
but i don't it doesn't really come to me
that hurt yeah that's cool well I also
want to be a front-end developer but at
I second designer may not like but I
think about designing I get a headache
know what after design I don't know how
to use color patterns and something
though yeah I'm bad you should make a
video like a small playlist of using
color palettes and how to design I'll be
happy then yeah you you looked at as a
comment once I still have their in my in
my list of ones but yeah I would like to
do a design based kind of series because
I think a lot of I mean even if you want
to be a developer and that's kind of
like where your path is like
understanding design is really important
and when when I met though at my office
and I'm talking to you know the
developers or like the different people
in different departments marketing sales
and stuff I want them all to understand
design I want them all to kind of
appreciate the ideas behind it to help I
mean and I said I've said this a few
times that like you know hey guys we're
all designers like we're all designers
here and maybe I'm pushing the pixels
around but like it's going to take
everybody here to make this thing good
design is the real deal i think it just
make gives you a bind or just throw it
away like if design is good people are
like stick to your stuff and design is
not good they just walk away and there's
a lot of questions right like it a lot
of you get a lot of first impressions
based on how just how things
look and that's yeah is more than that
more than it's more than just looking at
you right it's like it's like how how
does it work like what what kind of
lessons do you give people before they
use the thing in order to help them
understand what if you before like
that's all design yeah I go to cold pan
and I'm like I just got bashed on by
their like amazing work they just make
the awesome stuff all the way like I
don't know how how they got ideas to
make stuff but they just make awesome
stuff all the time yes you can visit it
like 12am in the night there's also like
full of awesome stuff all over the place
copÃ¡n is very cool I'm a really big fan
of Chris coiler the guy and I know one
of the guys yeah chain chain I'm young
man you agree suspect refuses someone
else man I don't know yeah he's his like
definitely helped me I mean I like
actually my computer at work right now
has a tab open with CSS tricks and I
know that for sure so I was looking at
it today on how to do something with
flexbox and and to me it's like def
chips lie dev tips for designers is
always there like always a single window
in chrome is always open like if I
forget something how to make design
thing that color like buttons for
buttons I always use that buttons video
like yeah i think this work shadowing
work this much shadowy work always like
try to find some stuff from your video
like and just mess it up and then put it
on my site that works that's wild mint
little oil yeah yeah that is but CSS
shakes his gun like it's everything is
there and they like the what's he used
like in the article not too much but
still he explained everything in just
few words yeah you get that's true yeah
is very clear with this instruction yeah
and I could take a listen to podcast and
I have a listen to podcasts
like this is I never never understand in
India I don't know maybe you tally no
one knows it but it podcast is like I
asked my friend you know podcast they
like what no realistic your podcasts no
really Nana oh yeah is it video or
something I'm like yeah I just I just
don't try to explain them just eat up
all my brain that's awesome what are the
podcast you listen to ah they're like 99

videos all the time go get some job
tonight dude my mom don't understand it
she'll get it she'll get it when the
when the checks come in yeah well he'll
understand so you're at you're doing
this I got you oh yeah like when I was a
kid and I told my mom I wanted to be an
artist she she said she's like you know
what I hear when I hear of artists cuz i
also wanted to be a poet she was like I
hear you starving artist I hear you
don't want to make any money and you
want to be poor I'm like wow maybe don't
don't listen to them and either the
market work if you're good at your stuff
like if no matter what you are if you're
like beggar or something you just have
to be good at it like you have skills to
make that happen that's a great insight
even if you're a bigger you can be yeah
yeah you're gonna have to you have to
make your face like that can you please
give some money
yeah everyone needs some skills to make
happen like when i started with web
development i have no clue how to get
clients I like do you want a website
like that it just doesn't work who have
to like cruel your skills vines comment
like 10 times a google hangout hello
hello you like your website that's true
but you have to you have to know how to
sell your work yeah like if yeah this is
good as telling you work as you are as
good at working because you don't like
nobody will appreciate it and you'll
never be able to make more work it's
true very true and all the work you get
is like by referencing like you have to
make your clients happy no matter if you
have one client or two you have to make
them happy like always they just give
you work that's what i learned that just
got word from references like I make a
website for a client and he refer me to
another one and then you got for me to
another one that's how it works that's
true if you take care of your customers
and that's that's very true and it's
actually leads on to Anna question we
have here and this is something that you
can help answer because you do have
experience with this this is from
Michael Angelo Sosa he said is how do
you get started as a freelance web
developer first of all you have to learn
something and make it like you have to
do some creepy very quick I remember I
email you I still suck it work you ever
that know what was it like in June or
maybe july i email e like man i suck at
work and you like you have yeah it's
good you second were like yeah give
offense but being good or bad yeah yeah
like it's okay that you start yeah
that's good thing yeah you said now you
have somewhere to go yeah it would be
horrible if you're
it would be it would be horrible if you
were like exceptional and got in got no
clients that would be weird I have a
friend that lives somewhere on my house
and he's like I'm so good at that
designing but I know he sucks okay just
so confident he just soak off in a leg I
am the number one I'm like okay sir he
always like he always gives me some
nonsense and vices like if you want a
job you have to make some like okay
he just chased jobs all the time yeah I
don't want any jobs I just have to make
something before getting a job is like I
want to chop nothing else okay yeah so I
think that that that kind of answers the
question pretty well like to get started
is you have to already have built some
things yeah yeah yeah make like free
stuff just make your own site or like
someone outside this make credits or
something on their side or your side
just make something people will get to
know you email you if they like you
worry you just have to just go need to
do like too much when i started i have
no idea just I'm not gonna say that line
because you start laughing again but
when i set up my blog and make some
stuff and they're like people contacted
me to emails and hang out I don't know
how they got my email ID yeah I don't
know but I got email to like yesterday I
found that like 10 clients send me
invited on hang out I like what and
they're like you want them you want to
make a website for me I'm like okay but
you don't need to do too much just make
some stuff and put it online and talk to
your friend around but just
transform it gets people like the
customer the second part you did so
actually I said I said make something
and then what you just said was really
important you said put it online that's
another big thing right like so there
are different forums for you I'm talking
Michelangelo there there are different
forums for you to use to present your
work right so you can go to like behance
for example is a great place for web
designers or developers to showcase
their work and another thing I noticed
that you say freelance web developer not
necessarily designer so um if you find a
designer right if you find a designer
the hat that doesn't want to code then
that's that's your golden goose you just
follow that guy around and he'll bring
work because he's designing but he
doesn't want a code the work is already
done we just coat it out yeah I'm trying
to find a designer who don't know how to
code because I second design and maybe
he'll second codes yeah I mean that's a
little more viable way to do things just
to partner up with somebody and like
soon enough you know like people will be
asking you for design work and you give
him design working or her in yeah
they'll give you development work yeah
that's cool symbiotics profits happy
there huh yeah there's opportunities
everywhere you look at as long as you
keep your eyes open there are also
minute I started as a blogger I thought
this thing still doesn't work like
freelance or something like that it's
aight doesn't work but they actually
work when you make something good i
don't know i had spotted at the blogger
it sucks but it sucks well you had a hit
right out of the gates with like ten
thousand people a day yeah yeah that's
good you need I've never had that even
with Deb chips I don't have I don't have
10,000 views a day i don't think i have
600,000 views on my profile on hulu plus
but i do not know I do not have a really
good man yeah even a blogger like he has
50,000 subscriber email subscribers I
know he has like 3,000 views on his
profile and like Oh am I getting these
views no I don't know add like 600,000
years too much hmm that's awesome
cool so we're gonna we're going to bring
this to a close i got a few other things
to do tonight but thank you so much for
your time man i was there's a lot of fun
to do this yeah um thank you everybody
