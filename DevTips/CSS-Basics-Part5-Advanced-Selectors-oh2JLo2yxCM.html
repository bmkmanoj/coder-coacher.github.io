Travis this is the fifth video in series
called CSS basics so if you remember two
weeks ago we talked about selectors and
then last week we jumped into properties
and values which together both make a
style so if you haven't already seen
those videos or if you need a quick
refresher I recommend going watch them
now as they serve for a foundation of
what we're talking about today if you
have already seen those videos
yeah Mayer swamp saying so today we're
going to revisit selectors and talk
about a few more advanced ways to use
them so real quickly let's review those
other selectors that we learned the
first one was a tag in this case an
anchor the second one is a class
selector we throw a dot in front of the
class name it selects any element that
has that class on it and the third one
is an ID selector if you throw a hash in
front of the ID name of any element on
the page that will be selected by this
selector now to show examples I have
this page set up with some simple markup
and we can see that every anchor here
gets the color of red on it and let's
also do a text transform uppercase okay
so all of the anchors have red color in
our upper cased and the container box
here has a an orange border around it
and then the there's a ul here which has
a an ID of main list and put a great
background on that this is just a simple
example of what we've already learned
now I just review these real quickly
because these are building blocks of
more advanced uses okay in our market we
have a bunch of anchor tags but we also
have a strong tag down here you can
apply a style to more than one selector
at a time it's easy you just list them
out and then separate each selector with
a comma like this now the anchor and the
strong will both be turned red this is
really helpful if you want to apply some
common styles to a wide range of HTML
elements let's say for example you want
to add some margin on the bottom of all
of your headings paragraphs and list
items and instead of writing three
separate Styles you can write one style
with three selectors and they will all
inherit those same styles or you could
just use this guy and go balls to the
walls crazy and select everything this
is called an all selector this little
asterisk selects everything so this
right here will select everything and
make the margin and padding zero down
you may see this used when somebody
wants to reset the styles of their
browser you see all of those browsers
come with default styles for example
label I'll brief every page is a white
background black text and you know
paragraphs have some margin around them
by default list items have margin on the
on the left so you want to zero all that
I just throw it under an all selector or
the asterisk
next is a descendant selector you can
narrow down the selection by choosing
children or descendants of other
elements in the Dom you remember the Dom
right the document object model the Dom
is how things are organized or in other
words the relationship that each element
has with each other if you need a
refresher on the Dom check out this
video right here this is from our series
of HTML basics where we talk about the
Dom it's really important to understand
keeping in mind that the browser reads
your selectors from right to left
writing a descendant selector is easy
you put a space between the child and
its parent l I space a and then the
color red this will make all the anchor
tags red as long as they are children of
list items now you see how understanding
that Dom is important we can take this
even further and say that this color
gets applied to only anchors in list
items that are children of other list
items this selector then becomes more
specific to the point of excluding this
other anchor here as it is only a child
of one list item and not nested in two
of them mind-blown
right I know let's continue we can use
that same idea of a descendant selector
to say that all ul s inside of this
container class get a red border around
them
building on that if we use the direct
descendant selector it will only select
direct children or in other words
children that are nested only one layer
deep in the Dom to write that we use a
greater than symbol between the two
selectors notice that the second ul
there does not inherit the style we can
select the element that is immediately
preceded by the former element by using
the adjacent selector UL plus P color
red in this case only the first
paragraph after each ul will have red
text just this one right here while the
adjacent selector selects only one
element following the former the sibling
Combinator element selects any matching
element following the former element so
you write it with the tilde in this
example we'll write ul tilde P color ed
now any paragraph following the ul will
get that color red but notice that that
first P which is above the UL does not
inherit the color okay let's switch
gears up a little bit and talk about
pseudo selectors that's right
pseudo selectors these pseudo selectors
allow you to target elements only when
they're in a specific State for example
when an anchor tag is being hovered over
you write this by using a colon so a
colon hover and then let's just take the
underline off while it's being hovered
and then watch when we hover over it
that underline just disappears you can
use these to select links that have been
visited or that are active which means
they're currently like being pressed
down by the user at the moment or even
select a text box when it's in the state
of being focused or in other words when
the cursor is blinking inside of it so
for that we're going to write text area
and then the colon focus and then let's
take
this that blurry blue off and that's
called an outline outline:none
okay and then we'll just add a blue
border to it and we see that when we
insert our cursor inside we have a nice
clip crisp blue border instead of that
funky default blur okay let's take these
ideas and put them together to make
something really cool you'll see a lot
of people use JavaScript for this but
it's not really necessary if you're if
you know what you're doing with CSS so I
have two elements in my markup right
here one is called pica and it's an
anchor tag and the other one is called
boo so what I want to happen is when I
hover over pica
I want boo to show up kind of like a
tooltip or something like that
first let me throw some styles on boo so
it actually is visible I'm gonna say
height 200 pixels width 200 pixels
background can be pink and let's round
off those corners leave
we Center the text here and vertically
too so let's hide it now display:none
oh now for the fun part I want to
combine this pseudo selector with an
adjacent selector to say that when
somebody hovers over pika the next
element that matches it called boo will
show up in the dom it will be displayed
so I write a class of pika hover the
adjacent element with a class of boo get
to display:block and if we run over
there and hover over seat it shows up
wow that is so cool we didn't use any
JavaScript it's way lighter and faster
for your browser to use and the it was
just really simple CSS - selectors and
two lines of markup amazing and people
use JavaScript to do these tooltips
still okay before we end I want to show
you one more cool pseudo selector that
will allow you to select an element in a
range of elements based on its position
in that lineup in the range if I write a
P that's a paragraph tag colon first
child and then make the color red I can
see over here and the result is only
that first paragraph turns red I can do
other things too like last of type and
that takes the last of the type of this
P and turns it red I can even choose a
specific number amongst all of the
paragraphs that are siblings there so I
say enth child let's say three so that
selects the third paragraph and turns it
red let me add a few more paragraphs to
make this more impactful okay
so now the fourth paragraph or number
five so this is really easy to select
any element in a range of elements we
can take this even further and just
write the word
odd and at all the odd elements are
highlighted in red now or even of course
that works too
we can even do a little bit of math in
here so like we say the multiplied by
three so every third element gets this
style applied or every third element
starting in negative one position so
we're going to start with here and this
heavy so there's a lot of flexibility
with just like counting whatever class
of pseudo selector selectors can be
super powerful if you know what you're
using which is like my main point of
this whole video that it's not what you
know it's how well you know how to use
what you know yeah so which kind of
brings us up to our next video we're
going to talk about specificity
something you don't hear a ton about
because a lot of people ignore it
because it's maybe a little complicated
but it's super fun and it's super
helpful to figure out like what exactly
is happening in your style sheets so
