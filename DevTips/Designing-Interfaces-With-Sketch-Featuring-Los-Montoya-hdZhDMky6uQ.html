def tips if you know who I am
awesome if you don't know who I am my
name is lohse and I've been in some of
the earlier YouTube videos with the dev
tips community I think Travis called
those CSS basics you may remember me
from there it's been a long time dead
tipper if not Travis and I also host a
podcast called late nights with tribe
and loss a lot of fun you should check
it out
and Travis has been waiting about a year
and a half to get me on the show not
because of him but because of me it's
taken me that long to get over the fear
of getting it from the camera and
talking to you guys so without further
ado here I am we're going to talk about
design today and I'm gonna show you how
to use this software called sketch it's
made by the guys over at bohemian
coating and sketch is about it's a
design software that is specifically
built for interface designers mobile
designers and icon designers so today
we're going to build an app a mobile app
for the iOS platform and I'm gonna run
through sketch and use some source files
and give you a glimpse for how the how
the software works and how I use sketch
so let's get to work
alright so we're gonna get started since
this is sketch you're gonna go to
bohemian coding comm and download your
free trial after you have your free
trial you're going to need the iOS 9 GUI
and you can go to design code that I Oh
/i OS 9 here you can download and we'll
need to download this which is the GUI
as well as the SF fonts that come with
iOS 9
you're gonna download them both and
before you open up the iOS 9 GOI and
sketch you're going to want to add the
SF fonts to your font book
and in your in your on your Mac yeah on
your Mac okay so once you have what you
want you're going to have your little
sketch file here and what you're going
to do is double click on it I'm excited
it's coming okay cool so now that Yui
that we have it open you can press the
spacebar press and hold the spacebar and
pan around so you can see everything and
to orient you in the middle you have
your canvas it's the entire white kind
of gray space and then there's this ios9
artboard that he's created and within
the artboard he's created these little
like groupings you can see he's labeled
them it's nice you can you can drill in
and and check those out a little bit
more anyway this is uh this is the
layers panel and left hand side on the
right hand side is our properties panel
and anytime you click on an element the
properties panel will change accordingly
I don't let you know what are the things
you can do per property that you've
selected if you notice it's it's opened
up everything and I'm going to want to
collapse everything that I've messed up
I like it organized there we go okay
cool
and and then up the toolbar is your
tools these are all the tools that are
available tools that are available to
you and when you select elements some
will become active and inactive
depending on what you're going to do so
in this video we're going to design an
eye
9 app and we're going to design two
separate screens we're going to design a
news it's a news news app we're going to
design a news feed as of you and never
wants in the design the article view
once you select once we select an
article anyway afterwards you can play
around and there's I don't know what you
cannot build with this I'm zooming and
panning and you can see there's
everything you could possibly ever want
here yeah it's amazing anyway you can
take some time and look through it we're
gonna make our own app so to make your
own app you first need a new document so
you're going to go file new or command
end and you're greeted with a simple
sketch and you're gonna click a as a
shortcut for artboard and sketch does an
awesome thing where it gives you
pre-made canvases and so you'll click on
iphone six-plus or whichever one you
want design for it let's go for the six
plus because that's the one i have and
you click on that and there you have it
and you pan around we're gonna make the
first screen and we'll call this one the
newsfeed and for the newsfeed what i'm
going to want is a big full bleed image
and so the way you do that is you click
off a shortcut for rectangle you'll
create a rectangle that will later add
an image to and you'll drag it and it'll
snap to the corners grab the little
handle here in the lower right corner
and have it snap and the red lines help
you do that
anyway you can go find any image I went
to the stocks that I am the I oh where
is it there yeah the stocks that I am
and found this awesome image on get ref
II and so I downloaded already and what
you're going to do so you can see I'm
going to close this because I don't
think I'm going to need it yeah I am
going to need it so we'll just keep it
here I downloaded this this picture
right here and what I want to do is I
want to click on my rectangle you'll
notice that you can manipulate its
position on the artboard on its X&amp;amp;Y axis
the size you can rotate them flip them
you can add a radius to it we're not
going to talk about styles right now you
can add an opacity you can blend you can
ignore the fill you can add a border
shadows inner shadows etc and so what we
want to do is we want to add this image
into here so you click on fill you're
gonna click on pattern and this little
area you're gonna click and drag from
your desktop into here and you can and
will just drop it in you click fill and
that's a beautiful beautiful image you
can also do tile and tile it I wouldn't
do that yeah let's go a fill fit looks
good yeah looks good
and then we want to apply a slight blur
on to this and so you you'll create
another rectangle before that though
let's name this let's name this mountain
bumps an image and let's create another
rectangle on top you notice how when you
create it in the layers panel you have
your image and when you create a new
layer it's text it on top of it and so
it's kind of like a this is how they
organize things and so we want to add a
blur here so we'll do the same thing we
did previously and in this one we're
going to add a background blur and
you're like wait what's happening and in
the fill we're gonna make it let's make
it white and let's decrease its opacity
I'm gonna press and hold shift and click
this right here and it will decrease it
by 10 percent each time I think I want
it at like I think zero is fine and then
you can mess with the amount of blur
that you want on this I think I want
your like a three pixel blur two pixel
blur yeah let's do two pixel blur and
then let's make this black because we're
gonna have some white text over it and
like at 15 and it looks pretty good all
right what we want to do is we want to
create the menu the hamburger menu you
need to click our four rectangle and
you're going to create a rectangle make
it white and we're gonna want a height
of one and before we make it let's see
if there is one here already so I can
see any
probably not I don't think it's a iOS
pattern
I think the pattern for iOS is to make
it like a menu or back see what they do
here yeah yeah all right we're gonna do
what we want to do so we're gonna make
this hamburger and yeah I mean you can
discuss that you know the hamburger is
the worst UX thing or whatever
for our case we're gonna make it because
it looks like so I'm duplicating it and
I click shift and then hit down
duplicate again and bring it down so you
see how I've created three separate
copies so I'm gonna zoom out and see if
this is yeah see that's a good looking
that's a good looking men you may want
to tighten it up a bit
Eileen so he pressed alt when you select
a UI element you can see how far it is
from everything else so let's make it 10
pixels from each other there and we're
going to select all of these and create
a union and now we have this shape
called rectangle and we'll call this the
menu icon and then don't forget to name
this this will be the background blur so
we know what we're talking about and now
we select this we want it to be all
right and now when you select the menu
icon you you want it to be 20 pixels
from the top and from the left if you
press and hold alt you can adjust it
to be to be as such and so when you're
designing when you're designing anything
you want things to line up and look
visually clean and so when you sew in
sketch you can open up the rulers and
show rulers and if you notice I'm
dragging a guide and I want that guy to
serve as my left my left barrier and on
the right-hand side I want to be also
also 20 pixels from the right and so
we're at 414 we're going to want to go
down to 400 396 and now we're 20 pixels
from both the right and left and a way
to check as you can make a 20 by 20
which is a 20 pixel width thing element
and zoom in you like it mom spot I'm off
I'm off by one I'm off by two there we
go
Kenda math there we go all right so I'm
zooming out so that settles it for me
and now we want to to add a set of title
to this and we'll click T for text type
something and we'll use keys it she's a
sans-serif and let's try Helvetica let's
just do how better go because that works
well it's the SF 1 SF UI text use that
and then we want this to be just make it
a little bit bigger let's make it semi
bold and then let's make it twenty four
feels good and we'll call the so this
would be the title we can give it like a
free climbers I think it was really big
36 yeah and give another one right here
zooming in show that zoom out okay so
call it three climbers complete historic
climb and Yosemite National Park that's
good
and then let's maybe bump it up a bit
free Claire's complete story climbing Oh
70 National Park is about good okay and
then what this needs it needs a outside
we need to let them know that this is
the newsfeed so let's create another
field here we'll call it feed and then
let's make this will use light
let's try regular yeah regular is good
and we'll do the size of 24 try to see
if it's too big may 2018 yeah 18 feels
good alright so 18 so I want this to be
centered so I'll click on this alignment
bar here for Center align horizontally
and then I want this to be somewhat
centered to here so we can create some
more guidelines here give you a feel for
where this feet is and you can use your
arrow and just set it right in the
middle on the baseline yeah yeah it
looks good
zoom out okay so this is called feed and
then we want so in this app this
imaginary app maybe it's like Yahoo News
where you only get ten different apps
ten different news articles and so we
can do this full bleed if this were a
curated list of a hundred articles this
wouldn't work right and so because I've
given myself the constraint of there's
only ten articles that you receive each
day we can take advantage of more like
full bleed imagery and so in this one we
can get away with that and you can swipe
swipe up like ten times and get all the
app all the articles at least that's how
I'm envisioning it having given it much
thought when it comes to the interaction
design of how this how the app works for
this video we're focusing on the visual
design all right so we have feed free
climbers complete circle I mean you say
National Park and then I want I want to
give them a let them know where this is
from
and like I read more or or something I
read more contacts
so I'm going to create a divider here
that uses the full width of this this
these guides we've set and I want it to
be about 20 pixels away and I want this
height to be 1 pixel and I'm going to
make it white and give it an opacity of
50 maybe 35 yeah I feels good 35 and I'm
going to want to divide that kind of
down the middle as well so I'm gonna
create another one the width of one
color this one white as well the opacity
of what was this
35 35 percent opacity and we're going to
Center it with this one so if you notice
I selected them here in the layers panel
and I'm going to Center them and then
make sure that I am right on it and
we're going to bump this down the entire
way
hmm seems to loan just about 16 all
right and I want to move all of this
down yeah feels better let's get this
ruler out of the way so I can hide
everything that I'm looking at and we
want them to know that this is like a
National Geographic article so we'll
click here and we'll type the National I
should know Geographic and we're gonna
give this a font size of I think twelve
is good or fourteen I think twelve is
good and I want this to be SF u i SF UI
text
nice fu I display and then we'll go
medium because it's gonna be yeah so
we're gonna go medium and I want to
Center in this little area and so what I
can do is I can cheat I can create
another rectangle about that click this
and Center it hmm I don't want to set
around that I want to Center it on this
one so click where Center and we're
gonna want to click those two and bump
it to the left and then this one we're
gonna bump it to the left as well and we
want a view our rulers again because I
don't think this is long enough there we
go
let's hide these again okay cool so
we're good and then we want to give this
the same it's white and we don't give it
a thirty five percent opacity just let
them know hey this is a National
Geographic
hey we can bump this up some more I
guess thanks 16 so zoom out yeah it
feels good it's National Geographic they
know it's big nice can read out and
display and then we want to give them a
call to action I've like read more so
we'll click and duplicate and bring this
to the right and we'll say read more
click to read more and your National
Geographic bump it back down and I don't
want an arrow to the right and so this
is when I go back here and see do we
have something like that
actually I reckon we do I reckon hmm
here's what we'll do we'll grab this one
and bump it the other way so if you
press and hold command you can click
individual elements outside of like it
allows you to disrespect the grouping
and go straight to the element click it
will do command C come back to this
point all right so you'll right-click in
the end of the app here and you'll go
paste here and we want to use this and
we'll rotate it by clicking rotate press
and hold shift click we'll turn it up
180 degrees and we want this to be our
white that we had here and we also want
it to be 35% opaque
to match everything else and then we
want to scale this down because it's
huge
let's try about 30 percent scaling 35 35
is good and then we'll click and drag it
down zoom in and I think that I think
that looks good
zoom out and see it yeah read more all
right and then we want we want to look
know what type of what type of article
this is going to be so we can create a
rectangle by pressing R and just make an
arbitrary one for now and what will
adjust it and see what it looks like all
right one about here and we'll add I
like this font so we'll reuse it come
and see you come in B and if you notice
my rectangle is up here and this copy is
here so we want to drag it up then make
this the white is good and we want to
bump the opacity back up want to give
this a nice bluish color yeah it steals
nice hey I like the color okay the blue
and this is going to be we'll say this
is travel and if you want if you want
the front color you can go here and
select let's say like you I like flat UI
colors flat UI colors and let's pick
like this blue copied go back to here
click on the fill select the hex command
B enter and we got that blue if you want
to spice it up alright so I want this to
be ten pixels and maybe like five four
pixels so I wanted to be ten ten and six
and then we'll bring this height down
there we go and we want this to be 10 so
we'll bring this let's make this little
caps travel and just open it up a bit
there you go travel and then we'll go
about 10 good there we go let's look at
it mmm I'm just a big let's make a
little bit smaller just go 14 removing
12 and do the same thing I think zero
was good
see they know they they have it right
already 0 10 6 height
let's make it 14
oops will Center it yeah looks good so
we'll have them both select it will
group them and we'll say this is the
category tag zoom out now we know it's
trouble yeah that works for me all right
so we know it's travel and the next
thing we want to let it know that when
when this article is and maybe how long
the read is so we'll keep using the UI
display
I like this duplicate bring it up and
we'll do say Friday what's today Friday
Friday September 18th and this is a
little tab tab say it's a 8 minute read
then I want to bump this down fit up
thank you 50%
doesn't get in the way yeah and then
just go light what amazing here
medium-well
stick with you regular yeah I like that
so I think it's too far apart so Friday
Stern teeth duplicate and then we'll go
then watch be like 14 pixels this is a
four-minute read and then we can
highlight the four and give it make a
little bit more yes we have to do this
for want to highlight this all right
there we go for a minute if you notice
what I did there I separated for and the
minute so that I can bump this up and
highlight it right oh you're like 80%
alright so I think we can call this one
done so we know that's a travel
it's a forming to read free climbers
kalisto climbing in Yosemite National
Park it's a National Geographic could
read more so what happens when you click
read more this is the article view and
what we're going to do is we're gonna
click a create another one we're gonna
rename it article article mm-hmm and I
want to use the same image I used here
I just want to use the top like the top
quarter I'm eyeballing right now there
we go and I want to use the same image
and we'll do what we did last time and
bring it in what will Phil look at that
that is what's up I like that a lot like
it alone
and we're going to duplicate this image
and change it from a fill of an image to
fill of a color and I want to add a
slight like a slight tint to it so if
you notice I'm darken it up a little bit
and that's so that when I add icons here
it can it can you can see it so I want
to use the same arrow command see paste
it here and I'm going to rotate it the
other way and here I want to make it
more vibrant yeah let's go full vibrancy
here and then we want to scale it just
scale it up a little bit there you go
and we want this to let them know that
hey once you're here you can go back and
again I'm making it 20 pixels from the
left eye pixels from the right maybe I
want to bring it down a little bit more
and then I want to I want to also give
them an option to share the article if
they like it and so I'll go back to here
and find the share icon which is right
here whoops
down here so I want to click ctrl
command I mean select it you notice just
to share I'll do command C like we did
with the other icon and bring it to here
click here right-click paste here and
we're going to scale this down say 50%
yeah about 75 to set where to scale down
to 75 percent 70 there we go and we're
going to put the share icon right here
so use some rulers again and see where
this lies there you go and we're about
far we 24 pixels so same thing and we'll
go about 24 pixels alright so they can
share this if they want to and now we're
gonna move into the text here I want to
create another guide at the leftmost so
I can align my text and I'd like this
text so what am I using semi bold so
I'll click text here I mean we'll bring
in the
some bringing medium here and then we
want to make it a dark color I like that
color it's not a full black it's a nicer
little color here and maybe I like semi
bowls nice
it's so nice well bump this up to 18 and
I want this to be about about 24 here
we'll call this again free climbers
complete historic yeah let's make it
bigger
there you go free climbers complete
historic climb and Yosemite National
Park
yeah I like that just give it a little
bit more space so free climbers complete
and then we want to bring in this and
reuse it here Oh see it's still in the
newsfeed we're going to want to bring it
into the article and I'll line it 20
pixels nice and then we want to bring
make this a group and bring these over
paste here
I think it would be not white ungroup
leafy's because we want the date yeah we
want the date and it doesn't need to be
so prominent here so we can go like a
like a 12 and I'll line it with this one
there we go we can add a nice little
September 18th 2015 there you go more
detail and can add a
50 percent so we have here
what are we in the middle between this
to use this little nifty one all right
so we have that and a nice little
separator
okay cool next we're almost there next
we just need to write the UI display
regular font say two climbers made it to
the top of El Capitan all right we're
almost we're almost there
almost almost all right and then I want
this to be a little bit lighter I think
that feels good
all right let's bump this to 1816 El
Capitan and 18 yeah to close ranks at
the top of El Capitan and yo Yosemite
and I want this to be I go any oseh MIDI
National Park on Friday the first ever
to scale the 3,000 foot
yeah 3000 foot granite wall using only
their hands and feet their hands and
feet and safety rope for 19 days Kevin
the organs in 30 of Santa Rosa
California and Tommy Caldwell 36 of
Colorado go low tidal pull it up tempted
what many considered possible then we
will bring all of this down because I
think that's a nice amount of stuff
and we can make this larger
hina 324 what do you think 264 like this
better
there you go
when you consider and potato many
consider impossible many levels the two
climbers trained for about one year
before attempting a massive climb up
massive climb you get there we go
alright so these are our two screens new
command period command period and space
you can see them in all their glory so
that is a quick quick rundown oh I gotta
take a nap here in a little bit
that is a quick rundown at how I use
sketch I use a lot of shortcuts and it
was more the goal was more to give you a
sense of how I used the app and what you
can make with with sketch and if this
looks this looks good if I don't say so
myself I like it I like it a lot and
yeah it's a simple mobile news app and I
like curates top 10 stories of of the
day for you and you can swipe up use
full-bleed imagery it's beautiful
etc alright call it let's call it done
we spent this episode designing a mobile
app for the US platform using bohemian
coding software called sketch and I'd
like to thank you so much for giving me
the time and attention
to show you something that I've been
doing for a long time I love design and
the visual aspect of it is a subset of
design thinking in that whole and try to
suspend a good job of about talking
through the full process designer on our
podcast and he's also written he also
created a website and and owns a domain
info process designer calm and you can
take the time to read through that and
hope you enjoy the little bit that we
spent on the visual design elements of
design if you have any questions or
comments or concerns put them down in
the comments below and I'll take a look
at them as well and follow Travis's lead
of trying to answer as many comments as
possible so thank you once again see you
next time Oh keep on that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
