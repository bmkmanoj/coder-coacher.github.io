the phrase keep on hacking keep on
hacking people in acting keep on hacking
keep on tacking keep on hacking keep on
hacking
oh yeah and keep on hacking today I want
to show you why ah here on the channel
and also on my podcast and again in my
notes and in my lectures and just about
every time I communicate with someone
I'm always sharing this message of just
keep on going don't stop just don't
listen to that little voice in the back
of your head that says you're not good
enough
or it's just too hard or you're not
going to make it or whatever and I tell
you guys all the time that you just need
to put in the hours just just do the
work and commit yourselves and one way
or another it will all work out and so
today I want to kind of put myself out
there as an example to show you exactly
how this works I scraped together a lot
of my old work and I'm going to show you
my embarrassing past and I want to show
this to you to prove that not everyone
springs forth from their fathers loins
like fully formed with a with a complete
creative perspective now I also want to
admit at the top of this episode that I
don't think that I have everything
figured out and that I also start every
project with the same fear and loathing
as that's that first project that I ever
started and I also think you know that's
okay you know people like us who are
paid to be creative people this is our
burden really and I carry it gladly
because the rewards definitely out set
the pains all right enough talk I'm
about to show you the earliest version
of my website that I could find okay
there were earlier versions and maybe
even better versions but this is the
earliest one that I could find so we're
just going to call this one version
number one and I think this is probably
the earliest version when I was serious
about trying to gain clients and I don't
really have much to show for this a lot
of these links are broken and the
content is broken but the thing to
recognize about this design let me show
you this it was tables look at this this
this layout is tables it was basically
slices
taken you know from Photoshop and the
portfolio linked like some flash plug-in
or something the resume was just a PDF
and the contact was it was an email this
this was like my first like try like
look at this like person sitting here on
the edge I have no idea what was going
on these are all images these these are
not even words but this is before CSS
fonts were thing at all so images as
type we're pretty common but look at the
are I mean this is this is aerial I
think no that's not aerial
these are aerial and then this looks
like myriad anyway this is pathetic and
ugly and this one me zero clients just
to be clear zero clients saw this and
thought I want to hire this guy I don't
know what I was thinking the next one is
more of a conceptual thing no this is
this is really really stylized you know
Travis is like all I think actually this
was inspired by like an urban outfitters
catalog that I got in the mail once I
was like oh man that's amazing but yeah
like this is the first time that I used
CSS layout so everything is kind of like
positioned like everything is positioned
absolute and I treated it kind of like a
Photoshop layout right where like if
it's if it's a box it's positioned to
absolute and it's like floating in the
air somewhere like nothing is kind of
fluid or definitely not responsive
actually back when this was created what
did the dates are like 2008 2007 this
was like responsive design wasn't even a
consideration back then I don't think
when was the first smartphone after this
I'm sure so there's a blog portfolio and
about and goodies goodies were like I
don't does this even work oh my gosh it
works free junk for everyone tell your
mom like I made like um wallpapers and
stuff does the download doesn't work
okay anyway uh let's just continue on
this is just so bad I think this was
even powered by blogger
from from Google remember blogger.com
this one had huge load times like it had
a problem because it was so slow to load
because the internet was slower back
then and this one also won me zero
clients so let's go to the next one how
many clients do you think this one
awarded me that's right zero
it's a left-aligned kind of like crazy
this is back in the day when like
flourishes and that kind of crazy stuff
was all in style I can't even read this
quotation anyone who keeps the ability
to see beauty never grows old oh that's
nice good what's up losers my name is
Travis how many yeah how many clients
bought that
tweet-tweet with okay so this one was
like obviously a holding page there's
not a lot of content here it's not like
meant to be like showing off any
portfolio pieces it's I don't think he
was even up very long I think I put it
up while I was designing in a new style
and this one also at one means zero
clients but this was a precursor to the
next one which was this one which
actually for me was quite successful
this one did win me three or four
clients and one of those clients rolled
into a full-time job that I was able to
kind of stay with for maybe like three
or so years and that was at my first
marketing agency and kind of like
launched my career as a professional
those are the ones I did freelance every
now and then but it was never because of
the website it was because I knew
somebody or you know like it was just
horrible but this one is is funny too
because it's just like that same style
of you know unnecessary flourishes
everywhere and like overly designed
graphics and stuff and like everything
is in a oh it still works they're gonna
pop out here
I think this isn't called light box it's
like a jQuery plugin I had no idea how
to do jQuery everything even like this
scroller that I had right here was like
a plugin that I chopped up and tried to
make work as as as well as possible in
this one right here what is this this
button that goes to the next these are
these these graphics for these buttons
are literally stolen from apple.com I
believe back in the day I think I
screamed shotted those buttons this one
is copyright 2008 so again we're going
back quite a while ago but this one yeah
this one with had some good copywriting
on it I think and people commented on
that and I was I was hired because
because of this so this one was this one
is important to me because of that I
don't think it's necessarily good it's
definitely not responsive but there we
are
the next version is is an interesting
one this is the first version of an
actual blog so this is the first time I
started creating serial content and I
don't actually have the content this is
just something I uploaded into the
template yesterday when I was preparing
for this video and I'm really sad about
that so I don't have the content anymore
but I do have the these were built on
WordPress so I do have the wordpress
templates so this is a wordpress
template and actually this was during a
time in my life where I was considering
branching off my career away from design
and I was considering becoming a
photographer and so I made a design for
this page that was basically centered
around photography and I tried to post a
daily photo and I did it for like a year
or two and the photo would go right here
and then there would be an explanation
right here and then these ones there
would actually be photos here on the
right too and it's like a three column
grid I mean it had you know it was good
I had comments and everything had this
about page work oh the about page works
okay about myself okay anyway so so this
one this one lasted a while but it went
through iterations and I don't have the
con
ten of the sites but I do have via the
templates right so it was a template so
I would make a new template every time I
updated the version so this one was like
a photo journal template this one is
what I called Haas and let's see if this
updates okay so it this is the about
page nothing there okay so this one is a
little bit more focused on the content
being streamlined so it removed the
links to other ones and then we move to
a paginate 'add design and also kind of
like had this this bar and at this one
here the reason why this one is a little
bit different is because i tried to make
less of a photo a photo journal kind of
one and i tried to make it into an
expressive arts one and i can't show you
because i didn't have any of those
specific posts but there were posts
where i would go in and and wouldn't put
a photo but i would make like a more
design centered post where it would be
full width and be like more individually
art directed right and this was like the
first time i do that but i would only do
that kind of special post every now and
then I really started enjoying the idea
of making individually designed posts
and so the next design that I made or
the next iteration really really catered
to that a lot and if I go back in here
and refresh okay oh the headers broken
but I used to have this cool oh it still
does so like this pulldown profile so I
got rid of the about page made a profile
that just kind of popped down and these
lines should have connected here I don't
know why it's broken but and then there
was like a slider here so it was like
you could get around everything a little
bit more in like they would like pop up
and I don't know there's a lot of
different things about it but but sent
essentially this area right here was up
for grabs and I could make designs that
would spread the whole width and they
were like special articles and different
things and that kind of like set the
tone for the next generation of of what
would the
website was and if I go to the wayback
machine I can find a version of that was
archived of that of the expressive
articles now by this time which is I
don't know the date of this one but by
this time the articles were like the
main thing and so like when you would go
to the website the articles would be the
like the most recent article would be
the only one showing and then you the
only way to navigate would be by using
these buttons here to go back and front
forth but I would create like these huge
like things and this is all a lie of
text and you know using I think there's
I don't think this is HTML text I think
this coupon or something like that and I
was like experimenting with JavaScript
being able to pull things around and
reorder them and stuff like that and
like I would make make everything myself
I wouldn't use plugins or anything
because I wanted to learn how to do it
and the best way to learn how to do
something is just to struggle through it
so so these things like surf day and
then there's their other ones here web
archive a lot of these articles are
actually on so what are we looking at
here we're looking at 2011 right here
August 2011 and it's when the CSS is
broken anyway let's move on so a lot of
those articles I I packaged up and took
with me to the next version which which
is actually similar to the version that
I just replaced recently so I'm showing
you this on Behance
which is like a documentation of the old
design is not the actual design so all
of these articles got their individual
cards right here so and then you would
like kind of like hover over the card
and it would slide up and show you the
name of it and everything like that but
here you can see there's an animated gif
of like scrolling through the cards it
was kind of like a Pinterest board style
of these covers you know and I really
focused a lot on showing the showing all
the articles as an index and that way
instead of showing them because the
problem was when it was like just one
article for the whole page that people
would come in they'd be like oh this is
just one thing and they would never
back or forth and so I wanted to show
yes there's a lot of stuff to see here
and so I made this more of like a more
like an index instead of just like
having one article at a time and that
worked really well and I also started
showing off my work in terms of design
portfolio and that that worked well this
website here was really good to me it
enabled me to find a lot of a lot of
clients and a lot of work and here's my
about page on Travis had hair back then
miss it but these articles here were
individually designed and they they're
art directed and I had to like struggle
through the HTML and CSS and JavaScript
teaching myself along the way like this
like everything I teach you guys in dev
tips I kind of learned by just forcing
myself to get through all of these weird
ideas like I have I just have this weird
idea and like how do I build this just
experiment experiment struggle struggle
kick the wall nothing works
alright and then finally it works and
you have that moment right this caused
so much growth for me this is like the
most important website that I've ever
built is that is this one because it had
so much growth for me and now the you
can't see it here in this Behance
presentation but there was a few
versions of this one as well and the
first one the first one was really like
a like textured you know like it used
like a lot of like textures and stuff
and then it it kind of like over time
became a little bit more flat in terms
of design style but but the overall
structure really hadn't changed for
about three years and then we have what
we did recently here this website looks
so weird when it's big like that this
website here is what's currently live on
the on the Internet and we did this
website together and this series is the
big series that we did this year we
spent 12 hours designing and coding this
from the ground up and I showed you as
every step of the way so you should
probably be intimately familiar with
this design if you have seen
that series but but this design has been
really really effective I'm very happy
with this one it has a really cool
modular design so if I don't do YouTube
anymore I'll just take this section out
and the whole design doesn't need to be
rethought if I want to add in something
else I can just pop it right in line
anywhere that I want and it works it's
really good I'm still working on a few
bugs for example for some reason the
font is not coming through right now I
don't know why I'm still working on a
few bugs but that's all I'm going to
share right now you should go to the
website Travis Nelson comm and sign up
for the email notes and the podcasts
which are awesome so thanks for sitting
through this I hope it was fun for you
it was fun for me and digging up these
old artifacts but the biggest lesson
really that I want to impart to you guys
is that you know things just take time
this takes time I get emails all the
time people ask me what they can do to
just get better faster you know what
videos they should watch what articles
they should read books but in my opinion
there are no shortcuts there is only
hard work and it takes time the author
and researcher Malcolm Gladwell says
that you need 10,000 hours before you're
good at really anything now if you work
about 40 hours a week every week that's
going to take you about 5 years to do
I'm just saying that if you're
discouraged because your design or code
skills are not where you want them to be
take heart that's a good thing because
now you know where you need to be
imagine if you sucked and didn't even
know it that would be worse just keep
working and never be satisfied and do
the work today that you want to be paid
to do tomorrow don't waste your time
trying to be a great photographer if you
want to be a professional musician you
only have so much time in the day and
you need those 10,000 hours to be good
at any one thing so focus on that one
thing and start today as I said this is
the last video theater thank you so much
for making 2015 a magical experience for
me there's been difficult moments and
more than once I've considered giving up
on dev tips and just crawling under a
warm blanket and never coming out but
you know then I get
one email someone from a land far away
explaining to me how dev tips has helped
them in their life and that really just
like inspires me to keep going so
literally thank you this is for you and
inspired by you and people like you and
this is supported by patrons these
people these patrons are the awesome
people who are donating a sum of their
choosing for every video that gets made
now patrons do receive a few perks but
mostly they do this for you the people
who benefit the most okay Deb tipsters
my name is Travis this is dev tips
signing off
for the last time in 2015 keep on acting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
