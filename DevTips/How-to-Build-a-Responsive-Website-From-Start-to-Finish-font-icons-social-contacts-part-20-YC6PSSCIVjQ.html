another fantastic Monday aren't you
lucky today
we're going to continue on with the
artist theme and we're going to build
out the contact section ah this is so
exciting because it's the second to the
last section that we're going to be
building and then it's it's done we done
we did something big and awesome and
cool and wow let's not get too excited
let's just let's just start this is the
section that we'll be building today
it's called the contact section and it
is awesome and we're going to be using
some what is it called web fonts for
these icons here and then just like a
big fat link and it's really it's going
to be really easy so hopefully this
won't be a long video and then you can
go about your day feeling like you
accomplished something
okay so last time we left off we did
this client's section here and now we
want to do a contact section alright
we're going to create a new section
duplicate and then I'll rename it to
contact and then basically going to get
rid of kind of all of it
and rename it back to section contact
and then this will be contact
and this will be ID contact awesome okay
now let's get into the meat of the
project alright now we've set up the
page we need to include it into our
index and we do that by using the liquid
template tag called include and then
include contact and let's refresh right
here and there it is there's the contact
section okay now that we set up the area
to work in we're going to work inside of
it and remember how we do we just start
describing things okay so I'm going to
look at I'm going to bring my Photoshop
file now I have my Photoshop file here
on the right and I have my code here on
the left and we're just going to start
describing things okay so the first
thing I see I'm going to call a div
class the social social links and inside
of the social links I'm just going to
have a series of anchor tags and inside
those anchor tags I want to link to all
my various social networks social
accounts and things like that
now you can have as many as you like
right here I'm going to make about one
two three four five is what I have in
the design and let me show you how I'm
going to get these icons it's probably
the coolest thing you'll see all day I'm
going to go over to a website called
echo moon io allow and I'm going to use
the ICO moon app now I call moon's
purpose is to allow us to use like these
icons these web font icons in our
projects for free it's really great they
do get a chart they charge money if you
want them to host your icons what we're
just going to host it locally it's no
problem so this is a free service and
what's cool about that is they allow you
to pick and choose which ones you want
to use and which ones you don't want to
use so the ones that I want to use are
just the the social media icons this
these guys right here nothing special
and I know that these are contained
there's a whole bunch of different
libraries to choose from as well I know
that these are all contained in font
awesome so I'm going to add font awesome
to just see what happened there font
awesome guy added to this list of things
to kind of select your icons from so I'm
going to come in here turn it up to like
42 so I can see things and I'm going to
I'm going to find the icons that I want
to include in my font and I'll leave out
the ones I don't so I have my selector
here a select selection tool kind of
selected right there and I'm going to go
hunting as a YouTube doe cat that's good
on my Instagram I on my dribble of
Behance I also want the Twitter bird
there it is nose here somewhere
also glit grab a few others just to kind
of have in the back pocket in case any
of you guys want to have different kinds
than I'm putting up
I saw Facebook here vine your soundcloud
okay you guys can you come back and add
whatever you like as you see fit but
I've got like a few here for me so now
from here I'm going to click on this
button down here called font and what it
does is kind of generate a preview of
the ones that I have chosen so I have a
SoundCloud vine Behance dribble YouTube
Instagram LinkedIn Google+ github
Pinterest Facebook and Twitter so it's
twelve in total and I want to go to the
preferences here now I could download
this as a font but what I want to do is
click this option here called encode and
embed ant fonts in CSS so this is not
going to give us a wofe or a true type
of TTF file it's going to give us like
base64 embedded into our actual CSS it's
a little easier for us to use or after
like you know track things down and also
it saves us on those really important
HTTP requests so your your CSS is not
going out and contacting another
resource and pulling it in before it can
render stuff it's all in line in the CSS
and it's just kind of you know universal
it'll work on all the browser's so it's
a really good option we switched over at
work to doing it I'm doing
on my personal website for a long time
and now I'm going to teach you guys how
to encode and embed if your font in your
CSS okay so that's the option we want
and just click X right here and then
download so your download comes with a
few files in it and what we want is this
file right here this style file and we
can basically just plop that into our
CSS tools right there now I have style
dot CSS I want to rename that file to
icons icon font dot s CSS now it's a
sass file all of a sudden now this right
here you see all this kind of nonsense
it looks like this this is the the code
the the base64 code that is actually the
font itself right so it's not a it's not
calling the font on a server somewhere
this is the font embedded into our file
and we see down here how we use it if we
put a class of icon - Twitter on
something then it will render the icon
of the Twitter logo inside of whatever
we put that icon on and I'll show you
how that works right now so icon fonts
ass is saved up in our tool section and
go to our tools directory and import
that file call icon - font save oh I
want to put us underscore in front of
the name there we go
okay to make this work I'll have to go
it down here to the anchor tag that I
want it to actually be the link and I'm
going to put class icon - Twitter all
right now let's refresh it on our
project and we'll see if that little
logo there it is there's that little
logo cool and we have five of these
now let's refresh our project and see
all our little line of icons there they
are fantastic now we just need to style
and like you would normally do now to do
that I want to set up our new section in
our style sheets go to sections and
create a new file and I'm going to call
that underscore our contact dot sass
then we go into sections directory and
add a line for contact alright and I'm
open contact and here we are the thing
was called social links this little
wrapper I'll call it social links social
links and I want to make the width of it
a max width of it actually because I
want it to be able to shrink max width
of it is going to be 700 pixels not
negative 700 it's just 700 and the
margin is going to be 0 at the top left
and right is going to be Auto and I want
the bottom to be about 50 because I know
what the next thing is going to be so
there's that and then hmm I also want
the display of it to be display I want
to be flex as well so that the things in
it will be like spaced evenly and kind
of line up nice no matter how many you
put in there if you want 5 like I have
or if you have like a lot more in mind
display flex and then justify content is
going to be space the space around ok
and then let's do the little links
inside social links a you're going to be
display:block and the background
is going to be the accent color we want
this size to be a certain size and let's
see what I had planned out here 50
pixels these reach 50 pixels want the
size to be 50 pixels I want the text
aligned so within that 50 pixel box
I want our want our icons to be centered
in the middle and then I also
two-sentence just enter them in the
height I want the line height to be the
exact same height as our height oops
which is 50 pixels and then we can make
the color of the icons because they're a
font I can just name the font color and
that will be a color of the icons the
color will be white and it looks good
let's refresh and see what we got
Bing okay that's fantastic
you need to round those out with a
border radius of 50% and the font size
will be let's think about what I want
the the hover look like do I want the
hover to look like let's say ampersand
however I just wanted to jump out a
little bit like so I'll do a transform a
scale one point two I don't know and we
want to put the animation here by just
doing transition and then refresh oh
that's kind of nice yeah that's good
it's good all right how does that look
does that look good that looks pretty
good
next we have this bar and then a big
contact email right at the bottom which
will do like this div section
let's call that a br a class bar and
then we have a new link a class big link
and all right now put this big link you
want to fill it in with the whatever
email you want people to contact you at
in this case would be the artist at
gmail.com and and the link will be male
2 : and then the email address all right
okay first thing we want to do is find
that bar bar and let's say its width is
going to be 250 pixels wide its height
it's going to be 0 pixels its margin top
is going to be 4 pixels solid and the
color is going to be accent we also want
it to be oh margin is margin top I met
boarder margin is going to be zero zero
Auto and then 50 I think oh not 550
let's see we got at their bar break oh
that's a break I want men to put an HR
for horizontal rule not a br for break
and there you go there's that bar looks
good now for the what's this called big
link we're going to do a
text-align:center and that will only
work if it's a the display type is
display
block and yeah the font size is going to
be 72 pixels pretty big see how that
works
ooh looks good and we want the font
weight to be 300 let's check that out
looks pretty good except for because
it's block it has like all of this is
active area hmm let's say this let's
call it display:inline-block and then
take this text-align:center and put it
on its parent which in this case is
what's called section contact
so that way we don't have to do this
everything should be text-align:center
anyway all right now you don't have to
that active area on the side but when
you hover over it we do that's great
okay this is a little unnerving oh I
want to put the line height one tighten
up bit alright this margin here is just
too much margin bottom is 70 for that
guy okay and I think that concludes this
section contact or email yeah looks good
I'm into it now we've got a style set
for everything we're going to template
eyes this section so that the content
can be controlled through the settings
folder to make it easier for the people
who are using this theme later on so the
first thing we do is go into our
settings um oh and I'm actually just
going to copy this first section again
and and start down here so I want to say
this group is called social this is
going to the contact section and the
icon is all we need right here the first
one is going to be actually I'm going to
list out all of them that we have so a
note here and I'll say can be a Twitter
I'll just kind of note out the ones the
options of the icons that I have loaded
in
I think that's it right okay so now that
we know which ones we have available
let's talk about how we're going to set
this template up
okay the icon this is going to be the
one that's replicated I think what five
times one two three four five the icon
that I have set up is going to be
Twitter and then it's going to be
dribble then it'll be behance then it'll
be YouTube and then it will be LinkedIn
but you can use any of these keywords to
create the icon and then you want to
link these through so this will be what
is it
HTTP twitter / are sorted comm slash dev
tips show presto
they're done now now to bring all of
those data outside of the settings and
into our template we're going to narrow
these links down to one link that's
going to be repeatable and it's going to
be I'm going to do it like this four
links for link in and we're going to
think about where those variables are
set up now they're in the global keyword
of site and then data and then settings
file and then in the group of was it
social right right there
social okay so for every link in site
data setting social and then we want to
close our for loop right here and for do
one of these and then we'll print out
the little variables here icon right is
it icon I have a short memory icon and
link
oops this needs to be linked and then
I'll copy that and it's going to be
right here
icon - icon so it's going to print out
is icon - for example if they chose
Twitter icon - Twitter right so save and
let's print that out refresh and there
should be no visible change other than
its rendered dynamically from the
settings menu now somebody who's using
this template later on can come into the
settings page and render these out right
one more one more email that's what we
want so that's going to be right here
oops in site data settings email
copy and then a mail two will be the
same right there
refresh my company oh I'm getting an
error build the whole time oh no oh okay
so it's link dot link and Link dot icon
refresh there we go
so here we go sorry I got those all
wrong I've fixed it though so that's
what it looks like if you add Facebook
on the end and there we are so cool you
can add these in let's let's stretch
this down and see how this works out in
mobile that's okay but I also want to
put I'll say um flex wrap wrap social
links margin 20 pixels there we go
that's going to be a bit better I guess
that'll have to do cool um that's it I'm
going to remove all these Facebook's
from our settings I would keep it around
five if you can it looks best that way
the contact section is officially done
so you learned how to get web fonts kind
of like narrowed down into just the
fonts we need you to we'd want to have
the whole font that you know of full of
unnecessary characters that we're not
going to be using and we also learned
how to I guess that's the biggest thing
for the section of the contacts section
and then in the next section next week
or whenever this next video comes out
we're going to do the contact form which
is also super exciting okay so until
then keep it real keep it crispy and
keep hacking bye guys
