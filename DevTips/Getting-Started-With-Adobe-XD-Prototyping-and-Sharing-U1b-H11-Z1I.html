dev tips today were looking at
prototyping in Adobe XD last week we
took a tour of the design tools in Adobe
XD and next week we're gonna sit down
with one of the original creators of the
tool we're gonna talk about the future
of the product and what that looks like
I wanna thank Adobe for sponsoring the
series and let's take a look at
prototyping in Adobe XD when ready to
prototype in XD we got to switch the tab
up here to the prototype mode you can
see that the side bar here goes away you
only have kind of like one tool here the
select tool what we're gonna be doing is
selecting elements on these artboards
that we want to create like hyperlinks
or clickable areas so if I click this
object here or click any object see that
there's like this little arrow that
comes off the right of it and I can drag
this arrow and just attach it to the
next artboard and what happens is they
get a modal that will say okay let's
create a hyperlink or a hot hot area
what does it call the hot area hmm it's
so hot
what are the details do you want to have
a transition you don't have to you can
do none or you can use the dissolve or a
slide or something like that what we're
gonna do is we're gonna do a slide up
and the easy we want ease in out and
duration to 0.2 seconds is that's pretty
good actually
20 point point 2 seconds is 200
milliseconds mmm the first thing also to
remember is that see how I have this
artboard selected and look at this
little house here is gray and this one
has a blue house on it that means that
when I start my prototype let me go help
and press the play button this whole
this will bring us up a new prototype
window it starts with the home screen
which is the one that we've selected up
here if you want to change the home
screen just click an artboard and then
click the blue button and then when I
start their prototype it will start with
the other screen right the one that we
just selected as the home screen so let
me put the home back on here these so
deselect everything selecting nothing
here and going to the play button and
now let's hit the create an account
button and we're gonna see that slide up
happen
so 0.2 seconds is pretty fast I guess
let me slow that down a little bit and I
don't even have to close anything down
to make any edits I can just go over
here and click this button click this
transition and make it point four
seconds now let's try it a little slower
and I can see what's happening a little
bit more exciting so you don't have to
close this thing this thing live live
updates in fact let me let me show you
when I'm clicking on different artboards
this preview window updates on the
artboard that I'm focused on and I can
make I can't even make changes if I go
to the design tab and change this to
like your name it will it will update
here right I mean I didn't want to say
yo name you don't am linking back to
prototype okay so mmm let's prototype
this create a user flow here what we're
gonna do is we're gonna create a journey
that the user might click on different
areas and create a flow so we have the
login button and that's going to take us
back to the login screen and so is the
create account I mean we could do a
create account flow but you know what's
we're gonna skip that and make it simple
so we just have a login if I click on
the X you can click this arrow here you
don't need to drag the arrow you can
just choose artboard from a drop-down
and you can go to either one of these or
you can click previous artboard so no
matter where you are when you click this
X it just goes back to where it was
right it uses the reverse animation of
where it came from which is pretty cool
let's press Continue and you're gonna go
to this home screen here which basically
has all the surf spots and by default it
says slide up easing out for a point
four seconds this is where this is like
the default the last settings that we
use to create this previous one so we
don't want it to slide up we want slide
down because we want our user let's
click on the home we wanted a user to
create account this this kind of screen
slides up they type their name in they
continue and it slides down for the
content reveal that's a good animation
right there let's close this and just
start wiring up a flow real quick here
okay so let's say somebody clicks on
this search bar it should go to the
search screen if they type in some
things let's click on this typewriter or
the tech keyboard here and it goes to
this screen if I click X it will do that
one trick where it goes
previous artboard x would go I guess I
don't want to go to this one I what X
would want to go to this one yeah hmm
and if they hit enter on this card if it
would still go to this screen right
because this is a card of card of reef
is the one that they're searching for
right here card of state beach okay um
here's a big here's a tip for when you
guys are doing prototypes it might be
tempted to dive in here and make it just
this one the hyperlink because oh if you
don't go to Swami's or San Elijo or
pipes we don't want them to go to the
cardiff beach but you know the idea of a
prototype is not to make sure all of
this story in terms of the content is
you know linear but really just to make
sure that the idea is that they pick a
spots nearby you go to a spots nearby
template and that's kind of weird so I'm
gonna say if you click any of these I'm
going to take you to the cardiff reef
page and what's my animation here slide
down no let's just do a let's just do it
a dissolve or none really let me take a
look at that so let's press play what
does it look like hmm I think you're
better if I just did none just a hard a
hard cut oops in that detail yeah that's
better
okay so this back arrow can be that back
button search can be you know search and
let's use dissolve okay so I'm gonna
take a few seconds and and just kind of
wire all these up we're gonna go in
fast-forward mode you guys ready hold on
to your butts
okay so we've wired up all these screens
of a zoom out and just press command a
for like to select everything you can
see all of the different wires going
from page to page so that's pretty cool
make sure everything at least has an
entry point sometimes like you'll be
wiring up things and you'll leave a
screen out entirely that you've designed
you design the screen and you didn't
even use it in your wire a wire why I'm
saying why are your prototype workflow
right anyway so let's get this started
select nothing here so we know that if
if you have a screen selected and then
you hit the play button it will go to
that screen so we're gonna hit nothing
and then hit the play button so it'll go
to the home screen and let's take a look
at our prototype now the cool thing
about this is that I want to share this
prototype I want to see how my team or
my customer reacts to this and so one of
the cool things I can do there's a
variety of ways that we can share this
prototype with our team I'm gonna show
you one right here you can press this
record button and it will give your
cursor this kind of like finger and you
can click around on things and you can
show by example what it's like when
creating this little movie here that
that you can export and share with
everybody so let's let's click around
make sure that everything's looking good
all right yeah I'm super happy and then
I'm going to stop the recording and I'm
gonna save it to my desktop
and then when we watch this movie here
we got a little video that we made and
we can act an email this video I can put
it you know in my Dropbox and share the
link around or whatever and then the
whole team can be like yeah okay cool
this is also a really great way to get
feedback from a user testing right so
like give this you know push play and
give this to your user and just see how
they click and ask them their
expectations in all the while you're
creating a movie of what they are doing
so you can watch this later and say like
oh well users didn't really understand
this part and and you can get feedback
that way now that's one way to make the
movie there's a few other ways to export
you can like actually click click
excellent
you can actually click these these
artboard and press command E and this
will just you know it'll export a ping
and you can do what you know what sizes
do you want because remember this is all
vector art you can export it to 1x and
2x you can even do 3x or a variety of
different ones for these quick like
basically export presets here I usually
either do a designer web and just
actually I've started just doing design
just exporting it 1x and then all of a
sudden I've got you know what this ping
here you can do you can click you can
select multi pens and be like oh these
are just the instructor details let's
press command E in and export all three
of those at once you can even export
certain let's see let's click into
something let's go to the design tab you
can export just this grid here press E
and when the export happens I have just
descriptive images that I've exported
out there as a pain so you can export a
lot of different ways let's see how else
can you share things oh you can share a
link so if you create this share you can
share online and you can allow comments
from your the people you share it with
and just create a link and after you're
done here
you're gonna get this link which all the
work that we did to set up those blue
lines that
wiring flow will all be active and
actually let's click let's do the link
right now here we are let's take a look
at it so everybody can can see you can
see this and use it and then when
they're ready they can make comments or
or whatever you know so it's pretty cool
that's what those are a few really great
ways to share in XD another way is to
mirror the content from your XD file
onto your phone and have at a pible
prototype right here as you know your
work
this makes prototyping easy fun and a
lot of different ways to attack the
problem thank you so much for watching
this episode the prototyping and sharing
tools in Adobe XD are wet really sets it
apart from the other design tools in the
marketplace and it's really cool to kind
of see how that works I want to thank my
patrons for supporting the show and just
being there wherever we go and just
being awesome every episode you guys are
incredible and I want to say to you guys
if you are looking for a group of people
to meet and to join up come visit
patreon.com slash dev tips and you can
learn more about the patreon community
that we have there all right that's it
next week we're gonna sit down with the
creator of Adobe XD we're going to talk
about what it's been like to develop
this tool and what the future ideas are
and we're gonna see you then keep on
hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
