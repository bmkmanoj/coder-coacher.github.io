I just wanted to make this quick little
video to say thank you guys so much for
watching the CSS basic series we just
completed I love it when you guys
comment and share and interact it makes
this whole effort worth it to me so
thank you again I don't have anything to
share with you guys in a way of tip stay
but I wanted to take some time and talk
about what we've accomplished so far and
what we can look forward to in the
coming here first I want to share with
you guys a few statistics I'm kind of a
stat nerd so the stuff is interesting to
me and I think you'll find it
interesting as well dev tips first video
is posted on September 8th 2013 now
that's a hundred and one days from today
when i'm recording this video in those
101 days i've published 27 videos for an
average about one video every three
point seven days which is not horrible
the topics we've covered as you know
mainly have been html5 and CSS in fact
each of those two topics have had their
own basics series aptly named html5
basics and CSS basics which we just
wrapped up last week half of the 3000
total video views' have come from the
html5 basic series which really makes
sense when you think about it because it
was the first series that we've done and
it has had like the most time to bake on
the internet and get those SEOs going
outside of those two larger series we've
had a few smaller subjects there's been
a series called how does the internet
work which I talk about how does the
internet work and there's been a number
of videos inside the dev tips beta Ceres
which are just kind of random topics
that for one reason or another i was
inspired to talk about at that time
those are all fun earlier I said we're
about three thousand video views which
is great but when you talk about the
actual minutes being watched of all the
videos were at seven thousand and six
hundred two minutes spent watching dev
tips so far and that's really exciting
if you average that out between the
videos that's about two hundred and
eighty minutes per video now this is a
really rough estimate but I think that
it takes me about on average three
hundred and eighty minutes
to write film and supply the graphics
and edit each video so that means that
my efforts to teach and hang out with
you guys via the YouTube platform has
had a multiplier of 0.875 which means
it's so far it would have been more
effective to talk with each one of you
individually that's sobering but you
know it is what it is all right we've
had 81 comments on depth tips so far and
this is my favorite part of what I'm
doing here I love to hear from you guys
I read and respond to every comment on
the channel the biggest day for comments
was november 20th with 10 comments so it
looks like we're really chatty when it
gets time for turkey the person with the
most comments is marshmallow humor Jesus
told me that she is a student in college
learning about web programming which is
awesome I'm so curious about who you
guys are I love learning about you as
far as demographics are concerned it
looks like we have a 7030 split men two
women in our biggest age group being 35
to 44 years old now when I say we on
this channel I'm talking about we making
this stuff is just me I'm just one
person but I really like to think of the
channel as our thing if you are watching
this channel if you're sharing this
channel contributing with comments and
ideas and questions this is your channel
this is all about interaction and I want
to increase that in the new year and now
let's talk about the plans that we have
for the Navy now this is going to be the
last video for 2013 I'm going to be gone
on vacation for the rest of the year and
it won't be back until mid-january with
the new video but I want to talk to you
right now about what's going to be
happening in 2014 I'm very excited about
all these ideas that I have and we'll
share a few of them right now with you
guys to get you super pumped about what
we got going on in the future now that
I've covered a lot of referential
content in the html5 basics and CSS
basic series I want to return to a few
of the subjects that only have to touch
on very lightly
and do some deep dives on those topics
very excited about deep dives I want to
work with you guys a little bit more
closely in 2014 so here's a few ideas of
how we can make that happen maybe we
could do a live chat and I can help you
troubleshoot something as you're working
on or maybe I could answer some
questions for you and help you get past
whatever you're currently stuck on or
even if you guys want to come on the air
and you know discuss something that
you're working on and kind of promote
yourself here whatever I don't care this
is this is a community let's do this
let's help each other all right i want
to bring more people on the show i had
loads in the studio a while back to
discuss CSS cascading and we had an
absolute blast so I'll look forward to
having more people on the show so I'm
not actually a coder by profession I'm a
designer but code is a lot easier to
teach because you know it's either fixed
or it's broken but I'd like to take some
time to discuss some design principles
with you guys later on down the road I'd
like to discuss tools and trends that
are more timely I feel like we've been
talking about the fundamentals and
basics for so long now and like the
internet world move so quickly that
there's like a lot of cool things we're
just not even talking about so I want to
give my perspective on frameworks like
bootstrap or coding philosophies like
object-oriented CSS super cool now so
far the videos have had a very bike know
how does this work kind of vibe to it
which is cool I mean you know the
fundamentals are super fundamental and
they're very important but now that
we've covered a lot of that I want to
jump into you know how do I make this
thing kind of videos where we work on
projects together or you know do
whatever you guys want to do another
small thing is I toured the idea of
publishing the manuscripts that are
right for these videos see what comes to
that in 2014 I would like to attend more
functions and stick this camera in more
people's faces I think that's a lot of
fun I'd also like to develop my own
projects live for you guys so you could
watch as I develop in real time that
would either be like really really
boring or really interesting depending
on
if you're me or not so to sum up I've
got a lot of ideas but absolutely no
time to do them in but I'm very very
excited by your encouragement and
support thanks for sharing these videos
thanks for liking and subscribing and
most importantly thanks for being that
beautiful and unique snowflake that you
are so until january i'm travis and this
is dev tips thanks for sticking around
I'll see you then
did you ever know you could be the
subscriber you just a subscriber I want
you to B's you can get their videos in
your inbox and that will happen every
Monday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
