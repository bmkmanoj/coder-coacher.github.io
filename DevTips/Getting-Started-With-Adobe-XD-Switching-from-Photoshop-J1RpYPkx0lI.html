is dev tips this video that we're
watching right now right now is called
switching from Photoshop and it's in the
series called getting started with Adobe
XD big thanks to Adobe for sponsoring
the series ah so here's the setup in the
last video we talked about switching
from sketch to XD and this week we're
talking about switching from Photoshop
to XD and this video is actually a
little bit more relevant to me because
Photoshop for me was my design tool of
choice for over a decade and that only
changed when I joined Google and
everyone was using sketch and so I
learned sketch and use sketch for a few
months and then XD was released and I
just kind of like Oh shiny new stuff
over there now I'm using XT the last
video we talked about the similarities
and differences between XT and sketch
and I feel like that transition from
sketch to XD would be a little bit more
straightforward than Photoshop txt
because both of those tools were created
specifically in mind for people who were
designing layouts for digital interfaces
and Photoshop is an entirely different
beast it's used for a lot of different
things if you use Photoshop for layout
and design now it's likely that you'll
be using it for a long time because
honestly it's a piece of software that
we as designers repurposed a long time
ago to meet our needs it was never
intended to be a layout program we
should have been using InDesign or
something else but anyway Photoshop is a
great tool especially for the demands of
that time where the websites that we
would create were a lot more graphical
in nature all that is to say that if I'm
making this video here and intended to
help people switch from Photoshop to XD
I really need to make sure that I'm
talking to the right kind of designer a
layout in digital interface designer so
let's make a really quick list of the
types of things that you'd be using xp
for and the types of things that you
would not be using xD for XD is great
for web layouts
app layouts and user flows and drawing
boxes lots of boxes and for working fast
and trying a lot of variations of your
idea very quickly that's a big strength
of XT and XT is not really great for a
lot of things there's a lot of things
it's not great for chief among those is
like graphic editing I mean I'm talking
image editing even simple cropping it's
not you can mask but cropping is not a
part of it graphic effects anything more
than putting a simple border on
something you're gonna have a bad time
XD is not great for making a delicious
and nutritious lunch XD is not great for
iterating or making a lot of versions
wait yes it is that's what it's good at
but it's not good at helping you find
love because that has to come from
within and at this point I think that we
might be better served instead of making
lists about the differences between the
two applications to just create
something so let's create the same thing
in both of these apps and see and notice
and talk about the process and the
different tools that you might use and
the different like you know ways that
you would do it in each app as that's
like a fun time
first let's design in XD I'm gonna start
this project by opening a new art board
template at 360 by 640 size the reason I
do that is because 360 is a really
versatile number and when we're talking
about grid sizing so I'm going to make
this 20 pixel column grid with 20 pixel
gutters and it's a really easy way to
just have everything lined up nice and
tight I have a folder full of images and
I'm gonna drag out the box that I want
to contain the hero image I just drag
the image straight from my finder onto
the rectangle object that I created and
it fills that image into the background
of the object I'm gonna drag out some
text to be the title of the page this is
Arches National Park a place in Utah
that I went camping at recently and it
is beautiful so I want to make a design
around that right
I'm going to use these guys to inform
the size of the rectangle that I make to
hold the content of the page and put a
drop shadow on there to make it stand
out and turn the background a little bit
gray again the guides come into play
when I'm making the call to action
button this is the button that will
people when they go to the campgrounds
they'll use it to book the campsite and
we have a nice little camping icon here
the next thing I want to do is look at
the ratings and I use the repeat grid to
quickly pull out five different stars
and then I duplicate that repeat grid
and make it darker to show that some of
the stars are selected and highlighted
we have 3.5 stars here I'm going to grab
out some description text of the arches
national park I drag out a text block
and fill it with that text I'm again
using those guides that I created to
inform how I place that text block right
now I want to create a carousel of
images and it's really easy to do with
the repeat grid just repeat this block
and then if I drag a group of images on
to repeat grid each element in the
repeat grid gets filled with one of the
images from the group I dragged in
having done that I line it back up into
the grid and it's looking good I drag in
a menu item and then I create a scrim
which is this black gradient thing that
sits on top of the image to allow the
logo and menu control to kind of stand
out a little bit more I turned the whole
thing into a symbol and duplicate the
artboard the reason I do this is because
any changes that I make later on on this
layout I want it to reflect in every
version of the layout that I use and
this second artboard is going to be a
state where i've dragged out the menu so
I'm going to blur to that background and
draw a new menu open on top of it I
really don't know what kind of links a
good campground website would have but
might be something like this how many is
that same menu proportions to create the
close button using the pen tool and then
why don't I use this close button to
create a graph
the cool device set between the menu
items mmm looks awesome enough for the
second half of this video let's recreate
the same thing in Photoshop the first
thing I did was export a flat PNG from
the XD design I just did and put it
right next to my new artboard in
Photoshop I noticed a big difference
immediately when dragging new images
into Photoshop I'm not placing them on
objects to fill I actually have to scale
and crop the images on my own this scrim
that I'm creating is very similar to
what we did in XD it's a vector object
with a gradient fill but when I place
these SVG icons I can't easily change
their fill so I'm using a color overlay
style to change them white actually like
manipulating text in Photoshop a little
bit better it's easier to do maybe it's
just cuz I've been doing it longer here
but I really like the way that when you
create new text elements but they retain
the style of the last thing you did XD
can be pretty tiring having to reset the
font every time you create a new text
note just like XD I'm using vector
elements to drag out content containers
but this time instead of using the grid
like I had an XD i'm just using nudges
mostly because I know exactly what I
want to accomplish this time you can see
that there's a lot more fuss when I'm
adjusting these stars in Photoshop I
have to manually adjust their spacing
because they're not in a repeat grid
like they were in XD it's not too bad
though a quick group a duplication a
mask and we have 3.5 stars you can see
again that I'm using nudging a lot with
these buttons and these elements because
I already know the dimensions and
proportions from the last time I design
this site so I kind of had these little
cheats or maybe an unfair advantage when
I'm designing in Photoshop right now
because I've already done the
exploratory work in XD there's no repeat
grid in Photoshop so I'm dragging out
these vector objects as placeholders and
then using them as masking elements for
the images after I place them one by one
to get that blur effect I duplicate the
entire artboard flatten everything and
use a Gaussian blur filter it's not too
much more work and in the end it all
kind of looks the same the biggest
downside to this photoshop document that
I've created is that it does not scale
up
I cannot export this design at 2 or 3 X
/ Retina screens either way these arches
have never looked so good
that was certainly a fun time thank you
so much for watching this episode of dev
tips and next week we're actually gonna
go into the fundamentals of XC wear and
talk about the basics it's not gonna be
a switching video we're gonna talk about
how to get started with XD what are the
fundamentals what should you know what
are the quick things that I use to make
me fast and to make me excited about
this application that's gonna be next
week if you are excited about dev tips
