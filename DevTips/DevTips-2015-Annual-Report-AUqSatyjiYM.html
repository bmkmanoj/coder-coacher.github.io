annual report ah every year I make a
video that looks back on the progress
that we've made over the channel of the
things that we've accomplished and also
makes goals and projections for the year
to come I'm going to share some real dev
tips numbers with you and hopefully you
find these things as interesting as I do
we're going to be looking at three main
things number one performance number to
content goals that i made last year and
how i measured up this year and there
were three we're going to be setting
goals for 2016 click any of those titles
to jump around first let's talk about
channel performance in terms of
published videos in 2014 I published 96
videos that's averaging out a new video
about every three point seven days now
this year in 2015 I kind of kept that
pace publishing 98 videos now keep in
mind that I promised you guys only one
video a week so this is a great example
of under promising and over delivering
it's been a really good year for
publishing videos and we made tons of
tutorials some of them were parts of
longer series like parallax on the web
and design and code my personal website
in 12 hours and some of them were single
videos like how to make a full screen
landing page or what should I use REMS
or M's but I also started doing
different types of videos as well like
these special vlog videos where I take
you to different places in my life like
these conferences where we meet new
people and and fans of the show and it
took you with me for all of my
interviews to get my new job as an
interaction designer at Google and for a
few select awesome videos I invited
other people awesome people to be guest
host here on dev tips people like Caleb
Meredith Mackenzie child and even my
podcast co-host Carlos Montoya so
overall I'm very very happy with the
videos that we produced but now I want
to talk about how you responded to those
videos I want to talk about views dev
tips really took off in terms of
viewership last year I was so impressed
with the 500,000 views that I gained in
those 12 months this year I was
completely blown away by the 2.4 million
views that I saw this morning when I
looked it up 2.4 million in terms of
time watch that's over
12.4 million minutes I mean that's over
24 years of dev tips glowing on computer
screens all across the world to me this
just amazing but speaking of all around
the world the top three countries that
watch dev tips outside of the US are the
UK Germany and India and at the bottom
of that list is Samoa who watched about
six minutes of dev tips this year my
favorite part about YouTube is the
comment section I feel like I get to
really know you guys down there this is
the area where our relationships are
born so last year in 2014 the channel
had about eight thousand comments and
i'm assuming about half of those are
mine because back then I was really good
at responding to everything but this
year this becomes such a big task
because the amount of comments has has
just exploded to around 19,000 comments
and i love the or also it just engaged
and helpful just so encouraging the most
comments on a single day award goes to
jun 29th with 239 comments now that was
the day that i published the first video
in the design and code my personal
website serious so what is youtube
without subscribers right this year we
gain 52,000 new subscribers interesting
story earlier this year about may or so
a co-worker of mine asked me what my
subscriber goal was for this year and i
just told them seventy thousand
subscribers and that number seventy
thousand we hit 70,000 on january first
Oh 2016 which means I didn't make the
goal but anyway but honestly a sub count
is not really a great indicator of the
channels health because about forty
seven percent of the people who watch
dev tips videos are subscribed to the
channel if you think about it most
subscribers don't really watch i'm
subscribed to a lot of channels on
youtube that i don't really watch every
video on i just kind of keep tabs on
them and peek in every now and then and
so if i'm describing you right now hi
how you been all right so that wraps up
the performance section of the video I'm
really proud of what we're accomplishing
here and I'm excited to do more
okay last year I said that I wanted to
craft a holistic educational experience
the idea was that I wanted dev tips to
be a place where you could get a design
and code education a to z well that
didn't work really and frankly I'm over
it i discovered this year the what makes
dev tips fun for me is number one
building relationships and number two
messing around with stuff and sharing
the things that I'm into it's as simple
as that and so I decided really that I'm
not trying to replace your education I'm
just trying to supplement it and have
some fun and so the first goal of the
year was not so much a failure but more
of a learning opportunity for me I think
we defined the brand a lot more this
year and had a lot of fun doing it so to
me that's a success just not in the way
that I envisioned it and the second goal
that I stated last year was to build a
home for dev tips building a home for
dev tips has been an ongoing effort
earlier this year I launched a patreon
page which enables people to connect
with each other and myself on a deeper
level it's developed into a really great
small community and recently Mike made
me smile when he said that I love the
fact that dev tips has connected me to
people all around the world and that's
really awesome to me that's a huge
success to me and I don't want to give
away too much now but I've also been
working with Caleb Meredith to build a
really great place for depth tipsters on
the web we're doing a little beta
testing now but I can't wait to tell you
more launching things is hard but we're
committed so that goal of making a
community a home for dev tips is alive
and kicking but more on that soon all
right now the fun part let's talk about
the goals that I have for dev tips in
2016 goal number one is to expand
operations 2015 has indeed been a year
of growth for me and for dev tips but
I've spent most of that time struggling
on my own to support it all in 2016 I
want to take a few steps towards
expanding the operations and creating a
more collaborative environment to get
this workout I personally want to learn
to delegate more and to work better with
others and to get started with that
effort
really excited to share the news that
I've taken on a video editor her name is
Herman she's already edited 3 videos
last year say hello Irma hey everyone
just wanted to quickly pass by and say
keep on hacking I believe in you Thank
You Irma is doing a great job in
enabling me to move faster and get more
work done in other areas of my life
second goal for 2016 is to do things
that improve other's lives it's a big
one last year we the patrons and I
donated a thousand dollars to the Save
the Children's Foundation I'd like to
triple that this year I think that I've
discovered through doing dev tips and
through other things that one of my big
passions is providing opportunities for
people less fortunate than myself and
this is especially true when it comes to
disaster relief opportunities and as a
side note now that I am an employee of
Google every dollar that I will be
donating this year to charities it will
be matched by Google so that three
thousand dollars that i want to give
will easily become six thousand dollars
for the children the third goal that I
have for dev tips in 2016 is to
strengthen the community last year i
started the patreon community and it has
done a wonderful job of connecting you
dev tipsters to each other and those
relationships are important and I really
want to find new avenues to strengthen
them and the work that I'm doing with
caleb is going to go a long way towards
meeting that need so stay tuned for more
details on that the last goal that I
have for dev tips in 2016 is just to
have fun one of the things that I
learned this year probably one of the
hardest lessons is that if it's not fun
it's not worth it and I'm just not into
it so I'm going to be really judicious
about the things that I do in the
projects that I take on I want to have
fun and not lose sight of why I got into
doing this all right everyone 2015 was a
fantastic year full of great memories
great videos good connections with
people I enjoyed myself thoroughly and
I'm so glad that you've come along this
journey with me I am really excited for
2016 it's going to be incredible next
week we'll be back with a regularly
scheduled tutorial video and I want to
give a huge shout out
to all of the patrons some of them who
were in the past who are no longer
patrons anymore patrons who are now and
and the ones that just joined thank you
so much for being a patron and
supporting the work that we're doing
here this has been an amazing year for
the channel and mostly because of you
this is the list of the current names of
the people who believe in what we're
doing here at dev tips so much that they
would volunteer an amount of their
choosing to support this channel for
every video we make visit patreon.com /
dev tips to find out why they do that
I'll see you next week and until then
keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
