SI ng welcome to our 8.1 in the video
series i call design and code my
personal website in 12 hours ah for the
past two months we've been working on
this very personal project it's my
personal site thank you so much for
coming along this journey with for a
designer like myself designing and
redesigning your personal site can be a
great source of learning and growth in
fact it was through doing this very
thing that i taught myself how to code
originally so this is really important
to me this is like my coding crucible
today we're going to start working on
the articles section the article section
is unique in that it's a direct port in
a lot of ways from the current web site
so let's look at the current web site
you see the current homepage is
basically a listing of articles we're
going to take this content and repurpose
it here into this section the articles
section let's get started
as a review have covered the hero
section up top we've covered this this
YouTube section in last week we did the
mentoring section as we scroll down we
see that we have nothing nothing done
yet and let's consult our Photoshop file
to see what's next for us so next we
have defined is the articles section and
the articles section are unique to this
point because they involve the blog the
Jekyll blog and so I've been getting
some questions lately why did you use
Jade and Jekyll and Jade is a templating
language well Jekyll is a little bit
more verbose and it's templating in that
it can handle things like blogs in
addition to that reason my current
website is built on Jekyll and all of my
posts are Jekyll posts so they're going
to be really easy to transport in but
today in this hour
I'm not going to be transporting my blog
post I'm just going to be creating some
ambiguous blog posts to fill in the
spaces so that we can get an idea for
how that works and I'll teach you how to
make the loop and everything but that
will become later the first thing we're
going to do is is deal with this Styles
now like every other section video I've
done before I have to do that to a few
things I have to create the Jade
template in the in the Jade files folder
and I have to create the the SAS file in
in the CSS folder so you don't need to
watch me do that I'm just going to speed
through that right now okay I've set up
my workspace and just as a review I've
created a section - articles Jade inside
the Jade files and I've included into
the index.html like we've done every
other section by using the liquid
include tag that Jekyll uses secondly
I've created articles dot SAS and
included that into the main dot s CSS so
they can be imported and then used with
the rest of the CSS files so
everything's all set up just the way we
usually do I want to start with a
section - articles Jade let's open the
let's open the columns Jade and let's
just grab the columns that we want to
replicate here so according to our
design here on the right we're gonna
have a 50% split on both on the left
we're gonna have a call - one that's
containing the characters there the the
phrase writing and designing articles
and the button and then on the right
we're gonna have a bunch of clickable
thumbnails and these clickable
thumbnails are not going to be contained
in any of the column - ones or
- twos they're gonna have spread as far
wide as the column - fifty will allow it
which is 50% of the viewport and and so
that's what the structure is going to be
so we're gonna have two 50s and inside
of the first 50 on the left is going to
be a column - one and so that's
basically if we go to our columns below
all of the coding we're doing
it's gonna look like something like this
the floating one and then the 50% one
and that's the last one so let's go in
that columns Jade let's just grab this
last section
copy it close that file and go into our
section
- articles and paste it in and this is
just a starting place I'm going to name
that section with a class of articles
okay now that we've done that let's go
into the left-hand side of the layout
there and create the home lead you know
the paragraph in the button so we're
gonna go into the column 50 that has the
column - 1 inside of it delete that and
then we're gonna make a class of home -
lead it's that right let's check on our
YouTube or something
section YouTube Jade home lead out
dented yeah we're just gonna copy this
actually a lot of copy and pasting and
these in these sections because they're
very very similar okay and put them
inside of the column cool oh the content
we want is is this phrase here writing
and designing articles
and the the home - CTA is going to be
the phrase inside of it is going to be
see all articles capitalized this too
and the H ref is not yet defined so I'll
get rid of this link to my URL or the
YouTube channel and that should be it
except for remember all every one of the
text-based
sides - when they collapse be on the
bottom so this actually needs to be like
this and delete that and put it below
column 50 like this okay and I need to
have in column - 50 right here I need to
put that class for example on the
YouTube this class section or class
order first and remember the class order
first make sure that in in the layout it
gets moved to the left but when it
breaks down into mobile it goes to the
bottom that's all that does so I'm gonna
save and then look at what we got on on
our layout here alright let's check it
out all right here is our call to action
and our home lead you have the 50
percent the 50 percent column on the
right and then when we make it mobile
the home lead goes on the bottom and the
50 percent column is on the top that's
exactly what we wanted now what we have
to do is go into our photoshop file see
what else we got let's start with let's
start with the background let's go into
the Styles get rid of these other files
here okay styles sectioned articles
background image I already have this
image extracted it's right here in the
image file article dot background it's
just this text right here so you know
say image no I'm gonna say also is that
URL dot dot image what's it called
article dot - BG dot jpg and I want that
to be sighs no I don't want it to be
cover I want it to be repeat repeat
okay cool so you see that there in the
background little handwriting elegant
noice noice and the only other kind of
things I need to style for this
left-hand section are the colors so I
want the home CTA to have a white color
I would would a white color and the
button the butt and it's gonna have this
blue and I don't know
blue it is let me sample it here all
right I got the sampled color and I'll
be back round blue that's the color I
want cool
so now let's focus on this right hand
section this right hand section needs to
be full of boxes of thumbnails like this
and then when you hover over them it
gets the article name and date in the
hover box okay okay hmm so let's just
start making boxes I guess column 50p I
don't want that let's let say article
all right article rep and then we want a
class of each one is going to have
article - yeah now this article thumb
that little square I want to actually be
a link so I can use the a tag the anchor
tag and I just need to make sure that I
change that to a display block because
they're naturally display:inline but
this can work article thumb and then
inside of the article thumb I want a
article meta and then inside of the
Arctic Arctic
article meta and inside of the article
meta I want I want the article meta
so first is name and then sort of the
article name
and that second one will be dated and
this will be like December 10 1982
that's all we got let's save it there
take a look at our progress all right it
looks good we want to take this and get
this article thumb here and copy it as
put it into a let's put it into a mixin
because mixing called
thumb the reason I'm putting into a
mixin is because we have to replicate
this a few times because there's a few
articles here I think there's 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10 12 so 12 articles and I don't
want to like write out 12 articles so
does make mixing with twelve twelve
instances what did I call it thumb 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
easy peasy I've done that 12 times I
should have 12 of these little units
here brilliant okay next we go to the
what should we do should we style these
oh you know what we should do these
anchor tags they need background images
because then we use the thumbnail right
here if we look and we use these
thumbnail images as like clickable
things so let's make a space right here
called style equals back ground - image
and URL and then in the URL just put a
placeholder of my favorite placeholder
film or a
come slash and it could be anything like
say 230 wide and like 500 tall and
that's fine we're just using them as
background images so I should have a
bunch of film areas here now I don't why
is that why don't I have a bunch of Phil
Murray showing up is the background of
all of these all of these you know
article thumps well the reason is the
reason is the reason is because they are
currently as I said static elements
they're their anchor tags and we need to
switch them to display block BAM there
you go those peel Mary's hair love it
back ground size cover back down the
sides cover and then let's give these
boxes a dimension I want the box to be
have four thumbnails in the row and that
should be done easily enough by saying
with 25% so now we have our boxes those
white as we want
should we just float them left I don't
think we've used floats one time in this
whole series so far we've just been like
flexing everything but this is fine we
use float left article with 25% that
means it's going to gonna have four
across and it's gonna be a lack of a yet
and now we want to do something
something a little sneaky and what we
want to do is we just want to have the
thumbnail be a square no matter the size
of the width and how should we do that
well we're gonna use like a sneaky CSS
trick and I'll show you how first thing
we want to do is set this position to
relative
that way we can go in here and say and
after create a pseudo element and with
all pseudo elements before and after you
have to have a content and then you
should just define the display type so
we say it display block and then here's
the trick do you say padding top or
bottom 100% what it does is it it it's
100% of the width of the parent so what
we're really saying is match the width
match the width of the parent with this
this inner element which will add height
to it so let's save and show you right
here so what happened you handsome devil
we have let me pull up my developer
tools not on that developer tools okay
so what we have here is a background
image or the what's called the article
thumb right here and you know it's it's
not exactly a square like we're looking
for but I'll show you why and then we
have the article meta which takes up
about forty four pixels of height and
then we have the after element which is
the exact same width of the X aim exact
same height of the width right so it's
not the after element that's adding that
extra height to make it not a square it
is indeed the article meta so remember
how we made this a position:relative so
let's go to that article meta and make a
vision app salute right now we have a
perfect square because the article meta
being an absolute element is taken out
of the flow of the elements in the DOM
and layout wise and they are they're not
sitting on top of that after that after
element which is 100 percent of the
width its height being 100 percent of it
the width of its parent
so let me now have a grid of four by
three this is 12 I have a cons or
thumbnails for articles that are you
know wonderfully laid out smashing so
let's talk about this
this article Mehta let's make the back
ground actually let's make the
background the same colored here I was
gonna make it pink you know how like
that kind of pink you guys know how I
like background pink okay now we can see
that the that the background the the air
the element itself is squished in that's
because it's that's because its position
absolute absolutely positioned elements
kind of shrink up to their content so to
battle that we got to use these tops
these left's right put them all at zero
bottom and this will just stretch this
out to the parent the nearest parent
that has a position declared which is
relative which is the article thumb
which is declared relative so that's
gonna stretch it out across the hallway
of the ol the hallway the whole way
let's go to the background and say they
- out this is a this is a what's it what
is it it's a sass function you can say
fade out comma and then want to fade it
out start at zero point two I think okay
that means I was gonna tease backwards
is it fading in or now okay so two is
like more opaque that's alright now
let's go to
like this doesn't fit right here needs
to go to the bottom okay now let's go to
the color and make it white white text
okay and you want to add a bit of
padding how about ten mixels okay now
what's cool about having that position
element stretched all over you can add
padding and it just adds padding inside
and you don't have to worry about it
adding extra width because the position
is what's making its dimension not like
a defined bit so we have the article
name and the date cool let's let's look
at these name and we want to just bump
up the font size a little bit to 18
pixels and the date just make it
font-style:italic cool okay great
next let's deal with the kind of the
hovering situation here we don't want
these blue overlays to be there all the
time we want them to be just there on
like hover let's go down to the bottom
here and what's interesting is we don't
really we don't want to be concerned
with hovering over article meta we want
to be concerned with covering hovering
over article some so we'll put that
hover there
and then when you hover over article
thumb let's then target the article meta
as an element and then do things to it
one of the things I wanted to do is fade
in so I'll set the opacity to one and
then also I want to translate it let me
show you a little bit about I don't want
to translate it out so let me go to
article meta here that's not outward and
we'll use a transform and say translate
and then in there we'll just say zero
percent to the left and right and then
100% to the bottom just scoot it all the
way down see now it's pushed all the way
down so down there on the bottom and I
want to poke them up at the top so I
have to go transform zero on hover so
you know how they jump up great let's
put a transition - we can get animate
that all about 300 no 200 milliseconds
and ease in cool I think we can do
better let's add let's add scale to it
and we'll start it like maybe just 50%
and then when we do our thumb we want it
to grow to Sklar SCAL you want to scale
- all the way to 1 so now we have these
little guys and then when you hover over
them they jump kind of up alright and
then remember I put the opacity on let's
put the opacity turn turn it off here
that's cool and now you see how it kind
of like you can still see you outside of
the box when I do this thing in we need
to we need to cut that off from
happening by going to the article thumb
and saying over flow over flow hidden
now it won't happen it'll just look like
it's coming from the bottom of its own
container you guys like that I think
that's quite nice all right there's a
few more things I want to do and then
we'll be done with this part of the hour
so you see these writing writing and
designing articles portion here and the
in the button I want to take that and
kind of Center it because we have all
this height gained from these articles
on a center this this text here so I'm
gonna come down here and find that okay
I want to make another dip I'm gonna
call that a description wrap and indent
these so it'll be inside that the
description wrap is basically just gonna
tie those two elements together because
remember flex when I flex stuff cuz I
want to flip this thing with flex when I
flex stuff it gets like all breaks apart
those columns really well and I want to
keep them together as one kind of unit
that gets centered together so I wrap
them up together but I want to focus on
this column 1 column 1 is the only
column one that's in the section
articles so I'm gonna go to section
articles and just I don't know column 1
and on the hit display flex and also I
want it to be aligned items in the
center there we go now they're in the
center and let's look at this in mobile
see how we're doing here okay so we have
all our articles they're still squares
and looks like our text is hitting too
tightly right here that's fine
that will be that will be in an
immediate query actually so let's go to
make a media query at media max-width
we know that's going to be 640 pixels
and that's gonna be that new element
that we just made called description
wrap when it's small like that I want to
add just some margin margin top yeah
let's say 50 pixels okay
perfect can we go into mobile or desktop
mode at 50 pixels it's gone and it's
floating in the center here's a thing
I'm noticing now that the these Bill
Murray heads we should put would you put
position center put his face there well
that looks weird okay
I want to get rid of these margins on
the top and bottom so let's go to what
is the element called article wrap
article thumb probably right here is a
good spot for article wrap margin will
say negative 50 pixels zero zero here
right oh why is this bottom margin not
getting rid of oh how about because of
the floating that's why so where do we
go float we got to say clear fix that's
what we wanted okay so we've cleared it
now the articles are touching the top
and bottom what happens gonna go into
mobile is it yucky oh okay it's kind of
yucky so we want this to be to 100 to
offset the negative 50 pixels that we
put in there let's check it out now
it works for me in the next section
we're going to be using Jekyll to put in
new thumbnails and are actually an
article loop instead of using these Jade
mix-ins right here and then after that
we'll do a little bit of you know fun
stuff with JavaScript to make it fun all
right so we will see you in the next
video thank you so much for watching
little trap already told us what we're
gonna be doing in the next video that
comes out tomorrow so I'll see you then
in the meantime you might want to check
out the latest vlog episode in which I
document my interview with Google and
that was freaking stressful and maybe
interesting to you maybe you would like
that I don't know I'm just I am is there
also I have a podcast and a mailing list
that you should definitely subscribe to
a lot of people think that those things
are better than these YouTube videos I
think that I'm gonna start ordering
jalapenos on my pizza from now on that's
just a fact
and of course this video would not be
possible without the support and
encouragement of my patrons these
patrons dev tips patrons enjoy really
awesome benefits like being able to join
in live on the new hangout series hosted
by Adam and Matt it's awesome last week
Adam taught us how to get even deeper
into Jay really good stuff but even if
you're not a patron you can still check
out the recordings after they're
completed there's the new playlist on
the depth of channel page on YouTube and
you can check out all the videos there
and join us at patreon.com slash dev
tips okay I'm done talking
I'll see you manana and until then keep
