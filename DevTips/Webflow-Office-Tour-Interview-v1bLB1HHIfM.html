Street in San Francisco we're going to
go inside everybody
look at this I forgot my tripods have to
use a stack of books alright what's up
with the web blow guys want to introduce
yourselves
sure I'm glad I'm the original
co-founder of what was started with my
brother Sergey and our friend Bryant so
I'm bearing on the marking team here
okay cool and what was it like having a
start-up with your with your brother so
my brother and I have an amazing
relationship we actually ran webflow as
an agency before where I was doing the
coding easier than the design okay
he's five years younger that means so we
always had this the brother that's
closest to me I kind of had a
contentious relationship interesting but
Sergey since we're so far apart we just
got along well really and our skills
kind of complement each other Twitter he
would do crazy designs and then I
wouldn't pull out them and kind of
naturally fit into one flow right those
me just saying hey maybe it makes sense
for us to build some software that lets
you do white you know actually put into
practice what you're designing without
relying on me right I could
silifulin let's talk about what would
close and for you guys watching dev tips
you may have seen the video I did with
Ren when I was in Israel and he gave us
a really quick demo of building
something right with your toe I've never
seen had been done it was like in front
of me I was like laughing because it was
gonna I thought it would be sure so tell
us what is web flow and why did you make
it sure
initially so you can think of web flow
as a website builder but when you say
that people immediately think Wieck
Squarespace weekly all of these sort of
consumer a biga template gonna do
something like that it's nothing like
that
so web flow is essentially dev tools
what you've seen a browser when you're
working as a
burn on html/css but on crack like
taking the next level where we have we
essentially create an abstraction layer
over HTML CSS and JavaScript and given
designers that same level of power we've
just made it more approachable via
visual interface so it's the same thing
that you would do as a developer in like
a CSS style sheet or an HTML or Jade
sort of markup file you're just doing it
in a in a different type of environment
so instead of typing you know div class
whatever you're actually dragging a div
in giving it like an HTML tag and then
adding your class has I've been done
before or something like this been done
and nothing we really need from them
with the mental framework when you're
building this where does that come from
that's a good question I don't think
every single attempt at this tried to
abstract it way too far
so will you try to take something like
Photoshop and say are we gonna generate
code right now but that so there have
been many many a sense of that so
Dreamweaver McCaw there's tons of them
like Photoshop itself you can right
click and get some CSS out but the the
mechanics of that are so they don't
match how people develop for the web or
how you develop in production for the
web that usually use the garbage like
you just get something that can maybe be
used to maybe copy like a you know a
complex gradient or a shadow or whatever
we still need to know exactly how to
take that output and put it into some
specific piece of code and the insight
for us was dev tools like we saw so
that's the working model yeah how do
engineers use this palette that I open
up the inspector how do they use that
we're actually manipulate the page right
and the inspector right the huge problem
with the inspector is a you have to
understand exactly where to go to find
out what you're manipulating so you not
only be able to inspect take that
element and go find you know the styles
or properties of that thing
go change it but you also have to know
to take that back to whatever source
file like right so what will is its got
like that additional layer not only do
you like live reload it so immediately
though there's no miko happening except
when you make that change that's a
direct manipulation of the source file
uh-huh you don't have to like go back
somewhere it's for it to reload your a
lot of making that change directly
telling the science of I copied a mother
and the inspector and pavings and my
citizens so it's basically dev tools
with the actual saving when when web
first only started first talking about I
was like tell me exactly kind of
intercepts like yeah what was the kind
of Asian what was the vision and what's
open it's kind of stuck with me as and
when you talked about kind of the
disconnect between traditionally the can
coding and then seeing the actual result
and how web flow is basically just
manipulating and directly seeing results
right away so they're playing a bunch of
connections between the kind of like
creative design aspects and then the
actual you know in our case not hand
coding but the the manipulation of the
page to create which we've designers but
you still have to know the core
principles of the medium that you're
designing for
revelon most design tools we've tried it
just hide this complexity and say you're
just dragging boxes around what that
translates to in dead languages
position:absolute left op you know
everything is completely yeah it has set
with and then that's how people are used
to working in Sketchup Photoshop and
pretty much every other design tool in
web flow we enforce designers to think
like a web developer you have to
understand it like nesting of components
and elements you have to understand that
that CSS classes that you set up will
cascade
eret you have to understand for example
if you're working with flexbox you don't
just like drag it on that's around and
have them stick to a side you have to
think of it here's my place parent or
flex container and my flex items and
here's how I want them to layout and
there's a one-to-one correlation between
some CSS change in an action you taking
alone so what I'm really gathering from
this is like the more you know code the
better you are like understanding the
way the dog works and about y'all CSS is
implemented there's actually better you
are going to be in web flow because
you're directly manipulating those
things as they were those things and not
like move a box here and then it
generates the manager back end so it's
absolutely an advantage to know HTML CSS
up front to understanding what flow but
it's not a direct requirement okay so
learning the principles behind the box
model for example you know if I'm
introducing your sketch I can just say
take this box shape tool interact
something and click on it and move it
but you understand and then put another
copy face the box and move that box
around it doesn't affect this box in web
flow you would say you know dragging two
elements and add a class to one of them
and set the margin and you can see
everything below it moving right just
the principle of that the box model at
the reflow of the page is it as a core
kind of aspect of the medium of the web
and that is pretty easy to understand
much easier to understand then let's say
all the semantics that go to
knowing how to bootstrap grunting
gulping right what everybody a feather
of insomnia yeah I think like my my
story might like coming into using my
floaters like a pretty good indication
of kind of how just using you I
interacted with what those you are I
kind of teaches you the ways to think it
makes you a better kind of thinker in
terms of how you build web pages like my
old job I'd taken some kind of
introductory treehouse is showing so
going through nothing to you know
basically understanding how web pages
built but certainly not doing like
animations in CSS etc etc but my kind of
ability to build web pages however I
want to look has gone from you know in
the slow lane 25 miles an hour to like
it screamed on the highway and and
that's been amazing and like the other
day I was watching some of your videos
about how to do CSS animations and I was
seen like okay iterations infinite or
iterations that one too and I was like
I've never seen that code before but I
knew that there's a checkbox and the
animations and the butler which is like
loop we're not I'm like I see come
exactly right a code that's being
written when I'm manipulating animations
and stuff in web flow so it's like it's
cool to like know I think like if I were
to reinvest time in learning code I'd be
way way further along that was why I
can't finish the course of path right so
this could be an aid to learning is that
what you're saying we've had people
learn to code through web flow and
university programs actually use it as
an introduction to what design okay you
can see the direct
kogas that's generated when you're going
around with what we call up classes but
there we have a slightly higher
abstraction clever style blogs where you
know you assign this class to an element
and then you can see exactly you don't
have to worry about for example putting
the CSS into the right media query
you're almost doing with the states of
that class and when you look at the code
it's exactly what you would write if
your hand coding and that's a that's a
great way for beginners to just have
this direct manipulation of of this
canvas and seeing exactly what the
resulting code would be and a lot of
times you can have like developers go
head-to-head to somebody that you know
knows well over to learn to code through
workflow and somebody who is a
traditional sort of web designer been
doing this for years and sometimes the
web designers that have learned web
whole can go much faster just because
there's this you know you have to jump
back and forth between go much faster
using one flow yeah exactly exactly
where even though they know how to code
that same thing they prefer the web flow
just like same reason people use dev
tools sometimes try to define a shadow
or gradient remember ten million it was
a moment of my last job I was working on
this this box that have all these logos
and I was working with my co-workers who
do you know he's couldn't but he had
just been learning flexbox and we were
kind of pair programming writing
alongside but we kept breaking it and
kept ruining it and then I learned how
to use weapon I was like I was like okay
let's try columns I'm gonna show this
like justify middle okay yeah because I
can just click it right away and have it
be ready understand so the learning the
principles of something like flexbox you
can do a lot quicker and you can see it
that way right on the side would you say
that there's like anything you can do in
code you can do in web flow is that fair
I there's a threshold so when we first
started two three and a half years ago
first launch yeah out of everything you
can do in web design we could do five
percent like we couldn't even do
multiple pages we can do any sort of
ditions our goal right now is to get to
100% parity to what CSS and HTML allows
you to do yeah
and we're among the first to to launch
things like 3d transforms flexbox we're
working on States is great support
already to wear our parity to what you
can do in CSS is one-to-one when you put
some constraints on you know like really
deeply nested CSS selectors usually
because it's bad practice to go down
oh you limit how many yeah we like for
example we don't allow nested classes
unless they're like class and tag based
selectors so inside of like just to
enforce we want to move designers closer
to look at component based thinking in
general CSS where you don't have to
worry about these crazy nested SAS
driven subjects that we have now where
you have to like go all across here yeah
file select fine CSS specificity complex
or whatever but right now there's an
escape hatch like anything that what
people can do you just do a custom hood
so it was a little bit or like you look
like that good but we're working so
we're kind of like at the 80% Margaret
nanowire for for a lot of sites you can
do 100% of what you need to do for that
project but if I was to say you know the
last 10 projects have to work on maybe
20% of them needed something custom and
most of those times those custom things
are like yeah a custom component or
paralyzed or like some crazy thing that
we don't support yet we're constantly
catching up to we're just a year ago
were at 5% now like a year later were
20% now we're at 80% so we're making
like these big leaps towards what
webhost capable of as like a superset of
what CSS allows and the huge thing
working right now is plugins so like
anything that web flow doesn't have will
have an open source plugin ecosystem
that
billed as a react component and just
plugging its waffle and that would be
like fully visual so something that we
don't support it some like crazy widget
slider carousel whatever like anything
they consider enough to what component
space what you can dilute react you
would be able to build as a developer
once and plug that in as a as a plug-in
and then Natalie does that thing that's
awesome luckily getting my next question
is like what's what's on the horizon
that's a huge thing right now plugins oh
because that's that's what makes web
flow completely extensible and the way
that we're architecting the thing is
with future compatibility with
developers in mind not just for
developers to build those plugins but
the way that we're even persisting the
way that we store sites and applications
and workflow like the entire data model
of the dom structure the CSS is abstract
in a way that we can have that this UI
on top of it that can edit it but we can
also write plug-ins to like atom sublime
then that actually know the information
around this like more abstract way of
representing this website or application
and actually sync it back to a code
editor so the designer in it and a
person in a program that could be
anything at the same time in a totally
different interface right the developer
or as adding in class via typing class
name and we can do a lot of enforcement
there like this classes this number and
whatever we have a look some capturing
constraints and somebody who's way more
comfortable and on the design side it's
working on the same exact project in
real time in a visual way that's like
you know maybe my ear plus out but
that's the end result where we see like
the live collaboration around the real
thing not like just facsimile that we
never
okay here's an approximation in a
chopper sketch file and the developers
are doing the actual thing where we see
designers are actually really capable of
coming up with production level
prototypes right that can be like with a
click of a button converted to
production
that's not even a prototype that was
some of the sentiment that I was
gathering from the video that I'd do
with ran people were saying that whiffle
is really great for prototypes and
things like that but you're aiming
towards production parody we are we
already have in many cases like I said
we're catching the after terms of full
full parity we have real production apps
that are taking like half a million
requests a month with what crazy
production traffic and a lot of
different requirements and those things
are running including blood flow built
by one designer somebody who doesn't
know how to code and maintain running
production by a designer which is pretty
crazy to think about it like that was
impossible three years you know so if
you look at our entire Club Center run
by your support team not even designers
that not developers CMS driven Help
Center yeah exactly and our entire time
the marketplace runs off workflow built
by name our product designer mhm
we've had entire companies start like
with non engineering talent right in
production you can have a coder look at
that code and ask who is this built by
it's like it's really different it's so
impressive the things that people really
builds with it like what I always say
it's like if you can design it you can
build it and so we have a channel on our
slack channel it's like we call in the
wild it's just like the latest things
are built that are amazing they're games
like that's incredible
like it's just it's so great to see
but the limitation now is that it's it's
mostly good for read-only things so if
you have something on the user base
system right that's not possible it
might be eventually so you'll be able to
build something like an Airbnb or like a
Twitter you know prototype initially as
a first version but right now it's more
around like these marketing sites
WordPress a little type of sites that
have a lot of time feeding on the
background I would actually say since
most developers work with designers what
a lot of developers are doing is they're
translating the designers intent into
production to write well what's a little
of developers to do is say to designers
don't give me a sketch mock-up that I
have to like write all the code for give
me like a working web flow site or
working web for you why then all I have
to hook up if anything is like some
dynamic aspects or some some user
interaction right but the actual you
know expressing something small like
when I hover over this but now wants to
do some animation how do you explain
that in this case shop rather like
sitting next to the developer and
principle you know yeah what allows
designers to actually do that in the
native environment of the web when it's
the final like css3 format they would
use that a developer yeah yeah and a lot
of times developers don't even know how
to do that kind of stuff like I've been
in web development for 15 years and a
lot of things that our designers have
done with like our 3d transforms feature
mm-hmm in our interaction see why I
would know like I seriously I see web
flow has kind of like 3d animation
software right 20 years ago people had
to understand vertex math nerves not
even for rational b-splines like these
technical people had to do animation
and then we created an abstraction layer
of my 3d studio max we're now a creative
people they still have to understand
like all these constraints of how to
build ringing systems and have it but
all this stuff is visual like they don't
worry about how's the hair going to flow
they should have a hair system mm-hmm so
we've created these visual abstractions
to to help people harness the power of
that medium we're doing the same thing
with what flow where we're taking all
the everything that's possible in the
web in our idea is to be like the X code
of web development where designers go in
and create what they imagined and then
maybe there's a little bit of hook up to
like real databases relatives or
whatever but it's very close to the real
thing it's not the real final thing
that's awesome thank you guys so much
for this time to explain to us what we
got going on here I'm excited to jump in
and try my hand at your table I've never
used it before so it's gonna be like a
fun partnership slash exploration for me
yeah yeah so take a you know keep tuned
for the next few videos where I'm going
to be using the web flow tool to build
stuff for myself but I want to see a lot
of living and we'll see you guys in the
next video keep on hacking thank you so
much thank you thanks for coming back
all right videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
