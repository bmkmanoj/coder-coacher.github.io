we're talking about submit stuff that's
really wacky I'm gonna teach you two
things that you probably have already
seen and experienced every day and but
never thought about it and how kind of
weird and wacky it is the first thing I
want to show you is something that you
probably see all the time and when you
look at the markup we see that we have a
body here and there's nothing in it and
it's just a big body here and nothing's
in it okay let me throw of body and
background purple and save oh my
goodness that is so weird do you see
what happened that's just so weird you
don't understand why well let me tell
you why it's weird because this whole
viewable area turned purple but look how
big the body is that body is zero pixels
tall literally there is no body to be
seen here it doesn't exist it's zero
pixels tall it should not be displaying
anything any any other element on the
page you put a background color on it it
won't I mean the background color will
stay contained within the container that
it's declared and right you have a div
background orange would you expect it
weren't to spread outside of the div not
at all so this is what's really weird
about the background let me let me
illustrate the point further and say
border two pixels dash and orange orange
particular and what that is weird right
if I actually write something in the
body you can see that is that the body
is just wrapping the content the body
folds up just like any other was it
called like block element right but the
background goes outside of the bodies
container which is really really weird
and that includes background images and
gradients and all that kind of stuff so
I just want to point that out to you the
second one I want to put out to you
is this you know you're ruining misdial
my cool Ninja Turtle website so I have a
title here called Ninja Turtles rule and
this website is all about ninja turtles
and I want to actually use this title as
a header if you look at the title the
head actually has a display:none
property on that's weird and the title
does also and these are the user-agent
style sheet something like which that
means like in the default style of most
every browser on the same muscle don't
know for sure excel use every browser
but the default browser for every the
default style for every browser that
i've ever come in contact with is to
default the title and the head to be
display:none so we're gonna override
that just a head and title display:block
oh man it's so exciting font size is a
200 pixels color green and space but
look at this this is cool there's no
content in my body
there's just the title that I'm
displaying here and you can do all kinds
of cool things with the title man look
at this
title I'm used to sass okay title don't
be like background pink and be like
position:absolute
zero pixels left zero pixels and pixels
where's this whoa weirdos in two hundred
that would be weird oh my gosh the title
is on the bottom of my website there's
like a kind of a sticky footer
that's so weird and text-align:center
don't say padding 20 pics and bump of
that font size by 30 that's weird right
that's the title of the website and it's
like other weird pink sticky footer on
there that's all we have for today I
really appreciate you guys watching
these videos and leaving your comments
makes me feel super one-foot but also I
feel like there's some really cool
comments people will say that I'm
helping them you know do better in
school or be prepared to enter the job
market or even to like brush up on some
skills that they've always wanted to
learn down so it like really gets me
going I'm get really pumped about that
anyway keep on commenting keep on loving
ask more questions if you want to know
some more things and I'll think of some
cool things more applicable things to
share with you next week I have some
really big plans for next week today
this week I'm actually on vacation and I
record this like last week if you can't
tell I don't know how you could tell but
because time traveling alright but gives
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
