that one of my new year's resolutions
was to just have fun and what's more fun
than a new Star Wars movie huh
well a happiest illustration here I
found it on dribble by an artist named
justice Scalla berta they'll be linked
to his art in the video description I'm
gonna recreate this illustration and
animate it using HTML and CSS so on the
top left here I have two document setup
I'm using Jade and sass to compile the
HTML and CSS and I'll have a link in the
video description to a code pin so you
guys can see exactly how this all works
together and try to make it better if
you want sure mine's not perfect and
over here on the right we have an art
board this will render out our progress
of HTML and CSS as we save so this video
is gonna be heavily sped up so hold on
to your butts
I start by blocking out the HTML I
create a container with a class of bb-8
this will be the anchor that every part
of the illustration hangs on inside that
I block out the body the head and even
things that hang outside of our little
Droid you know like the sparkles and the
ground and things like that
next I'm using the color picker and the
chrome dev tools to select the colors
from the original illustration and then
store them up there in sass variables at
the top of the document now you see that
pink box there that's the BBA class the
circle inside is the bb-8 - body class
element notice that the body is taking
up 100% of the space of the parent but
later on elements like the head and the
sparkles will hang outside of the parent
the bb-8 class element
I used the bb-8 - body to overflow hide
the elements inside of it
these large orange circles and other
things to mask them to get a nice round
shape with the details in it I'm not too
worried about accuracy here I'm just
eyeballing the shapes inside I want to
capture the emotion and not necessarily
the specs of the illustration
I create this pink overlay here just so
I can see what I'm working with but I
need an invisible element to cast a box
shadow that I could use to add to that
you know shadow tint there under the
Droid now I do the same for the head
here the pink box will be just an
invisible container now there's two
parts to the head the dome at the top
here and the kind of trapezoid below it
the bottom part is the most difficult
part of the whole illustration actually
it's made up of three parts and each
part will have a blue box and a dark
blue bottom border as you can see I'm
having a bit of a time you know making
them all fit nicely but we get there
after I finally get those bottom pieces
together I go back and craft the lens
the sheen of the lens is created by
using the pseudo elements before and
after and they are turned into lighter
blue boxes rotated and overflow:hidden
inside of the lens they create that
little shine on the lens I think that
this little freckle here is what makes
bb-8 so adorable
it's that asymmetrical anthropomorphize
little you know blemish that really
makes him have a personality
now that invisible box that was pink at
one point is now rotated and positioned
all of the head parts are attached to it
so they kind of move as one unit think
of them as you know like a group the
next group is the speed lines they're
all styled the same and then individual
classes of 1 2 3 and so on are used to
position and determine the lengths an
additional class called
tail creates that line that has that
little gap in it
excess the sparkles are very similar to
the speed lines there is one general
style and then additional classes are
created to modify the size and color and
then each Sparkle gets its own position
the T is part here is placing sixteen
sparkles using XY coordinates I make the
task a little easier by using the nudge
and the dev tools and then copying back
those values but
this took forever keep in mind that this
video is sped up like 20x ok same thing
with the ground one style and then they
get overrides for position and wit
little bumps here created by cropping a
circle with a border and placing it
inside each ground piece
CSS animation is really fun make
keyframes that say it starts at 360
degrees rotated and ends at one and then
it just repeats infinitely that's how we
get that spin yeah looks fun there's one
problem our shadow is spinning shadows
don't spin and let's like you know the
Sun is spinning I don't know how many
Suns there are or how fast they spin on
Daku but you know we should really fix
this so I comment out the animation and
then move that invisible shadowing
element outside of the body but now it's
not cropped so I need to go and redo
that mmm looks like a little visual
glitch here the shadow is only kind or
getting crop hmm I'm not concerned
though maybe it looks like a little you
know bb-8 is kicking up a little dust or
something as he rolls around
I make a new keyframe called pulse I
want these sparkles to shine hmm it's
not very twinkly the more like a
bouncing their heads to beat or
something there we go make that
transition a bit less jarring by peeking
out the animation at 90 percent I run a
few modifier classes basically changing
the delay so they pulse at different
times and there we go
I feel like bb-8 is moving along but the
ground is stationary so let's animate
those bumps here
and done okay
bb-8 is definitely the most adorable
droid in the galaxy but okay so we're
done with our CSS illustration here of
being a remember you can use the link in
the description of the video to check
out the code for yourself it's on code
pen there for you thank you so much for
