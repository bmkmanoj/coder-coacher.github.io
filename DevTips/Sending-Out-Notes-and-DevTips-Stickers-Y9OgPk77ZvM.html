everybody this is a video that is a
thank you video to all the people who
signed up after last week's video to
learn more about the community when it
launches I have some devs tip stickers
here 40 guys and I got some pieces of
paper we're going to be doing a note
making tonight something I promised that
I would send you a sticker and a
personal note for the first hundred
people who signed up and if you lived in
the continental United States and
sending you a postage in the mail was
reasonable I gotta say that I feel
really bad about all the people who
don't get one and sorry I wish there was
something more I could do for you guys
but my means are limited and I'm not
able to send out send out these these
perks to two people if you're not in the
United States there's just too many and
I don't have the overhead right now
anyway that's the sad news the happy
news is that you guys can watch me make
these notes out and and then we can
hopefully get some feedback when they
they arrived to your mailbox with a you
arrive to your nail mailbox and put a
hashtag of dev tips treats on it and
send the picture to me in the twitter
with hashtag dev tips treats or just
tweet directly to me and I want to see
what you guys do with with your stickers

if you're on that list and also thank
you for filling out the other questions
like the ideas of what you would like to
see in the dev q-tips community and how
you hope it will benefit your life I'm
really confident that the things that I
have planned will be a big benefit to
you I'm very excited to launch this
community and looking through your
answers I think that my ideas and my
plans are very much in line what you
guys are hoping to get out of the dev
tips community too I don't want to spoil
too much but I am running a small beta
of the community and I'm just blown away
with the activity that's going on inside
of it the people in the dev tips
community shout out to you guys right
now they're they're building a nap
together right now as we speak there
it's like managed and contributed by
every but I'm not even a part of it I'm
just watching it and I'm like oh my gosh
I can't even believe this but it's
really cool in the app that they're
gonna launch is going to be pretty sweet
