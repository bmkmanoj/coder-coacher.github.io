another episode of depth ha all right
now that I got your attention let's look
at our Trello board and see what we got
next for today's video
Trello says make the header responsive I
was so excited to this today is the
video I wanted to do for a very long
time I haven't like really found a good
like rhythm for it and it's like go back
and fix something that I you know messed
up in the start which is this make the
header responsive let me show you what I
mean by that
this is what we got right now crash it
looks like a like a train wreck right
here and also right here this word is
rapping and let me show you another
thing if I do what is called an
emulation right if I turn on the
emulator and I'm looking at iPhone 5 so
it's 320 pixels wide you see how this is
a problem the text is too large to even
wrap one word and what's happening is
it's going off the canvas and creating
this width that that it doesn't know
what to do is you can scroll
horizontally and that's just for a
responsive design that's like a big
no-no that's really really bad and I'm
embarrassed that we've gone this long
without fixing this yet but today is the
day I'm so excited for that let's just
jump right in
yeah the thing that we're going to do to
fix this is just write a few media
queries and we're going to go into our
header dots ass down to the bottom and
create a few new lines at media max
width and we'll say about 640 pixels all
right now in the max width we want to
say the first thing we want to do when
we actually let's just bring this in so
we can talk about what we want to do now
I set my media query at 640 pixels so
this should to take effect right here
the first thing I want to do is want to
move this logo away from the left side
and put it kind of straight in the
center it's on a mobile device I want it
to be in the center and then below that
be the navigation so what we're going to
do is say a media query header and then
up here I say
and background position this is what it
is so let's grab what it is and then
talk about I want to change it so this
is 30 from the left and 20 from the top
and I want it to be 50% from the left
and 20 pixels still from the top let's
save and refresh exactly what we wanted
okay now I have to move this navigation
below it in kind of Center as well
that's right now it's floating off to
the right okay hmm
so the nav let's first of all actually
let's put that under the header so I
think it is up here and we need to be a
little bit
Yesi nav header so it needs to be nav
okay so let's make a new item called nav
let's move it in a little bit actually
right there so now it's it's a child of
the header cause up here I say it's a
child of the header and in order for the
media query to take place it needs to be
more specific right
using specificity CSS specificity let's
see now if you need to be flow to none
all right refresh okay hmm so float:none
reveals a few things about this first of
all we were only ever using margin
instead of padding so let's go back up
to our nav here instead of saying margin
30 3000 let's say padding 30 0 30 3000
all right now that's better sometimes
when you have like margins can break out
of the box model but padding's will keep
things nice and tie the way you thought
it would if you ever have this kind of
thing where you're like margins are
going outside of its parent just change
that to padding that will get you what
you want right away now we're no longer
floating left but let's make this
navigation it is a block element let's
say on the inside should be text line
a Center good looks good it's good okay
now for those padding's I'm petting a
top let's say 80 mm-hmm I like it maybe
ninety ten more pixels okay now you see
what's happening now because it's no
longer floated to the left the
navigation is actually affecting that
title box that's below it right with h1
so what we have to do is to get rid of
this we have this enormous margin on the
h1 or a zero here we have a padding top
100 I just turn that off let's see what
we got
that's what we want to do a turn the
padding top off padding top off h1
padding top zero pixels
okay so let's stretch this out looks
good there pull it in looks good there
great great now you see how this um this
header is a fixed height it's 400 in
something from 50 pixels just get rid of
that that way the height the height of
the header can be dynamic is if you have
if you want to put something taller in
it will just grow and that's really what
we want so let's refresh and it's got
it's gotten kind of bumped up so we need
to add padding on to that last sentence
or maybe on to the bottom of the header
yeah that's probably a good idea header
position
padding-bottom fifty pixels the 50 or
100 what do you guys think 50 is pretty
good close that down so now that the
header size the height of it is dynamic
based on what is it based on the the
content that's in it so if this line
this artist theme line breaks becomes
taller so does our header now that's
going to be really good if you guys have
different lengths of names where you put
multiple words in there or something
like that so that's pretty good the
navigation is working but it's like in
line a little bit let's put this in
another emulation mode turn on that okay
now it look it's looking pretty good but
no matter what I mean you see how this
this title is still going off it's just
it's just it's one line I mean if you
have a longer name than artist then this
is going to be a problem on a phone no
matter what all right now this would be
no problem if you wanted to title your
site Jeff now you're good Jeff is in in
the money business right now but when
we're doing something called artist
theme or if you're doing like the name
of your company or or your full name or
something like that then this is going
to be a problem but there is a really
awesome solution that I'll show you
right now we're going to use a jquery
plugin called fit text and fit text is
created by trent dave and regan of
Paravel and they also have another one
called lettering jeaious but anyway so
fit text is a really awesome jquery
plugin it's really simple and what it
does is it just it just kind of expands
and contracts this the font size of the
text you pointed at so that it can work
well in any kind of space might work
well in any kind of container that it's
in so let's go to github and i don't
even need to download it it's so small
that'll just go to jQuery dot fit text
and I'll just copy it it's super small
and then I'll go to my JavaScript
functions
throw it in at the bottom as is and then
I'll go up to my my document ready dr.
declaration and use this line right here
BAM okay so this will be dollar instead
of jQuery and the font okay so the max
font size is that there's a maximum with
all allow it to grow and the min font
size is the smallest it will grow but
inside there it will stretch in and grow
depending on this on the area available
to it so let's go to header and see what
our natural size should be 72 72 pixels
copy that and put it as the max font
size and then of course this is not
going to be responsive headline ID it's
going to be where's it going to be it's
going to be header h1 save alright now
when we go into our header h1 there it
is it shrunk down right to the space
that it should be and let's take this
emulator off all right now it's the
maximum is going to be is that 72 that
we programmed it as initially but it
will shrink now see that it gets smaller
with your window that is so rad because
when you put it on a phone look at that
looks great doesn't it and everything
it's not going to scroll wide like like
you know like it used to
I mean let me zoom in on that for you
guys look how great that looks right
it's just it's perfectly sized for the
phone for any just any container that
it's and it's going to look great okay
so that concludes our video today it's
just a really quick one but I wanted to
clean up a lot of stuff in the header
it's really important to me that it
looks really nice right the first time
the page loads and so you can get that
like first impression points for sure
and also that gets us one step closer to
our last video of this series in which
we're going to talk about hosting and
that's next week tune in Monday we'll
see you guys there keep on hacking and
