Nilson and this is dev tips a YouTube
channel where we look at web design and
development and today we're starting a
new series called the what is called CSS
animation series now the way this series
breaks down is we're going to have two
principal episodes and by principle I
mean we're going to be talking about the
the functionality syntax the ideas
behind making this all work what are the
principles involved in making the
animations in CSS happen and then after
that we're going to have a few episodes
more practical episodes and in those
episodes I'm going to go over like the
things that you should be animating
because there are some things that don't
need to be animated that I see animated
a lot and I want to go over and give you
some good recommendations and show you
practical examples of what and how and
why you should be animating certain
things and not other things but that
will come later and I don't know how
many of those will be it'll just be like
a continue to do them until I'm bored of
them kind of situation but this is the
first of the two principled episodes but
before we go into the how of CSS
animation I want to go into the what am
I talking about when I say CSS animation
or animation on the web
okay so animation kind of breaks down
into these these two ideas the first
idea is to just to give something life
right you'd like dr. Frankenstein has
this monster and gives it life he
animates it right the second one is what
we really want to be looking at today is
to give something the appearance of
having movement and the key here is is
really movement okay so in CSS there are
two main ways that we move things around
the page the first one is what we're
this video today is going to be covering
it's the transition property this is the
how we animate with CSS the first one is
using the transition property the second
one is by using the animation property
and you have to couple that with the
this other idea called keyframes and
we're going to get into that in next
week's video or the next video that I
create but right now we're going to be
looking at the transition property and
then after both of these two like I
mentioned early
here we're gonna have a few videos that
are planned and they're gonna be talking
about you know the elements that you
should be animating and we're going to
take a little bit more of a UX stance on
that what you should animate because
it's good for the user and what you
should not animate because it's
ridiculous and dumb sound fun okay on to
the first episode today we're going to
be talking about the transition property
and this is part one of the CSS
animation series so let's let's first
take a look at how it's written what's
the syntax of transitions in CSS how do
we write them let's break them down like
this we declare this transition on an
element and the element that we - the
blue right there the element in this
case that's a class called element the
thing that we call this transition on
will be the thing that's going to be
transitioned or the thing that's going
to move okay and how we write that is
there's a few parameters there's a few
values for the property of transition
the first value of the property is the
other property that's going to animate
and that'll make make sense in a second
the second one is duration how long is
this transition happening and the third
one there is he is I say ease because
timing function didn't kind of fit in
the line I wanted to keep it on one line
but you can think of it as timing
function or ease basically this is the
how how is that transition distributed
across time is it ease in out ease in
you could even use things like cubic
Bezier or steps with transition so it's
pretty cool and then the last one is
delay how long should this wait before
the animation or in this case the
transition starts happening okay you
would write it out something like this
here's an example of how this would be
written transition opacity not and the
first the green there is the property of
the element that we're animating so if
there's a bunch of element properties
like height and width and color all
those things will not get transitioned
only opacity you could even write the
keyword instead of writing opacity in
green you could write all that means
everything will get this same transition
okay after transition you're right the
orange which is time so transition the
opacity over
300 milliseconds and use a timing
function of ease in out but wait until
after one second has passed before this
transition starts does that make sense
this is this is the formula for how
we're going to write transitions this is
the syntax and you can actually add more
than one transitions onto any given
element if you just wear that semicolon
is right there just change that for a
comma and then repeat the green orange
pink and blue and then end with the
semicolon right so you can have you can
transition different properties so like
if this is a pay city and we wanted to
also and transition the background color
you would write this again but the green
would say background color right I hope
that explains itself so that is the
syntax of CSS transitions and you notice
that in this example opacity is the
property so let's talk about properties
what can we animate and what can we not
animate because there are some things
that just don't make sense to be
animated right or they're just not even
able to be animated so animatable
properties okay things like font size
background color I have listed here
width and like left which is how far
from the left something is positioned
these things would make sense obviously
if you change the value of these
properties that some kind of visual
change would happen if you if you change
the font size from 14 pixels to 28
pixels you can see that there's going to
be an animation that happens there there
there's there is distinct traversal of
the values that can happen width from 28
pixels to 100 pixels wide you could see
that thing growing all right background
color you can see the color changing
those things are animatable properties
and this list of four is not all of them
there's like you know actually there is
a list of all of them and I'll link to
that in the description below but
basically you just think of it as
anything that you can imagine changing
you can most likely animate it okay here
are some things you cannot animate just
just as an example to help you
understand the difference right so we
have display
can you imagine something visually
changing from display:block
inline-block what would that look like
right
can you imagine visually something
changing position relative to absolute
you could see that there's a difference
in the way it will display but how would
you transition from from relative to
absolute you can't do that right you
can't you can't animate the font family
from Helvetica to - I was going to say
Arial but you kind of can do that now
Helvetica Helvetica - you know Georgia
or something you can't like animate the
characters it just it just doesn't work
you have to switch them out there's no
animation that can happen there right so
a lot of properties are animatable and
some are not and that's just what I want
to explain here now when you're
considering animatable properties you
have to consider what animate what
properties are the best properties to
animate in other words performance or I
have to consider performance because
animation takes a lot of work to do
we're moving things around on the screen
we're making things go whiz and bang and
are we animating the right thing right
and some and there's there's going to be
a some links down below some references
that you can read on why some things are
better than others to animate but here's
here's the general rule okay the most
performant things to animate our
position scale rotation and opacity
notice those first ones their position
scale and rotation those are all in the
transform you know property so it's kind
of just like transform and opacity you
so you would say like we're position I'm
not talking about position left I'm
talking about translate right translate
this X&amp;amp;Y so these four things are the
most performant things to translate and
I have a quote right here from Paul
Lewis and Irish who wrote an article
together on html5 rocks comm and they're
talking about these four properties and
the quote says here if you animate
anything else other than these four it's
at your own risk and the chances are
that you're not going to have that silky
smooth 60 frames per sec
animation and that's what we were
talking about in when we're talking
about performance like the most
performant things to animate our you
know transforms and opacity other than
that you might dip below sixty frames
per second and there's a lot of reasons
for that an article is very good so I
recommend you go read that there is a
link in the description and just to
summarize that these things do not cause
a repaint of the elements and they do
not also cause a reflow of the layout
which are very costly in terms of
browser rendering these things transform
and opacity will just basically change
the element they're targeting on which
is a lot more proficient in terms of in
terms of browser performance okay so now
that we have that out of the way we know
we know how to transform something and
we know what we should be transforming
let's talk about triggering how do you
do you trigger a transform in other
words how do you make one happen okay
it's not that hard there's a lot of
different ways
but the main two that you want to cover
is by having the hover pseudo-class you
hover over something and it it
transitions and you know that could be
either itself or a child of itself and
I'll show you how that works this the
second one is a class change so
something has is a normal element and
then you switch a class but that class
has the command or the style of it to
transform translate transition so that
all these trends transfer point
transition it so the news the new class
has the style of transition on it and
I'll just kind of like move it around
based on the new class and when you take
that class off it moves back right so
this is what this is a great way to do a
few things like menus or dropdowns and
things like that we'll talk about those
in a second that's it that's all the
talking that we're going to be doing now
let's jump into some code and you know
roll up your sleeves and get Cody here
we are in the code and it's a very very
simple code just to start out with we
have the famous pink box the pink box
that we learned almost everything on I
love a pink box for some reason
um okay and we're using Jade which
translates to HTML so you see like I've
clicked the view compiled it's actually
just a div with a class of box but I
just get a write box because I like Jade
and if you like Jade or you don't know
what Jade is check out the you know do
you even Jade bro video and understand
what the heck that is and then for our
CSS we're using sass it compiles down to
normal CSS so if you don't like Jade if
you don't like sass that's okay normal
HTML and CSS works for all of this stuff
and this is a code pen so you can visit
the visit this code pen later I'll have
a link for that code pen in the
description and just like you compiled
so you can understand the HTML and CSS
if you have a problem with that but I
don't care enough to do it for you
just saying so we have a pink box here
we have one HTML element called box we
have a body which has 50% there are 50
pixels of padding and I don't know why
we have a font color on that body and
then we have a box which is an inline
block background pink and a height and
width of 200 pixels super basic okay now
what we going to do is we're going to
transform this box so transform and
we'll just say translate translate means
move let's say translate it 200 pixels
that way and then 150 pixels that ways
so we're moving it to the right and down
and that's that's all fair let's rotate
it a little bit let's rotate it like 20
degrees okay now we see that we've just
moved it and moved it down but there was
no transition it's just just it just
snapped right where it should be right
so let's talk about this transition
property will write the transition let's
get rid of our JavaScript move this up
here and so to transition them to get
that to animate down we have to write a
transition and what do we want this
transition to be remembering back to our
syntax will say transform is the
property that we want to transition and
how long should it take let's say 300
milliseconds which is just a good
Goodspeed for your eyes to understand
what's happening and what's the next one
the the timing function let's use the
classic ease in out one of my favorites
it's easy to do and it looks good and
then the delay we only don't want to put
a delay on there okay so I've saved it
what has happened nothing has happened
why is nothing happened well because the
the origination of the of the animation
is never like it's already there right
so one way that you can really easily
understand how something will transition
is take that take the property that
we're trying to transition and just
quickly comment it out now we can see
that there's some movement happening
right pop-up okay so now there's no
transform declared so all of those you
know values of transformed the translate
and the rotate are kind of zeroed out
but when we quickly add them the
transition will say oh I'm looking at
transform let's do this let's take let's
take 300 milliseconds and ease it in a
certain way for that transition to
happen right pretty simple the next step
to understand and use these things is to
realize that the the user is not going
to be editing your CSS we can't expect
them to come in here and comment and
uncomment your code right so what we're
going to do is we're going to take this
and and put the responsibility of
triggering off into a hover
so box let's say box hover there you go
that's how you write that and then in
the hover we want to put this transform
LX cut that and paste that here okay so
notice that the transition is always on
the box I you get this confused when I
first started like where do I put the
transition on the hover because I want
it to hover no no you put the
destination of the style on the hover
and the transition is always on the Box
looking for a change in this property
when that when the hover happens it says
oh here's a change in this property
let's do it over time which is that
right did you get all that okay so let's
hover over this and we'll see that this
transform will happen when we hover BAM
see that all right you see this little
jittering here that's a problem because
what's what's happening is that our
target in other words the box with the
pseudo selector of hover is that is the
target and it is actually moving around
so this makes it pretty hard and if you
hurt like you know well I mean imagine
that you're a user you're trying to
hover over the pink box and it's like
flying around you're like wait wait like
it's follow down here okay follow what
so what we're going to do to combat this
problem is actually offload the hover
onto another element so let me show you
what I mean I'm going to go up here and
say trigger this is going to be my
triggering element I'm going to put box
as a child in that so let me show you
how that renders the box is a child of
trigger all right and then I'm going to
go in here let's style the trigger up a
little bit
trigger it'll be the same size with 200
pixels height 200 pixels border 20
pixels solid and we'll say 99 and then
background is going to be a goal DDD
okay we have this trigger element that's
around the box element and I'm going to
offload this hovers right now it's still
hovering in the box until of this this
this jittery problem I'm going to
offload the hover to trigger and I'm not
going to transform trigger right I'm not
going to do that that's not what I want
to still the same problem look legit
ring what I'm going to do is I'm going
to say when trigger is hovered then take
box the child of trigger and transform
that like that now it's really clear
that this is the trigger and then the
box over here is the child that's being
animated and one interesting effect of
this is that if you hover over a box
we're going to have obviously I'm sorry
if you hover over trigger
obviously we have it triggering but if
you hover over box as well which is a
child of trigger it's still triggered so
one way to overcome that is you could
say go to box here and say um what is it
it's pointer events none
now what pointer events does is it says
don't register any hovers or clicks on
this element it's just an element that
you cannot interact with you can just
see it so when I hover over the trigger
obviously it's it's moving but when I
move that hover onto the box it doesn't
recognize any hovers or clicks on it so
when we're going up there this this guy
right here pointer events is super
helpful when you're using um like
JavaScript or something later when you
need to interact with things and make
sure some things don't trigger something
so remember pointer events it's a big
one when I'm going to realize what that
thing was when I learned pointer events
I was like ah this is amazing why don't
people talk about this thing more it's
kind of like this we don't talk about it
but it's so powerful all right anyway
pointer events none so that's hovering
that's the first part of this practical
exercise that's what we're going to show
you there what I want to do now is show
you how to do this same thing but with
with classes okay so I'm going to pull
up some JavaScript here and I'm going to
say okay I'm going to target the trigger
and use on click so when I click it
something's going to happen the thing
that's going to happen is this o is this
function okay so this function here
we're going to say grab the trigger that
you that you found or the thing you
clicked on which is well we use the
keyword of this and just say just say
you know toggle a class toggle class of
anything clicked
and so you know taro class means that if
clicked is on it then remove it if it's
not there put it on so when you when you
click on the trigger it'll get a class
of clicked so instead of saying trigger
hover we want to say trigger with a
class of clicked is what we're going to
do so let's click E and it moves now
this will stay when we're moving around
which is the nice thing of having
JavaScript add classes you don't need to
rely on a hover and you can click it and
it'll go back right because we're just
toggling that class and that class of
clicked is what triggers this transform
right that's that's what says we need to
we needed to be having a different type
of transform and because there's a
transition already on it looking at for
transform changes it will do a change
got it so one thing I want to show you
more just is kind of like a little bonus
and this is not necessarily related to
how you trigger an animation but it is
fun to think about this box here has
obviously this animation on it and the
the timing function is ease in out and
this will work for anything that you use
timing functions on but chrome has this
really great pop-up window that kind of
shows you the thing over time you see
where this animation is more dense over
here and sparser in the middle and more
dense that's because this curve here
shows you over time that we're spending
more time and then we're going up
quickly and spending more time at the
end that's why it's like a softer
transition right you can have different
different things where it's more dense
in the beginning so we softened and have
a hard ending right there's a lot of
different kind of curves that you can
use and they all have keywords right in
quadratic out sign things like that you
can also take these little hand handles
and move them around yourself which is
cool so like see how it gets like a
little pause in the middle
mmm something like this
OOP there's like a little stutter I
wouldn't recommend that one but you put
at the point is you can design these uh
these um these timing curves yourself
these are called a cubic Bezier in this
code
it's given right here is actually
something you can copy and paste into
your own code I'm going to make this
custom cubic busy a a little a little
more bouncy and if I take this top point
and move it over we'll see how its 1.97
if it's over one that means it's outside
of the box that's why it's kind of like
clipping here in the in the display but
what that does is it gives us this
really kind of bouncy so let me I'm
going to copy that
take it back over to my code and replace
the ease in out with this bouncy cubic
Bezier let's move it over so you can see
the whole thing in line okay close and
see how it bounces bonk bonk bonk that's
because my cubic Bezier is doing that
I'm not putting like you know I'm not
doing anything special other than saying
like make your busy a whale weird curve
in this 1.97
will make it go like over overshoot
where it should be so you can use cubic
Bezier to give your animations these
weird like you know flourishes or like
kind of a life that that it would not
otherwise have it have if you were using
a keyword and also I can't remember
where I heard this but I believe that a
cubic Bezier is more performant than
using a keyword like ease in or easing
out or is easy in sine or something like
that right so that's all I wanted to
show you with actually one more thing
one more thing triggering is important
because you need to realize how to enact
your Trent your animations so I want to
show you one thing one more thing that
that you might think would work but does
not work with the transition property
okay so let's go back and put this
transform in box okay so we already seen
that the only way now to get it to
transform is to is to remove the
property but from the CSS and not I'm
going to remove box from the trigger
element and then in here I'll say not
this not toggle the class but append
append a div with a class
of box okay so what this is doing i'm
using javascript to insert an element in
the document inside of trigger with the
class of box now question what do you
think will happen do you think that the
pink box will show up where it should be
in then animate to where you would like
it to be or do you think it would just
show up in the ending State well let's
do a little click and figure it out it
ended in the ending State now it
shouldn't be all that surprising because
we already have the transform already
declared a transition happens when
there's a change in something so when
the box shows up and it just is already
transformed if there's no change so you
can do this a few times there's all
these these boxes that got added to your
document object but they don't get an
animation now this is this is the reason
I'm bringing this up I mean you're going
to be like duh Travis why would you even
brings up the reason I'm bringing this
up is because there is a difference
between transition which we're looking
at in this video in animation the CSS
property which we're looking at in next
week's video okay so next week tune in
and I'm looking at the animation
property and it's going to be part two
of the CSS animation series okay and
