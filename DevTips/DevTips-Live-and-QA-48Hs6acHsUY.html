don't speak english year i had to teach
myself through movies and music and
things like that Wow life as a here we
just speak Arabic and French you know we
they teaching us French it's something
like there is Jade which is English and
there is HTML which is French latissimus
all stop wait are you saying that you're
htmls in French no no he's comparing the
two languages oh okay I was like I was
like but over here we write HTML in
French I was like that's new i did not
know that these new programming language
in arabic really yes they're cold I
don't know is it written from right to
left yes oh okay yep excellent moroccan
arabic not therapy I'm just I'm just
really curious if you like you use
monospaced fonts like they have mono
space like because my English because
it's not so good you know oh yeah no
worries no worries it's pretty good oh I
just I just found to get for the rabbit
programming ah cool yeah okay i'm
linking it sure is there is something i
would like to ask yeah hit a man what's
a video about color theories theories
yeah like when you're trying to design
something what colors you can use mm
that's interesting that's an interesting
topic I'm not too great at it but I do
have a textbook on color theory and just
just quickly one of the things that
always blows my mind is that you know
people are always like does white I'm
sorry I messed that one up does red and
green and blue um make white or you know
like what do you get when you add all
the colors too
the other is it black or white well it
depends on the you know the color the
color system you're using right like an
additive color scale like your screen
it's all going to be white coming
through but a like a subtractive color
scale like like print right CMYK is all
going to be together and be black it's
really interesting I've been i learned
that was like we got a new joiner joiner
joiner darko joiner join el derecho
what's up man do you have a video yep
wrong hey how are you I'm fine good what
are you joining us from from Estonia
what's that macedonia your own macedonia
a nice wow such a big world i like
sometimes like what I meet you guys on
these live channels or like in the
comments and stuff I'm just like so
surprised that the dev tips goes further
than my garage it's crazy I'm sure yeah
cool so um I wanted to ask you guys for
some ideas for the upcoming videos um if
you have any I'd like to to take those
you have a theory already because what
there's just like so many you know like
when you start you're like oh yeah I'll
make a few videos about HTML and then
we'll be done and then you like to roll
into this and just it's just grows there
is something about about sometimes when
I design something after I seen its some
couple times I hate my design yeah yep
there there's no way around that that's
just terrific oh that's good though
because it means you're probably getting
better so you look back at the old
things and and you see how you weren't
good but you're getting to you know
you're becoming good mm-hmm the the only
thing that you can do is don't give up
because what will happen is you'll start
to get really frustrated and that's a
great opportunity to say like okay I'm
not I don't want to do this but if you
can
something that yeah you'll start talking
against yourself you'll start like being
downright but if you can work through
that frustration that's when the magic
happens that's when a good designer is
born one of the major reasons of keeping
on designing was your channel so I want
to thank you about that yeah oh I'm glad
that I could be a part of if your your
journey man that's really great thanks
mmm any other questions or suggestions
for videos I have a Paris to you but
Burger or you're like one thing I've
been wondering like when which of your
videos I kind of knew into designing a
neural programming but i'm thinking like
are you like SAS like only it's like oh
really like trying something else after
the SAS it's like over with your sass
assassinated yes the first like I didn't
even know like I've maybe like five
percent of CSS but I jumped in the first
thing I did was jumping into something
more easily read and that was stylist
for example or a stylist I really liked
but then I saw your videos about sat
sounds like Oh scrap that I'm going to
SAS now because you were like particular
about the same thing here how what do
you think about other like preprocessors
like stylist and other yeah that's a
great question I think that they're all
great and I don't have a strong
preference other than I I know SAS
better and there's more around there
like about it you know what I mean like
I can find more articles and more
interesting tricks about SAS than I can
about less or stylus although i have
used both the other ones in fact less
less was the first pre post
pre-processed CSS language that I used
and it kind of got my mind spinning
about the whole thing and then I found
out about SAS and mostly I was forced in
the SAS because they started using it at
a new job that I started and then I kyla
I was like this makes actually a lot
more sense to me the way that the
variables were handled in the way that
mix-ins were used were a little bit more
expressive and like a little bit more
verbose we're like less was like you
could include the class
name of a class before and it was
actually a like a mix in and that was
always like kind of weird like it not
weird but like hard for me to kind of
get my mind about the difference between
difference between like using it as a
mixing or using as a nested child so um
so sass like really opened that up for
me and kind of made things a little bit
more clear and then through my own
Discovery i discovered the nesting the
indented version of sass and that like
that like really made me like so excited
and look like definitely in the camp of
sass i've been playing with stylus and
its really really malleable I think that
there you know you can use it with
bright braces without we do all kinds of
different things with it and the reason
I haven't taken to it very much is
because it's based on node and the the
major CMS that I've been using lately
has been Jekyll which is a ruby based
application and Jeckle now compile sass
within its own application that within
the own package which like really just
kind of I don't know makes it all
convenient so that's kind of where I
want to met with that but what I've been
trying to do for dev tips is I've been
working a lot more with code kit which
allows me to write the sass and the Jade
like I like but you guys can inspect it
as CSS you can click the little eyeball
in the code kit and it will show you the
rendered CSS so you can you know
approach it from whatever angle that you
like no exam Oh pen instead of Po kid
yes that's exactly what I'm it was
making sure again yeah yeah yeahs code
kit does it locally if there's like a
more complex thing like with multiple
pages or like something like that I'll
use all you all do it locally and then
I'll try to represent it on code pen but
usually it's just a bit code pin is fun
it has those little hang ups but it's
good I think I just worry for demos or
something yeah simple yeah I get a lot
of good responses when I do a code pen
because people like to you know like
explore the code as I'm as I'm
what you know as they're watching the
video so it's really yourself amazing
and has it has all to keep a relative oh
and it takes text editor oh yeah yeah
it's good and the setup is so easy right
like I don't have to like let I'll have
to like create a new project on my local
machine and you know say down yay
environment I just like open a new
project and start working yeah so that's
cool cool cool hey tracks yeah man um
i'm just gonna jump on here real quick
flight thank you and all that good stuff
um appreciate your videos i started
developing in like literally christmas
day my wife got me a developer book and
it was a pain in the ass it spoke about
it it was um what does that have a right
here King it's just the basic highest
rated on amazon and everyone has this
book yeah of course you could it's like
that that starter starter doing I'm i
started learning it and I was like oh my
god this this is this is awesome you
know and then I saw CSS not my all is
cool building things and then you pulled
out stats and from there just dropped
for me oh no everyone then you know cuz
i keep saying how the building blocks
keep coming up it's like language after
language and then I saw Jay that's like
out there goes HTML up so hey I want to
say thank okay that cause a problem for
you or did they accelerate you for me it
caused the problem because my computer
isn't always the happiest camper you
know I mean and so getting it all to
work seamlessly was a pain in the butt
it's finally there and I'm getting this
ass because I I started out with CSS and
the book really is strong on
fundamentals and all the brackets and
getting used to that yeah so the ruins
tasks happened I had to pretty much you
know I was writing CSS and have to
backtrack and by all right take out the
brackets all that and it was one of
those thinkers kind of it up up down is
like I'm trying to catch up with all
these other things that are popping up
you know every single
week or whatever it seems and so I'm
getting to the point where I need to
start learning JavaScript and that has
all the braces and the bracket so now
I'm having to redo that and figure out
you know because my brain wants to write
it as normal stuff HTML at first with ya
too what is it greater than or less than
signs mm-hmm it was just really cool to
have your videos and it not be super
boring where I want to stab myself like
I want so sad if i made you stab
yourself ya know there's there's some
that are just so boring where it I don't
stop learning I just turn off and just
stare it you know the lamp or whatever
but it took a while Martin my wife would
be sitting here it's like oh you're
walking watching the awkward designer
the Opera developer yes I heard yeah saw
the wound video she saw is the more it
starts out it's like it's that time of
the month and I want to you know make
babies I never since she's not fun easy
Robert man I'm gonna get going great
american cookie like I told you yeah
alright then enjoy your cookies thank
you for stopping by bye bye that was fun
Joey to your face is here yay you got
the mustache going I got it off and the
beard you know awesome so tell everybody
where you're at Joey where you from
right now um just south of Houston Texas
just out of my room right now cool ya
doing the job look thing oh yes right
yeah yeah that's good well good luck
with that thanks um let's see we've got
some questions here but they're all like
about the next project who does want to
know what the next project as I guess
how did you guys like a Caleb's um video
if you like that absolutely love to
completely changed everything that I do
in terms of CSS wasn't that amazing one
hundred percent phenom I watched his
video and then like when I'm editing it
you know and like
I'm like going to it Mike like now I
have to redo everything yeah I mean it
completely it's good and bad obviously
it's good because in the long term it's
easier to edit but now it's like okay
I'm starting a couple of projects and
now like oh well now I have to learn as
I'm doing these projects instead of
using what I got comfortable with before
but oh my gosh Evie completely just flip
the script it was great yes I like a
great teacher yeah yeah it was it was
awesome I read the book like on the page
on snacks a page like it now it's a boat
half a year ago and was using that then
after that started on started on using
been aiming for the classes and that's
really really like awesome and now i'm
all into it I the oh my god Harry
Roberts the speaker yeah here in Croatia
last last last summer so yeah I spoke
with him like a lot about the approach
of how it is and he represent the yeah i
would say in verse triangle a CSS the
system how to build like your tool set
course for SAS like not framework but i
would said the tools that you are going
to use and how you going to use the
naming for it and you really pay
attention for specificity of the CSS
yeah so we are really cool Harry Roberts
if you guys aren't clear on the unlock
is he's his CSS wizardry com yep yeah
this is Missouri man that guy like is
good he's it like not only is he just
like good at teaching you like what's
like like popular or what's new or
what's available right now but like he
invents things like he like like like
the other was the last thing that kind
of blew my mind oh he was using like the
angled bracket
inside of the class attribute to group
classes according to like what functions
they do you know like I was like I've
never thought of that before that's
awesome yeah like was likewise I was
like using like for one year he's you
know framework so built like oh I've
never used that if you like it and you
know yeah it's awesome it's a BEM naming
it's a objective oriented CSS so really
really really cool stuff Andrew like and
it gives more flexibility and you can do
your own blocks and whatever you need it
it's not you I framer like bootstrap or
something like that it's just like you
design your stuff and then implemented
on a common eat oh yeah it's more like
um it's like a guide or like a
last-minute direction yeah yeah it's
cool great well um I have to get running
soon I just wanted to make this like a
really short video compared to usual and
to say thank you for I mean everybody
thank you so much for for support like
over the past two years and just like
watching the channel grow like reading
your emails in your comments it's just
really cool for me so thanks thank you
thank you for cool videos thank you all
right we're gonna stop the broadcast now
thanks everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
