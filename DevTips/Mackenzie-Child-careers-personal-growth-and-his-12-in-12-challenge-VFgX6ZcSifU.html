the best episode of dev tips you've ever
seen in your whole entire lifetime right
now I'm with somebody that I've been
just chatting with for the past
half-hour we've had a few emails and
tweets together but this is really the
first time that I'm sitting down with
and meeting mackynzie child say hello
mackynzie how's it going everyone
alright I'm so so excited that you're
here I how did how did we in touch in
the first place did I contact you
someone tagged both of us on Twitter ah
yes all right because you're you're over
there in Colorado in the snowy capped
mountains and you were not originally
from there right or did you move in when
you're a kid yeah I moved here when I
was three from California nice nice and
how long have you been in designing
professionally I got into design when I
was about 15 and have been doing it or
I've gotten into the web more recently
when I was about 20 mm and I'm about to
turn 20 floors so okay about a decade
nice that's a long time and it just like
slips right past us and it really does
did you go to school for that or do you
self-taught mostly or what's your kind
of story
so I got into design when I was 15
like I said a friend put Photoshop on my
computer and then about three weeks
later I put an ad on Craigslist for my
awesome new graphic design skills so it
was a first project you did off of those
craigslist ads so I had a lady who owned
a interior design company she contacted
me and wanted a logo done and a flyer
and a advertisement mm-hmm how did I go
I immediately started on those I spent
like three weeks and I was super excited
and I showed it to her and then
I emailed her and then I called her and
I never heard back so as Dee did she use
the stuff or did she decide that you
weren't as good as she thought you might
be here I'm guessing so which is a
completely understandable because I
looked back on that project a few last
year sometimes a little bit I'm like I'm
so sad because a lot of the early weird
stuff I did when I was when I was young
I lost I lost in yeah like like I didn't
like really understand how things
computers worked and so like we got a
new computer and through the old one
away with all my work on it and that's
kind of it that's about me so so like
the memory I have of the work was it was
awesome and I've never even designed
anything as cool since so it was pretty
it's pretty sad but that's just memories
maybe they're actually pretty horrible
so do you remember the lady of this uh
give me the name of the interior
decorator you want to put her on blast
on YouTube I dunno
so what was it what was your first like
job then like like how did you crack
that nut going from like just posting on
Craigslist to actually being a worker in
the web industry well I actually did go
to school for graphic design yeah I went
to the Art Institute of Colorado and got
a associates in I think it's like
Applied Science of graphic design or
something like that
some very long sounds fancy name but
after that I graduated and then two
weeks later I got a job at a company
called super flow and they did
dynamometer xand flow benches which is
just the like engine and chassis testing
they like fine-tune everything for like
race cars and all that good stuff
interesting that was actually a really
fun job because I got to do
pretty much had full control over their
branding ah it was all print work but I
really enjoyed that that's awesome so
then how did the coating come into it if
you were doing print work from the
beginning so the coating came out of
just a need because I would pass off my
I would spend several weeks crafting a
pixel perfect beautiful design for the
new website and I pass it off to the
developer and then I would get back the
version or the first and second and
third draft and just that everything was
slightly off most people probably
wouldn't notice but uh yeah yeah it just
drove me to want to be able to have full
control over the design and how the how
that translated into the woods that's
exactly my story that's the whole thing
like I have been like so frustrated so
many times by not having the skill to
breathe life into the designs and like
the drawings that you make and being
able to have that skill it gives you so
much freedom and that's actually the the
original name of this YouTube channel
and still the URL of it is is dev tips
for designers it was intended to help
people like you people like me to take
our designs and give them life but it
turns into out is just dev tips but but
yeah that's the end of the intent like
that's like totally my like story as
well as that's really awesome I love
when you like kind of jive with someone
sorry if I'm nerding out but so tell me
what you're doing on YouTube you you
have a YouTube channel it's
appropriately named mackynzie child
design spelt with a Z and you're doing a
12 in 12 challenge don't tell me about
that yes so the past few years I've been
dabbling with the back end framework
Ruby on Rails
I really have several projects I've been
wanting to build but I never actually I
the 12 and 12 challenge was really a
kick in the ass to get myself to finally
rales right like I said I dabbled with
it before but every time I'd get stuck I
would just like find something else more
interesting or just honestly move on
something else easier to learn so where
did the idea come from like like how did
that all gel into a YouTube channel
instead of just like I want to learn
coding so obviously I wanted to learn
rails I read an article I think like
three weeks before I started the
challenge that said you learn better by
teaching or you learn better when you're
expected to teach so the whole idea was
to build a web app using rails and then
I would teach how exactly I built that
web app and then make screen casts of it
and put it on YouTube so you build the
you build the projects before you start
filming so that's honestly why I learned
so much while I was doing this so I
would start out I built the web app oh I
would struggle to build a web app with
all the features that I wanted to have
in it and then I would build it again
and this is all in one week span so I'd
build it then I build it again and the
second time I would take like detailed
notes just so when I did record the
screencast that didn't look like a
complete fool and then the third time I
would build it and record the screen
cast and then obviously edit it and I
threw it up on YouTube right soo
so by the time we're watching you this
is the third time you're going through
it uh-huh man that is I should take some
notes from you man I'm like I am messing
my way through the stuff that I'm doing
on this channel and I'm like my audience
is always like why did you do that
getting sense I don't know definitely
yeah probably a better style and a
better watching experience for your
audience well I think week 7 I was like
screw it I don't have time and I'm too
exhausted to do it that mean time so I
just went I think it was week seven I
just went straight through once they end
up being close to like two hours long
and
yes bad yes that's true wait so you're
saying on the seventh week you recorded
the first time like like you didn't do
it any any of the two nope I just yeah I
did the design and and the coding on the
fly so any errors or anything I just
figured it out as I went we look at C
which which video that is I feel like
you a seven or eight or something
is it job boards it might have been
that's awesome you look it up so you've
got a lot of it I'm just gonna read a
few of the things that you projects that
you've done here there's a lot of cool
stuff how to build a reddit or a hacker
new style site how to build a blog in
rails a recipe box a Pinterest clone a
movie review app to do apps job boards
workout log a Wikipedia clones forums
notebooks and like a dribble dribble
type app in rails these are all rails
apps that's a pretty big list of things
that you did and this took only three
months to do yes honestly I wish I did a
four and four challenge because this was
incredibly incredibly hard I know
exactly what you mean like when you
start out a new project and you like
over commit yourself yeah I am the
champion of over-commitment my my wife
is always like that's why you don't ever
sleep dude because like here always
because you always like have this this
thing that you're doing I'm like like no
no I don't overcommit I just but but you
should listen to my new podcast what
would you say is like the biggest thing
that you personally have gotten out of
these 12 weeks oh man
well first off I realized that I can do
a lot more than I thought I could it's
so many times I told my wife many times
I'm like screw it I can't do this
there's way too much work but she's like
nope you have to do it and I was like
fine that's but I learned
it's pretty cool because like the fifth
week I felt finally felt pretty
comfortable with making a rails
application obviously there's still a
ton I need to learn have you ever made
one before these 12 weeks I made I would
say one or two but it was like step by
step following the tutorial and then
like once a tutorial was done I was like
cool I have this but I don't know how I
did it
right right so I'm the I mentioned I
don't I don't know rails myself I've
worked at companies that use rails and I
said worked inside of rails apps but
I've never like administered one myself
what is the process of creating one of
these projects and like deciding on what
it is is one step of the project but
like like what are the steps to make it
work and talk about that a little bit
well the first few applications where I
picked those purely based on the fact
that I could find tutorials to guide me
along but the later ones like the let's
see the movie now the workout log and
the notebook were just my ideas so I'd
start out I would first figure out what
I want to do and then I would model out
the data so basically like pretty much
figure out all the features I wanted in
the application like users and then I
think the workout log had workouts and
then for each workout you have like a
number sets and number Rhett's reps so
you just model all that out and then
that is how you go about building that
application and then I know from the
company I worked for they do a lot of
user stories yeah so basically like as a
user I want to be able to do X because X
and that's something I definitely
definitely used along the way did you
did you like sketch things out or
wireframe or like I said you did user
stories like did he design
as little as possible yeah purely
because I'm a designer obviously I know
I would have spent hours and hours
focusing on the wrong things so I use
bootstrap for some of them and then like
the notebook application I did spend a
bit of time on the design on that just
cuz actually we just launched the
redesign and my job and I was feeling
pretty pumped so yeah I went ahead then
spend a bit more time on that design
other than that it's just pretty
terrible bootstrap applications cool so
you have made a 12 awesome projects in
12 weeks what does the response been so
far I've had a ton of people reach out
and just say how much is helping them
which is super encouraging yeah but I
think that's purely based on the fact
that I'm building full web applications
and not charging for it right which is
something not found on the web very
often a lot of people have just been
saying how much has helped them and then
obviously a lot of people want me to or
I've noticed a lot of people want me to
like build their application for them
yeah there are a lot of people who have
encouraged me to keep going and that was
a big help for like week seven and eight
when or even week forward when I wanted
to quit very badly
you know my favorite thing about your
channel is hmm your face here you have
like this like really like something
here's something going on there it's
like um like an encouraging or something
I'm looking at looking at all your
thumbnails right now there's like
there's like a yeah buddy kind of like
feel to it I don't know if I'm getting
that right but like like it's like super
friendly I guess is what I'm saying like
it's super nice and friendly and like
your voice is super soft oh one thing I
didn't know about you your videos or at
least the few that I've watched
completed - mm-hmm the ones that I've
watched you do one take yeah
what how do you do one take
I like we've been talking here for 20
minutes and everybody's gonna see four
minutes of this like like there's no way
I am such a mess all the time how do you
do this what how are you such a natural
I would not say that it's just me
repeating it over and over I probably
sit in my room for like half an hour
recording the intros and outros until I
think oh so you do multiple takes but
you don't splice that you don't cut them
together you just like okay that makes
sense for future videos I won't
I won't do that but this twelve and
twelve honestly I'm not really sure why
I did everything then one take it's good
like you don't see that a lot on YouTube
we rely on jump cuts a lot the other
thing I noticed about your your videos
were that was the music mm-hmm so did
you produce that yourself it seemed like
really timed and interesting I lucked
out because my brother is a music
producer got it right I was like this
has to be custom cuz it's like they like
the way it like crescendos right is your
ending your point and stuff like almost
every time it's yeah I don't know is
that I'm perfect do you have like
different splices and loops that you're
putting together in building for the
impact no he gave me like a it's like a
five minute clip and then about 45
seconds to the end it drops and then
like builds up so I just use that for
once I'm done talking right usually okay
cool I'm learning a lot from you man
you did a really good job especially for
like I don't know considering it's only
12 videos and this is your first like
I've done like nearly a hundred videos
now and like I'm like wow this guy he
knows what he's doing well thank you
okay so um let me ask you this question
of all the the twelve videos you doing
so far what is the most cringeworthy or
like what like when you watch them
you're like oh why did I do that do you
have any of those I have tons of them
yeah I was listening to I think
the movie review uh-huh and I'm just
like smacking my lips there at the
screencast I actually think I'd do that
in a few a few of them yeah I'm like uh
and I realized I say alrighty and so
constant alrighty
yes you know I have a few those that one
out one of them that I realize I say the
first thing we're gonna do is and even
if it's like the fifth thing that we're
doing I'm like alright so the first
thing we do and it's like we've been
doing we working for like a half an hour
already um let me ask you it just a few
more questions about what you're doing
I'm just really interested in like your
process and like your whole kind of like
philosophy is what so so you've built
these twelve things what are you gonna
do with them now are they just kind of
like just for experience or are you
gonna leverage anything and kind of
build out an app any further um well I I
do want to these twelve are just for
experience um and I do plan on spending
the next like three or four weeks
actually writing out the text for the
tutorials because a lot of people have
asked for like subtitles and stuff so
I'm gonna go through and that like
images and write blog posts for each of
them so that should be a big help but
beyond that there's just a bunch of
projects I want to I guess startups I
want to launch and this the whole point
of this was to be able to at some point
in the future yeah build out projects of
my own yeah it gives you legs to stand
on yes like uh mobilizes you so I mean
so you're gonna take a hiatus then
because you've done this for twelve
weeks in a row without missing a without
missing a beat right uh-huh and you're
gonna take a hiatus and like kind of
transcribe things is that what I'm
understanding um well yes
right now I'm redesigning my website to
allow for the videos and the articles
and stuff and I'm probably only gonna
take like two weeks off okay this week
and next week but I really do enjoy
making these
so I don't know if it's possible but
next year I'm going to try to do two
videos a week obviously Wow our videos
but I'm gonna try to do like 15 to 30
minute once yes the goal is to do one
video like say on Monday for development
either front-end or back-end and then on
Wednesday or Thursday do a design
related video dude that's cool I'm like
kind of jealous there's no way I could
do two videos but I really want two
people that some people ask for more
what when I hear one comment I got it
was like I got a great idea
why don't you do two videos a week it is
a ton of work it's such a ton of work so
I like I totally like I don't know maybe
everybody who's watching this video
thinks that I'm like kind of like
hamming it up right now but I'm totally
geeking out on this this is like I don't
know I was like super impressed without
you did everybody it's like I guess
everybody that I've had on the show up
until now now has been like more mature
in terms of like they've been doing this
YouTube thing a lot longer they've been
having a lot more you know experience
what like building things online and
stuff and I'm so I'm just like I'm like
I I interesting I'm like learning but
like here I'm like just like so excited
because you just have a call this like
raw like energy and like like awesome
content and it's just like there's no
pretense it's really cool I don't know
sorry anyway um
that's kind of like what what I wanted
to get down to I just want to find out
like what your whole plan is with this
this 12 and 12 are you gonna be doing
things like this in the future like
longer series like this where you
challenge yourself like that or we're
gonna be doing things more like in a
bite-size tutorial you said you'd make
them shorter what does that mean yeah I
there's no way I could keep up with
doing a full web app each week without
getting burnt out or killing myself so
I'm not even going to try that the plan
is to do shorter like more specific
videos like
how to implement search in your rails
app or how to like on the design site
how to wireframe or yeah just random
stuff like that but I'm a big advocate
of designers being able to both code and
or both design and then code front-end
and the backend great well I'm glad you
said that because one of the things I
wanted to get to before we close was
like what is your advice to the young
designer who or developer who's like
trying to find their way trying to find
like their voice how would you advise
them to kind of to proceed well one
would be learn how to design and code
that will be very handy in the future to
is make as many freaking side projects
as you can possibly do would you advise
to do 12 in 12 weeks yes I telling
everyone I was like everyone who asked
me like what's the best way to go about
learning I was like how about you build
12 web apps in 12 weeks you'll learn a
ton how did they how do they ask you to
the emailing your is this on Twitter
yeah I've gotten a bunch of emails a
bunch on Twitter and YouTube and stuff
yeah okay just actually started a little
like chat slack using slack okay so it's
like a public slack room yeah that's
cool so we've got like eight people on
there but most time is just me sitting
alone in the room oh I'm not sure that's
going anyway at some point I want to
build a an actual forum like a little
community for designers and developers
yeah that'd be pretty cool I think that
there's a great opportunity for that
especially for people who are like
interested in coding and designing
through video and watching this YouTube
but I think the people who who watched
the content that we produce are a unique
brand of designer and coder so I think I
can place where they could thrive
would be really nice I've been about
that anyway that's all we have time for
today thank you so much
McKenzie for joining us I really hope
everybody who watches dev - dev tips on
the Reg or go check out Mackenzie's
YouTube channel he has 12 excellent
videos like 14 hours or more of content
free building complete applications and
rails they're really good he does a
great job of presenting as you can tell
he's a very charming and charismatic
person and fun to be around so um that's
that's it McKenzie would you please say
keep on hacking keep on hacking all
right we're done how do you feel about
that feel good I feel like I'm looking
up and down that was really a hard thing
to do or to not oh because you kept on
looking at this type thing yeah I was
trying so hard on - but if you're
editing the video
