probably heard me talk about the really
odd things I tend to do for my birthday
one of the things I did this year was to
write a poem for every year that I've
been alive the result of that exercise
was this interactive blog post I'm
really happy with it and I thought it
might be nice to take you guys behind
the scenes to show you what goes into
something like this ah so in this video
we're not going to be coding line by
line like usual I wanted to present a
holistic view of what goes on behind the
scenes you can think of this is more of
a case study now the first step I took
before I even had any idea of what this
project was going to be was to actually
write the poems and it took a few
settings and a few revisions but luckily
enough I chose a simple enough form of
poetry to experiment with and soon
enough I had 32 poems
another part of my birthday celebration
is something that I call a Vision Quest
it's really weird I know but the idea is
I go on a walk and I don't have a
destination and i don't have a timeline
and i just kind of see what happens so I
walked and I read my poems and you know
eventually along the way I started
plotting the poems sentiment on a graph
you see that was this a happy palm a sad
poem somewhere in between fireworks
literally lid off in the back of my
skull as I I started connecting the dots
on the graph and I realized that what I
had drawn was not just a graph of these
poems but really a map of my personal
happiness right over my entire lifetime
and there it was my life's joy mapped
out on a graph right before me
so I shared this graph with with a
handful of people and you know through
conversation through talking about it on
the podcast I came to kind of think that
this would be actually a really great
interactive experience and also a great
subject from my long-neglected blog at
travis nielsen com most of my efforts
these days are focused on my youtube
channel and sadly my blog has become
this lonely desolate place so I was
super excited about building this into
something a little bit more shareable
and my blog seemed like the perfect
place to do it
so starting on the design was pretty
simple because I already had this the
sketch already and I made a few other
sketches in my notebooks about how the
poem would kind of interact with the
graph and the next step to do was to go
into Adobe Illustrator and create you
know fill out the design itself the look
and feel of the post i created this grid
and then stylized this line with Bezier
curves and inset anchor points I had not
yet designed the bubbles at all I was
saving that for the browser I exported
the illustration as an SVG and brought
it into my code as a background image of
a diff
now getting the size and interaction
right for this graph is one of the most
important parts of the project it's a
long graph and I have a plan to extend
off to the right and the viewport and
then be scrollable into view my first
few attempts failed I tried anchoring
the size of the container to the viewed
port using percentage widths and Heights
and that didn't really work out because
this would happen a lot I tried doing
this padding left six hundred percent
and what this does it allows the element
to scale with depending on the height of
the project but in the end it didn't
really work out because it skills to the
wrong dimension so all of these attempts
really failed quite badly but finally I
thought to use hard pixels as the
definition of the containers width and
height now the viewport can scroll
naturally and since the initial height
is only a 432 pixels it looks great on
mobile I made sure to export the
illustration as SVG so that it would
scale up beautifully because it's a
vector not a raster image that would
just get pix elated I use media queries
in the CSS to check the browser height
and scale the container up to bigger
screens
the balloons themselves are not a
technical feat just a you know a
rectangle with three rounded corners but
to make them a success there are a few
key points number one the balloons are
children of an element I call the poem
target you see that there it is a direct
child of the overall grid and it's
positioned absolutely now it is
invisible although when I was working on
it i turned it pink like this so i could
see what was going on sometimes i do
these things you've seen me do them
before usually I use the color pink
because it doesn't really show up in my
designs this often but I used a level of
transparency but you see how the target
is so much more bigger than the point
visually because that's what we have we
have these huge thumbs when we're doing
mobile and you know maybe if you're not
that great at clicking on things you
have this big target area to enact the
balloon now a lot of time was put into
the animation of the balloon you can see
when I hover over it bounces out past
one hundred percent down and then
finally lands at one hundred percent let
me slow it down a little bit five
seconds I'll slow it down to two seconds
now you see how it goes up far and comes
down in like it bounces in and out a
little bit maybe even maybe even too
much I don't know let me show you the
animation that went into that you saw me
mess with this here this is the the call
to the animation I have it the animation
is called bounce open a habit going at
0.5 seconds with an easing back easing
and that's an easing back is a variable
that's contained inside of bourbon and
now down here is the actual animation
bounce open so we're going from 1 to 50
65 80 90 100 so 1 250 half of the
animation just happens with no bouncing
at all and then the second half is just
the bouncing we go to 65 to 80 we're
going past right here one point 0 1
we're going past one hundred percent
back down below one hundred percent and
what finally at one hundred percent
we're ending at one so we have this
nation where you're bouncing out coming
down in like this and it feels more
fluid with it feels like it has mass and
velocity although I'm just faking it by
kind of making things you know not
really just Cohen and linearly and
lastly I want to be experienced to be as
immersive as possible so I added a
little sound effect when you hover over
the target and it's still slow but that
idea is that really draw you into what
you're doing as a user you performed in
action in you're getting immediate
visual and audio feedback makes it
really immersive experience I landed on
this water dripping sound after a while
but I auditioned a lot of sounds first
let me show you a few I had at one point
I had generated a random number and
chose from different six different like
tones of this one here so it was like
whatever one you got was it was a
different pitch but in the end I decided
on the water drip I felt that it gave it
the kind of like the jelly feel that I
wanted to give it so it's not just the
animation but the sound also has that
that that tactile jelly-filled that I
was going for to bring about that
experience the sound is just a simple
html5 audio tag that holds the source
and the sound is triggered by a really
simple JavaScript here that just says
when you hover over the poem target play
the sound as simple as that
after taking a step back and looking at
the work so far I decided that it wasn't
a media obviously i added what i call
visual affordances these are graphic
design elements that help people to
understand what they should be doing
next the first thing I did was to design
the cover of the image to show an
expanded balloon already setting the
expectation that this is something that
you can reach out and touch once you get
into the design I added these little
blips that happen on random intervals
you can see these little animated pulses
emanating out from the control points
they're there and they say it'll click
me click me and lastly I added this
little floating arrow here which points
the way to the first node and pops out
the first balloon that little arrow is
sitting there saying like right here
buddy you can do it and each of these
little elements because they're animated
in such kind of like a lively personal
way have their own language a design
language but also this personality that
hopefully we speak to the user and help
them to understand what they should be
doing another usability concern that I
had was that it might be a little
disorienting for some people that we
have this like long horizontally
scrolling layout and not the usual
vertical one so there are already a few
design choices that help people to
intuit this horizontal layout for
example the graph itself runs off of the
page if you follow this line we also
have the numbers here you know 0 5 10 15
and you know that there's 32 so
obviously they just keep going and even
the title here 32 years of poetry is
intentionally very tall and very long
here and it spreads very wide just
helping people to feel that there's more
on the right side of the page and that
they should do they should make an
effort to bring it in from the right
into the viewport but still I wanted it
to be as obvious as a slap in the face
that this thing moves horizontally and
not vertically so I use JavaScript to
redirect the downward scrolling action
into a horizontal scroll
that way it will be painfully obvious to
anybody who tries to interact with this
design that the movement is laterally
not vertically it might be a bit of a
surprise but it's definitely
discoverable and lastly I added a few
icon prompts here at the top to help
people to discover more about this
project or to leave comments if they
wish did you see the way the modal
bounces that animation is reused
actually from the balloons I wanted to
maintain a consistent design language
throughout the entire experience and
last they added a little Twitter bird up
there to that when you click it it opens
up a pre-populated tweet that you can
just log in and tweet if you felt like
doing me a favor and sharing this on
Twitter this has been a really fun video
for me I hope has been few a breakdown
of a creative project that I recently
did now links to the project itself live
and to an episode of my podcast where i
disgust you know right in the middle of
that creative state what I plan to do
with the poems is in the links in the
description below those links are in the
description check those Apple I've never
made a video like this before let me
know if you liked it in the comments
down below and the dev tips question of
the week is what other designs would you
like examined and broken down it doesn't
need to be a project that I've done it
can be anything that you see in the
world and if it inspires me then I would
love to take a look at it and try to
break it down see what tricks they used
and how that we can recreate it thanks
for watching everyone and keep on
hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
