here today just have a quick video for
you I made and released a video recently
this on Monday which was yesterday
actually which detailed the process of
sketching a website layout and then
going into visual design and and I
realized a really handy thing for you
guys to have maybe a little vocabulary
set or a library of sketching symbols
and so I want to share with you a few of
the things that I've come across and
that I've adopted into my kind of like
toolbox of sketching symbols so that's
what we're going to start today um so
the first is the the format when I
create a new sketch for a project I
usually frame it up in the format that I
believe that it's going to take so for
example let's start with something very
basic if it's like a postcard I'm going
to do it in a square you know for Scott
postcard format like a was a 5 by 6 or 5
by 7 or 4 by 6 and that and then I'll
just you know start designing in there
if I'm going to do something like a
poster I'll do the format of a poster
right if I'm going to do a website I'll
often make a make a three-cornered
rectangle or a three-sided rectangle and
I'll leave the bottom side open so that
I can just continue on making more
length as I need it right and so I'll do
all of this work and then i okay this
website is going to be longer than I
thought so I'll just make it longer and
I'll keep going when I started I used to
make websites like this and then I run
out in the bottom and have to ignore
this line so anyway I just do a four a
three sided rectangle and then just let
it grow what else okay so another option
might be if I'm doing a website that I
know that it's going to be a full-height
a website like a like a landing page or
something you see those a lot pretty
popular right now and it's like here's
the big button
scroll down later so anyway I know that
this is going to be the hundred percent
high it so I you just make a full box
there and then the other one to consider
is the phone wherein you can actually
draw the height of the phone and
consider these because you really need
to consider your edges maybe even more
so on a phone than you do on a on a
desktop or a browser you know and then
you can you can delineate where the the
viewport will be and then if your
content needs to go out you can still
continue sketching down that's okay okay
now that we're done drawing our
rectangles to denote the format that
we're working inside let's talk about
the little library of symbols that I use
to denote common UI elements okay so the
first one is just a line of text if
you're gonna do a line of text usually a
started with like a little squiggle and
then line it out right there that
squiggle lets you know that this is some
copy and you know there we are
if I'm going to do a headline I'll do a
three corner or three box rectangle and
I'll extend this top side a little bit I
don't know where I got that from but I
just like the idea of it and this could
be a headline if I know that it's going
to be a double deck headline meaning
that there's two lines in it sometimes
I'll just divide it like that make two
squiggles so I know that this headline
is going to fall bound down to a second
line and then again if I'm going to do
like a subhead maybe I'll do two lines
with like it opens on both sides and a
squiggle in between these are just
different ways to denote different
levels of the hierarchy and helps us to
just sketch quicker and faster if we
have all these things in our toolbox and
also it will help us to communicate
quicker with other parties if they
understand what these with these symbols
mean as well some of them are really
abstract like these some of them are
more are more literal like for example
this is an image this is
a placeholder for a video this would be
an avatar you know and sometimes you can
I mean you can even like connect all of
these ideas and say this is an avatar
and say and create this kind of lock up
here and say okay so the prickly
person's face is going to be next to
their type their name and then up their
title you know the CEO of whatever
company so this is this is a you can
combine all of these tools to create
this really simple lock up put it inside
of a card there we go you can share that
okay um other ones that you'll commonly
see are you know just a bunch of lines
like this and this would be like a body
of text you can even be more specific
about what kind of style of body of text
is if you put a rule or a line down one
side you can know that this is
left-aligned text and this one would be
you know right aligned text I've even
seen it but I've never done it myself
but I've even seen it where people send
our text center-aligned text like that
um what else we got other options would
be like if you want to create a list of
items pretty simple to create a list uh
so these are the more like abstracted
ideas of of UI elements but some of them
are a little bit more literal like let
me show you how to do quickly a sketch
of like for example this would be some
tabs right and below that is the content
oftentimes you can you know like this
would be oh this will denote a graph you
don't have to be specific about what
kind of information or what the graph
would actually look like you can just
say like I want this right here to be a
bar graph and then people kind of
understand that that's what we're
intending and this is a very quick way
to sketch out these wireframes
another important thing to have as a an
element in your toolbox
is to be able to sketch forms because
forms are the active part of the
internet right the Internet is based on
forms so I would say like throw your
label there we already reviewed that a
single line of text and then a form
field a label and then a form field this
was similar to the contact box that we
made in our last video and then down
here would be a submit button now with
buttons I usually try to make them
beveled a little bit so I'll just kind
of like darken the shadow of the right
and bottom borders so the looks more
clickable it looks more actionable than
anybody who's looking at this will not
be confused that these are form fields
and this is an actionable button okay
other interesting things I mean I mean
you take a form field you throw a
magnifying glass in the corner you've
got a search button
you can attach the button right here and
then darken up that bottom and right and
we know that we've got a search so
anyway these kind of things are are deep
are the tools in your toolbox of UI
sketching to help you move quickly
through a layout you combine all these
things to to make compositions okay
that's it for today I just wanted to
make this really quick video as I was
thinking about the topic check back for
dev tips more dev tips on Monday and if
you did like this video please like it
and share it and do all that good stuff
that we youtubers love to say at the end
of videos anyhow take care and have a
good whatever day this comes out on by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
