Travis Nielsen and this is the last
video in this series called CSS basics
so far in this series we've talked about
basically what is CSS we talked about
cascading nature of CSS selectors
properties and values advanced selectors
we talked about specificity and even
we've talked about last week css3 this
week we're going to talk about something
that I normally wouldn't throw into a
basic series but it's something that's
become so ingrained in the way that we
use CSS professionally that you're going
to need to know about this that
something is called CSS preprocessors
pretty cool huh so here's like the
elevator pitch for using a preprocessor
in your workflow let's say you're making
a website and you declare a brand color
and use it for two style links and
headings and a few other things and
you've done so about a hundred times
throughout all the Styles let's say you
want to change the color just a little
bit and tweak it you have to run through
all the styles and change them one by
one
you can just use a variable and that way
you can make a small change here and it
will show up everywhere else that you
define that variable pretty cool huh so
how does this magic happen whoa here's
the basic idea your browser still needs
traditional regular everyday CSS to
render all the websites that you see
across the internet but really smart
people have invented a way that we can
write more useful and intelligent and
beautiful styles that do all kinds of
crazy tricks and then run them through a
program that outputs normal everyday CSS
that your browser needs
pretty cool huh all right here are a few
other things that a preprocessor will
give you imports are this may seem kind
of obvious but the real power here is
that all these separate documents that
we create can be collected together an
output as one single document this is a
huge deal you consider that every CSS
document you link to in the head of your
HTML is a separate HTTP request which is
a request to the server which is a
request that the browser needs to
download and it's a load for the user if
you can make that just one request one
download and the browser will probably
cache it after the first time you win
pretty cool huh
also this liberate suss to be liberal
with the way that we structure our code
you know these days I don't really think
twice to make a new document to style a
new module or something like that on a
larger site I'll make a video later
about how I organized my style files but
this importing feature plays a large
part in how and why I do it so it's
pretty cool huh nesting nesting is a
really cool thing that helps you write
code that feels very modular it helps
you think about the relationship of the
HTML elements I like it because it just
feels natural fast and makes a lot of
sense when you're switching over to a
pre processed language this is probably
the first feature that you'll be messing
around with cool mix-ins mix-ins are
kind of like functions in JavaScript in
the way that they are actually reusable
blocks of code now like the functions in
JavaScript you can pass arguments to
them that will affect the output of the
code that you use in the mix in in
this example we have a mixin that helps
us write the new flexbox tiles really
easily after we have the mixin we can
use it by adding this simple one line to
our style document and the output is
this beautiful and easy cross browser
compatible CSS functions now functions
are like little kind of guys that are
built into the preprocessors they'll let
you to do like fun little things like
for example take a color and change its
tint by 10% so in that example you don't
have to really figure out what the color
is for the button when you hover over it
you can just change it to be 10% of what
the first color you defined was math you
can do mathematical operations right in
your CSS dials things like Junot simple
stuff like add and subtract you can
divide and multiply it's not as useful
as it is in JavaScript because
javascript can actually read the Dom and
count the elements or dimensions of
objects and perform mathematical
operations on those things this can't
because remember the final output of
this is just static CSS and I thought
this was really cool slash weird
what is the color pink minus 50 yeah so
it's got that going for it which is
great okay that was just a really quick
look at the functions that a
preprocessor can give to you and like
let me just tell you there's a lot more
and they're super useful and I can't
really think about styling a larger site
anymore without using them I'm sold I
will never turn away they are incredible
and they are awesome but you will notice
in this video I have purposefully not
identified any of the Priya processors
by name because I wanted to talk about
the functions in general and now I'm
going to talk about them individually
introduce the most popular three that I
am kind of familiar with and a little
bit about each one let's do that less
the first one that I came across a few
years ago and the one that I suspect is
the most popular is one called less so
you create da le s
files and it outputs after you run the
program it outputs dot CSS files I think
less is the most popular one because
it's the one that Twitter bootstrap uses
less was also the first one of these pre
processors to maintain the original
syntax of CSS with all its like brackets
and semicolons now I think this was
really smart of less in marketing it to
programmers because you could say things
like oh the code that you're writing
right now is actually valid less so just
you can ease into it just start now and
baby steps I chose to learn less first
because back then it had the
best-looking website and I guess I'm
just really fickle like that sass sass
came a bit before less and it was a lot
more aggressive in the way that it
marketed itself to the coding community
sass thought you know hey if we're going
to be rethinking the way that we create
CSS let's really rethink the way that we
create CSS the original version of sass
stripped away curly brackets and
semicolons and instead relied on line
breaks and indentation after less came
out and became really popular really
quickly I think that's kind of
understood that people were just afraid
of change or something and so they came
out with another version of sass called
as CSS and it just does the same thing
as sass except for it lets you keep
those curly brackets and semicolons and
this I really help people to be feel
more comfortable with the whole idea of
pre-processing and I think I don't this
is just my observations but I see it a
lot more sass now because of a CSS and
although I get why people like the curly
bracket versions of these pre-processors
you know it's comfortable and familiar I
really really like the indented flavor
of sass it's really beautiful to read
it's easy to read and it's maintainable
all you have to do is just indent or out
dentin to nest things and level them in
scope oh it's so great it hey sass lets
you mix the flavors that your import
to your final project you can like mix
them in and they'll just output just
fine so my challenge to all you people
who are kind of a little nervous about
trying the indented flavor just use one
document and import it in and you know
in your CS CSS project use an SI SS file
and import it in and see if you like it
better that's what I did I just tried it
with one file like last year and Wow it
was so much better it didn't took me
like 10 minutes to get comfortable with
it maybe less and now I just swear by it
it's so great and and there's also
really great functions built into sass
when it compiles it can switch you can
switch a whole project from SAS s to s
CSS it's even like if you you could even
have you know if you're working with a
team you could have your version of SAS
s and then they could you could switch
it over s CSS like with one little
command it's really I'm rambling but
it's you should try it I also like SAS a
lot because it has really awesome
extensions things like compass and
bourbon and I'm not really sure if les
has equivalent things I'm sure they do
right now but I know that SAS does and I
know that they are awesomeness so they
got that going for them which is nice
and also they got purple branding and a
new website so I can get behind that now
style is and lastly I'll talk about
stylists which I've never used in a big
project yet but they have probably the
best website and it looks really nice so
here's what do know about it Dallas is
really unique in the whole bracketed
versus indented things in that it
doesn't really care you can write
indented a flavor of stylus and a
bracketed flavor of stylus in the same
document and it will just read it just
fine I don't know how it does it and
that's kind of cool but it's that's what
it does there's one of the things that
does ok that's it for luck the
introduction of pre-processors will
definitely definitely spend a lot more
time on them later but I'm really
excited to share them with you because
this is really a big part of my everyday
Kodi work and you're going to be seeing
me use sass a lot more in the examples
that I do on this channel so get
prepared
for that it will talk a lot about that
more in future videos also I'm excited
to say that this is the last video in
the CSS basics series now I love talking
about the basics I think fundamentals
are fundamental but I'm really excited
also to dive a little bit deeper in the
near future so look forward to that you
have any questions like I didn't explain
anything very well in any of these
videos or maybe even I got it wrong
please let me know in the comments below
I want to know what you guys think and
where you need more clarification right
now I'm interested to know if you guys
use CSS preprocessors and I want to know
which ones you like and why if you
learned something you like in this video
today please share it with your friend
and please please please subscribe to
the channel because I have so much more
to share with you and I want you to know
