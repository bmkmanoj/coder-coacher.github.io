let's get started
a video you're watching right now is a
companion video I made another one in
which I coded up a responsive email from
scratch and walked you through
everything that's involved in that so
what I want to do right now is instead
of do the code writing firm you want to
talk to you about some of the larger
principles and ideas that are involved
in such a thing if you haven't seen that
first video already it's okay there's a
link to it in the description below you
can watch them in any direction it
doesn't matter they're not continuous it
does not matter how messy your directory
is an email is not a website so other
people are not going to be jumping in
and out of it over a long period of time
it's just a temporary thing that you
code up and send out so I don't use any
subdirectories everything is in the root
and it's just really easy to work in and
get messy another thing to keep in mind
when you're creating responsive layouts
for emails is that you don't need to be
fooled into thinking you need to use
tables they're an outdated concept when
it comes to responsive emails and
they're only useful if you want to
create multi-column emails which them in
and of themselves are not a great idea
keep in mind that your head and body
tags and likely your style tags will be
stripped by the email client now this
makes style tags a nice to have that you
can use them but you can't rely on them
you should make that make sure that your
email will work fine without them the
same principle applies to media queries
since the media queries cannot fit in
line always not that I know of you can't
rely on them for responsive emails a
really good mobile first responsive
approach is to have a flexible layout
and a single column to begin with all of
your Styles need to be inline but that
does not mean that you need to write
them that way now after you create your
Styles use MailChimp CSS in liner to
move all those styles to be in those
inline attributes email designers and
senders need to understand that a large
majority of their emails that they send
will be opened up on mobile
devices now I've described how I
designed for one flexible with column
but this also means keeping your content
mobile first that means one clear
message one clean call-to-action now for
one last thing remember to always jump
on your hotel beds and never eaten any
of that snack food that they leave on
the counter if you haven't yet go check
out that other video where I cut up the
email from scratch it's about a half an
hour long but you may find it really
interesting if you have watched that
video already let me know what you think
of it in the comments below because I'm
still a little how to say self-conscious
about that kind of video where I code
right in front of everybody I feel like
I am NOT doing a great job but anyway
I'd like to feed it back on this style
of it if you found these or any other
videos helpful please share them and be
excellent to each other we'll see you
next week
