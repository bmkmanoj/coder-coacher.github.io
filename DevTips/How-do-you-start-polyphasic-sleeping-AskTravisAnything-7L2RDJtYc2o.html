this question comes from Christian
burner
who says I started listening to your
podcast with low so a few weeks ago in
some of your early podcasts you talk
about polyphasic sleeping question how
on earth did you manage to get started
I'm trying to get started but for one
week now and however every evening
there's there's always something I have
to do I can't imagine did you encounter
this problem too
do you have any tips deep down and deep
down I know it's just a matter of
planning but I'm wondering how do you
explain to the rest of the world that
you got asleep when Sesame Street is
finished
I don't understand the Sesame Street
point maybe that's from the podcast that
was like two years ago or one year ago
polyphasic sleeping is the practice of
sleeping many times throughout the day
so I can sleep three hours at night and
then three 20-minute naps for a total of
four hours in the day if I sleep for
four hours than the day then I get an
extra was it like four to six hours more
than you do
and that enables me to be really
productive and basically make more of
these videos and other things
anyway Christian uh polyphasic sleeping
is really hard to do unless you have a
reason to do it so you know like what
are you doing when everybody else is
sleeping it has to be like a gift a good
excuse because you're not doing
something worthwhile and interesting and
like engaging here you're just going to
be like drifting off in fact you
probably will do that anyway for the
first little bit there's just like a
two-week hump that you have to get past
some tricks are to put the phone on the
other side of the room I mean like
socialize what you're doing saying I'm
doing this telling people that you're
going to be taking a nap in the middle
of the day from now on I have a nap kit
at work it's a yoga mat right it's a
thick squishy one a yoga mat and it's
earplugs and I like a you know sleeping
mask and I go into like a phone booth or
a phone room or a conference room I've
booked it on the calendar and then I
stick a sticky note on the door shut the
door cut off the lights
sleep kit taking that for 20 minutes
it's a lot of work but you have to like
plan it out I have to do it right and to
be honest ever since I joined Google
it's I've been not so great at it I do
it maybe like three out of three days
out of the week three days out of the
five day work week I'm doing polyphasic
sleeping I don't know it's great fun if
you can if you can if you can do it but
but I wouldn't beat yourself of trying
to do it because I don't know why beat
yourself up man that's it for this
question if you want to know more about
polyphasic sleeping check out the
podcast thick that Christian is speaking
of there are two podcasts that reach
about 40 40 minutes long and they're on
Travon lost comm and they're called
something like how I increased my it's
like something really clicked baby like
how I increased my productivity by 150%
or something like that that's polyphasic
sleeping if you think it's worth it then
there's a big sacrifice to made it's
hard to do but it's great so app sorry
sorry microphone
