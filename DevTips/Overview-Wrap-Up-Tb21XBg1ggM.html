videos and this is one of them
now before we start today i want to let
you know that 100 percent rounded up to
the nearest 100 dollars of the money
raised from our patrons will go to help
the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe
North Africa in the Middle East this
continues the tradition here at dev tips
of giving back when we can this started
last spring when we as a community
donated 500 dollars to the Save the
Children Haiti disaster relief fund if
you also want to make a personal
donation the links for that are in the
description below so you're watching a
bit of an overview for this series that
I call design and code my personal
website in 12 hours last week I
published the final video for this
series and this is what we made it's my
personal website I've been waiting a
long time to get this done and
eventually I decided the only way to get
it done and also maintain my weekly
youtube show is to do it with you guys
so I'm really grateful that you came
along with me on this journey of
completing my website it was kind of
cool because I named this series blah
blah blah in 12 hours but I didn't
really know how long it would take I
just like the number 12 it you know it
sounds good because who would watch a
video series that's 13 hours long no
it's gotta be 12 and so now after like 4
months of working on it together the
final timestamp of these 25 videos turns
out to be 11 hours and 38 minutes
nailed it now this has been a complete
series of design and code we didn't
start just coding right away we spent
the time to go through the discovery
process we sketched multiple wireframes
there's even a two hour Photoshop video
in there which interestingly enough is
like the most popular video in the
entire series by far and the other week
we finished it the last bit of front-end
code but even though the series is
complete the work is not over so in this
video I want to talk about the just the
last step so we needed to get done in
order to go live after that twelfth hour
video I identified four more things I
needed to quickly do that we're either
outside of the scope of the video series
or things that we've already done in
other videos that I could quickly point
to and talk about them here and you
could just get the idea so here's my
quick list of pre-launch to do's number
one activate
that javascript scroll number two port
the Jekyll blog articles from the
existing Travis Nielsen comm into this
new one I needed to comment out that
mentoring section I realized that I'm
not ready to add more complexity to my
schedule right now I do plan on sorting
that out sometime soon but also I need
to add like a booking or scheduling
mechanism in there somewhere and I
haven't even think I've thought about
that yet and lastly to publish it live
just put it out there on the internet I
use gh-pages from github to put it out
for free so let's start with item one
activating the JavaScript scroll you see
this navigation here it was supposed to
scroll to the correct section when it
was clicked I deferred this when we were
doing the header section and never came
back to it it's not a big deal we've
done this kind of thing before
check out this video from another series
where we solved the exact same problem
and then look at last week's video with
Fred where he basically rewrites that
specific JavaScript to make it more
proficient so checking those out we know
exactly how to do this next thing moving
on the second item was just outside of
the scope of the project we did talk
about how to set up Jekyll blog post in
our 8.2 but I needed to make sure that
my weird articles plugged in and worked
and also I needed to create an index
page you know so when somebody clicks
see all articles it actually goes
somewhere so check out our 8.2 for how
to set up a Jekyll blog loop and the
third item was simple enough I just
commented out everything that had to do
with mentoring until I have enough time
to go back and support that service and
lastly I did publish the site already on
github.com using the gh-pages service
there's a link in the description below
to a how-to guide if you want to do the
same thing it's really really easy so
now that I uploaded the site to gh-pages
it's visible to the world there might be
a few bugs but it's more or less done
and I'm really happy that it's done it's
been such a long time in the making
thank you so much for coming along with
me on this journey I'm working currently
on the next multi-part series that
should be ready in the next few months
but in the meantime we're gonna be doing
a few fun one-off video topics for a
while so if you have any you know single
video sized requests leave them in the
comments below and if I can do them
they seem fun to me then I will make a
video about it how I told you about the
awesome community we have rocking over
on patreon.com slash dev tips patients
enjoy different perks for supporting the
show like access to early videos and a
24/7 live chat it's awesome
friendships are being made questions are
being asked and answered and work is
being critiqued it's pretty amazing to
see

I hope to have a new vlog post out soon
and until then keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
