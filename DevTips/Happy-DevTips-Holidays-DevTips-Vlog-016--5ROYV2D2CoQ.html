I'm a reindeer I just wanted to make
this really quick holiday video for you
guys to say thank you for an incredible
year and I hope that coding Santa brings
you what you want this year now I'll be
away until the end of the year but I
still have one exciting video to share
for you and that will be out on Monday
but what I wanted to do today was open
up some mail actually I got a dis post
in the post today and it's a it's a
present a holiday present from our
friends is herb ZURB are the creators of
the foundation framework and they sent
me a little little holiday gift let's
open that up okay looks like we got some
stickers and the big a oh okay cool got
a card here hey Travis happy holidays
super glad to have you on community
rocky and the rib team Rafi is the guy
who sets up all of that all the videos
that we do over there and everything
like that he did you really cute what's
it called panda with guns Rafi is
awesome okay so um looks like we got a
punch out yeti which is like the the
mascot of their framework let's just
fast forward this but let's build it
let's build it right now
alright so there's the little cute
foundation Yeti he's got a little arms
and ears or little horns i guess it's
cute huh that's from Zuri but we've got
so I got some sticker sheet it looks
like here the sticker sheet of like
accessories some new eyeballs maybe what
is this zurb slushy or a bow tie that's
cool once we put on it kind of don't
want to ruin it me so cute maybe a
mustache alright let's put a mustache on
him how about a big bushy one
there you go okay thanks Ralphie from a
cool Yeti I'm going to keep that on my
desk at work that's awesome and next for
our next section of the video we're
going to be looking at some questions no
I classes smell like marker for the next
part of the video going to put on a
jacket for the X part of the video we're
going to have questions and these
questions are not exactly a new I've had
them in my queue for a little while so
thanks for submitting them but if you
guys have new questions Mikey's running
a little bit short so be sure to email
this to me or leave them in the comments
on the video like this below and if
they're good questions or if they
inspire me to think of something
insightful then of course i'll share i'm
here on these vlogs like i usually do
the first question comes from thomas
browne how old were you once you managed
to design and code full time i was about
i think twenty four ish or something
like that but for me it wasn't like
you're not a coder and designer and then
you're a coder and designer because i
didn't go the school route it wasn't
like a switch where you turn off or on
like you graduate and now you're a
professional you get your first job i
started doing freelancing as soon as i
could and when i was very young and for
a long time too and not not being
full-time that's why i don't count those
years as a full-time professional but i
don't think that they are they should be
discounted in terms of education because
they were very informative so I mean if
you're trying to ask this question to
get an idea of where you stack up I
think that's probably the wrong question
to ask it doesn't matter how old you are
this industry is democratized meaning
that it's open for anyone to make
anything that they want and to work with
anybody they want there's no restriction
on age there's no restriction on
education if you have a skill and if you
have the desire and motivation then you
can do it and that's a really wonderful
thing about this this industry that's
the only thing that allows me to be Who
I am and do what I do is because it's
democratized because there's no
restrictions or
or like legalities like I don't need to
have a diploma from anywhere to do the
work it just it just comes down to who
you are and what you can do but yeah in
general about 24 ish so I usually say to
people that I've been doing this for
about 10 years and that's give or take
true okay so the next question is from
Ricardo zaffa lon hey Travis my question
is this how do you overcome the urge and
feel to always learn a little bit more
before applying to a real project Thanks
hey Ricardo I think the way that you
overcome that is by building the habit
of of applying what you learn as you
learn it and this is going to have to
benefits number one you're going to be
able to use the things you're learning
right away and that's going to be a lot
more fun for you but number two the
things that you are applying right away
are the things that you will retain if
you watch the video that was released on
Monday about CSS filters you might spend
ten minutes enjoying yourself and maybe
learning about something new but you're
not going to really it's not going to
really change the way you work and maybe
CSS filters is a bad example because
it's such a fringe technology and CSS
right now but generally you know if
you're learning something you should be
applying it right away whether it's in a
paid gig or whether it's just in a
personal project or whether it's just in
the sample projects as you can learn the
one thing but you should be typing along
with every video or every tutorial or
every blog post tutorial or whatever
that you're that you're consuming that
way you can retain what you're learning
that's what you really want you don't
want to just consume everything you want
to grow as in your ability to be a
contributor to be a creator and in the
way that you do that is to apply what
you're learning right away cool and then
the last question comes from Matthew
Hargreaves Matthew says have you ever
suffered imposter syndrome or have been
asked to do something that you can do
but got scared even about doing it I
feel like we've asked these questions
before Matthew
yeah dude like that's my life so if
you're not aware guys I write a note
every thursday to to everybody who
subscribed to it right it's at travis
nielsen com / notes you can go there and
sign up right now and you will receive
the note that comes out in a day or two
and the purpose of these notes is just
to interact on a personal level and
share with you guys what I'm thinking on
in like a day to day basis or you know
like something that's kind of been
striking me lately something that
doesn't fit into a video or a podcast or
or maybe it's just like this seeds of
those kind of outlet outlets anyway
there's a note recently where I answered
a question from Justine and it's called
Justine's question Justine is asking
similar things and I wrote that I'm
constantly doubting my abilities this is
like a thing that I live with like right
now at Google I'm like freaking out
because I'm surrounded by really
exceptional designers everybody is just
so much better than me but I think
that's okay I think it's okay to feel
that way because I expect accelerated
growth this year that's what happens
when you become face-to-face with the
reality that you are not as good as you
assumed you were you get better faster
that's the truth so a imposter syndrome
is a is a good friend of mine we've been
friends for years but I use it as as a
way to tell me that I'm doing the right
thing there's a way to tell me that I'm
going down the right path because if you
ever get too comfortable then you stop
you start really progressing you know
anyway I hope that was helpful for you
Matthew again that's the last question
of the day if you guys have any
questions be sure to leave them in the
comments below and we'll try to hit them
up on the next vlog and and have a good
end of the year there's one more video
before the year ends and then when we
come back in 2016 I hope to have another
annual report for you the first week and
then we'll get more then we'll get back
into some coding things all right take
care everyone bite keep on hacking
you
