channel is called dev tips
I teach website design and development
and I recently was sent this it's a
silver play button from YouTube and this
play button this kind of like it's it's
a it's a plaque you hang on the wall
it's in this case and it's nice it's a
silver play button it's given to people
who have achieved 100,000 subscribers on
their YouTube channel it also comes with
this nice letter from from Susan
Wojcicki who is the CEO of YouTube and
I've seen a few of these videos where
people talk about the silver play button
but nobody has read the letter and I'm
gonna do that for you guys in a few
minutes okay and then after that I want
to give you a few tips and pointers on
how you can achieve this milestone of
100,000 subscribers for your YouTube
channel if you want to make a really
great YouTube channel I'm going to give
you some tips some pointers some ideas
on how you can make that possible
alright so let's get started the first
thing I want to say is that I
acknowledge that the people watching
this video may not be the normal
Watchers of this channel this is a
YouTube channel where I teach people
tutorials about how to make websites and
to design and to code websites and if
you're here just for information on the
play button that's totally cool but if
you are a normal watcher of this channel
and you're not necessarily interested in
making your own channel but you still
may want to stick around because I'll be
going into a few of the ideas and
thoughts behind the production and the
purpose behind this channel and you
might be interested in that so let's
talk about this this play button right
here as I said they send it to you
straight to your home or wherever you
tell them to send it to you maybe about
six or so weeks after you actually hit
the goal so right currently right now
I'm at like 130,000 and I've had it for
a few weeks so also before I make this
video but so it takes a little bit a
little bit of time don't expect to hit
that 100,000 mark and then immediately
you know have this play button at your
doorstep it like like a little form
shows up in the back end like an alert
in your dashboard and you have to kind
of
like follow a link and fill out a form
to actually get it and you're like I'm
not sure if that actually went sent to
the right person or something but you
know and about a month and a half later
it shows up look that's quite nice it
also comes with a with a letter that's
you know a form letter but it's sent by
I don't want to drop this sorry
this letter is sent along with the play
button in in a box that's quite nice and
a lot of people I've watched a few of
these videos where people talk about the
silver play button and they never read
the letter and I was always like that's
in the letter so I think it might be
interesting if I read this letter to you
so you can I think it's really I think
it's a nice letter it made me feel like
excited it's really well-written and it
kind of celebrates the achievement okay
so I'll just so let's get started and
again this is from Susan Wojcicki who's
the CEO of YouTube you've just done
something very few YouTube creators
accomplished you had an astonishing
100,000 people subscribed to your
channel we know that numbers on YouTube
can get really big but we hope you don't
lose sight of the reality behind that
six digit milestone each and every
person who has subscribed to your
channel was touched by what you did they
were inspired or challenged or
entertained you made it to this
milestone with hard work perseverance
and chances are with a healthy sense of
humor what you've accomplished can't be
taken away from you and we like to
recognize you for all your hard work
with this silver play button a small
token of our esteem and respect we know
you don't do this for rewards you do it
because you have Drive to create and
share and because you've found an
audience who cares believe us when we
say that we can't wait to see what you
do next a million subscribers seems a
long way off right now
but you're closer than you think and
we're rooting for you congratulations
sincerely Susan Wojcicki CEO of YouTube
it's a really nice letter isn't it I
like how they underline the fact that
this is a great time
to celebrate it's a really big milestone
but at the same time they acknowledge
the real reason that we do this stuff
the reason I create my channel the
reason that so many other people do the
hard work of YouTube it's really
freaking hard work but the benefits are
that you are able to impact the lives
and bring them you know whatever type of
content you do that enriches and and
fulfills the people who are the the fans
the subscribers the followers the
audience the community of the people
that surround your content so in the
case of dev tips this channel I teach
people skills that will actually get
them work that will help them to create
a living a sustainable income for
themselves I think that's really
important and it's been a huge part in
my life the fact that I've been able to
carve out a place to live I currently
work at Google and that that was nowhere
in the cards for me growing up but
through education educating myself and
harnessing and utilizing the skills that
I try to teach on this YouTube channel I
was able to kind of find a place for
myself in the world and create a
marketable skill set right so that's
kind of why I do the YouTube channel
what I want to do right now is give you
guys who are watching this video and
you're interested in how to grow your
audience how to have a successful
YouTube channel I'm going to give you
five pointers so I'm going to list the
pointers just right there as I as I go
through these the first one is that this
play button it will not make you happy
okay none of this will make you happy if
you want more likes if you want more
views if you want more clicks even if
you want more money
none of that junk will make you happy
what will make you happy is building
strong and meaningful relationships so
if you just want happiness and you think
that that YouTube will give that to you
you're wildly mistaken
you'd probably be better
focusing on real relationships so go
call your mom the second one is that an
engaged audience is much better than a
large audience what do I mean by that
every person who watches these videos on
my channel is part of something they're
a part of the channel the check the
channel is not just me talking to a
camera although that's how its produced
the channel is everybody who watches it
everybody who engages in the comments
everybody who has a voice and shares
their knowledge and experience and
enthusiasm for what we do here so early
on in the channel I recognize that
people who are commenting are actual
human beings okay with hopes and desires
and goals and needs and I figured if
they care enough to leave a comment on
content that I produce and are actually
leaving positive comments which is a
miracle sometimes on on YouTube then
they deserve that same interest and
engagement and caring from me so for the
longest time I think until you know
maybe about a month or two ago I was
proudly able to say that I responded to
every single comment on the YouTube
channel now that's no longer true
efforts like that don't scale but I
would spend hours just going through
comments and answering every one of them
even with just a an emoji or a thumbs up
sometimes a long detailed thoughtful
response depending on you know the
interaction which was appropriate but
the point I'm trying to make is that the
way to have an engaged audience because
I'm saying the point is to have an
engaged on this is better than have a
large audience the way to have an
engaged audience is to treat them with
respect if you go through and the
comments on any dev tips video you will
be surprised by the overwhelming
positivity helpfulness and just
excitement that this audience that this
community has and the reason for that is
because we're a highly engaged
community and that to me is much much
more important than having a hundred
thousand or two hundred thousand or
whatever although the number does
reflect the excitement of the the group
and how accurate your message is to the
general population but but bigger is not
always better
engaged is what you want okay so that's
the best principal to principal three
quality doesn't really matter value is
what matters so asking yourself
questions like what am I giving what
value am i bringing into the lives of
the people who spend their time watching
these videos and this kind of gets back
to the the motivations that we talked
about earlier on right this play button
won't make you happy if you're making
YouTube videos to be popular or to be
liked or to even make money you're gonna
be disappointed
YouTube has a way of really
disappointing people with the outcomes
is because it's hard it takes a lot of
energy time and even money and the
payback can be very very elusive in
terms of popularity or money or like
financial opportunities so the only
thing that will really make it worth it
especially early on when you have a
smaller audience is being able to
positively impact the lives of the
people who engage with your content now
I have an education channel and so it's
easy to think that like it's you know
the content is helpful but you know you
might make skits or make reviews or like
teach something else or you know
whatever it is bringing people joy
happiness entertainment is a part of
that that's value and focusing on that
is what really makes a good channel
people can tell a disingenuous in a mile
away and they they won't they won't
accept it you're not going to get very
far if you're just in it for self
aggrandizement number four is to keep
reinventing yourself and what I mean by
that is that you know you're gonna be
doing this all
time because the YouTube channel
requires a lot of commitment I've been
doing this for three years now and
reinventing yourself is kind of like the
key because you know you're a real
person I'm a real person the people who
watch these videos are real people in
their lives evolve every day and and
we're met with new challenges and new
experiences and we have to react to them
in our own true and honest way and
people evolve and you have to be true to
that evolution and keep trying new
things with your channel you know making
video is actually a really creatively
satisfying task and there's a lots of
there's lots of different things that
you can do I mean I teach code and if
you expect that you know every video is
going to be just like a screen with code
on it and a voice over you're going to
be pleasantly surprised because dev tips
is a lot more than that I take I take my
audience on trips when I go abroad or
when I go to like different places
meetups
I'm try to interview and meet new people
when I do code I have my face there
because it's a personally engaging thing
and I try different techniques of coding
all the time in and it's just like
trying new things seeing what works
right keeping your audience kind of on
their toes and experimenting keeping
yourself creatively engaged to is a
really important you don't want to get
stuck in a rut creatively so try new
things get inspiration from different
creators who are outside of your content
vertical so for example I'm doing
education content but I watch a lot of
news content I watch a lot of comedy
content and I try to assimilate those
influences into the way that I teach
people how to code and create websites
and the fifth tip I have for you guys
who are trying to grow an audience is to
just really be patient just calm down
you know like whoa it'll happen if you
just be yourself and create value and
keep true to that message and and it'll
happen you know and if it doesn't that's
fine too you know you'll
you'll find something else to get
excited about that's just the way things
work okay so so just be patient that's
all the tips that I have for you today I
think that's a pretty good way to end
the video subscribe to my channel it's
really important to me that's a joke
and keep on hacking that's something I
say at the end of every videos because I
want my audience to just keep keep
working at it as much as I have to have
patience with the channel they have to
have patience with their own growth and
evolution - alright okay so I'll see you
in another video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
