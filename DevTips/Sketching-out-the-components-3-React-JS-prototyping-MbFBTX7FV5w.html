high fidelity prototype in react J as
and in next episode we're going to talk
about the application that we are
actually going to be building and we're
going to sketch out the actual
components and you're watching dev tips
due to the editor and we're guest cells
for Travis and this is MP J and I'm
David what kind of app are we building
say your artwork and there is something
about your product that disturbs you and
you want to just try something new out
that would normally require you to go to
stakeholder and fight for a developer to
help you to do this but that's not what
we're gonna do we're going to learn the
basic skills of creating a react up not
a production ready one but a clickable
one that works so something that's
always bugged me with a Spotify desktop
app is you get a lot of tailless yeah
it's difficult to find the Paley's and
you don't get an overview of the
playlist alright so this is this is 45
the client that I used to work on I work
mostly on the desktop client here's the
playlist the playlists are top-level
here they're different from from albums
which are which are in these these
sections artists or the same way this is
this thing with the playlist that's nice
because I can click them and I have
really quick access to them but there's
also a benefit to having these kinds of
dedicated views for them these a great
in this aggregation Muse or whatever you
would like to call them because then you
can add things like sorting here like a
title you can sort my albums here by
title this is this a Swedish but I can
here's another filtering option that
that we can add and you can also search
just my my albums by sword of remember
remember something here I remember
getting a lot of feature requests from
my friends on on playlists and such as
sorting the playlist and filtering the
playlist but there is really no place to
do that also if there was a playlist
overview you there would it be a place
where we could
add interesting data about your playlist
like your most recently played playlists
or perhaps you were the total amount of
playlists you have or the total number
of hours your players at it like stuff
there's benefits to having an overview
and not just these these lists so that
is what I would like to try out and see
what we can do with let's sketch this
out we need some kind of tight them just
yes let's begin with that that's always
a good height so all right to know where
you're at
what's that gonna say it's gonna be like
David's playlists or something our MP
J's playlist or whatever then we talked
about we wanted some kind of we want to
do some kind of aggregation data it's
not too important exactly what because
we can we can probably iterate on this
as we go that's a nice part about being
able to be a develop designer that codes
is that you can kind of you don't have
to do too much up front design before
you give it to the developer because the
developer is you and you can just make
things up as you go so some kind of
aggregate numbers like yeah in the view
currently how many playlists are it oh
yeah that's excellent like fifty four
plates that's great and perhaps how many
hours of music is it in those players
sure like 200 14 hours exactly this is
one of the things like it might be
difficult to calculate that it might not
even be possible with the API not sure
but that's cool because this is to a
large degree an exploration of what we
are able to do easily as well because if
you are able to discover things and
limitations of the system while you are
developing so not only will this give
you a feel of what works for your user
it also gives you a sense of how hard
this this is to do so this is an extra
benefit to doing this kind of hacking
high fidelity prototypes as well then
we'd like a filter
yes yeah that's a looking glass
yeah like the filter box you don't feel
like that filter
you have sort now I think that we're
fine with filter yeah
maybe a sort later but it's important to
it's very important to keep your scope
limited otherwise you get confused yeah
and then we'll have like the playlist
the each individual playlist item
component so we have playlist playlist
one and then there's another playlist
and then there's another playlist and
then there's another playlist etc do we
want some kind of metadata here in
purpose length or something I think it
would be awesome if we could to have
like that just the three top three songs
or the first song to know like so even
though I made I call this like fall of
2009 it would be cool to see what was i
listening on that alright but add
something like that yeah so we have like
Queen here and Michael Jackson oh yeah
the artists that are in there there
would nice yeah artists or song I don't
know what special yeah some something
it's gonna be something there we'll
decide later as we go along I want to
talk about components here because I'm
an important part of react a thing that
react offers you is a component system
how how would one describe the concept
of a component hmm something like if you
think of CSS something you would add a
class to something that is reusable it's
works you can put it in many different
places but you specify it in one place
basically yeah that's an excellent
description so let's draw out what
things we envision to be separate
components here so I think that the
actual title that is just a component
that will be produced only once but we
call that component a here sure
and then these aggregates they work they
work the same it's a number yeah and
then some texts
components B yeah this filter that is
its own component yeah we will only use
it once because it's not logical to have
it in any other way yeah but it's kind
of it's also interesting to have it
contained in one component so that we
can work on it separately and then I
guess each playlist yeah yeah each each
playlists it's a component yeah we'll
put these as components as well yeah
that's what I'm thinking it's probably
something that we will play around a
little bit with start with these like
major components the the major playlist
component and then we could like if we
have the time add sub components
precisely because it might be
interesting for instance let's say that
this was a piece of a larger system then
these things would definitely be be a
separate components because you would
want to use the playlist items without
this this topless thing but for the
purposes of our how fidelity prototype
we don't need to think too much about
architecture in in a real application
application you would spend a lot of
time thinking about how do we architect
this the right way but this what we're
building is basically a a hack and we
shouldn't concern ourselves with not too
much but it's still sort of nice to
think in components because then when
you as a designer hand it over to the
developers if you have already done the
like big thinking of what is each
component then it's much easier for them
to implement it sure and it's also even
if you have done the wrong components
and stuff it's still you are still
speaking in their language because they
will know react and they will be able to
if you have used some kind of padding
somewhere or some HTML tagging or
something they will be able to reuse a
lot of their work in your
instead of re-implementing every single
detail on their own so I guess we should
start coding right I think so but before
we start coding we have to install a
bunch of things so we're next video is
about installing nodejs
yeah we're gonna talk about what knows a
little bit about what no js' is just a
little and the also install a package
manager you can click this episode here
to get started it sounds scary but we'll
walk you through it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
