about CSS floats now often confusing
this CSS property is fundamental to
understanding modern CSS layout now as
an added bonus I'll be using this speech
jammer app to make things a little bit
more fun this is CS CSS floats explained
on a speech jammer to CS SS clothes
explained on a speech jammer earth
so let's now now talk about clothes
floats are an interesting CSS as
property because they're not often used
what they were intended intended for for
now they'd been Julie became a staple in
CSS layouts strategy but they were
initially intended for like li layout
Flair a layout flare let me show you
what I wouldn't let me show you what I
mean I have a paragraph here with an
image in the front now you can see that
this image lines up with the BS baseline
with the text all images by default are
inline display types so they would
naturally be treated like another
character yeah in this string of text
now the ADA now the idea behind CSS
floats is to enable you to literally
float this object the to the left or the
right whichever you choose and have the
text kind of stylish Li float like float
up around it
creating a kind of visual style see I
float:left this is how it works out and
right here there you see it floated off
to the right just as you expected and
now this text that floats up around the
object is a big deal you notice that
everything is moving up up and moves
around the float object floating the
floating object pushing to the left or
the right a bit depending on the
direction we choose are they yes now you
can see when we look at them when they
look at the HTML markup that the first
element in the HTML is leaving is
leading the float if I flow at its
leading the float left if I choose to
float right it's the furthest all the
way to the right meaning that it's
leading the float okay this is difficult
too now let's talk about how to use
floats with layouts you don't have to
flow only H images you can flow other
HTML objects like containers as an
example if I float to para glass Leslie
they hear it they find them if I float
these two paragraphs here they
themselves are floated left and create a
type of column system now this is
important in order to float the autumn's
objects left
and have them look like you know columns
we need to have a defined width and the
widths need to make sure that there's
enough space left over on the road that
the other Kong can literally float up
next to it a few years ago some really
smart CSS developers noticed that you
can't below two objects side-by-side and
they thought hey what a great way to it
way to make a grid so this is one of the
most common ways that CSS grid systems
work I feel like I'm yelling one of the
earliest and most widely used grid
system was some sense was this was the
960 grid system this library came out a
few years ago and was used all over the
place but since but since then since the
960 grid system system that has led ways
to more advanced system so some of them
were flexible somewhere based on the
golden ratio show and more recently like
you more recently like you would notice
in the Twitter bootstrap grits systems
have become responsive meaning that they
will adapt like a four column will turn
into a three and a two depending on the
device that you're looking on or the
screens the width available to it okay
that should do it for them and turn this
off oh my gosh okay that should do it
for closed today next week we're going
to take a deeper look at grids
themselves if you enjoyed this video
