why we are using react js4 a high
fidelity prototype and why we think that
is a good idea and you're watching with
guest po mpj and david so we're gonna
make the case for react in six points
it's an industry standard it's growth
it's backed by Facebook and it has a
native components you can build apps
first industry standard react has
reached a point where it's arguably an
industry standard is it larger than Java
and.net or what do you mean by industry
standard I mean it's okay so I would say
if I compare this in designer terms I
would say that angular is the industry
it's the current industry standard for
building building web application single
page web could you say that angular is
like Adobe Photoshop yeah and react this
like sketch yes awesome growing it's
growing
yeah so that that comes back to the
Photoshop versus versus versus sketch
analogy because you want to be using an
industry standard that is actually
trending upwards and growing to becoming
the dominant industry standard as well
and react is definitely the strongest
contender in that that area the third
thing that speaks for react is that it
has a ludicrously strong ecosystem
because it has it has had a strong
position for many years now and it has
been growing for many years and there is
a lot of components and documentation
and forums and learning resources around
react yes so what do you mean by
ecosystem is that if I need something I
need help with something
this probably someone that has built it
already and I can just drag it in and
put it in like to my app yeah precisely
if there is some quirk or weird thing
with react yes that is going to be
really well-known in the community and
you're going to find our solution
solutions on the internet on how to work
around it it's backed by Facebook yes
Facebook yes it is it is it was built
internally at Facebook and used inside
of Facebook for I don't know many years
but a long time before it was launched
and why is this good it's good because I
really want to be using tools that a
company has been dogfooding themselves
for for a long time I think that angular
is sort of used by Google but it's not
like they don't use it in a ton of their
stuff it's it's very telling that a new
product like inbox for instance was not
built with angular or angular 2 but
while Facebook is using their stuff
using react for their stuff very
extensively what do you mean by small
yeah it's I mean I it's small in size
which is nice in a web application you
don't want to deliver this huge
libraries to declined every time but the
thing I want to focus on is that it's
it's small on a conceptual level so
there are lots of tools available like
like angular for instance which is a
very elaborate framework for building a
huge-ass real application it has routing
it has database layers it has networking
capabilities a lot of stuff and so
there's a lot of stuff to learn and
manage react on the other hand is very
very firmly just this little view layer
it's it's just there to render the view
and it's not concerned with any of those
other things which is very nice because
you can learn react very fast and get
going very fast and there's not a lot of
moving components it also has react
native so you can build
a native app out of your web app is that
right soda it's it's a No you can if you
build a web application you can reuse
the core logic of your component and put
that in a native app and render native
iOS components using the Arak reactor
odjick are you still writing it as like
HTML ish with it yeah if they have done
a they've created a flexbox
implementation basically for Android and
iOS because I don't if you have ever
worked with
iOS and Android they have these very
special layout components which are not
bad but it's extremely annoying to keep
that layout and the web layout and the
iOS layout in your head at the same time
but the gist of it is that you can build
native apps with react not embedded web
views that kind of sort of feel like in
native components you are actually using
the native components so if I learn
react I have all the tools I need to
build either a web app or an iOS app or
an Android app it's that is very close
to the truth and those are our reasons
for picking react Jay asks for this this
project and in the next video we will
start sketching out the components I'm
gonna put that over my head here so it's
gonna be a lot of drawing and we're
going to give you the first sense of the
actual application that we'll be
building awesome yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
