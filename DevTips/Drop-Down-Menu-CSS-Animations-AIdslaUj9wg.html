is Travis and lately we've been talking
about CSS animations and we've done a
few videos already we talked about the
technical aspects of the syntax what
they mean how does work and all that
stuff and last week we talked about the
UX narrative battalion behind animations
why did they why do humans like them
when's a good time to use them and one
wins when you know mm how to how to do
them right in terms of user experience
today we're just gonna be looking at fun
things to code and that's kind of what
we're going to be doing it for the next
few weeks we're just going to be doing
fun stuff and what we're gonna be doing
today is a what am i a CSS animation the
drop-down menu it's gonna be fun we're
gonna do four different styles of the
animation real quickly like hopefully
and I hope you enjoy it so sit back get
some popcorn some of you guys like to
watch this on the big screen I know if
you guys send me Twitter images as you
guys effects your feet cause your feet
and then face which have mixed feelings
about but anyway let's get started so
we're going to start right here in code
pin now because I'm doing this work in
code pin again remember that this is all
available for you guys to go and follow
the link that's in the description of
the video down below and check this all
out for yourself okay so let's start
with our markup I did the mark-up again
in Jade Jade is a a pre-processing
language if we go over here to view
compiled HTML we can see that this code
that I've written right here Jade
compiles into the regular HTML that
you're used to okay so let's look at
this HTML here and see how it reflects
what we have here on the right hand side
because understanding the markup ism is
important so we have a nav item and in
that nav item an unordered list and in
that unordered list we have four list
items each list item has a name style
one style too that's what these gray
things are here style one two three and
four and in each of those list items
there is another UL an unordered list
with a class of drop menu and then a
class of menu - one two
this one has three and the next one is
four and the list items are uno dos tres
cuatro Sinko CS and that's how we have
these drop-down menus right now let's
take a look at how this is possible with
the the SAS basically it's very simple I
am hiding the triggers right here I'm
hiding the lis that are inside of the
drop menu displaying none hiding and
notice that I'm talking about the lis
and not the menu itself right that's
going to become important in a little
bit and I'll show you why but I'm not
hiding the menu I'm hiding each item in
the menu individually and then when I
hover over one of these gray allies here
style one style two style three we're
going to look inside of it and find that
drop menu and then the Li is inside of
that which are these ones oh dear I just
mess that up okay then we'll have a
display block on it so we have a basic
hide in show with css.hide and show
right exactly
you've seen this a million bajillion
times I've probably wrote this type of
code a million bajillion in two times so
you've seen it exactly two times is two
times fewer than I've written it and we
want to make these things special so the
way we're going to do that is now
remember here how each one is labeled
menu - 1 min you - - we're going to take
advantage of that and rewrite this thing
here under menu one right here so we'll
say when you hover over a list item
inside of the list item drop menu and
we'll say specifically menu - - one look
at the Li and do something to it namely
make it block like it is above but take
it to a pay city or opacity you know
there's been a lot of comments how
people don't like the way I say opacity
but it comes from the word opaque so I
don't know why it's pronounced opacity I
don't say oh that's Barry you a pack I
don't I don't get it so I'm just gonna
say opacity like the way I like to say
things right it's my channel get your
own channel if you want to say things
differently opacity okay so let's take
the opacity down to zero and then let's
use keyframes to
to bring that opacity back in so I'm
going to say at keyframes and name the
keyframe menu one and we'll say from 0%
which will be like that opacity zero
again to 100% which will be that Oh a
city one right and now we have to use
this animation and then in SAS you can
do this animation and then : and then
below it's a name and you can break out
all these properties we did this in the
last video will say name is menu one not
in the last video but the video before
that menu one and a duration
let's say 300 milliseconds and what's
the other one eat of timing function
ease in out okay and let's check that
out it animates in and then disappears
animates in and disappears
question why does it disappear answer it
disappears because our fill mode is not
declared now this is the one of the
trickiest properties of the animation
family now what film mode means is you
know we explained it in the keyframes
and animation video two weeks ago but
basically is like where do you want the
animation to end at the beginning or the
end to make it end at the end you have
to actually write forwards it's not the
default thing but I use it most the time
so now when we hover over it should stay
up okay so now we see that we're not
getting a snap Ian like you're just a
display:none to a display:block like
these other ones we're getting a 300
millisecond fade in of the opacity
there's more we can do there
let's do also miss scroll up here
transform and this is what we're going
to start at we're going to say transform
rotate rotate why rotate why is like
that toward
you you know it's not like rotate around
its like this right so let's say rotate
Y 90 degrees so it's kind of like flat
at U and then we'll bring it in like
this and then we'll translate translate
Y which means like move it up or down
we'll say 30 pixels push it down 30
pixels and towards the end of the
animation we want to bring that to zero
pixels and negative and zero degrees so
it's so it's being where it should be
right and I think there's something we
want to do here oh yes in order to make
this rotate while I look very 3d ish we
have to go up here to the parent of the
thing that we're rotating yes and we
have to put this really cool not really
cool really really interesting CSS
property on it called perspective
perspective 1000 pixels I'm not going to
explain that right now we'll talk about
another day but let's see what it does
now we've got this rotating and lifting
kind of animation now remember earlier I
explained in great detail in great
detail how we are actually animating
each of these list items individually
and not the whole menu itself now this
is going to play come into play right
now when we can do something really cool
like like like like select each of these
list items individually and animate them
one by one let me show you how to do
that we're going to use some sass magic
here don't get too sad I'll explain it a
little bit not too too much because this
is not really a sass lesson but we're
going to make a loop here I'm going to
say at 4 and we're going to make an
iterator dollar I for the iterator we'll
say 1 through there's 6 items right yeah
right here
uno dos CS that's six one through six
and we'll put these guys under our our
Loup so for one oh I didn't right from
that was like I was like wondering why
this error was there okay
so you write this like this at for
iterator from one through six that means
that this thing will get written six
times and for each time this dollar
I will simple be a placeholder for the
numbers one through six depending on
which iteration it's on right this is
like if you guys are familiar with
JavaScript you know exactly what I'm
talking about
but we're doing it with sass right now
so let's create a selector that's going
to make sense to select each one of
these boxes here individually one two
three four five six we're going to do
that using the and nth child right nth
child and we want this to say one two
three four five six all the way through
the six is right and the way we do that
is using sass we say that dollar i but
that's not enough we have to use like
some more syntax to make it make sure
that the variable is not getting
confused and it's interpolate
incorrectly so use a pound and a little
ol one of these bracket bracket things
and now let's nest the animation under
the enth child and now every time this
iterator counts from one to six we'll
have an end child of one through six let
me show you the rasterized not the
restaurants the rendered version of this
view compiled and you can see here that
here we are a child one menu one and
child two and child three and so forth
looks pretty good pretty good it's still
all the same though nothing's different
between them so let's go in and make
each one of them have a unique kind of
thing look why are we counting from one
to six if they're all going to be the
same right so let's take that duration
and we'll say let's take that duration
and multiply it by the iterator so 300
milliseconds times one in the first one
will be three milliseconds but in a
second one should be 600 and so forth so
let's hover over style
and see that they oh there's a crescendo
here in the duration right not the delay
this is the duration so they're all
starting at the same time
boom all starting at the same time but
the last one here is taking so much
longer to finish its animation let's
let's use this the same technology the
same idea on the delay delay let's say a
300 milliseconds times that iterator and
let's get rid of the iterator on
duration and since there's going to be
300 mm I don't want 300 on the first one
so let's kind of wrap these around in
some brackets and then we'll minus 300
on them I think hope this works so what
I'm hoping for
let's just check it when poem 4 is the
first one to have a delay of 0 delay
delay of 300 - 300 that's not right
that's not right oh not negative 3 let's
try minus 3 maybe that space will help
us out there let's try that again look
there there we go
animation delay of 0 milliseconds for
the first one and the second one will
have 300 milliseconds times 2 minus 300
which will be 300 ah sometimes I can
math pretty good but most times I can't
so you're seeing this pretty lucky ok so
what I'm going to do then hover over
style 1 and each of these blocks these
elements these list items will animate
in but not the same time just
progressively slower like they were a
minute ago but all at the same speed but
progressively delayed choose your poison
you could say something like this - 100
and that way they would like still
animate while the other one was going
it's alright
oh no no I got it no 300 is good would
but we do 151 fitty because our duration
is 300 so if our delay is only one fitty
that means that the next one will start
in the middle of the animation of the
previous one let's check that out there
we go a little faster you don't really
notice that there's a problem with I
mean not that the problem but like that
the times are a little bit different in
fact it makes it looks a look a little
bit more fluid and I'm happy let's move
on let's let's take a let's take a
command copy of that one go down here
and do no but this time we're going to
do menu 2 we're going to do the second
one to please thank you and n all this
looks good except for let's change the
keyframe name to to good good let's keep
all this together except for the
keyframes let's try to you know just
mess with those because the animation
these keyframes are really where the
animation is happening so in this one
let's keep the opacity how it is that's
fine to have a fade in opacity but
instead of saying rotate Y let's rotate
X which is this way now not this way
it's this way I'm going to rotate X
negative 90 and take this translate off
completely and rotate X to 0 let's see
what we got
so you get like a flipping there you go
flipping a little bit but now we see if
it's pivoting from the middle that is
fine anything wrong with that but what
if we did a pivot from the top so this
would be like what does it transform
iridium a top center and that way it
looks like it's unfurling oh my goodness
look at that
it's an unfurl can you believe it that's
pretty nice unfurl but what if we did
this what if we did
like a like a 30% maybe and then we take
that transform and we take it past zero
and go like 20 20 degrees so it's going
to like flipping out a little bit and
then from 30 to 100 we'll go back to
watch the horses oh that's a lot less
uneventful maybe 20 is not drastic
enough maybe 50 degrees 30 is wrong 30
let's try 60
there we go now we look like like things
flapping out like doot doot doot doot
flappers spinners and flappers you know
that's how we do it
ok let's move on to stannum 3 and paste
it menu 3 menu 3 menu 3 menu 3 okay and
let's do the menu 3 a little bit
different
why don't we we have this rotate Y going
on here what about instead of
translating at from the bottom we
translate it from the top and we did the
opacity a little earlier so let's say
30% and move this one into 30% and
translate why oh oh whoa you have to
keep you paste it goes back to zero
weird okay now it's like now it's like
spinning down from the top kind of
similar to what one number one was there
what if we don't do any spinning at all
no rotates no rotates what we do is
scale scale yes that's not how you spell
scale scale I do you guys talk to
yourself this much when you code I don't
normally either scale so what should we
scale to scale to one but from what how
about 0.3 0.3 for a scale translate why
that is the movement now it looks like
it's building we have to translate why a
little bit more how about 60
oh wow and that's like falling I think
we're doing that opacity a little too
fast that's interesting what if we did
what if you did a little bit of a bounce
so let's take let's say 80% that's what
what is that 80% and we did like a
transform scale let's take that
translate y out scale to like 1.2 all
right
maybe this work oh another pop in
well we can also pop the the translate
let's do + pop the translate translate
to maybe 10 that's fun
our let's move on move on one more one
more
mini three got on a menu for last one
alright I'm just really I mean these are
not of course the only four that exist
in the world I'm just showing you could
just like make up this stuff and it
doesn't matter and you just tweak it
until it looks good that's what I'm
doing I'm making this stuff more or less
off the top of my head let's change this
scale to a rotate and this time let's
move that what was it this one transform
- origin top right right so now we're
going to rotate negative 30 degrees and
translate it just translate it right now
we'll see how that works
get rid of this 80% thing and make user
degrees see what we're working with on
or for Oh weird
oh that's actually nice that was
glitching at first probably is something
with the updating of code pan but I
think that's quite nice but we could
also do a trans late x 30 pixels and
translate x0 pixel so now it's like
scooping animation is pronounced more
because it's coming even further from
the right like it
thank you for watching this episode of
deaf tips I thoroughly enjoyed myself
and I hope you did too next week we're
going to be looking at some other UI
elements that are a really good idea to
use animation on I want to see any
avatars jumping I don't want to see any
letters animating in I don't want to see
any media objects bouncing we're gonna
animate the good stuff man I don't know
what next week is going to be out how to
society yet but it's going to be good
also I want to take a little bit of a
moment to thank the patrons of this
channel the patrons of the isn't what's
a patron a patient of the channel is
somebody who has has thought that these
things that I'm teaching that we're
discussing we're learning are valuable
enough that they have donated a dollar
amount of their choosing to the channel
