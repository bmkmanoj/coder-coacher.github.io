child and this is depth tips
ah so Travis and I go way back
while we first started talking forever
ago when he asked me to do an interview
here on deaf tips if you're curious
about how I got my start or how I as a
designer was able to teach myself how to
code using rails you can click here and
watch that interview but over the next
few weeks I have the pleasure of
teaching what I've learned and giving
you an introduction to the Ruby on Rails
framework so for those who don't know
Ruby on Rails is a fantastic web
framework that allows you to build
powerful and robust web applications
very quickly it's been battle tested and
proven by big companies like Twitter
Hulu Groupon Shopify just to name a few
so at the end of this five-part series
you're going to have built a simple
rails blogging application with dynamic
content at which point you're going to
be in a good position to dive deeper
into Ruby and Ruby on Rails framework so
the project files I used in this little
series will be available to the members
of the dev tips patreon community which
I'll tell you more about at the end of
this video but for now let's jump in and
talk about what rails is how it got its
start a little history lesson if you
will so what exactly is Ruby on Rails
well Rails is an open source web
framework that's written in the Ruby
programming language if you couldn't
already guessed that from the name
everything in rails is designed to make
your life as a developer easier and it
does that by making assumptions as to
what you'll need when you create a new
web application basically rails allows
you to write less code while
accomplishing more so rails was created
in 2003 by this guy David Hyneman Hansen
or DHH as he's known around the
interwebs
so rails was sort of a byproduct of dhhs
work on the project management tool we
all know today as Basecamp
in 2004 he extracted the source
of rails and release it as an
open-source project so it was in 2005
when rails 1.0 was officially released
and in 2006 rails really took off when
Apple decided to bundle it with the OS X
leopard operating system so if we fast
forward 10 years and over 50,000 commits
to the rail source later rails is on
version 4.2 and has been battle tested
by companies like Twitter Groupon Hulu
and Shopify just to name a few so there
are three principles that have guided
rails since the beginning and made it
into the awesome framework we all know
today first of which is the MVC or Model
View controller architecture next is
convention over configuration and then
finally we have derive
so the models inside the MVC
architecture are Ruby classes that
handle the business logic and do the
heavy lifting of your application they
talk with the database validate data etc
so views inside the MVC architecture are
templates that render data from the
model and handle the logic of the
presentation basically it's what the
user sees and interacts with so a
controller sits in between the model and
the view of your application controlling
the flow so a controller will do things
like handle requests and initiate
changes into your model so convention
over configuration or the rails weight
is a set of assumptions or defaults as
to the best way to do things
so rails is designed to encourage
certain ways of doing things and even
discouraging others all of which is an
effort to allow you to write less code
all at same time achieving more from
your application ok so I just want to
say thank you for watching this be sure
to join us next week when we go through
the process of setting up our
development environment with Ruby and
the Ruby on Rails framework so this
video was of course sponsored by the
awesome patrons of dev tips who all have
pledged an amount of their choosing to
help make each of these videos
possible so patrons get to enjoy these
videos a few days early and on this
particular series they get access to the
project code that we're going to be
creating together in this series to join
me as a patron and support dev tips be
sure to check out
patreon.com/crashcourse and until next
week when I take you through the process
of setting up your development
environment keep on hacking my friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
