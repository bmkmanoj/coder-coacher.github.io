Lowe's in the studio we're doing a dev
tip tonight if you're new to the channel
welcome we're talking about website
design and development specifically
tonight we're talking about responsive
web design ah so in the industry right
now there's a big shift going on
probably one of the biggest that I've
seen and I've been doing this for a
while
and everything's going towards mobile
and responsive design and this is
largely due to these little Punk's here
these mobile devices have really changed
the way that we as designers and
developers need to work if you do a
quick Google search you'll notice that
Internet traffic coming from mobile
devices at the end of last year amounted
to 27% of total web traffic that's a lot
man that's a lot it was mostly me now I
do a lot of Google's also says that it's
up about 70 percent from the end of 2012
only six months ago as you notice the
internet moves fast
so does load okay so let's talk about
how we handle mobile devices how we
handle responsive design this video will
cover three simple steps to code a
responsive website to make your website
look good on a desktop on a tablet on a
mobile phone
let's do code bro all right most mobile
browsers will take your website and
scale it proportionally to the devices
screen width when the problem is you
product design your websites look
awesome on the best tab or even better
on a laptop but the annoying thing is
you have to pinch and zoom about to
navigate your site or whatever it is
that you made filling just pinching and
zooming crisps or maybe you're trying to
click on a link which is a nightmare
zoom in and tap on a link now there is a
way to reset this default behavior the
meta viewport tag allows us to tell the
browser to use the device width as the
viewport width and to disable that
initial scale it looks like this
so now when you're looking at an iPhone
for example your website will be 320
pixels wide there will look like
somebody just kind of scrunched it in
there and that's good that's what we
want now we're going to think of each
one of our HTML elements as being one of
two types either a container or content
right a container is an element that you
use as a layout tool it has form volume
shape a classic example is the grid
container if you set your grid container
at 960 pixels wide its 960 pixels wide
it's not 1950 it's not 1200 its 960 Y
you can also have containers in
containers like a grid column in the
grid container let me show you to mean
I'm going to add two divs in here to cut
this group of paragraphs in half I'll
put a class on them a column and they'll
float them to the left the idea here is
that all of these container elements are
structural and used for layout they
inform the structure of the page Thomsen
elements are just like what they sound
like elements that hold content if you
take for example a paragraph it's as
wide as it's packed so if you have a
naked paragraph on a page it's as wide
as the page now on my desktop that's
going to be pretty wide but on my phone
it's going to be only that that 320
pixels wide the paragraph tag is just
holding the content it's not describing
its form so it's going to be flexible it
will assume the form of the container
that it's in so when I put that content
in a container that's when the magic
happens
now just to be clear their content
elements are not just paragraphs right
right yeah they can be images forms
buttons specifically anything that isn't
let's say that we have a container and
it's 960 pixels wide and Center just
like most of the websites on the
internet that you have ever seen the
problem comes when you view that 960
pixels wide website on a mobile device
remember the meta tag we've placed in
the head that meta tag keeps the website
from being scaled down but look at this
this 960 pixel wide web site looks
horrible on this little 320 pixel screen
it's just too huge so that's a problem
and we need to fix that now the last
ingredient in art that we need for our
responsive site is to reach in and
control the containers help them or
we're going to do that with media
queries media queries are little
snippets of CSS that query or ask the
screen what size it is you can tell a
media query to look for all kinds of
conditions example I'm going to say hey
media query if you see a screen size
that's smaller than that 960 pixels wide
which was the size of our container yeah
remove the strict width from that
container and let it be a flexible box
which will help it respond to the screen
size piece of the response nice also
I'll override these columns here to not
be side by side because I just don't
have the space for it now that I'm on a
mobile phone now we see it on the
desktop you'll notice that it's nice and
formatted to the 960 pixel container
that we set now when I'm some my phone
here you'll see that it's nice and
responsive it has responded to my screen
width and it's not ugly and hanging over
the edge as it was before
noise noise noise few words about media
queries media queries are very flexible
you can check if a viewport is smaller
than a certain size or wider or even
shorter and taller than a defined height
you give it you can even check ranges
like right here I'm checking if a screen
is between the ranges of 640 and 960 you
can even check for media types for
example on this one I'm looking to see
if this page is going to be printed out
so I could remove a background for
example and save on some ink when it is
printed in the example that traffic
in this video we looked at a site that
was designated for a desktop mm-hmm
right and then we caught the exceptions
and we fixed them
that's called a desktop first approach
or in other words a mobile last approach
a mobile first approach iver makes your
site look awesome on a mobile device and
then looks to the wider screens phil is
about responsibly now the cool kids are
all doing mobile first these days
bootstrap foundation frameworks this guy
personally I don't care I don't have a
preference I've done it both ways but
maybe if I become cool I'll start doing
it well first I don't know how these
three things are the basic essentials to
coding a responsive site now here's a
quick pro tip before we end for you guys
who want to know even a little bit more
about responsive design there are two
CSS properties that control the width of
an element in a very intuitive and
responsive way they are min width and
max width now max width allows your
element to be set to a specified limit
but it can also be constrained to
smaller width now Travis here is set in
the original container to max with 960
instead of with 960 now we wouldn't need
to use a manicure here at all
because once my screen width shrunk past
960 the width would just respond to its
width now in my example here it'd be 320
pixels the min width property will allow
my element to shrink naturally just like
normal but it would have a limit to how
small it could get I have an example
here I could tell that I wanted to row
of these three elements to be all on the
same line and then just to you know
shrink them down until each was 150
pixels wide now at that point they would
stop shrinking but if the container of
the row got down to 320 like it would be
on my phone I would just have two rows
the elements would just fold because
they would be 450 pixels wide together
and not have enough room in that 320
pixel container now there's a lot more
on this subject but using those three
things is a really really good start
when a sweater thing
what does that mean good luck okay good
luck yeah that's good when it's birthday
really exciting to share and announce
that all of the example codes that we
have now on deaf tips are going to be
found on the dev tips github profile you
can find the link to the you can find a
link to the you can find you can find
the link shut up you can find a link to
the profile in there in the description
the video description down below and
also a link to this specific repository
for the code in this video in the
description down below please check it
out take a look around and mess with it
get your feet wet get your face dirty
and it's fun that's suppository uh
repository repast suppository above your
bed yes if you have any questions or
suggestions just leave a comment below
and for the love and send this out at
least one person really else it really
does
hey guys thanks for watching keep
hacking go for a five powder at karate
chop those good yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
