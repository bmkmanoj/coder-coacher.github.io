show in this episode I review a Mac
application called cactus cactus is an
application that promises a better way
to hand code websites now the developers
for this application cactus have given
me a free license I want to pass it on
to you so stay tuned for after the show
I'll tell you how you can win this free
application now are with the show ah so
the other day
Louis was like yo you got cactus I'm
like huh he goes yo get cactus do codes
I'm like I so what is cactus cactus
describes itself as a better workflow
for hand coding websites what it is is a
really small and simple Mac application
that creates a sort of an all-in-one
development environment for making
static websites so in order to
understand like what cactus is and and
what makes it a little bit different you
have to understand what sofa is let me
show you a sofa sofa is a company that
was around from 2006 to 2011 and they
made really like really good-looking Mac
macintosh apps and they were eventually
bought by Facebook in 2011 so it's been
a few years and now the guys who were in
sofa have left Facebook and started
making apps again and cactus is one of
their first hellos we're making apps
again kind of releases I've already
downloaded cactus let me pull up my
trial okay
now you can see right away that cactus
is a beautiful beautiful app now
everything that sofa made was dripping
with style and cactus really is no
exception it's really beautiful it's the
one of the best Mac apps that has
applied that iOS 7 kind of look and feel
everything down from like the stylish
like the hairline icons down to the
borderless buttons here it looks very
cool very sexy
the idea behind cactuses is this
one-stop shop for these small web
projects you start with a template that
cactus has I'll just throw this on my
desktop so each project is in its own
little site here it's well organized and
everything is right there for you so let
me open it up in my editor which is cool
they know what my editor is and they
have it kind of ready for me cactus also
sets up a really quick server so notice
that my port is on 8 9 6 6 so localhost
8 9 6 6
what's cool about having cactus run a
local server environment is that any
device that's on my Wi-Fi can pull up
the website and I in test for
responsiveness right here and so that's
a nice feature right out of the box
at its heart cactus is a static site
generator which means that at the end of
the day it's gonna give you raw HTML CSS
and JavaScript files as the as the final
output as opposed to something like
WordPress which is PHP based which you
need a server to interpret and rendered
by the server at every request of the
user a static site generator will pre
render all of the HTML pages of the
website so they're fetching and serving
the static HTML files which is a lot
quicker now the templates that are used
to generate this static sites are built
on a templating language called Django
the templating language in Django is
Python based so it's really well
documented and has a pretty good support
community so if you have those questions
on how to use it and how to get what you
want done inside of it it's going to be
pretty easy to find those answers and so
that's really nice as well
I'm looking through these template pages
that are prepackaged with a cactus
project and I'm noticing that there's a
lot of nice trees in here like 404 error
pages and jQuery is included right from
the get-go
also included in cactus is a live reload
feature for your open browser so right
here I'm gonna go into the CSS and
change my body background color to red
and I'm gonna see that it will the
change will take place automatically
without me having to switch to the
browser and hit reload that's a really
nice time-saving feature that I
absolutely love in fact I can't work
without it any more hack this also does
a fair bit of pre-processing with full
sass and CoffeeScript
and it's really easy to do I just run
into my CSS folder start a new file I'm
gonna call it sass sass and then I'll
say body background pink and immediately
when I say if my sass is rendered into
vanilla CSS just like that I want to
take a little bit to show you these
other templates here and create a
default template my site that's cool and
this is that this is what the default
template looks like here is a blog
template and the hyperlinks all link
through to each other and these these
templates are really really nice really
clean and easy to hop around for a blog
and lastly here's a portfolio template
clean and simple I like I really like
this I think this is I think cactus is a
pretty great tool for anybody who wants
to whip up a really quick static HTML
site the app is really simple and easy
to use the code is nice and organized
and well-supported and the templates are
frankly beautiful now I do have a few
reservations with cactus the simplicity
of it which I like sometimes gets in the
way of the functionality for example if
I'm back in my sass file and I make a
mistake like I removed this space right
here and save instead of getting an
error like a good preprocessor would let
me know where the error was what line
and why cactus will just not do it
it'll just not pre-process my file and I
end up with a blank file and I never
know why so that's kind of annoying the
other thing that kind of gets at me is
that cactus is so simple and optimized
that it's really prescriptive of how you
code and output your sites so for
example when I want to deploy my site to
a server instead of just giving me the
option to FTP or SSH into any server it
really wants me to deploy straight to
Amazon s3 servers which if that's what
you're doing if that's your plan in the
beginning that's really cool that's a
really nice flow you just put your
access key in your bucket name and
you're you're hosted on Amazon that's
really quite nice but if that's not what
you're doing and that's not what I'm
doing
it can get in the way and it's just it's
just really like I feel like I'm on a
freeway that goes straight to Amazon and
I totally want to get off at my website
com exit or you know a bucket of chicken
and some root beer
I think other than those two things it's
a really cool little tool and for people
who want to use Amazon to host their
site once it's created and want to have
a really quick and beautiful template
already done for them or at least a
really good starting point with the
default templates I think I think cactus
is a really good a really good tool for
them if you've tried cactus and you have
other opinions leave them in the
comments down below and if you want to
know a little bit more about the other
tools that I use in my in my everyday
workflow leave a comments or questions
I'll be sure to answer those in the
comments down below thank you guys so
much for watching I can't wait to talk
to you about it soon
hey thanks for watching that episode I
think that you will like cactus just as
much as I did so here's how you can have
it for free just leave a comment down
below about the project that you're
gonna do first with cactus the best one
wins whether it's original personal it's
funny or whatever I'm just going to
choose them later on this week and I'll
send you a license for cactus for those
of you who don't win there's a link down
the description below two cactuses
website where you can download a 7-day
trial and try it out for yourself good
luck everyone and keep hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
