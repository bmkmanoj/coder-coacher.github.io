annual report every year I make a video
that looks back on what we've
accomplished in this previous year and
the goals that we have for the new year
coming I also have a pretty big
announcement at the end of this video so
yeah but before we get into that I'm
gonna share with you some real numbers
and hopefully you'll find these things
as interesting as I do we're gonna be
looking at three main things the first
one is the performance of the channel
the second one is the goals that I made
last year in kind of how I measured up
and then the third part is about the
goals that I'm setting for 2017 so part
one let's talk about performance in my
published videos let's see last year in
2015 I published 96 videos that's a lot
and this year I published 82 videos plus
another 32 videos that were only for
patrons and other special occasions now
it's always hard to predict what kind of
video will be popular this year the
most-watched video was the video that I
made quickly while I was trying to
create another series that was a lot
more ambitious so I made this video
about my code editor and my setup and it
turns out that that video has been
viewed over 1 million minutes long and
keep in mind that you know in a year
there's only around up five hundred
thousand minutes so so really this video
has been averaging two people watching
it at the same time somewhere in the
world 24 hours a day seven days a week
for the entirety of the year like who
are you to people that just don't stop
watching this one video okay let's all
my video views the year before in 2015
my videos got 2.4 million views and that
was really really huge for me but this
year we're hitting 4.7 million views and
that seems completely unreal the time
watch statistic is just mind-blowing my
videos have been watched for 24 million
minutes in 2016 that's that's like 46
years and 15 days crazy just crazy the
top three countries that are watching
depth tips internationally are
United Kingdom India in Germany which is
the same as last year and still the last
on that list is Samoa who watched five
minutes of dev tipsy this year and
that's and that's down from last year
when they watched six minutes so some
are like what's up
are we not all right now let's talk
about subscriber growth views and
engagements and comments and likes
they're they're really important
statistics but the subscriber count is
something that's super easy to
understand and just kind of like watch
it grow so let's talk about subscriber
growth my goal for ending 2015 was to
have 70 thousand subscribers and I hit
that number on January 1 this year and
that was a pretty cool moment for me
that took about two and a half years to
get there in the following year this
year 2016 we're going to end that number
on 170,000 so that means 100,000 new
people have like found this channel and
decided that they liked what was
happening enough to click the button
because they might want to see another
video someday and I like so I'm so
grateful for that okay so now this is
part two we're gonna look at the the
goals that I had for 2016 and how I
measured up to those goals okay so this
is like a accountability right now so
the first thing I wanted to do was I
wanted like I had this vision for
deafness I wanted to expand the
operations 2016 was a year of growth and
I attempted to grow alongside with the
channel but I mean but honestly I don't
think that I did a very good job here's
a few examples of that I tried to hire
an editor but I kept like failing to get
the clips to her on time and I was
always ended up just like editing the
videos on Sunday night to get it out
there for Monday release because I have
no idea how to budget production time
fail another thing was like I tried to
be more involved in the community more
we're speaking engagements meetups and
and and those moments have been really
really great moments but
but it's hard because it's hard to move
my body around that much and I'm
realizing that I may be a little bit
more introverted than I thought I just
get really I could really like wiped out
from this stuff and all that growth that
I described earlier means that there's
less Travis for each of you and for the
people that have been deaf tipsters for
a long time that kind of sucks and it
might feel like I've disappeared in fact
I kind of have I no longer replied to
every comment I can't
I no longer reply to every email I just
I can't there's just too many I'm just
being real with you guys right here this
is one of my biggest struggles I feel
like some of the expectations I put out
there early on I'm just I'm just failing
to meet and instead of being attentive
and helpful I end up just being a jerk
and I know that more than a few people
have
I've stopped watching the show or even
stopped being a patron because I am
letting them down and I don't know what
to do about that I don't know I don't
know if that's okay so anyway that's the
expand operations goal that I had and
another big goal ahead was to strengthen
the community and I think that you get
the idea I feel like there's a strong
dev tips community like the depth tips
patrons slack channel is always poppin
and there have been like tons of patreon
community hangouts and projects and that
really really like really warms my heart
to see and that's all great but it's not
because of me which is actually a good
thing I think because really these
people in the communities and in the
chat they've come together to connect
and to support it to grow with each
other and that's really the best outcome
that I could have that could have
happened so I'm gonna count that kind of
as a win actually let's do that
and even though I feel like I'm failing
the community the community is still
still rockin and I like that another
goal that I had in 216 was to do things
that improve other people's lives and
that's an important part of what makes
me happy and and feel like a human of
consequence I try to look for ways to
relieve the suffering of others apart
for making educational materials I try
to
provide people with you know the
resources that they need to improve
their lives and last year I made a goal
to donate three thousand dollars of dev
tips income to charity and we did that
it happened with with your help with
your patronage and your views and your
enthusiasm for like the very few
sponsors that dev tips has taken we were
able to donate that three thousand
dollars and then because I work at
Google they match those donations
so the overall value of the benefit was
six thousand dollars to people who need
help and I mention that because it's
important to me dev tips doesn't
generate a lot of money it's it's not
about that but it does a little and
you're a part of that and you should be
able to enjoy the idea that you helped a
child eat it just by being here by being
involved being interested my final goal
I think it's the final one was just to
have fun what does that mean right just
to have fun well sure I said that if
it's not fun it's not worth it and I'm
not into it
so I'm going to be really judicious
about the things that I do I want to
have fun and not lose sight of that
again that was a quote from last year so
so you know I mean I don't know like how
do you measure fun and maybe you've
sensed like a theme in all like these
goals right there's like maybe you've
seen that anything that I've tried to do
the things that succeeded in those that
failed were like really I don't know if
I was coming across actually but those
successes were always overshadowed by
the weight of my own expectations and
the guilt of my shortcomings so I'm a
person right and I like a lot of you
your I'm a dynamic and complicated
person with a lot of different interests
and abilities and needs and I feel like
the video schedule of dev tips and the
content that I've been maintaining for
the past three years have driven me down
a specific and single road and I'm
looking around now
and seeing that I'm kind of not really
happy with you know or even interested
in that persona I wouldn't describe what
I've been doing with dev tips like the
types of videos that I've been making in
a schedule that I've been making them
out wouldn't you know at least for the
past six months I wouldn't describe them
that's fun
no more like more like drudgery or doing
a chore like with a smile so if my goal
is to have fun then like man I gotta say
there have been some great moments
mostly those moments came from meeting
people and and and having conversations
or like working on ideas with other
youtubers but but when it comes to like
making the videos and managing my
channel I would say that I failed at
this goal too so let's talk about part
three part three is the part where I
make goals for 2017 I guess really it's
gonna be a short section because in 2017
I have no goals for dev tips none none
at all so there's this there's this
parable about this woodcutter he's very
strong and very proficient and he's
skilled with his accent and he asked a
job from this timber merchant and he got
it and the pay was really good and the
working conditions were great and for
those reasons the woodcutter was like
really determined to do his best job his
boss gave him an axe and sent him to the
area where he was supposed to do his
work and the first day that woodcutter
brought in like 18 trees which was like
a record and it wasn't like so good and
the boss was like man that was amazing
keep going and he was so motivated by
the boss's words and the success of the
first day that the woodcutter tried
harder the next day but for some reason
he could only bring in 15 trees and the
third day he tried even harder but he
could only bring in ten trees and the
day after that and then after that he
was bringing in less and less trees and
the woodcutter thought I must be like
losing my strength and he went to the
boss and apologized saying
you know I can't understand what's going
on and the boss stopped and said when
was the last time you sharpen your axe
sharpen my axe
the woodcutter replied I had I have no
time to sharpen my X I've been very busy
trying to cut trees guys I'm gonna be
honest with you I feel along with that
woodcutter right now I feel like I've
been so busy creating videos and trying
to you know and failing to launch
courses and send posters and organize
communities and so much more that I've
just become very very dull so I'm going
on a hiatus and that's the big news
there will be no dev tips video next
Monday and that's a hard thing to say
since I've never missed a week in the
three years that I've been doing this
but next Monday will be the first week
that I'm not gonna publish a video and
now you may be asking how long will this
take how long how long will I be gone I
don't know I'm asking myself that same
question like I could be re-energized in
a few weeks and be back but it's not
likely but it could be like six months
but that also is not likely it's likely
somewhere in there you know in between
so I'm gonna be relaxing on the videos
but I'm gonna be trying to use that time
to get done all of the projects that
I've been wanting to do for so long and
I couldn't because yet another video was
due on Monday it's like a reoccurring
due date it makes it really difficult to
do new things right so I do hope to make
periodical like update videos and maybe
some videos about what I'm learning and
along the way but the idea here is not
to say that I'm tying myself down to a
schedule and I'm releasing myself from
the expectation all debt that I've been
that I've been drowning in for the past
six months so thank you to everyone who
has supported dev tips over the years
we're all passing ships in the night
it's been a beautiful experience to meet
you all and to share what we've shared
thank you to everyone who's been a
patron of the channel your philanthropy
is flattering and encouraging and and I
and I love you very much for everything
that use you and to the patrons I'll be
having one last community hang out soon
so so please join in for that good night
everyone and don't stop hacking because
I certainly never will always be hacking
differently now
