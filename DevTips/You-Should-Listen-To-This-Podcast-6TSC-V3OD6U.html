a great Saturday what am i doing this
weekend well I'm listening to one of my
very favorite podcast developer Teague
and you should too the host of dev tea
Jonathan recently had me on the show and
we talked about dev tips and well you
guys really as a community you may
remember Jonathan Cottrell from a few
months ago I was so impressed with
Jonathan because of you know his message
and the way he delivered it but since
I've had him on the show Jonathan has
been climbing the iTunes charts and he's
just he's been sitting at the top
positions in the developer category for
a while now and for good reason it's
just great so in the last two episodes
of Jonathan's podcast we have a really
frank discussion about what it's like to
publish content regularly what it's like
to build an audience and a community and
what it is that motivates us to do these
things I tell them about the mission of
dev tips and about the many rewards that
I get from all this work that I do and I
also talk to him about the vision that I
have for the future of dev tips so if
you haven't already I really recommend
that you go and subscribe to developer
tea and listen to those past two
episodes
I mean I've listened to them twice
already I don't know if it's like cool
to admit that or not but there it is you
can find the podcast on iTunes or on any
of your favorite podcasting apps and you
can also visit developer t-dot-com
to stream it directly in your browser ok
thanks everyone and stay tuned for
Monday's video where we revisit the
series of parallax on the web and until
then keep on hacking and also listening
to developer tea right I'm serious
though because I mean we're talking
about you it's going to even a little
bit anyway
developer tea developer tea Jonathan had
me on developer tea it was fun it was
neat
it was the developer tea off the dome
right there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
