Travis and you've made the right choice
whatever you're deciding on it's
probably the right choice
ah so today's video is inspired by a
question that I've been getting a lot of
lately and I want to talk to you guys
about tooling and using tooling in a
professional session so the question is
something like this what should I learn
sass less stylus which is used in most
companies like what should I use to
prepare myself to be a bulwark in a
professional environment and I'm going
to extend this conversation to talk
about Jade as well I get some comments
about my use of Jade in the videos okay
so um I think that this is kind of the
wrong question to be asking if this is a
if this is a question in your mind what
I would say to you is don't worry about
sass or less or stylus or even Jade or
any kind of tool set that is available
to for you to make your work better and
faster and whatever don't worry about
that stuff don't worry about it at all
until you feel very very very
comfortable with writing regular plain
HTML writing regular plain CSS and
understanding a good chunk of JavaScript
and how to use it to get what you want
out of it right if you understand those
three core technologies of the web
everything else is just intended to
speed you up don't worry about sass
don't worry about less and don't worry
about like even like uh you know
workflow things or compiling things
don't worry about grunt or gulp or don't
worry about Bower or don't don't worry
about your text editor don't worry about
you know don't worry about any like new
cool thing like we just did a bunch of
stuff on parallax I mean I know you guys
like that stuff and it's fun right like
it's super fun to do I like it too
but don't worry about that stuff don't
worry about it at all until you have a
super solid grasp
of of what HTML is how it works and what
it you know what it's for and then
styles what are they for what what are
what are these
you know selectors and and what are the
advanced like like it basically the
videos that I did a long time ago the
kind of art crap but they're they're
they're fundamental right so the videos
are the html5 basic series and the CSS
basics series if you've not watched
those and you have a question of you
know what is a preprocessor which one
should I choose stop right there and and
go watch those so there's like five
videos in each one or seven videos in
each one but what they will do is
they'll give you a foundation and maybe
they won't like make you a rock solid
foundational developer but they'll tell
you what you should be understanding at
least and point you in the direction of
where you can get more understanding and
I see this a lot actually that people
want to run before they can even walk
and you know they want the big exciting
parallax II stuff or they want to use
the new tool or the the new like
workflow or processor or preprocessor
without having a solid grasp on the
foundations I'm not saying you need to
be like a like the authority on CSS
before you should even get into sass or
less but I think you know you're going
to be tripped up on things that are
extensions of CSS before understanding
actual CSS so if I'm talking to you
about all this stuff right now and
you're like I dude I got I know CSS I'm
sorry for wasting your time don't listen
to me go enjoy yourself but so now I'll
talk to those people those people who
are they feel that they're legitimately
prepared to to you know
extend right extend their their workflow
via pre-processors or whatever
I'll talk to you about what is common in
the work industry
nothing is common everything is all Wild
West but I do see a lot more sass than
less sass is in my perspective again and
and your experience might be different
if you have more input if there's
actually like like a census on this
please leave a comment in the in the
video and help us all learn together but
in my experience what I'm seeing around
me is that sass is definitely more
popular and people like the S CSS
extension which blows my mind but and
then and then jade is not popular at all
people don't use jade partly because
it's so so tooling and frameworks for
your markup is is like there's like a
lot of crap that goes into that and I'm
sure like if you've written any language
if you've written any PHP if you've used
any JavaScript frameworks like angular
or backbone or react or anything like
like all of them will just mess up your
markup because they're very opinionated
about the market so if you have a
preprocessor like Jade and then you want
to run it through Jade and then let come
back into it and have like your
handlebars tags or your like anything
that like injects itself into the markup
it's going to be like weird and hard so
I only use Jade if the project that I'm
doing is just like a small kind of
self-contained thing and it's not going
to grow out even if it even if there's
going to be other developers working on
it I'm like very hesitant to use Jade
not because it's sucky it's awesome it's
really awesome I love Jade but it's it's
like it's not standard at all like even
like way lower standards and then what
sass is or even less or stylist so but
yet to answer the question about what's
used most commonly in the industry I
would say sass scss inversion is the
most popular followed probably pretty
closely by less and that's only because
I think of of
a bootstrap because bootstrap uses less
but I did see a tweet the other day from
@m do mark Otto the guy who the guy who
initially started bootstrap he said that
version 5 I think a version 4 of
bootstrap will be will be SAS you know
they're going to switch from less to SAS
officially and I'm that's pretty telling
right that's pretty telling of where the
industry is going and where the support
is kind of piling up on yeah so that's
the answer to your question I think the
main point I want to stress is that you
should not worry about this stuff until
you feel that you are rock solid in the
foundational things like HTML CSS and at
least have a hireable knowledge of
javascript and then you know start
worrying about your workflow start
worrying about your build tools start
worrying about your processing and start
worrying about lino like your
environment and your your ID ease and
you're like you know your get and you're
open like contribute now and all that
stuff like don't worry about it until
like you have the foundational stuff
like really I'm serious but in the
meantime like have fun right like just
enjoy it and enjoy the process of
learning and enjoy everything that's
possible and make your dreams big and
take take realistic steps to achieve
them through through foundational
principles like learning HTML and CSS so
I feel like I've gotten to the point
where I'm rambling now so I'm just going
to cut myself off thank you so much for
watching dev tips this is just a video
that I just wanted to kind of just give
to you guys in a quick way in the middle
of doing a whole bunch of other projects
I just wanted to talk to you about this
topic which I think is is pretty
important especially for people who are
just you know coming into this this
industry coming into these these things
and
it can be overwhelming I understand
there's so much out there and in the you
know the barrier to entry is only
escalating and so I feel for people who
are new to this work and who are trying
to get just like get their mind around
everything I know that there's a lot and
that's really why I tell you to focus on
the fundamentals right now so my name is
Travis this is dev tips if you are not a
subscriber to deaf tips
man I really think you should be and
then also if you want to support the
channel we have a patreon page so visit
patreon calm
thank you so much for watching and until
we talk again keep on hacking just keep
on doing it we'll see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
