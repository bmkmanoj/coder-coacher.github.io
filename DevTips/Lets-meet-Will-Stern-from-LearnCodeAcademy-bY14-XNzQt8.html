name is Travis Nielsen and if you're not
familiar this is a channel where we do
website design and development and we
are excited today to have a fantastic
developer on the channel I've been
talking to will for a little bit now
he's a is a really great human say hello
will hey how's it going everybody wills
channel is called learn code Academy
that's a YouTube channel assignment yep
uh yes that's a YouTube channel and you
can click on this space area right here
I'll probably put a logo on it and you
can go check out his channel right now
he also has a web site called learn code
dot Academy not calm dot Academy where
he puts up his did things yeah it's in
progress now so there's nothing there
yet but it's coming soon very soon great
so this is part one of a two-part video
series where we'll and I talked today
we're - in this video I'm mostly talking
to will and asking him questions and
he's feeding us very interesting
information and in the next video which
you can find on his channel will be more
of will asking me to give advice for new
creators and people looking to break
into the design and development industry
so take a look at that again you can get
those videos right here and they're also
going to be in the description the whole
time the video is on and let's get
started ah so everybody that watches my
channel will know that it's it's a mix
between you know we definitely talk
about web development and tutorials and
specifically how to create websites but
we also talked about the human side of
it you know and we keep in mind that
when we're when we're building these
things we are building them for humans
and it's going to be you know these
these these creations these products
these interfaces that people are
touching that are connecting them to the
world at large so in the end it's just
human to human with and were aided by
these machines and so I want to talk
today about will the human so can you
tell me a little bit about you know why
did you start so we'll start with
YouTube and then we'll go backwards so
why did
start doing a YouTube channel ah good
question um I started doing the YouTube
like the very Ellis Lea the very first
videos I did is I've kind of in the last
couple years
I'm always telling friends and people I
know that I how great the web dev
industry is because I think it's just a
killer industry to be in yeah especially
if you like computers it's so much fun
and it's a great job stable job so much
opportunity so I'm always telling people
this stuff and their reaction to any
techie kind of person or personal
executers is well what do I do to get in
it I'm working at Starbucks like what do
I do to go there I think that's I agree
with you and so I found a lot of people
saying hey can I buy you coffee you can
tell me how to get rolling or can can I
come and sit down you can show me how to
start an HTML CSS JavaScript and so it
kind of got to be more than I could
actually to do and so I found myself
saying leaving those times saying man I
wish I would have recorded that so I
could just show it to the next ten
people that asked mm-hm
um so I said I just kind of said to
myself well you know hey if if you have
a down Saturday or you know you have
spare time let's just start putting
these on YouTube for the world to see
why would I just show my friends when
tons of people can benefit from it um
and it took off a sec okay Wow people
really want to know this there's yeah
there's definitely a need for it
especially for someone you know uh
someone who has the ability to explain
themselves and explain what they're
doing well I think that's one of my the
things that I struggle with on my
channel is to talk while I'm doing stuff
it's actually really hard but it is
tough you'll see my brain freeze
sometimes just qohen stops and my mouth
stops yeah yeah yeah it's embarrassing
how many times I misspell like simple
things that I do every day
I mean so but okay so in that in our
industry it's quite common for people to
make the jump from writing code to
writing a blog or writing a book or even
like podcasting why did you choose video
and then why did you choose YouTube
instead of like another host and being
Vimeo or another hosting platform yeah
um
I mean really I picked YouTube because I
just figured it's it's kind of like the
platform right now it's going to people
are going to search that and I also know
that if people are going to search
Google and you happen to be the number
one video spot they'll see you there so
I just I just was like you know I think
this is if I'm going to do this to help
people that's the place to put it out
yeah that's the occasion any other
motive than just let's get it to people
I mean everyone smile and adil play and
I'll get get some change here and there
and that's kind of growing as it's
getting more popular but the goal was
just let's help people for free that's
it that's an admirable goal um so so
let's jump backwards then like where did
you come from
who are you uh did you did you grow up
being interested in tech and what's that
story like and um yeah I'm gonna
definitely always love computers I mean
my parents gave me I was home-schooled
my parents just gave me free rein over
the computer and there's there's
definitely several times it's like a 12
year old I accidentally erased every
file on the root level of the archive
and then this is back when you're like a
DOS prompt thing and so I was like oh my
gosh how can I get all the files back on
there before I shut down the computer
and don't know what to do but the right
definitely had some like scary moments
spending the next eight hours trying to
make sure my computer had all the files
it had no I don't even that would just
tank a computer these days but so yeah
just kind of always enjoyed it and then
got into web dev stuff probably I was
sixteen or eighteen like HTML was a baby
like blink tags right I mean scrolling
marquees myspace wasn't even there yet
so I kind of dabbled for a long time did
you make an atomic got like have you
ever made a table based web site oh yes
oh yes
tables were were the thing yeah
absolutely it was cool I was it was cool
to be good at tables it was yes and the
ugly ones with the gray shadows yeah
yeah if you could figure out how to like
do this you know more intricate layout
using like several different tables
nested and within each other you you I
wasn't that good
oh that was like a homer he goes rolling
marquee tag either on how to get it to
work
the monkey tag awesome bringing back so
many memories so you start like when
you're 16 or so I mean just just for fun
I'm just doing nothing I guess I kind of
started helping people for free with my
church for free I mean okay sure try
website in 99 I mean just kind of the
bottom of the barrel as far as anything
could be so um yeah and then started
kind of just slowly doing stuff for
people on the side for 100 or 200 bucks
I hold its studio 31 design and then got
my first job at webmd.com which is a
huge just giant company um I don't know
how I got it wasn't anywhere near good
enough to get in there there's like 50
front end developers there and somehow I
got a job there and and that just kind
of made things take off got my butt
kicked for a year and a half when when
was that welcome 25 years ago okay but
probably five years ago so yeah I
probably stayed this like amateur level
for eight years which is really easy to
do actually it's really easy for people
to stay just because you don't know
there's this whole other world of pro
level building applications there's like
there's web content and then there's
there's web applications and it's really
easy to stay in that web content world
forever and I don't think if I ever it
somehow got that job at WebMD that I
think I probably would have stayed just
kind of content land forever and not
really made that shift even if even if
you stay front and there's there's like
and there's levels and levels levels to
that so I'm not like the man yeah I'm
still just feeling like a nubian I think
you always do in web dev though I think
that's the only way because I mean
things so fast but also you have to like
remain
I don't know humble or something that
yeah yeah it's like I've been doing
multi page single page app JavaScript
stuff for the last five years and my CSS
CSS has changed a lot in four years so
so I see these slick cool things that
I'm like that just weren't around two
years ago and I
and had to do those and so yeah you
never have it figured out and if you do
get ready to lose your job within five
years that reminds me of like there's
this story AK I think it was between
Biggie Smalls and jay-z and when jay-z
was a young rapper biggie tells him to
uh to always be an intern or hustle like
you are still an intern for it you know
for even I'll get big and it's it yeah
yeah I just have that so I'm really
really interested in those kind of like
those gray years you know like like
you're not a newbie and you're not you
know you're not hitting the that the
hockey stick on the graph yet you know
like there's that there's that struggle
or that thrash that you need to kind of
go through and I think that you know we
you you meet so many people now and this
is just happening more and more that now
that we're doing channels and I'm sure
it's the same for you but we meet so
many people that want to know how to
just jump right over that step you know
and yeah and the hard thing I mean what
how do you answer that somebody who says
like okay what do I do next
or you know like how do i I've learned a
little bit gmail a little bit of CSS a
little bit of JavaScript how do I be a
pro yeah totally I the number one thing
is is if you can find a job that you can
barely get intern or get around people
if you can't get a job that puts you
around people that can just teach you
the tools and the toolkits and the way
that happens in the way that works then
then I mean the number one step is you
got it you got to know what you don't
know and that's I think the biggest
thing is is most people just don't know
what they don't know I know that's kind
of like a tongue twister but like just
build tools and why like so so much of
front end out used to just the HTML CSS
JavaScript and now you're doing builds
on the front end and you're building out
and compressing javascript files and
minifying and linting them and and doing
source control
and your your you have strategies on how
you're going to deploy resources and
this is all just front-end stuff this
this used to be what the true engineers
did and now it's kind of its kind of
reaching the whole spectrum mm-hmm and
getting just getting around people and
asking how does your workflow go how do
you do stuff on this level and so your
advice would be to surround yourself
with people that are already there so
you can level up that did my sacrifice
sign I never want to not know somebody
who can kick my butt you know I mean
it's just like that's just asking to
stalemate in the next three years or at
least slow track yourself yeah that's a
really good point so how do you yourself
keep up to date I try to I try to follow
guys on Twitter addy Osmani is I mean I
tend to live a little more JavaScript
world right now as far as the stuff that
I'm emphasizing with work day-in day-out
tends to be JavaScript in nodejs right
and so I try to follow guys that are
just the best in the industry on that
and they're usually tweeting about stuff
I don't understand and so I can either
kind of avoid that because it feels
painful or I can just dive into it and
force myself to barely like I remember
when I was starting out EOS Monte has
this book an e-book called JavaScript
design patterns uh-huh when I was just
starting JavaScript um I read this thing
and it was just like a foreign language
to me and I could kind of do jQuery
stuff but this was different
yeah and so I forced myself to like hand
code as examples not just read them and
copy-paste but actually type them out so
it would stick and um and I didn't get
it and so I forced myself to do it again
the next month I'm gonna do it again
the whole book then it was started
clicking okay so now you're rolling with
your channel and you're doing coding for
a living did you I mean it was this your
first career or did you have a whole
nother career first you wash cars for a
living well how did you make the
transition like I want to know like that
that initial struggle is what I'm really
interested in
gotcha I mean well my dad's my dad
always made sure he said you're never
gonna get a job for someone else so you
work for yourself so I did lawns
starting at 13 okay it's an entrepreneur
beginning huh entrepreneur from the
beginning yeah yeah I guess I mean while
your friends are working at Baskin
Robbins for four and a quarter an hour
you're making twenty an hour I guess it
kind of spoils yeah I hate it though um
so let's see okay so the actual first
real job mm I think so around 18 19 I
had volunteered helping my church with
their website for free for a couple
years and then there's some guy who just
kind of he sold music and add CDs not
some guy he's just a guy that did that
and uh he said hey we help me you know
builds my online storefront and all that
stuff I'll give you a ten an hour it's
like hey this is great some more than I
would get anywhere else and so I took it
so I guess is technically I was doing
really more graphic design form than
anything else um till I kind of came
from a design backgrounds so yeah come I
kind of had done design now not
professional not good just bad design
right some dude with photoshop on his
computer yes that somehow is what I
ended up doing for him most of the time
and kind of stay in that design world
for about seven eight years would put
out informational basic WordPress sites
where I'd do my best to hack a template
but pretty much slicing PS DS was as far
as I went and um the transition I think
the transition really happened when I
cut up a friend asked once I was working
designed for him he said I mentioned
that I kind of do websites he goes oh do
you do DD CSS layouts and it just kind
of clicked no I don't but I've heard
that term before and I really should
right and so that was the point I
decided I'm going to stop slicing stuff
up having Photoshop or Dreamweaver
whatever export my layouts for me just
probably gives or tables
what it did probably terrible code yeah
well if you're gonna do like the slices
inside it's going to give you tables
yeah so it was it was I decided I'm
gonna I'm gonna force myself to learn
this kind of put together my first
pieces of bricks CSS layout and it kind
of began so no run about right around
enzyme that that lots of resumes are
saying must be able to hand code HTML
CSS yeah because a lot of guys didn't do
that so I think that's how I got that
first job doing it so this is like
around 2000 or 2002 yeah so for me it
was later oh it was definitely later so
it must have been passed that is
probably 2008 oh okay we're talking like
six years ago it was not that long ago I
mean I was really kind of just graphic
designing for a long time then made a
shift it was like this is what
development feels like I'm going all out
this is fun so you don't you don't
really work with design at all
now you most it's all development yeah I
really don't I mean at first I missed it
because you really do I mean design
design is fun and coding doesn't seem
fun at first and but it's like this it's
like this endless thing that you can
never get to the bottom of the barrel of
and it it's really addicting in a lot of
cool ways and it gets very very creative
yes yes I find it really satisfying
probably even more than design I don't
know if I'm saying that right I think
that it's because with design you finish
a piece and then there's always opinions
right it's there's feedback and there's
iteration and there's like which is all
good and healthy but with with code you
just kind of like you find out a
solution and it's good that's the
solution and it'll stay there until you
circle back to it in three months or
whatever your iteration cycle is you
know and then you revisit it and you go
why did I write it that way
I'll do it I'll do it yeah I'll do it
better this time but but like it's it's
not like people argue with it and and if
they do it's it's not really I mean it's
more of a learning experience like oh
there is a better way definitively
I guess that gets down to the bottom of
it is that there is a right answer yes
where's design somebody's bad at design
will ask for an abundance of drop
shadows and like bevels and just like
they will they will think that that's
cool when that is terrible they're not
going to argue with your code when it
just works day in and out yes that
that's yet and and you know you're your
boss or your CEO is going to look at
your designs it's gonna say I don't like
this or I do like this
he's never gonna look at your code and
say you know you really should close the
you know print on the end there that's
right yes say good analogy that is
exactly the reward isn't is really it's
totally all there in a lot of cool
unique ways all right thank you so much
we'll for being on the show everybody
here appreciates it if they don't say so
I'm saying it for them and then again
everybody remember that you can take a
look at wills channel learn code Academy
and his website at learn code dot
Academy now it's not calm that's dot
Academy and will is is doing some really
really great tutorials and instructional
videos there and we're so so grateful
that you you're on the show today super
huge honor to be here thanks for having
me all right take care everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
