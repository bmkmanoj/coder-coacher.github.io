interesting video for today something
that I would just like discovered this
week if you follow my Instagram you may
have seen that I've been posting new
this new website of them messing with
and on that website are these buttons
that I've been kind of like trying to
get right there this little icon the
cutoff flips out when you hover over it
so I'm missing this button style and
trying to get it to work the way I have
in my mind and and I come across the CSS
property that I never knew existed so
let me show you what I mean and then
after this tip I'm going to talk about
what's going on with the channel and
what you can expect in the next coming
weeks I have some representations of the
idea here where we have a home button an
account button and like a was it was
crazy button and when I want it I wanted
to have these like icons flip out when I
hover over the button so what I did was
I transformed them to rotate Y so they
would just kind of flip towards the
camera at 90 degrees so you don't see
them because they're perfectly like
about holding a sheet of paper toward
the camera and when I say camera I mean
this the viewer me my eyes when i unlock
this part too so when I hover over its
going to rotate it back to zero degrees
so it should be basically just kind of
like flip into view like that okay
which is nice now the first thing I want
to do to make this look a little bit
better is attach the transformation to
to one of the sides see how it's kind of
floating out from the middle of the area
right there I want to use a an attribute
called transform origin and I'll say
left and left means the thing that's
transforming which is the icon it means
it will rotate out from the left that
will be the origin so now we can see
that it kind of just flips out there but
when you look at it closely let me slow
this way down so you can see what I'm
talking about this take it down to four
seconds you can see that it doesn't have
a very three-dimensional look in it in a
lot of ways it feels like I'm
squishing and unscrewing the icon you
see that it feels like it doesn't feel
like there's this flipping very much so
what I need to do to get that happening
is I need to go to the parent of the
thing that's flipping out which is
called the button group let me pull down
the markups you can see so we have the
icon here which is what we're flipping
and then we have this thing called
button group I need to target this thing
with a selector which I've done here and
let me just rewrite the selector here
button group and with this thing
selected I can say perspective and then
give it a give it a number and then the
number is this how far away from from
the object is the viewer it's really
fuzzy so what I would recommend is just
kind of trying a few numbers out
sometimes I try a thousand pixels so
yeah like this is literally how far is
my face from the screen about a thousand
pixels I guess I don't know so I try
these things out and try to get like
like a kind of a good feel and you can
see that when it does fold down the
insides here kind of come up a little
bit you got a three-dimensional feel
what if I did what if I cut that in half
and said 500 let's try that now you can
see that angle a little bit more right
there you see how it's not exactly flat
like it used to be when it was zero when
there was no perspective property on
this Stiles
let's try 200 now it feels more
three-dimensional look at that box right
there we've got a box shape happening
for sure all right now this is all good
in the hood unless something happens
where you're going to see where where
these icons are folding to okay so keep
in mind that right here I said ninety
degrees and if our perspective was still
zero that would mean completely flat
against the
eyeball of the viewer but when we change
the perspective you can kind of see the
edge of the sheet there let me show you
by changing this a text icon from
background black just to let's do a good
old pink we can see that the icon that's
folding back here let me speed that up
it's annoyingly slow now okay so 400
milliseconds we can see that this icon
is folding back and even going further
than 90 degrees it's actually folding
back in on itself and this button that's
a lot wider because the texturing is
longer it's even accentuated you can see
more of the back of the icon the back of
the icon right here now the reason this
is happening is because the the width of
this text string right here which which
actually forces the width of the button
so keep in mind that the perspective is
on button group right button group is
both the text string and the box and if
you zoom away from and this is all very
if like you know keep your head around
this a little bit but if you zoom away
from this button group you realize that
if the button group is this big the like
do this with your hands do this with
your hands and you'll realize that when
the button group is bigger or when your
hands get wider apart you can see more
of your palm right here and when they're
smaller you can see less of your palm
and that's why for this home one you can
see less and it's much more exaggerated
with this this bigger size button right
so what we need to do is we need to
shift the perspective to this I'm doing
this with my hands I hope this makes
sense we need to shift our perspective
of our eyes over to the right side of
the button so that when it flips out no
matter how big or small this button is
we're still seeing it light like we like
we should like we did it that first bit
when it was the when there was no
perspective and so the way that we do
that we have this other property called
prospective origin and I just learned
about this this week it blew my mind
prospective origin is kind of like
transform origin I can say left and I
can see that these you know this becomes
a lot more exaggerated because my
perspective origin is right here it's on
the left border of the whole object of
the whole element right now what I want
to do is I want to put my perspective on
the right side of this element so that
it can be all of them you know because
they all stick out the same amount of
width so that they can all have the the
same amount of perspective on it
regardless the width of the text string
okay and so let me change this to right
and now I see that they're all the same
all the same now you might be saying
we'll wait if these are 90 degrees why
are they not 90 degrees well remember
that the box of let me just highlight
this box here all right so the box that
we're in the button group is all the way
out to here okay so when you're in that
button group we're looking at the right
side of the button group here and so if
you're still you're still can see that
the outside of you know the hand in this
kind of metaphor here so what we really
need to do is we need to figure out how
wide this thing is and I think it's a 50
pixels plus 4 border so 54 pixels wide
and we need to come in from the right 54
pixels so let's do negative 54 I hope
this is right I don't know if this note
thing it how do you come in how do you
come in from the right how do you come
in from the right you could do this
maybe let's try this out I'm trying this
all out right now calc good old calc
calc is 100% minus 54 oh crap it didn't
work oh wait how about this
how about that yeah I did work
formatting you gotta get the formatting
okay so let me tell you what this did
let me now excite all this I
I was nervous I blew the whole video
okay so calc uh we first start with 100%
of the width which is basically saying
right right so going all the way past
the text string to the right edge of
even where the icon should be when it's
folded out and then we're saying go
negative fifty four pixels back from
calc so from 100% so calculate this on
the fly
we're telling CSS alright I'm just going
to do a little bit more checking in
what's the best one okay so it looks
like 53 is good and and that's how you
get like them all to feel the same and
pivot out from the exact same area that
they you know they should regardless of
how wide the parent actually is thanks
for watching this episode of dev tips we
had a few cool things coming up soon
later on this week I'm going to publish
the video where we talk to Matthew Tran
of the engineered truth YouTube channel
the interview and we talk about jobs and
about his time inside of a coding boot
camp and then also next week we're gonna
be starting the new series where we're
going to be building a new website from
the ground up and very excited about
that and so much more and if you want to
know about the dev tips community if
you're looking for some people to to
share this education with come join us
