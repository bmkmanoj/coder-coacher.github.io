that last video and I was editing it and
I thought oh this is a really nice
format you know it's casual we're just
coding here together yeah feel like you
know I feel like we're getting closer to
each other and that's got to mean
something so I had been working for like
a week on this video called no sass or
how I use sass and I'm I kind of like it
I'll be honest it's not my favorite
video I've ever made but whatever
hopefully you get something from it and
then I made this last video like 10
minutes ago which was about what was it
about what was the last video I made
sure it was about dimensions right the
chrome the chrome app called dimensions
which helps you do media queries easier
when you're developing responsive
websites so this format emerges in the
last video where I'm just talking to the
camera here hello Kaplan and it's one
take I'm also recording my screen as I'm
recording this and so when I go in to
edit it the only thing I'm doing is just
switching from from the recording to
recording and they're synchronized it's
really fun it's really cool enjoy it so
that was like 20 minutes ago and I
figure hey if I have a few more things
that I can talk about make a few more
videos tonight we can have a video every
day for the first week that I'm
releasing videos for the year and that's
a really nice way to open up the year
probably we'll see how it goes but this
will be video three I just want to
explain like cool little tips and tricks
that Castro cool little tools that I've
been using here and there so the first
one when I did sense I focused on code
kit as a means to process your
and there we are
I actually so I mixed feelings about
that video because it it rehashes a lot
of content that I went over with a
preprocessor video on the end of the CSS
basics video series but all is well it's
good content and it's important to know
and so we learned a repetition we're all
friends let's just have conversations
that we've already had before that way
we can just you know be friends whatever
so also another update on the kids
remember they're sleeping now one of
them woke up the little boy
Eames I'll get him on camera sometimes
he's a cute little devil but he woke up
and he was like really really mad and
it's like it's 11 o'clock p.m. and he
was like my kid is tired a little face
and he was like he hit my arm like
little weak little hand because he's
only one one year old
you're pathetic I could take you is what
I thought I didn't say it cuz I wanted
him to just be quiet go sleep so I
didn't want challenge him to a duel
right in the middle of his of his
sleeping time so anyhow I finally hold
him and walk back and forth across his
room pace like 50 times each way across
the room and finally he goes to bed and
that was the update nobody has stabbed
themselves with scissors although my
girl she's three she was running around
with a toothbrush in her mouth
she trips over the rug and falls on her
face and stabs her and said why am I
telling you guys this anyway his blood
is gross so what I want to do today is
jump back into code kit and show you one
really cool and unique thing that code
kit does above all of the other
pre-processors and it doesn't actually
have anything to do with sass the
creator of code kit created a new
language called
19 it's an open-source language but you
can use code kit to to use the language
and what what dot ki T is is a I guess
you'd call it like a preprocessor for
HTML where where sass will add things
like imports and variables that I
discussed in the first video this week
code kit adds those same things imports
and variables to just regular HTML so
let me jump into this let me jump into
this right here and I'll show you what
I'm talking about so this is the the doc
hit website now it has it explains the
things it does and gives you examples on
on how to accomplish it imports and
variables really simple but but so so
powerful and also missing from basic
HTML so now I have a website here it's
like a one-page portfolio that I made
for my friend awhile ago and there's a
you know it's just as the basic one-page
portfolio all right you see means a
million times but when I go into the
HTML the HTML is just really long and
kind of not messy but just there's just
a lot to it right and wouldn't it be
nice of each section of this one page
portfolio like there's the work section
in the links a section the resume the
about each one of those had their own
document for coding reasons that would
be cleaner for me to have you know
organized and if you're anything like me
you definitely want it organized because
I'm kind of a neat freak with my files
and so that really appeals to me so let
me show you how this is done I want to
take this indexed okay first thing
actually have to open code kit and drop
Louis into it okay so yeah so I'm going
to take the index.html in a minute
movie name to index dot AIT and code kit
sees that it's in duck index dot ki T so
if I compile it there it'll pop out
another index.html solid it is just
render indexed ki T into index to HTML
but now that I have the ki t file I can
start creating new files to house things
that I you know those partials that I'm
going to be using so the first thing I
want to do is create a space for the
header something crawl it better duck ki
to and on another one called
about dot ki t loops no one's called kit
text all right and then run another one
called there's another section work yeah
remain to work okay another one called
there is a rarity and okay so in index
takia t I have all my stuff so this is
my header I'm gonna grab these lines and
this one and control X to cut and paste
next I'm gonna click that include HTML
comment so refresher code kit when you
have files to cook it you have to kind
of refresh code kit so we can look and
it refreshes on its own that you can
manually refresh it so that it can be
aware of all the files that are inside
your working directory so after I added
all my files I just refreshed it so it
can track them
so I edit header to my kit and you
notice that header is grayed out here
it does not compile data directly
compile because it's imported into kit
and there's a little imports list header
is imported in the kit okay so the
output of HTM index.html means that
there is actually the header there so
all work just as we wanted it to
let's go back to index take this about
section command X go to battle and
those that and um do the same for
section work V man say oops see how it
see how it out click right there that's
because I have not yet added the import
statement into kit so it doesn't know
that it's supposed to be imported and
not compiled directly so when I add that
include statement into the the index dot
yet it'll stop
it'll stop that compiling directly I
wonder if it will remove the dye HTML
entirely let's take a look
Burke God save and oh no I didn't
comment yet there they have to be HTML
comments and save and so the block here
that happened no guess the work didn't
trash oh yeah I guess it's kind of messy
it doesn't clear out doesn't clear out
the the files that have been compiled
but then subsequently given import
statements they're compiled directly at
the time so I guess it's good to write
your import statements before you create
the new files to save up I guess it
doesn't matter indexed I can't work okay
so this one I'm gonna do and include
right here oops
from shopping and then I'm gonna take
section so when I do these tutorials I
often get like nervous when I start
typing or talking and stuff because I
kind of sound really dumb when I type I
sound really dumb whether I'm typing or
not but some extra done when I type
because I can't really talk and type at
the same time my brain just won't let me
so I feel like I'm really boring to you
guys as is this thing even recording it
is I was getting worried about that so
anyway feel like I'm super boring when
I'm doing the type and talk thing and
also I'm coding in front of you if like
you guys are like I don't know just a
what is it called self-conscious men
very self-conscious about this coding in
front of people because I feel like I'm
might be boring everybody in but don't
the truth is sometimes if you're not
into it
coding can be boring and shame on you
for not liking it because it's awesome
oh we see what happened there I have a
closing div right here for some reason
that means
section
my phone is right here the closest
indeed
oh this whole section is part of the
contact page I ended early
all right and then contact then there's
the finish and then just adding the
scripts to the bottom add your scripts
to the bottom of your HTML page if you
don't already do that because they can
JavaScript if it doesn't work it
actually stops everything whereas CSS of
it if there's a broken statement inside
it which is barrel barrel roll right
over it and then a little barrel right
over it and it won't literally affect
anything except for that theme which is
broken but javis beautiful just it'll
choke so that's why you put at the end
of the page because everything the load
first then get to the JavaScript then
choke and then nothing will be destroyed
earliest it'll be less impactful your
JavaScript sucks anyway that's it so
check this out in our code kit look at
this our whole document is just 37 lines
and we have all these really clean
sections to go work in if I wanted sort
out my resume let me go here and look
for it and sort it out if I want to do
my contact do right here about right
here so here's the another tip your code
editor probably won't recognize the the
dot ki t file type so you can tell it so
in in espresso I can tell it what
language it should be a manually tell it
to look like HTML because it really it
codes like HTML so if I tell it HTML
code kit my code editor will recognize
it do some syntax highlighting and
shortcutting and all those good things
for them so that's it this is the doc ki
T language this is super super cool when
you haven't really set up a server yet
to do your includes if you're like
writing like PHP or Ruby or something
you know like a server a server language
often handles these including type
features but they're like so freaking
handy and not available in regular HTML
and that's the pain point that
code kit addresses quite well also I
really like the way they do it so use
kit if you want to rapidly prototype
something with multiple pages like you
can create like a header or a
menu kit and just put that same menu in
all of the you know your about your
contact your portfolio page and then if
you need to change them in you can
change it in that partial or that's what
it's called a partial the thing that is
imported you change the menu in that and
then it shows up it propagates across
all those different pages because you're
just editing that one part hopefully
this is not too complicated or too basic
but exciting to you guys if you like to
just quickly jump in and rapidly
prototype something dot ki t know that
you'll have to do a Google search for
dot chaotix that's not really apparent
on the code kit website how to like get
to the docs of how to write the ki T
language but it's super worth it I
really but I can't say enough about how
great it is if you're gonna do it
early-stage prototyping or just making
up making something you know for
yourself like this one-page website but
you don't want to you know write it in a
server language okay that'll be it for
today's video
remember that you can subscribe to the
channel we're not going to do a huge
thing right now but subscribing is good
because every Monday at least and often
times more throughout the week I release
these videos and I want to make them as
accessible to you as possible so giving
them to you and your YouTube feed is
something that will happen if you
subscribe to the channel obviously and I
really appreciate you coming well at
least is that a joke I really appreciate
you visiting the video I don't know how
to make words that sound good right now
I appreciate you watching this video I
think that it's great in it you are a
great person in
well it's also midnight and that's why
I'm talking so down take it easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
