official episode of doing this thing CSS
grids with foundations or foundation
framework okay so as you may remember we
are doing the same wireframe layout
every every video in this series they're
all the same and the reason we're doing
them the same is so that you can have a
like a controlled perspective of all of
them how do they attack the same problem
every time right so the wireframe looks
like this and you'll be seeing me create
this and referring referring to it
throughout the video the first video I
would like to accomplish getting done
the the heading the site name and
everything up there and then the
navigation in the second video I'd like
to do the first column another video for
the middle column in a last video for
the I'm looking at right here that's
what on my hand a last video for the
third column and the footer we can get
all those done that would be awesome and
then I want to give to verbalise a
summary my takeaways for you guys and
that will be the a single video at the
end of the series called the summary
video or something like that I haven't
made it yet so I don't really know you
know how that goes YouTube what else so
this will be video one we're gonna do
the header and the navigation let's code
now you'll remember in the last video we
use Jade HTML pre-processing language if
we didn't use this I think I would
probably go insane by the amount of
nesting that's required in in these
types of frameworks so we're definitely
going to stick with that and I have a
few tabs open here I have the foundation
documentation right here which if you're
going to use a new framework you got to
have the docs and then I also have the
docs for the foundation font okay so
there's a few icons I want to use while
we go through this and so I downloaded
they're fine so the first few lines that
I have already set up you know you have
the doctype HTML is a HTML tag and the
head inside the head I have the title
foundation grid
a few meta this is this is going to
declare the character set and this is
going to declare the just make sure it's
mobile when it's when it's rendered on a
mobile device that it's actually
one-to-one instead of scaling down the
whole large-scale site it'll be
responsive this way with this with this
meta tag but you guys already know that
and then I have three links the first
one is to the foundation CSS on a CDN
somewhere so I haven't downloaded a
foundation locally which I probably
should do and the next one is the
foundation fonts on a CDN again I
haven't downloaded them locally but the
next one is local this is my stylesheet
this is what I'll be using to kind of
nudge things around or fix any problems
I run into in a case ideally I would
like to use this stylesheet is as few
times as possible because I'm really
testing out foundation for all it's
worth if possible I think the one that
we used with bootstrap was like 12 lines
long wasn't very long there's like five
I think styled in it hopefully we can
keep it down that way with a foundation
looking at this layout I see that they
have way of a grid and in the first row
of the grid is going to be the site logo
the site title here and the kind of
navigation and kind of sign up not
navigation but like kind of talk now if
like sign up for the newsletter you know
follow our RSS kind of like you know
important stuff but but not in-your-face
stuff so let's get started the first
thing we got to do now here's a big
difference between Foundation and
bootstrap in bootstrap you rely on a
class of container to contain all your
rows in foundation you don't you just
say row and then you're off to the races
so I'm start with a row and I'm going to
look at that first column that I must
stick that site name a title in and I'm
and the way that you declare
columns inside of foundation is a little
bit different as well in bootstrap and I
think you know Africa say I've built all
this already in preparation to get you
know used to it I wouldn't have to spend
so much of your time going huh when I
look at the docks but I kind of like the
way that they do the naming of the
different things and in this case the
way that they do do the column so every
column actually needs two classes the
first one is just column and you can put
an s on there they use both and it's
just semantics really if you want to do
column or columns but I like column
because it's one character shorter and
I'm all about brevity you can't tell
that because I talk too much but I
secretly am so after you've labeled this
div column you put a class of column on
it you want to put a class of oh you
want to say how many units or how many
columns wide this column is right maybe
that's why columns makes more sense
because you're actually saying how many
columns let's do that now whatever so
you're going to decide on the number of
column and then you're going to decide
what device you want that many number of
columns shown on right let me just show
you so you want to start small because
foundation is definitely mobile first
and they make a big deal about that so
small I want to say that out of twelve
that this will take up about four rows
right about a third a third of the width
and that would mean that the rest of
this has to be a column small eight
because four and A is 12 right in that
first column I'm just going to make it
h1 and I'll put site name right site
name and we'll save it and we'll see it
magically rendered oh and by the way I'm
using code kit to do the compiling it's
just easy especially for these kind of
one-off one-page little dillies right
here so keep that in your mind as we
talk the next one we're going to do is
the next area here which is going to be
this newsletter link and the RSS link
and then
jewelle form element to do a sign up for
a newsletter okay so there is a kind of
a component called doop doop inline list
and I think we use a similar one when we
did the the bootstrap version of it but
in fact if I'm going to be honest I
tried something else
I tried bread crumbs earlier and bread
crumbs comes with this weird like box
around it I didn't realize so when I did
this last night in preparation for this
video I used bread crumbs
don't use bread crumbs that is silly
beans so we wanted to use in line lists
and it's pretty simple it's just a UL
with a bunch of allies in it and then to
make it in line you just write it in
line list so it'll be like you l dot in
in line list and then a few of these
guys and how many we got maybe like a
few of them now normally in Jade I would
say to get the nested HTML element I
would say I'll put an anchor in it like
that and then write class fi because F
this is how you do the fonts and
foundation right fi foundation icon and
then the actual icon and I'm going to
use the male I think this is called the
male FF - male and then since it's an
anchor I need to put a ref or also to
look silly and waited sometimes in the
newsletter now you see how I'm nesting
down and you know whatever that's fine
but to take up less space if it's just
as simple as and every one of them has
an Li and an anchor an easy way to take
up less lines is just to put like this :
and then the next tag name like that so
it's quite nice and I'll do that again
done he actually let's render and see
where we go
did we get that icon right yeah okay so
it's a little male thing and it says
newsletter new letter yeah I guess the
newsletter okay
anchor dot fi RSS I hope that's right
riff and then RSS now you see how
there's no space right here between the
newsletter and the icon that space that
I put between the anchor and the word
newsletter is to denote that that's the
end of the tag so you actually have to
put two spaces behind there if you want
to have like a character space between
the two and that's what's recommended in
in font icons all the time is to put us
an empty space inside of the tag and so
you do that by having two spaces after
the tag if you're using Jade if you're
not using Jade you just put a just put
the tag and then a space and then the
write write out the label or whatever
the next thing you want to do is have
just have a pipe because that's right
there and then in here this next bit
looks like a form so let's go to our
documents and look at forums foundation
does do forms a little bit I feel like
bootstrap did them a little bit more
though and the form we want to look at
is kind of like this one right here it's
like connected so the way that you have
this connected form in in foundation is
you you put them inside of a grid and
then if you write a collapse as an extra
class name on the grid row it will take
away all the padding's on on the the
columns that are inside of that grid row
so it'll cinch up tighter the form that
the input field and the submit button so
I make a new Li and then inside of him
I'll put a form and that form is going
to be the row right so dot row and then
I want to tell the like I said I don't
want to collapse that row and then the
children are going to be those columns
so I'm gonna take column dot small and
the there's gonna be three
columns in this hopefully this last
little bit which is just this this form
right it's going to be the label it's
going to be the field and the submit
button so the first one is going to be
the label and I'll say out of 12 columns
I'll give you four columns can I say
four okay and then this second one you
just copy and paste these the second row
line is going to be the the input be six
columns and then the last one will be
just the submit button will be two
columns and we'll just keep on nesting
here so label and then the text from the
label so look I don't know what language
this is a it's like something Latin or
Greek or something but let's pretend
that's a word and then inside of the six
we want to have so this is a form
already let's it put the input and then
we want to say type equals text and then
this last one is going to be a submit
button in the way you do that in
foundation I'm looking at the docks
right here I want it to be like this was
going to be an anchor with a class of
button so a button and a class of post
fix I don't know what post fix does but
why don't we pause to XS post fix makes
it widened centers it so you how this
button is like widened centered and CIPA
the output let's do some experiment
let's not put postfix on it and then
let's say put postfix on it and see
because we're experimenting so we're
just doing this stuff right now let's do
it
a button go but we need a ref on that
button because it's an anchor and that
should be good let's take a look see oh
my goodness that all kind of looks good
until you get right here
this forms pretty big why is there so
much let's put post fix oh I don't know
what post fix does let's figure out what
post fix does see one of the things you
want to keep in mind about when you're
using these frameworks is that they're
going to teach you a lot of good things
you know I mean like if these are good
enough to be proper frameworks then
they're good enough to discover like
like tear them apart and learn why they
are so successful in so popular so let's
look up post fix post fix here says post
fix button removes all the padding's and
lines it to the center that's
interesting it makes it a display block
which is why it needed to be in the grid
and indexed to one if I take the post
fix off of this one will go wonky like I
ruined it yeah so I guess the main thing
is it changes refresh here one noticing
right here it changes the height but
that's not going to be it the line
height yeah interesting so post fix is
what kind of just matches it up to that
thing only why they call it post fix
that's a really strange thing okay and
now what I'm looking at the way that
these have worked out I'm seeing that
there's we have a grid of eight units
here and then the inline list is big but
in the each of these unit of these list
items don't take up the full size see
there's like this but a bunch of empty
area right here so and I would rather
have these elements kind of scooted off
to the right of the grid obviously
aligned to the right of the layout so
I'm gonna I'm gonna just here where
we're at in line list I'll say right and
that should float everything all the
children are right there we go now
floated all the children right but we're
still like stuck on the on the on the
top of the thing right there so I still
want to push those actions down a little
bit so I'll put a clasp on the column
not
column just the inline list and say a
class of top factions so I'll go into my
SAS and I'll say top actions margin top
of 20 pixels great that looks good
except for see how this the form is
misaligned to the label there's a way
that foundation can fix that oh let me
see here here we are the label if you
put in line on the label it will kind of
sync it up to the height the line height
of the of the form so let's try that on
the label dot inline okay that did work
but the problem is the problem is that
it's it's now it's out of sync with the
rest of the line there I want them all
to be the same so that's no good maybe
hmm I don't know what to do it just kind
of worked in bootstrap I mean if I was
designing this without using a framework
you know they would be easy to stick I'd
be like okay yeah I'll just tuck this up
under a little bit more but I'm not sure
if there's a foundation kind of method
of going through that I think I'm just
gonna leave it let's just move on okay
so the next thing we want to do is
concern ourselves with the the the
navigation here okay so let's look at
our options for navigation inside of
foundation foundation navigate
okay we have an off navigation a top bar
which involves JavaScript because it
potentially just sticks to the top like
that but I don't want it to be this big
solid block it doesn't really look that
great either and then what else we got
icon bar it's more like a mobile kind of
approach we can go vertical I mean it's
cool but it's not that's not what I'm
looking for right let's continue to look
side nav
no no Magellan sticky Nav Magellan
that's kind of nice I don't want the
JavaScript down I think I would accept
this as the navigation so what here's
what we want let's try it out let's try
it out we're going to go into our index
Jade and we're going to create a new row
and then in that row I'll say a column
small a twelve I want this to go across
the whole thing no matter the size and
then the navigation will look something
like this they want me to do a DL and
then call it sub nav and then a D D
which is definition data right
so this is a definition list if that
wasn't clear you probably have used you
ELLs a lot which are unordered lists you
may have even used o wells which are
ordered lists but the kind of like
redheaded stepchild of the list family
are the definition list the deals the d
DS and the DTS right definition list DL
definition term DT definition data DD
and they're using definition lists here
to form the structure for this
navigation sub nav so let's see if it
works for us
DD and we've got these data types in
what's it called in a foundation and
this is more for the JavaScript way of
thinking and I hope that it can work
without doing the stickeen I don't I
don't with the stickiness I just want
the style of it so there's a anchor tag
inside of the DD the definition data and
it has a ref I want my list to be the
home and there should be a few of these
home
I'm on it's about comics and movies is
the entertainment site concerts and
maybe like YouTube why not let's take a
look at how that looks
ooh what did I do wrong
I want a proper like across the top man
what's going on sub - nav it's giving me
these pills I thought they were going to
be in a gray box the other example had
them in a grey box this is a gray box
why don't I get a great box well at the
gray box add a little title and active
understand it can refer to big
definitions why don't I get a gray box
why do you get a gray box and I don't
regret so I'm now I'm opening the
inspector to see like what gave them the
grey box looks like sub - nav gives you
a background color
why does my sub - nav not give me a
background color is my sub - nav
background color being overwritten by
something sub - Nev is this like a newer
version of foundation maybe and they
didn't update the docs yet that could be
op that could be possible kind of bummed
because I wanted that grey well I will
put it on there myself
sub - nav background-color F - that's
what I wanted it'll need some more
padding of course padding a point 0.5 M
+ mm that's pretty good 0 M for the
right the left yeah okay I guess that's
I kind of wanted that I guess that'll do
if fits a little weird right like what
is this inspect element why do I have
such a big column here oh my wife miss
oh this form here is like has a lot of
margin beloved do these inputs have
margin on the bottom one REM it's kind
of a lot I get it though I get why you
would do that by default but it's kind
of messing up my shoes right here so
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to go to
that top actions cuz already have a
style for that and say margin-bottom
negative 30 pixels cheating um
alright now that's the end of the video
so please watch the next video because
in the next video I'm going to do the
first column and that's going to be
super exciting I have some I have a plan
for you guys and you're going to love it
so see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
