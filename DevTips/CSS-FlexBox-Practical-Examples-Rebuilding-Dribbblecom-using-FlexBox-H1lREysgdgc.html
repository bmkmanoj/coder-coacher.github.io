just want to let you know up front that
you may or may not find this video
useful depending on how much you like
awesome stuff ah last week we began our
epic journey into flexbox and we learned
how all of the parts work together if
you missed that video it's going to be
an exceptional primer what we're doing
today I recommend you go back and watch
that one also last week I wrote the code
using plain old vanilla HTML and boring
old stupid CSS this week we're going to
up our game to using awesome Jade and
super cool sass if you don't know what
I'm talking about when I say Jade and
sash check out these two videos here and
then while you're watching them change
your name to jasmine because I'm about
to show you a whole new world I can't
get that joke to sound good right now
we're going to step through three
practical examples of using flexbox in a
real-life setting the first is to create
a responsive three column layout the
second one is a small little media
object it's used on every website like a
Gillian Times like the most popular
thing you've ever seen that you may not
even notice because it's so ubiquitous
anyway and for the last one we're going
to recreate the dribble comm homepage
using flexbox see I told you to be
awesome you can use the annotations
below to skip to any section at any time
okay so the first two examples are going
to be here in code pen because they're
pretty simple and I have two spaces laid
out to handle those examples are right
here in these black boxes the first is
going to be a three column layout and
the second and media object I'm just
going to go ahead and hide that media
object space right here by putting a
class of hide on that and then we're
going to start with the three column
layout okay so in this three column
layout I want to do also the header in
the footer so I'll put the header and
footer here and alright header and
footer inside of those header and footer
tags then next I want to make a tag
called let's say body it's not the
actual body element but it's a it's a
div with a class of body because inside
of that body I'm going to put those to
be columns and so I'll say class number
one will be column one and then we'll
say this column two and column three so
we have three columns inside of a body
then we outdent it right here because I
don't want the body to be a child of
header I want header body and footer to
all be siblings within the example
layout element and inside the column one
I'll say this will be the main content
and column two will house like the
sidebar or maybe it'll just be like
navigation and in column three will be
like that just you know the sidebar I
like a blog or something on the side
alright now when we're looking at the
results of these code exercise right now
let's bring up our inspector make it a
bit bigger I'm looking at this inspector
which we have a header and the body and
the footer in the header is the parent
of these three divs right inside here
okay the first thing I want to style is
the parent of everything like the Thor
wrapper and that's called the example -
layout this is the thing that's holding
the header the body and the footer it
wrapping around all those things and I
want to say to that display flex now
remember we're using autoprefixer again
so when I write display flex it's
actually resulting in WebKit you know
like all the browser's WebKit and
Mozilla and and everything it's
resulting in all those browsers getting
the right vendor prefix in so you should
if you don't have Auto prefix or
installed you should be writing all
everything out correct but because I do
and I'm using code pain which allows me
to it all works out so the result of
saying just to this example layout flex
is that these these divs no longer
vertically stack they no longer break
each other they they they're now columns
right so we've got the header the body
those three and the footer cool but I
don't want them to stack up in those
three columns or the header to be above
and the body and the footer to be below
so we'll say Flex Direction column tada
it's kind of back to where we had it a
few minutes ago let's quickly style the
header and footer and we'll say padding
20 pixels and back ground like you know
a gray it looks good and color can be
white for the text cool make it a little
darker gray excellent now we want to
focus on those three columns that we
want to make they're just normal divs
inside of the wrapper called body so
let's focus on body and say body display
flex and now that we have them in the
display flex they're the three columns
right but
we want the hmm we want the body to to
grow to the available space let me just
say this actually we go back up to
example layout and just push make it
make it large and when we're using these
layout modes we can do something really
cool with like look with the height we
can say height I want you to be 100
views it's and what that will do okay
you see how this viewport just grew
actually let me kind of shorten that up
by saying calc 100 viewport Heights -
300 okay so now it kind of fits better
so now that we have the display flex in
the body we want to use the body to kind
of push the footer all the way down to
its available space down so let me
scroll down a little bit so you can see
it and what I'll do is I'll say Flex
grow one in that body element which is
the wrapper of these three columns here
just pushed everything down in fact let
me show you what that looks like by
changing the background to pink now you
can see that it's the body itself that's
pushing it down not those three columns
but we also need to see those three
columns so let's say column - one
background light blue
all right the main column is scrunched
all the way over to the right and let's
find column - to your background color
mister column - could be this is funny
one honey do I need to is like a little
like an like nice little you know to
saturate it green it's cute nice nice
and column three your background will be
peach buff
Oh adorable so now we have these three
columns and they're scrunched all the
way to the left and we want them to kind
of spread out so column actually two in
three which are the navigation in the
sidebar I want them to have a fixed
width let's say width is like 120 pixels
for the navigation and the same thing
for the sidebar okay then I want to go
into column 1 which is the the main
content area and say Flex grow one and
it will push the other the sidebar those
are pretty small the sidebars and stuff
let's say 160 okay so it'll push the
sidebar and the the navigation all the
way to this side because flex Gro is on
the main content it's just it's growing
as much as it can and since there's
nothing else stopping it from going that
full width it does but there's the big
problem here I don't want two columns on
the side and the main content on the
left
I want the columns to kind of straddle
it like that so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go into column two in say
order negative one and that'll take the
navigation and scoot it in front of the
column one and column three
the reason remember that by default the
order of any flex item is zero so if you
put an order negative a number like for
example negative one it'll jump in front
of all of the other things because
they're zero if you put a positive
number like let's say one column two
will go to the end where it should be it
where column three should be which is
navigation but we don't want that we
want it in the front so I'll say
negative one right so that is our three
column layout and it looks good but when
we scrunch it down we'll see that the
main content is the item is the element
that's flexing in the sidebar and main
negation are not budging at all so what
we want to do is make this kind of
responsive and what we would do if we
were going to make this responsive is
say at media
max with like let's say what 700 pixels
what is it when we scrunch it this far
750 was 800 you'd put this on anything
more Pro 800 probably you know too big
but here but here's the concept right
then we'll say body flex direction is
column and then when we scoot it in yeah
turned into a column cool but navigation
and sidebar are still like thin so we'll
say a column what is that are they two
and three yeah
column two and column three width is
auto okay now they're full width and and
also I want to take the order back so
column column one actually no it was
column two column two your order will be
Auto now autos not a thing we'll just
say zero
I'll default to zero right so now when
we look at this we have the main content
at the top and mobile and then when you
scroll down you'll see the navigation
and sidebar well actually maybe we want
the navigation at the top yeah let's
just leave it there
anyway the idea is you can use order to
resort these things and and relay them
out when it's on mobile right so it's
really nice and easy to do
okay for the next example we have
something called a media object you've
seen it everywhere it's just that it's
just that it lock up but you see of like
it like an image and some content or a
compare graph next to it maybe it's an
icon with like a label next to it I
could even be a you know like a form
field with a with a submit button on
right like a search bar or something
with a button on the on the right like
attached to it floating to the right let
me show you how to make those it's
really really simple in flexbox alright
so the first thing I'm gonna do is just
unhide the space that I have to build
this and we have a new box below right
here in media object in the media object
I'm going to make an element called
media let me put some divs below this we
can scrunch it up it's going to be
called media and I just want an image
and some content so image and the source
for the image will be good old trusty
HTTP filmer e-comm slash 50/50 so 55 50
bill bill murray there it is cute cute
is a little whistle there and then the
next thing we're going to say we want to
edit something called content now in
that content we just want some some
quick lorem right let's take a look at
what we got we got a filmer right here
and then i div below it filled with some
content okay
so let's bring up our sass again and
let's get some more space below in this
example we want to want to start by
calling that container the example media
and we'll say media and then inside of
that we had a what was it the image and
then the content okay
so the media here I want it to be a
display the Flex
all right now they're already bumping up
side to side and I'll put a little bit
of margin right on that 10 pixels yeah
get it away from the image looking good
looking good let's see I want to put a
max width on the media there so I can
get the so I can get the text kind of
wrapping down let's say 300 pixels and
that kind of looks good except for Phil
Murray's face is kind of squished in
like this like poor Phil squished so
what we're going to do is say that we
want the content to grow too it's um
it's available space but we also want it
to shrink up if if there's no space
available to it so we'll just use the
shorthand for flex grow and flex shrink
by using flex one and now it'll shrink
up there we are it shrinks up and let's
fill Murray have its intended space and
it's no longer squished Phil Murray Bill
Murray Phil Murray not pH fi-l l what
what okay cool so hmm let me show you
one more actually with this media
content type I mean that's it it's just
just as simple as that but I want to
show you one more kind and let's do
let's do that Search Group of having
oops not ground in that search group
will say we want an input that's
basically a text box
oops type equals text and placeholder
equals search
and then another input which is going to
be type equals submit all right let's
hit we got okay search box and a submit
button let's put a like at HR to
separate these two okay so we've got a
search box and a submit button now let's
quickly style that to have a nice lock
up using the the pattern of this media
object that we've been discussing so
let's just inherit all of that styling
by saying at media search group
networking I think I misspelled search
group in the markup let's go back yep s
e a are CH okay sorry sorry about that
humans happen okay so now we see that
like like the the look of it is like a
lot tighter than just having a random
input field next to a random submit
button and we can do a little bit better
to identifying these inputs and given
them just like a little bit more of a
good style for a form like let's say
padding 10 pixels and border mmm okay we
don't want border okay so that looks
like a pretty good search box and it's
amazing what some little bit of padding
can do for you when you're looking at
forms but the thing I want to show you
is this look let's take this the search
groups max width right now it's 300 you
can see how the search block up is only
300 pixels well let's make it 600 what
happened you can see that the text of
the media has stretched out to 600 but
our search button and our search field
is still small
well the default size of that search
input field was just about as big as it
is now and it's just kind of staying
where it should be we want
we want that search text field to
stretch or compact depending on how much
space is given to it and want that
button to kind of remain the same size
the whole time so what we'll do is we go
in here to input and say and type equals
text and we'll say flex one now the
search box the text box will stretch out
because it will flex grow all the way to
the space intended for it and if there's
less space it will shrink it up so
that's nice and that is the example of
the media object for this last example
we're going to step outside of code pin
and just use a few files that I have
developed already on my desktop and the
reason for that is because this is a
little bit more complicated and I wanted
to have the flexibility flex of stepping
outside of like the one page view and
kind of like putting the different code
snippets into partials to make them a
little bit more understandable and also
to focus on the things that we're trying
to focus on today which is actually flex
box stuff right so what I did is I got a
sneeze it's not coming what I did is I
basically gathered all the assets and
that took a long time and and designed
everything and kind of laid it all out
but no styling other than things that
are just colors and like sizes and
padding's like text sizes and things I
didn't I didn't align anything and as
you can see right here it looks kind of
like it looks kind of as if somebody
turned off the Styles completely I'm
going to take the CSS main CSS here and
remove it so this is what this looks
like without any CSS it's just a big
list of stuff right in the list of the
navigation list of all the shots on
dribble this trouble page that we're
going to be doing if I turn the styling
that I've done so far back on it's very
similar in structure but it's just got
some
colors and some sizes and some fonts
picked out and that kind of stuff so no
structure has been done we're going to
do the whole layout with Flex box right
now let me show you how I've organized
this I have three partials the first is
the header which is just this everything
you see in this gray box and the second
is the nav which is basically just these
three links and then we have the shots
which is basically every all these other
kind of graphics that you see the people
that did them and you know how many
votes or views and comments and likes
they get okay now let me show you the
structure of the files that have setup
we've looked at those three partials
right here and now I have the main sass
I have bourbon installed base dribble is
the colors that have that I've showed
you dribble dribble is the colors that
I've designed here and like this why and
the little borders and the color of the
everything right there it's just boring
stuff is just colors and stuff but I
have this empty sass document called
flex flex is where we're going to be
doing our work today we're going to
build this layout using flexbox
principles and elements so let's start
with the first partial the header let's
look into the header and see what we got
okay we have a header banner and that's
where the gray of the gray box is the
actual header element in and a nav the
nav is going to give us the logo and the
UL which has a bunch of links in there
okay so let's get that set up I'm going
to go into our Flex ass and we're going
to say header we want this to be display
flex now we see that there are two
columns in this in this flex they're the
ones the the layout where it says logo
and menu items here and then on the the
next column is the the little avatar
these two icons and the search box so we
want to move that search box in the
icons all the way over to the right so
we'll say
justify content space between and now
that'll send the search box and the
icons all the way over to the right cool
now let's think about this navigation we
want it to be kind of in line everything
in line right there
so the nav which is going to have two
elements in it it'll have the logo and
then the UL which holds all the links we
want that to be a display flex two so
we'll say not maybe what are you doing
we'll say display flex all right now we
see that the dribble logo is stretching
all the way down as far as the space
needed by the the UL when we can fix
that by saying a line items a flex start
there we go now the dribbles back into
proportion and we'll say the UL you know
what we're going to do a lot of display
flexing so let's go up here and make a
placeholder I'll say % flex and then
under that I'll just grab display flex
and put like that and then we can do
something that's good in sass to do if
you have a lot of the elements using the
same properties you can write an app
extend % flex and I'll put that
everywhere that I see display flex okay
so go back to the UL now remember I want
to have the UL to be display flex as
well so that all of its children will be
lined up in a row so when I save it
you'll see that we're looking at now a
row of items here and we'll go to those
list items
ah freaking autocorrect ah freaking
autocorrect okay we'll go to those list
items and say margin:0 for the top and
the bottom and 20 for the left in the
right and save and there we go
we remember when we said flex start we
can say something as simple as center
and we'll just bring dribble and those
links down to where they you know kind
of like are in the center of the line
right there that looks good
nice nice nice okay no the other one
over there I called it let's look at
this what is it okay I call these user
tools and it's going to be three images
and then a form which has one input in
it all right so three images and a form
with one input in it under the wrapper
of certain of user tools so let's go
back to our document here and user tools
is a sibling of nav and we'll say user
tools
let's get those images and that form all
aligned on the same row so we'll use
that extend flex and save and we'll see
that everything gets lined up there and
we want to do the same kind of right
here with the alignment a line items
Center now we're looking good nothing is
being stretched there everything's
looking nice and then just for those
images let's say margin 0 and 20 just
like the links above looking good ok so
that's how quickly we're able to sort
out everything in the in the header
using only a flex box let's jump down to
this next section which is called the
what does this thing called though the
nav actually it looks exactly like I
want it to
oops I just clicked on one of those
refresh actually this navigation looks
exactly like I want it to so there's
nothing I really have to do with flex
with that navigation so let's jump down
to these shots open the shots structure
so we can see what we have here okay now
I'm using a really cool thing inside of
Jade which is templating or in this case
it's a mix and built in so I can define
what I want the structure to be and like
all these like the link and the image
and the view count and avatar and the
name those are all kind of templatized
and then right here in these shots I'm
just like you know here's the URL for
the image here's the URL for the
whatever and that's how I'm getting this
repeating pattern of I think it's twelve
shots they're called
in dribble so the structure is just
going to be just this right here so what
they are they're all links with a class
of shot rap and inside of that is the
shot and the owner so the owner is below
here it's just the avatar and the name
and then the shot itself is the image
and then the image has some meta and the
meta is are the views comments and likes
okay so that's the structure now we're
going to go into our Flex SAS and let's
talk about the shots start there what we
want to be flex of course so we'll
extend it with a flex wrap and now we
see all the sudden that all of the shots
are in one column because by default
they don't wrap so we're gonna do is a
flex wrap wrap fo sho
okay thank you and then we want them not
to be all smushed over to the left we
want them to be kind of in the middle
with space between them so we'll say
justify
ooh there's a justify content space
between there we are there we are now
this is an interesting layout because we
have five going across and because
there's only 12 there's a few missing
here in the bottom and the space between
means the deck they like these are not
going to be together or anything
convenient but you know what we're
actually missing right here is a defined
width of the container at all right so
like these things are always going
though all the way all the way across
and if we look at the real dribble comm
we can see that these things are you
know like they're floating in the center
of the layout of course which is obvious
an obvious decision so let's pause for a
minute and get that set up I want to
come in here and make a class called
positioner and I'll just make it a Max
Max with 970 and margin bonus so it make
a max width and then I'll Center that
that kind of that container center it
zero Auto right there now we need to put
the positioner in the right spaces so
let's go through each one of these
templates and see where they need to go
the header banner is the gray bit and so
all these things to flow inside inside
of the gray bit so there we go the
positioner will shrink them up to where
they should be the navigation that can
get a positioner there we are and then
for the shots themselves section section
shots yeah this could be a position
right here there we go so now we can
have more control over the count and the
size that they're going to be in cool
cool
okay we are done messing with the
positioner let's get rid of these
Jade templates and back to our sass now
the only thing we have really to do left
is to sort out these this Schatz meta so
we're going to go into meta here and
write that at extend flex and that will
bring these all in two columns that is
unless you have an error oh it's not
flex its percent flex because it's a
placeholder okay cool
now they're all going to be columns but
I need the meta to be on the other side
see how they're all justified to the
left I need them to be justified to the
right so I'll say justify content of
Flex and there you go
scoots them all over to the end alright
that is going to be it for this example
of the dribble homepage layout and
there's there's a lot we could do to
improve it but you guys get the idea of
here that you're using flex to throw
things around justify them to the right
places and it's a lot easier than using
floats and clears and it's a lot cleaner
for the markup too so it's really cool
I'm pretty happy with it
all right you lucky ducks that's it for
me today but there is a big announcement
coming up in a few weeks I can't really
talk about any of it today but I'm I'm
just so excited about it and I know you
will be too in the meantime if you can't
get enough of this sexy baritone voice
in your ear holes check out my podcast
that I do with my friend Louis this
week's episode which drops tomorrow
covers the question of what do you do
when you do not feel inspired here's a
short preview of our discussion so here
are just a few and these are not all
it's not exhaustive list of course is
not the only list and some of these are
maybe just horrible ideas but here are a
few that I wrote down all right okay so
the first one is is your sit down and
you have this project and these don't
know where to start it's gotten heavy
because it's been a few days
right alright and then you're a pirate
all of a sudden and you can't type with
your hook on your hand and you can't see
the monitor a patch on your eye up in
this parrot on your shoulder won't shut
up just sucks yeah trying to go get a
drink of your peg leg and suck okay um
break it down
is the first tip break it down wrong
breaking rule not slowing down that slow
down break it down okay break it down is
the tip um so here's how you do that all
right we'll see you next week I love
that dress you're wearing
and keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
