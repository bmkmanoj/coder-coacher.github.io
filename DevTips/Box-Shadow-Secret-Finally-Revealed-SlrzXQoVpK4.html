you've been keeping secrets from me I
mean I thought we had something going
Internet I felt that we understood each
other and and the other day I discovered
something I thought I thought how we do
everything about each other I guess it I
guess it should come as no surprise I
mean other people know you too what am I
saying I'm saying dear Internet I
discovered what you did and I like it ah
so a long time ago I made this video
called the box model box sizing and
box-shadow and I showed you that you can
kind of cheat the box model you can you
could fake borders I guess by using box
shadow it's kind of a fun little trick
in fact I used it here on the killing it
with jQuery course website
I used it right here because you can see
that I have this this content width
right everything is 360 pixels wide and
then when I get to this content well I
wanted this gray box to be outside of
why I wanted it to be bigger than
everything else but the content well
that I had was constricting the width of
it and I didn't I don't know maybe it
was just too lazy to stick code it to
make it bigger and so what I did is I
actually used box shadow you see the how
it extends outside of the the actual div
how the gray feeling of it extends
outside of the div those are box shadows
right here I turn on this box shadow
that's the actual divots and there's no
padding it's just box shadow that's
extending the the the visual feel of
that box it's kind of funny actually I
was laughing to myself when I did it
background pink just to show you what's
up so what I want to do today is show
you another thing that I just discovered
about box shadow that just like blew my
mind I thought that you couldn't do what
I'm about to show you with CSS I thought
there was no way to do it other than
like making like multiple elements and
hacking and nesting and things like that
let me show you what I just discovered
and you might have already known this
but I just it's my channel and I want to
talk about it gosh
darn it and so here we are okay so there
are four lengths that you add to the
box-shadow property four lengths in the
value what I mean by a length is like
you know right here where it says 1 0
pixels right so the first length is if I
add 20 you can see that it's offset X if
I add negative 20 you see it's going to
be going this way right
so the first length or the first value
which we call them likes the first value
is offset X the second one is offset Y
it goes down 20 or net you can go up 20
you put negative 20 on it okay and the
second one is called blur obviously and
the third one is called spread now
spread is something that is kind of
calling it spread is really what limited
my thinking because we have a value for
spread in photoshop and what it does in
photoshop is let me show you here so we
have a 20 pixel blur and I want to put
like a 15 pixel spread on it what it
does is it it let me say idea you kind
of see that working it's just it's
taking you know where's that blur start
right and if you have a 18 pixel spread
that means the blur does not start until
after 18 pixels so if I knock this a
blur down to 0 you can see that the
spread is still there it's just out 18
pixels does that make sense so the blur
will start if I put the blur at 18
pixels you'll see that the blur starts
right on that edge what I never what I
never knew about this spread property is
that it's not you shouldn't think of it
as spread you should think of it as size
right and I did that just when that when
that paradigm came to me that this is
actually not spread you can look at this
property on MDN Mozilla's docks for HTML
and CSS and JavaScript and it's called
spread the spread radius that's what
they call it and that like totally
limited my thinking but now I'm thinking
of it as
ize interesting things can happen when
you think of it as sighs so let's go
back here and let's just set up let's
call it zero and we'll set up a regular
kind of like well actually let's let's
change this let's change the color a
little bit so let's just move it back to
this blue that I had and make the font
colored now I wanna make the blur ten
and what offset it by like seven pixels
okay now how do you in CSS make a button
stand off the page right if we look at
if you look at like material they do a
lot of buttons off the page
material design fab all right let's look
at the buttons on materialize whatever
what is this framework you see like when
I hover over this button the the box
shadow grows now what's happening here
let's look at it I'm getting really
nerdy and into this because this is just
kind of really blew my mind this week
okay so let's look at it we have this
button and it's it's got the class of
floating and let's look at the hover
state of it so you see how it when I
hover it over I'm gonna click this
button it's going to get the hover that
the Box shadow grows let's see what's
what's actually happening so the
normally is it zu2 to pixels down five
pixels blur zero pixels spread and then
when you hover over it it goes five
pixels down right from two to five 11
pixels blur zero pixels spread and the
opacity changes a little bit I guess
okay so what we're doing is let's go
back to this is all crazy let's go back
to the but the Buckshot okay so let me
write a box shadow for the hover here
and I'll just basically copy it and do
what they did which is which is to move
it further away and to increase the blur
so let's say 17 and 20 so now this box
shadow here should should grow and this
is this is how we get the illusion
that this button is coming up toward you
on the z-axis coming toward you but
there there there's this thing that I
discovered about the box-shadow property
this week and I'm saying I discovered
I'm sure a lot of people knew about this
but like this is making me go crazy that
you can do this this spread here if you
think about it as sighs you can think
that okay that can actually have a
negative value on it so right here we're
all right here let's just make this box
shadow look better
let's put negative 10 on it and then
move it down 17 okay now you see how it
comes in from the edges right there oh
my life that's just the gorgeous and so
let's make the hover a little bit more
exaggerated version of that let's say
negative 20 and then we have to add
another 10 pixels on to this I think 27
and don't change the blur oh wow did you
see what happened the box shadow is now
getting smaller and it should get
lighter too we should change this to
like two or something that's more
realistic right and would it be even
better is if we started we started
translating this so I'm going to
transform translate
let's do up like 10 pixels so that you
can get that feeling of coming towards
us oh yeah but that see we want to keep
this shadow right here the whole time
say oh it's moving up I moved it up
another 10 pixels so I need to put it
down I need to translate it down the box
shadow another 10 pixels so this should
be better
oh yeah Wow look at that oh look at that
that's a classy button see how the it's
so realistic in the way that the box
shadow behind it moves away get smaller
it gets lighter and
the button itself is moving up now you
can have a few things where the buttons
kind of getting like this herky-jerky
moment right here when when the target
of your you know is moving it can be a
problem there's way around there's ways
around that for example we can put a
wrapper around this button target the
wrapper make the wrapper be the one
that's making all this happen I'm not
going to show you that you guys can use
your imagination but I don't want to
share this crazy like box shadow thing
that I've been using box shadow for
years I never knew this and so that's
got me going this week thanks for
