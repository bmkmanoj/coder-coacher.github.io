beginners beginners begin here as this
is a guide specifically for those about
to begin also thanks for Adobe for
sponsoring this series on how to begin
using Adobe XD ah in this video I want
to introduce you step by step tool by
tool to the UI of Adobe XD I'm going to
take you through and teach you
everything you need to know to begin
using Adobe XD today it's gonna be fun
when you first launch Adobe XD you're
gonna be greeted by this launch screen
and it has a place to start new
documents using artboard templates and
they range from mobile to tablet web or
custom sizes there's a place for
tutorials and resources like UI kits and
learning materials there's also the
recent the recent files that you've
created or you can open one that exists
somewhere else on your computer so what
we want to do first is talk about
artboards and how this works let me show
you the each of these templates here has
a drop-down and you can find different
types of of that category of artboards
already so when we're looking at these
artboards there's a few things to notice
number one they have properties here in
the inspector on the right you can
change the background or the fill of the
artboard itself so where the background
of your art will just you know have this
fill and you can set up a grid on the
artboard and you can set the grid to any
number you like you can even set the you
can set the color of the grid to be
anything you like as well there here's
an interesting one scrolling so when you
set it to vertical let's say we want the
viewport height to be 960 but we want to
create a design that's very tall go zoom
out here and when I have this artboard
selected I could just make it bigger by
pulling down this side here and there's
this dotted line this dotted line
represents the fold so when I would
would make a demo so let's say I press
this play button I have this well
actually let me draw some art on it so
you can see what I'm talking about I
mean hit a rectangle rectangle there
oh there that's all good so now when I
hit this play button up here or rather
when I in creating a prototype or a demo
I can scroll down on it and that fold
was represented by the dotted line is
right there but I can scroll past it and
so oftentimes when we're creating apps
or websites you know they can get very
very long and so you may be a website
look really really long and has a few
different types of elements on it that's
what that that's what that dotted line
means and I think that's kind of it
let's back away let's let's close out
this window here and get back to that
starting starting place and I want to
use the custom size template here
because really what that means is that
there's no artboards actually here and
you have to use the artboard tool here
to either choose a custom I choose one
of those sides those template size or
you can just drag one out at any size
you like
now with the artboard tool selected you
can you can make them as many upwards as
you like which by clicking you know
above or below or to the right you know
and you just click around I'm going to
create new artboards relative to the
most recent artboard that you created or
the one before it and you'll notice that
these artboards number themselves - 1 -
2 - 3 and you can also with an artboard
selected hit option and just drag a new
one out and it will continue that
numbering scheme 8 9 here's 10 here's 11
right and so in this way you can keep
track of the versions you make or
whatever if you double click on one of
these names you can give it a new name
here and and then when you drag that out
it will be new name - one new name - two
and so on so that's a really easy way to
manage your artboards you just hit the a
hotkey and you're in the artboard tool
again ok so that's everything you need
to know really about artboards like I
think ok so let's close that and then
let's go into the into this tutorial
here this is a really great file that's
built into XD I'll help you explore a
lot of the major themes of XD what we
want to do here is start looking at the
tools the first tool I'm using is this
little arrow this is the positioning
tool wait wait what is it called its
called a move tool select tool ok it's a
select tool
use it to select things like this and
move it around pretty self-explanatory
we also have the rectangle tools like
these this one here these four okay
these three draw primitive objects and
this one will help you draw more complex
here our selection here those will help
you draw more complex objects the pen
tool right there so let's start with the
rectangle tool you just hit or you can
draw rectangles 90% of what I do in XD
is drawing rectangles each rectangle has
you know a few different appearance
controls we have dimensions in position
if you're in an artboard then this
position will be relative to the
artboard right oh that's not an artboard
let's draw in our board out okay now
this rectangle be positioned relative to
the artboard so if I hit 0 0 I'll be top
left and right right there and the width
is a really quick way to you know tab up
and down make it smaller and use precise
increments so you can get the exact
shapes that you're you're looking for so
that's the rectangle tool every
rectangle has these appearances or
rather these properties you can
manipulate border and fill just you know
pretty good everyone can have a drop
shadow here and this will be the blur
like a big drop shadow you can
manipulate the color of the of the drop
shadow it's all good and then the
appearance would sorry this this is the
opacity of it and you there's a shortcut
if you hit 3 it's 30% for and just kind
of move it around like that if you hit a
number really quickly five six it turns
into 56 or just five it's 50 all right
so it's a quick way to adjust the
opacity of something really quickly and
then these are the this is the border
radius you can make that make it have a
rounded rectangles or you could drag
these little nodes here in the corner
and drag them in if you hold option and
drag one of them it just drags one angle
in right there and you can see that it's
just manipulating one so this toggle
here will make them all happen and this
is for two toggle them one at a time all
right and when you're in a in a field
here you can see which angle you're
manipulating
so so those are all that's basically how
you manipulate rectangles in ex-ceo
there's one more thing this thing is
called a background blur okay when you
click background blur the object turns
into like this blurring thing that when
it's above other graphics it will blur
those graphics out and you can adjust
how much blur you want it to have right
here and the brightness which will say
do you want it to be like a dark overlay
and a blur or like a bright overlay in a
blur or just neutral put it at zero and
it just it adds adds no brightness it
just blurs and and then right here this
is basically the opacity of the shape
how much do you want the shape to come
through so if this was let's say for
example let's let's take this can we get
this image find an image here I have an
image right here let's get this image
and if we do a background blur it turns
into a background learning object just
like we showed it for but this opacity
will actually let the original image
show through now the image itself is not
blurred it's just you know how opaque is
it and then how blurry is what's behind
it right okay so now there's a drop down
here angle and this will change the
function of this thing entirely so
because it becomes not a background blur
but an object blur and this is basically
just a Gaussian blur that would you
could add to any object right right so
that's a little bit complicated at the
bottom there but everything else is just
exactly what you'd expect it to be let's
move on to the next primitive these are
ellipses and if you hold you know shift
when you drag out and know when you're
constraining the size so it'll be a
perfect circle and same things that you
know apply here fill border shadow
background blur and everything's pretty
much the same and then you have lines in
the short keyboard shortcut for line is
L so hit L and you can drag out new
lines these these are a little bit you
know it's like the width of it is like
not the width of the line itself but how
I don't know it's kind of hard to
explain I rarely use lines even if I
want a one pixel rule I'll just drag out
a square or a rectangle rather and just
fill it with a black and make it make
its height one pixel that's how I do
rules I rarely ever do lines I think the
only time I ever draw lines is if I'm
drawing an arrow to something and then
writing a note with a type tool which
which brings us to the next tool this is
a type tool okay so in in XD there are
you know there's typography but it's not
as robust as the other Adobe
applications in fact every note that
every type that you make defaults to
Helvetica neue which is super annoying
and I wish that it would just you know
go to the last thing that I made to
watch if I make a new one new note it's
at Helvetica so anyway it's always at
Helvetica always this color of gray but
you know you bakers can't be choosers I
guess so yeah
all those similar things in the
appearance panel are still here
appearance
we got opacity fill a border you know
you can add a border these these things
right here these dropper eyedroppers are
two sample colors so you can sample the
color of anything you see shadow
background background blur you can even
make you can blur out text or you can
even use text as a background
blurring element you see turn off the
border you see how that it's just
blurring what's behind it so that's
that's nifty and those are those are
like the creative to literally that show
you this pen tool if you've used a pen
tool before the concepts are similar but
the practicalities are a little bit
different if you double click on
something it turns into a Bezier shaped
a Bezier curve instead of a hard shape
you turn it back and forth you can click
on the middle of a line and drag out so
it's a pen tool you've seen pen tools
before this one's a little unique
Electric's you have to like kind of
explore it to understand what I mean by
that but you know nothing too surprising
what do we have next up zoom zoom in
click click click there we go I prefer
just to hold
and scroll in and out that's kind of
what I do normally for my zooming and
then you can also press the spacebar and
get that get that pan a hand to drag and
pan over around you can also scroll to
the left and right but you can also use
the use the spacebar to toggle this
little hand here a panhandler a hand
hand Handler and pen what okay what else
do we want to talk about here okay these
are all the tools to creation tools and
let's talk about these two tools down
here at the bottom this is going to be a
layers panel all right so when you have
nothing selected we're going to show you
all the artboards and zoom out here you
can see we have an artboard called home
blog adventure and gear and here they
are home blog adventure and gear and
this is the general pasteboard basically
anything that's not in an artboard so
let's double click into home I was gonna
rename it home in it if you double click
on to any artboard it will zoom your
right to it and then you can just kind
of grab something and manipulate it
right like that's kind of what a little
layers panel is you can hit command Y
and get rid of that layers panel I never
have it open I don't like it I think
it's distracting from the art it's in XD
it's so easy to touch the art so like
for example let's say that this element
and I'm holding shift and multi-select
here all these elements are in a group
now if I let's go back let's open that
layers panel you can see they're in a
group if I want to click on gear guide I
can hold command and click right on it
and it will die if my selection will
dive deep into it and then I can just
hit escape to go up one level right so
it's really easy I don't ever have this
layers panel open I'm just like oh
here's this one I'll select you know a
command shift select these two things
and move them over here and then escape
to select this whole group and put it
over you know whatever I wanted to do so
I you know layers
initially when what's this app called XD
launched there was no layers panel at
all and it really opened my mind up to
touching art directly and being able to
not even need a layers panel and I think
they got some criticism for that people
were kind of stuck in
they're stuck in their old ways and they
gave him a layers panel you know you
know give them what they want but I'm
I'm really grateful for the experience
of having to not use the layers panel
because now I realize I really don't
need it and I think I'm faster without
it
so the next thing down here so this is
layers and this is symbols right so if
you can hit to get the layers panel out
you hit command Y and I think it's shift
command Y to get symbols yeah symbols
should command Y gives you symbols it
also gives it puts it away a symbol is
something that you know you create once
and you can use multiple times if I
press this plus button all it'll create
a new symbol out of that and I can drag
onto the artboard and then when I when I
manipulate this piece of art let's say I
change the fill color you notice that
they're both changing at the same time
and I showed you guys this when I did
the sketch symbols comparison yeah
nothing's too much nothing's too
different right there but a way to make
a new symbol is to select an element and
press command shift K nope command K
yeah okay press command K and it becomes
a symbol and that and then just dive
into it you know it's just like a layer
group you can even do that command click
trick that I showed you and you can
escape out to the icon and move it
around and then every symbol that you
see now has the offset kind of icon and
yeah this is exactly what you would hope
to expect from symbols panel let me hit
command shift Y to get that symbols
panel away and the last thing I want to
show you guys as a tour of this this
application is the repeat grid button
this thing is awesome so let's say let's
actually just get rid of this these two
things and I must select this group in
this group by holding shift and this
group and I'm gonna hit repeat grid now
these things are repeating elements and
I can just drag it drag them all out and
this is the margin between the the new
elements you know and so you can go in
here and then when you have a repeat
grid element kind of happening you can
you can edit all of the text here the
contents oh hello there you air
beautiful your BH your fur and it
doesn't affect every instance of this
repeat grid right so like let me show
you the there you go warm dry cool hello
you're beautiful but if I do change the
color of something it would change in
every instance let me change it to like
a yellow interesting so the rule here is
that content doesn't change so like text
or images like if I made this into a
repeat kind of grid here and then I
dropped a new image on these they would
not change are sorry they would be able
to change and maintain the kind of grid
feature but if I were to change the size
of the image that would would change in
the grid right so they would not be able
to be individually sized yeah so um man
that is that's a pretty quick tour of
the whole app you know what I love about
XD is that it's so early on that like
you know you can do a tour how long
we've taken to this thing in 17 minutes
I told I toured the whole entire app we
didn't talk about prototyping yet we're
gonna do that next video but I turned
toward the whole design section of this
application in about 20 minutes and you
know if you can learn an app in 20
minutes and then start creating I think
that's a really good thing so you know
you're welcome I recommend spending a
little bit more time in that tutorial
document that I shared with you you
after going through those like six or
seven steps you'll really understand the
fundamentals of Adobe XD and that's
really what this whole video is about so
it's another great opportunity for you
to get comfortable with Adobe XD next
week we're gonna be jumping into the
prototyping phase of Adobe XD after
you've designed the most perfect design
how can you make a prototype of it and
that means like you know making
something clickable that people can
experience on their phones or sending
them a file that can click around it and
make comments or even or even creating a
video that you can email to people and
demonstrate your really great design
ideas so that's gonna be fun look
forward to that next week
I also want to thank the patrons of deaf
tips these are people who join the
community who support this show by
offering a dollar amount of their
choosing for every video that we create
here and it's really great you can meet
other people who are interested in the
same things you are get feedback join
the community there it's really great
check it out all the benefits of that at
patreon.com slash dev tips I'm hanging
out it's pretty fun and then you know
and that that's kind of it I'll see you
guys next week and until then keep on
hacking ah the beginner guide the guide
for beginners the the beginner guide for
beginners the beginners begin here the
beginner's guide the guide for beginners
the guide were the beginners in this
video I want to introduce you to the UI
of Adobe ux e ux what's going tobe XD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
