exciting episode of dem tips this is a
unique episode for a lot of reasons the
first one being is that I'm not in my
garage tonight which is nice
second one is I'm joined by Louis
Montoya I'm not alone you remember lows
from such classic episodes of dev tips
like CSS basics cascading and also
responsive web design basics so welcome
Louis thank you thank you it's also a
unique episode because we're not
learning how to code websites in fact
we're learning how to not code websites
we're using a service called Wix comm to
help you make simple and fun websites
thank you to Wix for sponsoring this
episode thank you ah ok so here's the
setup know your mom calls you yeah your
mommy called me and okay so she calls
and she's really excited about this new
idea she has she wants to be a famous
food critic right so she needs of course
her idea is she needs a blog and that's
why she called you you could do what we
did a few episodes ago in dev tips and
start you know making a jekyll generated
blog the problem is I'm not so sure your
mom is excited about running commands in
the terminal oh here you go
terminal have at it enjoy enjoy another
option maybe you could jump her over to
WordPress land but like even then she's
still going to run into templates and an
admin back-end
that she needs to fuss with before she
can get what she wants out of the site
yeah it's pretty nice you know I find
that when you increase the complexity
towards reaching a goal people are just
less likely to follow through overtime
and so in times like this when mom's not
trying to learn template hierarchy it's
times like this when something a little
bit more straightforward a little bit
more simple is the best choice so what
we're going to do is we're going to take
that example of your mom needing a
cooking blog and we're going to see if
we can meet those needs using a website
Wix com
that's cool she called you though okay
we chat for a long time she is really
chatty chatty Kathy
anyway you're probably watching dev tips
because you have a friend or family
member that called you up as well and
said hey you do internets can you make
something for me and that's probably
your watching dev tips is you want to
build something but there are ways out
there to make the stuff that are simple
and fun so I'm gonna see if we can get
this all done in under 15 minutes build
your mala blog in under 15 minutes let's
get started
cool so I just logged in to wix.com and
the only thing I can do is to start
creating which is awesome so I'm struck
trading right now and the first step in
creation is to pick a template and they
have like these tons of really awesome
templates that you know I'm sure we can
find one for you for your mother
she's a foodie she's a booty yeah so
let's just do a search I guess let's
just search food and don't look nice
this is salt and pepper so salt n pad
liver wait scroll down how many 10 pages
10 pages of food of food sites so I'm
gonna go over actually I'm going to do
go into the topics here and go to
personal blogs
here's that salt and pepper 100 K this
one I'm gonna take one that's actually
not a food blog okay because I want to
show you guys how easy it is to kind of
just like twist things around and make
it work for you alright so this is not a
food blog but we're going to turn it
into a food blog we're in the preview
mode you can jump in and out of your
templates like this but now I'm going to
choose to edit this site and we're going
to load the editor so the first thing I
knew need to do is I'm just going to
rename this because I know that I don't
want the ninja parents blog I want to
called it the all-caps this guy the foo
dist I made that name up Oh as you know
I hit that anyway yeah did you make up
the not space between thy food yes
because I'm going to do this I'm gonna
turn that black so now you see I'm using
my design skills design design you
thought I couldn't design I'm actually
really good at actually what I want to
do is go to the design tab and okay yeah
I want to go to the design tab and go to
fonts now they have a bunch of like
preset kind of
um font structures and you can like just
test to might as you go there's one that
I've kind of like down here
mmm actually this one is fun okay it's
nice and clean easy to do the foodist
looks good but you can customize the
font even further and you can go in
there they're not necessarily classes
that you would edit like in the HTML but
you can think of them that way this is a
title there are menus and their page and
this is like these kind of like these
headlines will you know they'll pop up
all over like each of these blog post
has this level of heading you know I
mean so if you edit it right here it
will show up throughout the whole site
so I'm going to change this to American
typewriter and say okay so now all of my
headings have looked it's kind of like
Oh going to the Cole typewriter II feel
cool and I'll do the same with my menu I
want them to be a typewriter guys it's
fun and then for the title though I want
something a little bit more slimming a
little bit more sleek than to Homa which
it is on let's put it on a lot of font
options here okay Mars oh there you go
really a you know classy but you can see
how because I change the font the the
layout is a little bit different right
so like how there's not enough padding
at the top maybe a little too much at
the bottom yeah what's cool is it like
everything on this page that you see is
like editable am like you can fidget
with it like it's not like a template
that you may be used to on other like
very very template eyesight's like I can
click this banner and to say like ooh
you're smaller you're longer like look
how do you mean like I can click the and
it's interesting how like each element
impacts the other moments yeah very
similar to what we're used to when
you're programming sites like if you say
oh this container to be X you know
pixels tall the things below it will
push down there right you'll have the
same effect here so I'll scrunch this up
the box that the text is in and see how
the the banner just scrunches up or down
yeah that's cool they a whole bunch of
like you know helpful handy things but
so I can pull it down let's go scrunch
it in and now now it's nice and centered
the way I liked it you know
yeah that's cool so let's click on this
they call it a strip but it's like the
header here and change the image they
have tons of free stock images so I'll
just type in food see what we get and
there we are three bowls of V and three
bowls of vegan food so doesn't that look
cool
the foodist the food is the food is this
mister yeah good assistant sir but my
mom called you your yeah your mom's the
food is now
okay so right press is the food is okay
so your mom called so what is this ninja
parent doing here right so I'm just
going to edit this text and you edit the
text right in line so what's what's nice
about this is that your mom can do it
literally it's so simple so you're gonna
like and give this your show her how to
do it but then you're gonna leave her to
it and she'll stop bothering you yeah me
the foodist right and then um you can
just change out these images really
easily in fact I uploaded can I uploaded
a picture of your mom so I'm so
good-looking Oh check this out you can
resize and move around why are you
moving I'm over dude oh I like your
mom's size I'll take this text over here
and just kind of make make it oh and
that's because I put it outside and it
will just warn me that's not a good idea
but that's okay
so I just kind of put it inside here and
she can change this to be like hi I'm
Kelly keep asking and then I'll just
shore this up right here oh that was
cool to see how easy that was
when you go to the next page let's say
like you know if somebody clicks into
your post
the layout is back over here is back to
normal so what I want to do is go back
to that home it's just as simple as this
I'm going to select this and this and
move in that and press command-c and
literally copied it to my clipboard yeah
and then when I go to these
no page I'm just going to select delete
delete and delete and command paste Wow
right and pull it up and it's easy and
you know instead of doing that over and
over again you can actually make these
show on all pages
oh cool right so like I cut and paste it
from one or the other but you could say
make these edits and then propagate
those edits out throughout all their
pages ah it's really simple to make
changes that could go through the whole
side score yeah
did you see how when I clicked on this
blog post it kind of like faded in and
out that's a transition and they have a
bunch of interesting transitions that
you can choose from so I go back to the
editor pages and then page transitions
in and out one that I like the best is
swipe horizontal I just think it feels
like really modern it's kind of kind
like an iPhone or something ah you know
I show this one so preview and then I'm
gonna go to home and look at how it goes
it's just kind of fun right
yeah that's cool slides in I like this
one so those animations can go on not
just the pages but a lot of the elements
that exist on the page individually as
well so for example and just click this
in a random headline here and go add
animation how about floating in and
click okay then when I go to preview and
then it's it kind of like happen as I
scroll in the site enters the viewport
watch with this headline it was kind of
fly-in and so you can do that you can
actually build animations on top of each
other you can say like a fly in and turn
and you know interesting things that are
just not like kind of like stock you can
like make a lot of new ideas Adam so so
you guys can play with that when you
wanted to sign up for Wix it is free so
go ahead and just check it out another
thing I want to do is show you guys how
to do this oh go back to the editor and
I click on the background here I have I
mean everything here is clickable you
can just make edits for that like for
example here in oh we're not in the home
let's go to the home page okay in the
home page I click on this blog I can
edit the settings or the box style is it
no not the bar so I can edit the
settings for the blog feed this is
pretty cool look at the a like several
different layouts yeah you can do like a
masonry kind of stuff
if you have more blog posts that kinda
just like staggers through we're like
large posts or this one here it kind of
feels like I don't know I'm kind of like
a magazine is really a you know and you
can go in here to these elements and you
could say all the space between them to
be a little tighter Wow crazy right
where's your way how big do you want the
images to be bigger smaller and it's
just like everything's like really
flexible and it just moves to what you
want it to be yeah and this this will
keep your mom busy yeah and and what's
cool about it is that even though you're
editing the template right now you can
jump into the content editor right away
and oh actually right now it's asking me
to save my work reminding me along the
way to save so I'll save it now and I'm
gonna name it so I'll say a foodie food
die foodie who died I'll name it a
foodie mom and save it cool
congratulations word is saved and so now
we get to edit the content its release
to this is what she'll be like working
in right yeah the main working area for
your mom and what's cool about it is
that it's not like go to you know her
URL slash admin and then work with a
bunch of abstract boxes to edit she's
touching the content right here and and
then she'll be able to edit it and and
then as she like edits and saves out
she'll be able to see let me just say
that she'll be able to see the content
right in line instead of like you know
going back and forth yeah that's cool
it's pretty cool um now is yeah that I
think that's the thing is like when I
said in the beginning like lowering the
friction lowering the complexity of her
achieving her goal you know so I want to
change like the background these stripes
back here there's you're gonna be
surprised by this so you can do
different patterns and stuff put
different image fills but you can also
change the color with this same fill and
it could be you know you know it'll
still have that move related texture on
top of it there are a bunch of different
tiles and textures and different kinds
of things that you can do actually do
like the white though cool cutting yeah
and let's see what other cool stuff is
there um there's this whole section of
like like widgets and modules that they
that they can easily add stuff on like
different types of galleries slideshows
I mean like the lists pretty long time
yeah of all these things that I can do
and in addition to setting up an online
store you know like there are other
things that she can extend her account
with to give her like like
enterprise-level Oh an enterprise-level
site right right like in your mom's like
oh I'm just building the business the
foodie business to do business it's a
blog business is a business so there's
now this blazing is my business
anyone calls you she called me a sleaze
like yo Chavez
I think I'm buddy come on business yeah
um so this is this is it I mean you can
do a lot of things there's a lot of like
even down to controlling your SEO your
sharing preferences on social networks
even the favicon and you also get
reporting like statistics analytics and
stuff on your site traffic that's cool
this is all free and then there's
different like levels of like upgrading
that you can do within it one more thing
I wanted to show you before we're done
is your mom decided to extend her
business and now she's no longer just
doing cooking blog and tips and stuff
she's actually wants to come into your
home and cook for you and give you
private lessons no money so what we want
to do and you know actually you tell her
to do is because it's so easy
mmm so you say mom figure out yourself
goes into pages and you go to add a page
now at this point there's like tons and
tons of like templates already ready for
her already ready already but you can I
like this one price list for her because
it'll help her to organize herself so
where she can sell herself so there's a
price list we're going to choose that
and we'll call this um in home and click
okay now you notice that there's added
and it just scrolled in that's cool it
just added a new element in my main
navigation of
and it took back the oh the little lines
that or something you know on the side
they like made space for and everything
it's cool so let's edit this page I just
want to get rid of that get rid of that
I'm going to pull this up and I'm going
to insert go to add and add image I'm
going to insert her her mugshot again
now it's a huge square right because I'm
not replacing another image that was
already a circle so how are we going to
get this to look like it should so and
put it in place and squeeze it down move
this tip paragraph over okay so uh first
thing we can do is edit the image and
notice we have image editing tools right
so your mom is not really good at
Photoshop either no but with these Lex
she's but I so with these like she can
like you know make a make a bump on
these images and just auto enhance or
she can go in to make effects and stuff
like what would effects we have in here
alright like Instagram can let your mom
Instagram her own photo on the cancel
these I'm gonna cancel out of this
actually I didn't want to edit the photo
itself but I did want to change its
style and they have these preset styles
and one of them is exactly what you
wanted special frame number one you can
edit the style even further in kind of
like you know make shadows behind it
like make it different punch things
border width and all that stuff but it's
already exactly what we wanted and then
we scroll down and we got some
headphones that doesn't fit so obviously
it just changed that image and again
using the free Wix images I'm going to
type in food see what we get now
remember this is a business that your
mom wants to extend where she comes into
your home income let's see if we can
find the right image what about this one
what about the beautiful berries can you
see somebody's like berries we go so
your mom comes to the business as your
mom comes your house and handy berries
she cooked very well they're a part of
this balanced breakfast she brings a
very Bush and the picture singer in your
home and you can extend this this like
frame of the photo or you know just like
make it too short or whatever it's all
like very I mean you can even flip and
rotate these things yeah and he is like
easily just double clicks in and changes
that her prices and kind of has
descriptions and stuff she's cheap for
her services she a good price like a
personal chef to come yes and easy okay
I'll pay 1099 for berry-picking
now notice like the headlines are the
same style that we decided in the very
beginning so when you add a new page you
don't have to kind of like okay what did
I want it to be and I kind of reiterate
through all those decisions you made
earlier they just inherit it just
cascades like it's like a basically a
style sheet don't that's pretty great so
in this way you can not only create
something fast for your mom but you can
enable her to extend those creations
yeah keep on building out what her
online presence should be yeah it's cool
yes a Wix will mature with her ass or
needs increase yes yeah she can extend
it through a whole bunch of different
ways so Wix is generally is good not
just for your mom not for free if you
guys want to build a site for Llosa's
mom it's pretty good
no but also buy five five five five
that's a lot of fun um but not just that
like if you guys want to do like a quick
portfolio or like a quick site for your
you know your friend or like your church
or something like that there's a lot of
different things that this can do in a
lot of different ways that it can enable
people who are not necessarily as savvy
as you are to build and maintain their
site without having to bother you guys
yeah or they don't have a reason you
said yeah that people who always call
you I got my site that's my head with it
that's me right you call me calling me I
have a number of people that the heads
are just like I'm just like they're
personally called to hey by the by you
