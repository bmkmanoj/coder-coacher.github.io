announce the winner of the coda to
giveaway from last week that's gonna be
at the end of the video right now let's
focus on the bunch of junk I just
uploaded to YouTube I've been thinking
about the plethora of CSS grids that are
available to us and I've been wanting to
talk about them for a long time
and I never really found the right angle
but I've got something for you today I
think I figured it out so I found this
website layout wireframe in some dark
corner of the internet and I thought
hmmm
wouldn't it be interesting if I
recreated this layout again and again
using different frameworks this would be
really cool because we'd be able to see
the different methodologies that each
frameworks espouses to get the same job
done another reason I'm excited about
this series is because each installment
is piecemeal you can pick and choose
what you want to see what frameworks you
want to look at and which ones you don't
and what's also cool for me about this
is because it's an open-ended series
there's no obligation for me to do them
all in order or even all at once so
today I did one and then next month you
know maybe come back and do another one
or one or when I feel like it's a good
time so this video turned out to be long
very long in fact so I tried to do
something new for dev tips for this
first time of kind of video into
multiple pieces now I recorded it all in
one sitting but it's in a lot of
different parts so you can take a break
and go get a corndog or whatever now if
you guys watch this in the playlist view
I'll be cutting off the intros and the
outros to make it easier for you guys to
get to the juicy stuff what's that you
already thought of that this is the
playlist view well aren't you a clever
girl so today is the first day in this
enormous series I love these and what
better way to kick off this series by
looking at the most popular kid in
school of course bootstrap now I do
think it's a really good idea to take a
look at the bootstrap grid to dissect
the CSS the IMP that actually makes the
CSS grid but today is not that day we're
just going to use it to make a layout
and see how easy it is to use I like
this I'm excited and I'm sure that these
videos will become more valuable as
other frameworks are added to the series
and now the moment we've all been
waiting
for I'm going to announce the winner of
Kota - now this is a hundred dollar
piece of software is not like a cheap
piece of software it's made by a company
called panic we also make other cool
things and I talk about the features at
length in last week's video go check
that out if you haven't seen it yet to
be eligible for this giveaway I asked
you to tweet a link of the video and
hashtag about tips giveaway now my

excited to say that it gathered 137

going to pick the framework that is in
