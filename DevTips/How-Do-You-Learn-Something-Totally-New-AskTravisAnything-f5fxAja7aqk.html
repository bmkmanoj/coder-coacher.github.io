Scotty thing yeah once they get really
really force yeah the yeah gets me every
time and I was like yeah I'm thinking it
but you're saying this question comes
from Linda vitsin how do you approach a
totally new topic I'm a programmer but
I've been asked to make a website how
can I go about learning to know what I
need to learn right so there's a bunch
of parts that I can't even see to learn
yet how does she get a clearer picture
puzzle that's a that's a tough one
especially with it with web programming
because it depends on who you taught
everybody you talk to is gonna say hey
learn this learn that did what and
they're all different things right but
one of the things that I always go back
to is foundation foundation foundation
and every year right yeah so at the
foundation of building websites HTML for
structure CSS for design and JavaScript
for interactivity but learning the
basics of each of those right learn the
basics of how HTML works and functions
learn the basics of how CSS works and
function so when you encounter it you
know what it is and why it's happening
even if you don't necessarily have
everything memorized so building that
foundation up of these these topics that
will help you there is going to work as
like a nice foundation for when you're
trying to build your house right if you
have a bad foundation the whole thing's
gonna come down so that's a no-no that's
exactly right just thinking about how
that applies or just a few like a month
ago I was playing a video game and as I
was getting towards the end of the video
game it was like really hard but I was
really good yeah and if I thought like
if I started the game at like the ninth
level or the last level I would have
died every time yeah so like like having
that foundation or the basics on which
to everything else to builds by the time
you get to that higher level it makes a
lot of sense so that what I'm saying is
if you start looking at this higher
levels like Scott mentioned everybody
has an idea everybody has advice right
right but if you start with everybody's
ideas of what they think you need you're
gonna say it's so it's so overwhelming
it can never
understand this I can never learn this
but Scott says started the foundation
learn to learn the foundations and I was
gonna mention something very similar
it's like like when you're building a
puzzle one of one tactic is to build all
the Brat the borders out right so so
frame your problem is what that what I
mean by that so in this case you're
building a website maybe it requires a
new type of functionality a new type of
like thing that you never approached
before well learn what those borders are
like and seek to understand how those
specific problems have been handled
before how what opportunities or
technologies or resources are available
to you maybe it's another person that
you can talk to or a book that you can
read or you know a tutorial that you can
purchase from Scott yeah that last one
yeah yeah Scott is by the way we didn't
mention it before is the purveyor of
level up tutorials on YouTube and he has
a whole bunch of like really really
exceptional premium tutorials thank you
so Lynne I hope that was helpful to you
and thank you for watching everyone keep
on hacking and we'll see you guys in the
future way in the future
super super in the future hey you just
watched ask Travis anything if you have
a question for me then send a tweet to
at dev tips show and hashtag equip ask
Travis
anything thanks for watching and check
out these other questions on the
playlist here on YouTube</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
