and today we're getting stupid nerdy you
know I've long held that it doesn't
really matter what tools you're using an
expensive paintbrush in the hand of a
novice will never be as good as a cheap
paintbrush in the hand of a master so
bring your dream weavers bring your
notepad plus plus --is it's not the
tools you use it's how you use it and
now I've got that out of the way let's
talk about our tools a few of you have
asked but a few of you have asked me
about what okay
no just wait wait for me to do it okay
oh look a few oh so fun to get out your
system okay so I just been a few
requests for me to make a video about
Adam the code editor that I use and the
packages that I use with it and that's
this video so let's get so I've
completely deleted Adam off of my system
right now so we can do this together if
you want to start with me now is the
time to do it go to adam.com page for
Adam the code editor that Adam by the
way is made and developed a byte
github.com the company so here's a quick
and simple download button also if you
have some time watch this video it's
particularly funny and quick humored
alright it's downloaded now I'm just
going to drag that Adam into my
Applications folder and launch Adam cool
we get the welcome screen here and now
what I want to do is go through and talk
about how I set up Adam so let me just
open a project that we've used before
sites
here's designing code so we've got our
project here on the left and you should
read these welcomes they're particularly
helpful I want to start with this
setting so I'm going to hit command
comma and we're going to get the
settings the first thing I do is I'm
going to use the font that I want to use
I don't know what the default is like
Monaco which is a good one
so what I've been using lately is Roboto
mono which is nice I like that one I use
16 for the default font size it's a
little bit bigger and we show you
here in assets let's open functions and
split left
so now that I've split this you'll see a
live update so the default is 14 and
then I just change it to 16 because it's
a little bit more comfortable for me to
read and it's definitely easier for you
guys to see in fact when I'm doing
videos I'll bump this up but when I'm
coding 16 is nice now on the settings
here there's a few default settings that
are just you don't need extensions or
anything like that but they're like
really really important to me one of the
biggest ones for me to have a
comfortable read is you know when you
get down to the end here that the
scrolling stops but if you click scroll
past the end you can just keep on
scrolling and and that's really
comfortable for me I used to go enter
enter enter enter enter enter limit
there was no scrolling past the end and
it would be like that's how I would make
it a little bit more comfortable but
scrolling past the end just really does
that automatically and it's really comfy
the next thing is for me I like to show
the indention guides and so I click that
checkbox the indention guides are these
lines here which are super helpful if
you're getting more complicated code and
if you're using Jade which is based on
nesting you know you have like some of
that going on these indention guides are
going to be extremely helpful I don't
show Invisibles but some people like to
do that so they can make sure they don't
have any like extra spaces after their
line endings and things like that I
don't really care that much about it but
one thing that I do think is helpful is
to look at the tab length tablet by
default is 2 and that's how I like to
keep it as well I don't use tabs I use
when I hit a tab it's going to be
rendered as two spaces and I think that
is best for me and the last thing in the
general settings that I'll show you is
about ignoring the name so if you look
in my source panel here I have like this
one is like a DS underscore store which
is a file that is a system file for the
Mac operating system you'll have those
in like almost every folder then I'll
have a dot git folder which is like my
version control and then underscore site
which is like from Jekyll so there's two
big
things right here one of them is ignored
names and by default it has dot get dice
VN da store thumb which like the
thumbnails for the previews if you're
using certain operating systems I don't
want these to show up in my sidebar so I
need to ignore them here's a list of
them and you can you can add to them or
replace them entirely
and then also there's this this option
here which is exclude VCS ignored past
VCS is a version control system so if
you make a file in your version control
system like get ignored get ignore file
and you write a few things in there
you'll also want those to be hidden in
the sidebar here as well you just you
just don't want to like have your mind
cluttered with a bunch of files that you
don't need to understand or don't need
to kind of like manage right so now now
what gives right the default says that
these would be gone and I've already
clicked these but why are they not there
this is the tricky thing that took me so
long to figure out I'm going to go down
to packages and I'm going to do a search
because these are all core packages core
packages are the packages that are come
default by Apple remember this is a
fresh install I just downloaded this I'm
going to do a search for tree and
there's a tree view package so I'm gonna
go into the settings of tree view and
then there's high the ignore names I
don't know it's it's so it's so bad but
hide ignore names gets rid of I could
see that get there and then da store is
gone that's look that I definitely want
that and then hide VCS ignored files
like look it underscore site at the top
now it's gone good because this is a
Jekyll file and in my GUID ignore file I
am get ignored right here on line 36
underscore site and that's kind of all I
messed with with the default settings
everything else I kind of leave as is
and then I go into like themes and
packages and things so next let's look
at the themes that I use a lot of the
questions where what are the themes that
I use what is the syntax highlighting so
let's go into themes right here Adam
shipped
once upon a time with
Adam dark this is like the default theme
that it came with it's kind of like
aggressive like the tabs are very
inspired by sublime and it actually
looks like sublime a lot and then
recently they updated to this theme
called one they won dark and one light
one dark is quite nice this is the
default theme that you'll open with
here's one light it's also nice so I
like the theme of one dark now to
install new themes go to the install tab
on the left and then you can search
either for packages or themes so let's
go to themes right now and a theme that
I have noticed recently kind of get
popular is is a pretty fun one let's
look for material and the one we're
looking for is the top here called atom
material so just click install and once
that is downloaded I'm gonna jump back
over to themes and then it'll be in the
selection drop-down atom material and
there it is so do I think it's cool I
think it's cool does it look cool it
looks cool the problem I have with it
and the problem I have a general
material design is that it's not that
usable so for example the dropdowns here
in themes where's the drop-down oh it's
right there that they're just not fine -
why I think the material needs to get
rid of this underline for the search
boxes like the text boxes and I don't
know so I don't use it because it's kind
of not usable but it is pretty so I'm
going to switch it back to one dark
which is a lot more easy to like
navigate and use let's talk about the
syntax themes the syntax things that I
like to use almost do a search for space
here the one that I like to use is down
here Space Gray atom dark syntax by JC
house there's a lot of them but I like
this one the best it's not as like
in-your-face as the rest of them its
subdued its muted and it's quite pretty
so let's go back over to themes for a
syntax theme I'll choose atom space
grade dark now you notice that functions
has not updated so let's let's open
functions again over here so the
difference between these two panes right
here is that on the on the Left I have
the default atom themes like one dark
and on the right is called space grade
dark from JC house
and it's a little bit you see it's like
just it's less bright it's a little bit
more muted and that's kind of all I do
for themes and syntaxes and things like
that it's pretty simple next let's talk
about packages let me open this Jade
file here and then I'll switch to
packages because I want to search for a
packages the package that I use to make
this syntax highlighting for Jade work
is called Adam Adam Jade okay so I'll
install this and then immediately you
see my my Jade code gets highlighted and
that's for Jade let me show you my CSS
here okay now we know that I'm using
sass and I love it but one thing that I
do with my packages and like the way
that I write code is like like this
autocomplete it just really really bugs
the crap out of me it always gets in my
way it suggests the wrong thing all the
time like for example if I'm in a SAS
file why is it suggesting markup like
HTML stuff marquee and then it's
suggesting functions here I don't it's
wrong it's all wrong it's not that great
and it was autocompletes the wrong thing
for me so personally what I do is I go
into my packages and I search for
autocomplete and I find this one called
autocomplete plus and I just disable it
I don't like it so then when I'm down
here I can just write margin like a
normal human and then just be you know
done with it so that's one that I just
turned off and a lot of people will be
like will you turn off our complete well
it's just personal you don't have to do
it I'm not recommending that you do it
it's just for me I don't like it it
might make me faster but it also like
makes me I find that when I have it on I
have to make more fixes because it's a
auto-completed the wrong thing then if
I'm just like misspelling things all the
time so many people would be like hey
Travis will you please use Emmett that's
another one that I'm not going to use I
don't know why I don't use Emmett I know
a lot of people recommend Emmett and it
is an autocomplete er it's like a it's
like a text expander so you'd write a
few short key words and then it would
expand into like you know a nesting kind
of situation but I don't use it because
I use Jade and Jade is already compact
enough for example like this is like a
huge page worth of markup and if I were
to expand it into HTML then I'd be
editing HTML and I want to edit Jade not
HTML that's just me but
one package that I do use a lot and I
get a lot of questions about is
something called pigments pigments a
package to display colors in project
files
now that pigments is installed you can
see already that the colors in this file
called VAR CSS are all highlighted in a
certain way so let me go over to just
one just click the package pigments and
I'm going to get the the settings for
the pigments package itself right now
the default kind of style of pigments is
to use the whole text string like the
hex color right here gets highlighted
with a box around it and you can go to
marker type and right now it's on
background you can set that to outline
which is like the border around it or an
underline simple which is kind of I like
that card a lot it's nice I've been
using dot dot is probably my favorite
way another interesting one is gutter
which moves everything over and add some
colors over on the left margin but dog
is nice people ask me a lot how do you
get those little dots this is how you go
to pigments and then you go to the
settings and you change it from marker
type to dot now I there's a few others
that will do this as well but pigments
is my favorite because it goes it goes a
little bit further for example if we
have primary color as a variable in SAS
and I have it set up to this pink color
here let me just write a body background
and then all right primary primary color
pigments will find the color that
defines that variable and pull the color
down into the variable which is
something that I haven't seen in the
other packages that do the dots as well
so that's pretty sweet and cool but
check this out if I go a lighten which
is a SAS function now 20% may be
lightened by 20% the new color on the
end is a result of the function so like
not only does it display the color like
we see if it you know line 1 and 2 but
like line number 5 it'll pull out the
variable and display that color but also
it'll
it'll allow you to do functions on the
variable and display that color and
that's pretty cool I think like you know
as you're as you're going through and
creating all these styles like that's
going to be super helpful in handy but
then you can also right-click on it and
then go to pigments and then convert it
to things like for example if you didn't
wants at I don't know why you would do
this but like let's say just converted X
hexadecimal and there it is like that's
what the result of that variable is
that's pretty cool and you can not
convert it only to hexadecimal but you
could also do RGB a and stuff super
super fancy right there's other things
as well if I do command shift P and I
find pigments this one's really cool
pigments show palette it'll open up a
new tab and show me every color that's
in my project which is awesome and you
can see I've got a lot of Blues like if
this was my project I would be like oh
wait like this blue is similar to this
blue can't I just compile them in that
way have less definitions of colors and
stuff like that it's a great way to go
about and figure out you know life your
project is efficient or not another one
to do is to find colors right here find
colors is pretty awesome because if you
think like okay where is this color
defined and you could say like okay
here's that Reds defining a background
color in in this file and you can click
through to it and then it's highlighted
down here this is where that that color
is defined that's pretty sweet I like
that a lot like that's super helpful
with like just optimizing and finding
colors that you're using before oh what
did we use before when you know like
we'd have this kind of button what's the
rollover like it's just it's all kind of
going to be organized and helpful for
you there so I really like that now the
last thing that I want to show you is so
this file right here on my right is a
style sheet for all of Adam what I want
to do right now is show you how to make
these circles a little bit smaller I
think they're a little bit too big what
I'm going to do is I'm gonna open my
inspector and I'm going to select this
circle here this circle is a element
called pigments color marker I'm going
to copy the selector and paste it in now
that I have this selector I can edit
that are actually on the page in the
editor itself right here I noticed that
I have a translate declaration here
they're moving the the dot down a little
bit or up a little bit rather so I'm
going to paste that in I want to keep
that but I want to add to it
I just want to scale it down a little
bit let's say zero point six and save
and then the dot gets smaller
maybe zero point seven maybe zero point
eight that looks a little bit better
right
I'll show you bigger smaller it's just a
little bit of a change is not a huge
thing but I think it's a better move for
me personally that's kind of everything
that I do with atom to make it look the
way it does I think I mean I deleted
atom in preparation for this video so if
I forgot anything it's because I just
forgot and anything outside of these
