just like you that's what makes me the
perfect candidate to present this video
series called github for noobs I have to
get up and noobs
we're gonna be looking at the wonderful
world of get the version control system
and github the popular service that
makes creating developing and sharing
code fun and easy aha let's start with a
short history of git as with many great
things in life get begin with a bit of
creative destruction and fiery
controversy our story begins in 1991
with the creation of the Linux kernel
the Linux kernel is an open-source
software project of fairly large scope
for most of the lifetime of the Linux
kernel maintenance changes to the
software were passed around as patches
and archived files in 2002 the Linux
kernel began using a proprietary dcbs
or distributed version control system
called bitkeeper
in 2005 the relationship between the
community that developed the Linux
kernel and the commercial company that
developed bitkeeper broke down and the
tools free of charge status was revoked
this prompted the Linux development
community and in particular Linna store
vaults the creator of Linux to develop
their own tool based on some of the
lessons that they learned while using
bitkeeper some of the goals of the new
system were as follows
speed simple design strong support for
nonlinear development maintaining
thousands of parallel branches fully
distributed and able to handle large
projects like the Linux kernel
efficiently both in terms of speed and
data size since its birth in 2005 it has
grown and matured to be easy to use and
yet retain all of those initial
qualities it's incredibly fast it's very
efficient with large projects and it has
an incredible branching system for
nonlinear development it is free and
open source and primarily used on the
command line and that's why it's kind of
super scary for us noobs but don't worry
we'll get into that later
now github is a for-profit company not
to be confused with the open source
technology called git
github was formed and work began on the
platform in late 2007 the company was
originally named logical awesome in
February 2008 the company was officially
changed to github in June 2011 github
became the largest code repository
service surpassing SourceForge Google
code and Microsoft's CodePlex and total
number of commits in September of 2015
github reported 10 million users adding
new users at a rate of 10,000 per day in
addition to the functions of git github
offers additional tools such as
web-based graphical user interface and
desktop as well as mobile integration it
also provides access control and several
collaboration features such as bug
tracking feature requests task
management and wiki's for every project
github comm offers plans for both
private repositories and free accounts
which are usually used to host open
source software projects this channel
def tips has several github repos you
can find them at github comm slash dev
tips thanks for watching this short
history of and difference between git
and github next week we'll be looking at
how git is used and some of the common
functions so my name is Travis and I
produce all of these videos late into
the night in my poorly insulated garage
for you because I like you
these videos are supported by fans like
you who go to patreon.com/scishow --that
i make patrons get extra perks like
early videos they get extra videos and a
really great community chat if you find
these videos helpful and want to donate
and join that little community
come join us at patreon.com slash dev
tips that is it for today I'll see you
next week and until then keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
