subscribers I can't even count that high
right you know what I'm pretty sure I
can so to celebrate this incredible
milestone I'm going to do something that
I've actually never done before I'm
gonna watch the depth tip show and you
are invited to watch it with me so this
is kind of be like a travel reacts to
Deb pitch but right now I'm gonna watch
them like you guys do in a browser and
I'm gonna just be going down a memory
lane trip here I guess anyway let's
watch okay so here's the first video
that I ever posted to YouTube the
welcome for the channel hi guys oh my
gosh lastly this is dev tips for
designers is a YouTube channel we're
talking about website design bring
attention to the glasses by the
come-along subscribe down below let's
get awesome oh dude this is so bad when
is this intro I made this myself I
didn't mean this challenge designers who
specifically want to learn about coding
and website development but honestly
it's open to anyone who want to learn
more and get awesome at internets ok
there's a few things here that are just
too much these glasses they're just too
much the idea that anyone can get anyone
can get awesome and internets I know I
know it's I probably would still do that
today but this is just so bad looking at
it do I always look so ridiculous and
then is this music in the background
design of myself really this join this
song and this jingle is a loop that i
found on the internet somewhere like I'm
a free website if you're all super
excited here on this YouTube channel i
bleep video this loop was was found on
on this you know looping website and I
used it like in every video like the
first like six months in
and the whole way through like I didn't
stop the music ever even when I was
coding or talking about principles I
would the music would just keep going
all about the end tons of you were
complained about it how you can be a
part of it and I often do full series on
specific set but I often do full series
ml5 you can find that in the playlist
down below so join the funds to be right
down below do tutorials we're going to
do video questions I don't know if this
was scripted or lineups and reviews and
all kinds of crap it's gonna be great
subscribe to do oh my gosh I forgot I
used to do this this this is not even
man like this is a subscribe button and
I used to blur out the background it
started like do weird singing songs
about being a subscriber and that was
like the Star Wars missed that was the
star wars a theme song oh my goodness oh
my gosh okay this one I remember this
video because my channel in a good have
you my name is Travis news it's like the
only white shirt that I owned this is
deb tips for design a place of this
video to make the internet go I don't
mean the internet go this video is the
one where I am talking about display
types right so I give an HTML element is
in line static or block or something
like that or inline block and I use I
use my face as a whiteboard this is one
of those ideas that like we're way
better in law theory and then they
started by a default inline elements do
not create and everybody everybody who
watches this video it was like whoa dude
back away from the camera like look how
big that phases
it's like a like Steven spiel we're
gonna close up right there and I think I
started writing backwards yeah this is
backwards you hear that that music I
think it's like this weird dubstep
jingle yeah it was on every video begin
oh my gosh this is so bad all right one
smelled like trees with the magic of
stylings that's so ridiculous now
they're all by yourself and there are
arrows going for there's a P tag on this
one but today we just want to talk about
how this oh my gosh it's so stupid hello
everyone welcome to dip to this is the
first time that I ever took the camera
out into like really wild science we're
going to talk to people and get sick if
it was so embarrassing to like walking
around of this camera it still is right
vlogging is still hard but this is like
the most embarrassing looks like like
personally frustrating video ever made
because I was like so nervous about
taking this camera around a toxin
already scheduled but it turned out okay
I mean especially for a confidence about
HTML emails what's that not a designer
well that's okay oh thanks man okay so
this one is called how does the internet
work and noise in the support no I just
get in the picture of a dragon so I've
taken liberty of making it simple
enjoying this picture for enjoying this
picture for you let's get dragon with
breathing fire chasing able to describe
it no a complete picture okay uh so in
this video I start drawing like a map of
like a very very fundamental basic idea
of how you know like how a server works
and how does ftp word gow you know files
and browsers and things like that you
can this was recorded on my living room
floor and then win it all the wood
background right there is on the floor
and I I have like a light it'll just
plug in his camera upon yourself down
and I was like drawing they talk
right hand under try my mother been good
trying to draw this stuff this one is
about CSS cascades my name is Chuck oh
my name is less hectic that joy this I
forgot good so this one is with Carlos
who is my podcast co-host and this is
way before the podcast he was even a
thing and invited us over lures hanging
out no like dude let's look at make this
next video i have written and see he's a
natural look at that he's a natural
layout colors and just all certain along
time ago that's right today we're going
to three years no videos out one day
we're just these songs at the end are
pretty good very good so i made this
video when i first hit 107 100 now we're
at a hundred thousand ki believe that
this was actually a visit this video
over a hundred subs was actually better
than 100,000 room oh my gosh I forgot
this one okay this one is like the most
annoying it only has two thousand views
so what I do is I explain CSS floats
while i'm using my default well i'm
using this this like audio is called a
speech jammer now the idea behind CS
fast flow its is what it does is it
delays your speech it record to you and
place batching your own words to the
land while you're talking and so there's
like a delay in your mind and your it
makes it really really hard to speak and
think at the same time so that's what's
going on here right whichever you choose
and have the text kind of stylish lee
float like float up around it creating a
kind of visual style
see I flow lab this is how we work out
in right he uploaded off to the right as
you expected text everybody that I saw
this video I hated it because it was so
hard to watch because yeah because the
vocals were so weird oh that's hilarious
to me what's up everybody this is travis

bedroom a little bit you can see a
chalkboard behind me that's where my
kids then I drew the subject today it's

wrong when you watch this Halloween will
be over but for right now this evening
I'm a bunny oh this one this one has an
intro that's famous hey buddies welcome
to dev tips my name is Shep this this
video is quite popular as well the
subject is responsive HTML emails but
the videos recorded while I was on a
business trip in LA so this is like a
random hotel room that my boss booked
and she was like in the next room and I
like jumping on the bed and making
videos all night and she's she was like
what were you doing like the next
morning when I met her in the lobby just
like dude what are you doing like
yelling and stuff yeah that's a good one
watch that one again oh this one this is
this video has been are you doing it's
like the front like the homepage of the
channel for so long wrapping up some and
I just can't take it down because it's
just it's probably my favorite video on
the channel Robert E is in CSS I did I
recorded this like a two in the morning
back when because before I was doing
polyphase I sleeping though so entirely
you look tired bro after you know the
next important so sentimental and
meaning no oh this video is fun I
recorded this intro actually record the
whole thing while i was at Google like
in the morning before everybody showed
up notice how like the whole office is
like empty because I was like nervous to
have a camera out in front of people and
stuff yeah but the video is fun it's a
video is find out I'm creating this
little what's it called route this
little bb-8 is Star Wars character out
of soup HTML and CSS here on the right
I'll stylist people really like test you
do more of something like that HTML
drawings this one is called SAS or less
which one should i use whatever you were
deciding cool hat bro my choice after
today's video since missed by this video
this is so many people and because it's
like 10 minutes long and I'm supposed to
be asking the question about whether you
should use SAS or less you know and like
that's like a straightforward question
right the obvious answer is use SAS but
I don't really answer that question very
straightforwardly I instead talk about
how you should know that nice pause
right there mmm there you go that's a
better plus I talked about like how you
should know the fundamentals first
before you worry about these things
because this was like a response to my
getting a lot of people who were not
really skilled in HTML or css asking me
which like frameworks and processors and
blah blah blah they should use actually
there's another video in here that's
about frameworks that that it basically
do the same thing and and people just
don't like this one here is called it
here our CSS frame looks bad hi I'm
Travis this is dennis mix mustache today
I want to spend a few minutes answering
a question hi I'm Travis this is dev
tips today Oh bend a few minutes oh I
missed that hat I don't know where it is
I should find it again I used to wear
that hat in nearly every video when I
was like recording in the winter cuz
it's cold out here in the garage my ears
are cold right now but I can't find it
here's Carlos's video hey he's come he's
got look it's a really nice background
set up I have like the worst like it's
just a piece of YouTube videos I need a
better background this talk that I gave
was in front of some students at San
Jose State Aras urban university design
students about to graduate it's a pretty
good video I give like I think 18 points
or is it 18 or maybe 14 points of like
things that you should know before you
graduate a design school and a lot of
people that watch it
say that it's it's really applicable to
to like any field you know like
architecture or dentistry or whatever
hey everybody do I have a treat for you
my name is Travis Nielsen this is dev
tips for designers a YouTube channel
where we talk about website design and
development all that kind of stuff now
this is the third and last this one a
series i call see that how does Cece
let's see that third and last that took
like 30 takes to get me to say better
the last I was like this is going to be
such a great idea hold up the new root 3
and then do like a like a swipe across
the neck like it's the last like oh yeah
that's a great idea that's the best idea
ever had so in the end of this video we
describe the relationship of HTML and
CSS and javascript is like this cage
right get notified and sent like how are
you stack up and have their own on top
of each other he just made in this
moment here HTML spread on the style
where he sprinkle on the JavaScript
where she shows it in my face that was
like our great plan boy it turns out
pretty gross I doubt you guys have seen
this one this is when I shaved my
mustache oh look at p
you get it Oh big one look at you want
it sounds gorgeous home video she's so
cute yes achievement unlocked that was a
that was a video for like early on in
the dev tips community like I had a
milestone like when like maybe like five
or ten people joined I would shave my
mustache I had a moustache for a long
time and everybody would like write
comments like I hate your mustache
please shave thanks for the video I love
the video i hate the stache so I had I
had a milestone that like if X number of
people joined I would shave it and I got
that little girl to shave it just some
random girl in the neighborhood just
kidding that's my daughter you know I
keep on thinking that this one's a good
one but I don't know if I've ever
watched it last week I sent out an email
note I have this weird like red filter
on it meaning in your work let it drive
you let it motivate you to keep on
hacking don't let it discourage you that
will make all of the difference that
same feeling either good advice Trev
what if I Drive you for good these
videos right here like all four or five
of these videos were recorded in one
night and it's funny because they get
progressively worse like like this
regular CSS and they were like I was
answering questions from people who are
commenting that night and I was making
new videos for them it was like oh like
my wife was out of town and my kids are
asleep and I just making videos in my
bedroom like like it made like six
videos that night pixels inches m's rems
CMV 8v max and more there are a lot of
ways
of expressing length in CSS today we're
gonna talking about CSS units that took
a long time that intro took so many so
many takes I over that pixels
percentages m's rims take forever to get
one jeez so the idea was to like record
myself saying how do you send it things
with CSS like multiple times and then
stitch them all together and make this
weird jumpy intro but it turns out like
you said your things yes almost
inaudible these three videos are awesome
and remarks and I we made this we design
it in depth about the same of us and
they have an awesome show today ah and
then we like today we have a one
compared our executions together and
talked about their the differences
between the misting relationship that
you and I have we've and it was a
really cool guy he sure is a really
generous patron of the show for a long
time straight I released I released a
lot of videos Oh like only in the
community on patreon so there's a lot of
things that you guys haven't ever seen
like the mustache stuff like this one
what is designed I've never released
that one I should really release this
stuff it's weird man it's weird to look
back at all the things you've been doing
