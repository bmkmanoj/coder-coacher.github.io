project under version control using
github
you're watching dev tips with guest host
mpj and david github I'm thinking a lot
of people have probably heard the term
getting maybe heard the term version
control but maybe not I think there's a
lot of people that are not completely
familiar with what it is by using github
you can keep tabs of the changes in your
code and different people in the project
can work with the same codebase without
affecting each other's code so you can
work on one part of the project perhaps
the playlist component and I can work on
the title component and we can work
independently of each other and then
eventually when you're done and I'm done
we can merge into the project without it
just exploding exactly so it's firm
first and foremost github is a
collaboration tool but it's also very
useful to use github even if you are
just a single person because it gives
you this version control it allows you
to see what changes you have made and if
you make a mistake at some point you can
roll back to another version and you can
also check out certain version at some
point in time and you check what things
what happens at that point there's also
a ton of other very handy features but I
would say that those are the big ones
you have very advanced rollback features
and collaboration features yeah and it
also works as a backup so you don't have
to have the code on this laptop we're
using right now or if none of those
things come ere convinces you you can
also think that github is something that
all developers use so if you want to
speak with developers and interact with
developers version know what you're
doing that via version control and not
emailing files back and forth that is
going to make the
it's gonna remove a lot of the friction
this is what github looks like when you
are logged in you after you to what you
have to do on your own if you're
following along is to create an account
on github.com but it will look something
a little bit like this here you'll see
that I have tons and tons of tons of
activity so that means that like there's
an activity feed of everything that has
happened in all the repositories that I
contribute to a repository is basically
you can think of it sort of like a an
equivalent to a perhaps a Dropbox shared
folder or something like that yeah
it's a space where we keep code for one
project and my repositories are here
like I have amassed a lot of them over
the years but yours is going to be going
to be empty and the first thing that we
will do is to create a new repository
and we are going to call that what was
the name adder playlists better
playlists so this is an this is gonna be
this is used as an Earl so I think that
you you're not allowed to use spaces and
stuff yeah it will just override it and
we don't need a description we're gonna
make this public partially because you
can't create private repositories unless
you have a premium github account but
github is completely free if what you do
is public also we want you to be able to
check this out
and look at our progress as we go along
so we're gonna put a link to this github
repository in the in the episode
description and we don't need to
initialize this repository with a readme
we don't need to add a git ignore and we
don't need to add a license because
these things already exist in in the
react create react app template so
basically yeah yes the name public and
create repository so we talked a little
bit about what the next step is here
that we want to show you guys because
I'm a software engineer by trade and I
do these things every day so I use these
SSH keys and stuff but David suggested
that we should use github desktop
instead all right so we need to get
access to this repository now from our
local machine and there's two ways to do
this this advanced thing that which is
what I use and work and stuff and
there's this thing which I know nothing
about and that you would need to
demonstrate ok now we need to download
the gift hub application either you can
you can use this way and all this code
which most developers like mpj is doing
at work and stuff but for us as
designers it's easy to just download
their app I click here on help just need
to download where do they have their
application use Google no perhaps they
don't have it any longer they do give
top desktop client here we go download
for Mac OS yeah in case you didn't cast
it up there David just clicked around on
a everywhere until I found it
it's a sip fine let's kick it
desktop let's go yeah I want to sign
into github and enter your details all
right so I will enter my and configure
get this is used to identify the commits
you create anyone will be able to see
this information if you publish commits
I think it pulls this from a github
account and then it configures
configures my local get with these with
these options which is nice and it's
showing some examples here but like
showing how that is that is gonna look
in in the commit logs no I don't want to
activate dictation God so I just press
continue here is I think so
they are send no we don't we don't want
to make github desktop better okay here
we go so how do we add what do we do
with this I think that you can now click
the add to desktop button alright so now
we have the github application let's
click setup in desktop and do you want
to open github desktop in Swedish yes
here we go
what is the local path for better
playlists it's alright it wants to
create a new one how do we do that I
don't know this is a software you wanted
to use okay so let's just create a
better playlist - directory and then
we'll just copy everything over there
sorry this is real-world examples so
here we'll have it will be empty
yep and I will just copy it
so here we have the bet copy everything
from there to the better playlist to
paste but how big is it
it's 129 megabytes this is more than
JavaScript development for you I hope it
will remember this get ignore file which
says what it will ignore it where it
will not because you used finder to copy
this and it won't include hidden files
so you need to move that over using the
terminal ok so let's go to the terminal
yep we are in the original yeah so if
you do LS dot is like - a you will see
all the hidden files as well this file
we need because we don't want to push
everything in this node modules catalog
directory yeah because the node module
catalog is something that it's just a
temporary thing you can redownload that
easily at any time so you don't want to
commit that it's it's temporary files
and we don't want them in our repository
that would be so in the terminal how do
I copy everything here into the new
directory like I have already copied
everything so I think that you can just
move they get ignore file or copy let's
copy it actually is that CP yep exactly
and then you type the destination so
it's a current and better playlist too
and then the file name I don't I think
if you specify specify the directory it
will go into that directory so go up to
go up one directory and then I don't get
it it did or we don't know because you
are not listing the hidden files it got
it yes and let's just look at it so we
type cat get ignore to just see the
contents so what the cat is is a way of
just showing what is in a file quickly
and this looks sort of right yeah
because it says to ignore the node
modules
which is where all the megabytes were
yeah now github desktop application
there you go
there we are so what this shows us is
that all these files since the inception
of the repository or project yeah all
these files are new additions yeah and
we want to make a commit we want to add
this update to the repository
yes so initial commit it's the title of
that one yeah and copied everything from
the previous episode yeah
commit to master is that all right yeah
it is it is boom yeah magic okay it it
disturbs my soul so much that this
directory is called better playlist dot
2-2 all right it's okay and now I can
publish this branch so it will actually
upload everything here to get up and we
will see updates on the website yeah
let's try that so it uploads 18 fives so
it doesn't upload all the nod note
module no exactly like you know as you
saw there it uploaded like that and that
is a wooden tab uploaded 129 mega bytes
that fast and you also see here that we
have all the files but the node modules
directory is is not there
and again the node modules directory is
all the NPM packages so we just go here
into source and we just checked our app
J s directory and we see that here are
the examples from the previous video we
did the default style so everything is
up here on github and what is the nice
part is this part we can check the
commits yeah that this is the initial
commit I entered here and with a small
message and then it says how many files
I changed and everything here is visible
and when it's green and there's a plus
sign it means that is an added line and
then we can when we remove stuff it will
be red ish and has a minus on it
cool so it's on github now it is and you
will you can go here and see this
in if you follow the link in the
description yeah
alright get up there come / NP j /
better playlists and it when you upload
if go back to the desktop interface it's
sad
right there where it says fetch origin
it said publish branch before before you
said that one of the advantages of using
it is that people can work on their own
you can work in your in your office and
I can work in my office and then later
we merge these things together then when
you do that then you are working on
branches you are branching off the
repository with your specific changes
and later you merge these branches that
is what branches are in in this in this
project we are just going to use the
default branch which is called master
there is nothing special about the name
maths or it just happens to be the
default name you could hypothetically
call it anything knowing about branches
is not important to this project I'm
just mentioning it so that you don't get
distracted wondering what the hell is a
branch alright so we've done everything
that we wanted to do in this episode but
I feel that it might be a little bit
abstract can we so we just do one yeah
let's make a cleanup commit if you
remember we were working here with our
code and it was a bit of a mess and now
I have to switch to the correct
directory in here oh yeah because you
have created another or in the better
place to directly yes all right don't
say there's like there's a golden store
in it for you if you can figure out a
cleaner way of doing this on your own
without using without creating this
intermediate directory we told you it's
not gonna be it's gonna be dirty let's
say
yeah so I just I don't like this line
right here remove it yeah and what more
do we have I think the default text
color intermediate variable there is
completely unnecessary so let's let's
just remove that and just put it whoops
put it here in the object straight away
and remove this one and we should just
see if everything is still running oh we
have to reboot from the terminal that
you need to rest by reading at the old
version if you remember we had a tab
here or just just stop that control see
a couple of times and then we just go
down a director hello apply directly and
then into the latest two directory yes
and how did I run the reacts it's all
it's almost always NPM start NPM start
that's that's usually how you run a node
based servers so it's rebooting and it
should look the same
yep looks the same that's great and say
anything more hair that feels
unnecessary or important logo we don't
we are not using that we're not using it
I think we're using a bit of the app top
CSS yeah let's just check the CSS here
what happens if you just if you just
remove it completely let's see it says
fine yeah yeah exactly so I removed the
CSS file yeah fail to compile yeah
because it's called the CSS file and
then we're just commented out there it
looks sort of okay yeah but it's still
like we couldn't just remove it so you
know what now we have a deleted file ah
let's let's damn it yeah exactly
whoops we deleted a file that we didn't
think we needed but it seemed like we
needed how do we get it back this is
where version control comes in so let's
head to the github desktop
here it says and - it says that we
delete that this entire file and then
this line says these are the changes
that we removed these lines and added
this line instead and all that stuff so
right now we can just right click and
discard the changes which is discord the
deletion of the file precisely to do
that are you sure yes boom pop right
back up yes this is this is amazing
yeah this is very very nice this has
saved me an infinite amount of times I
would never even even for just a little
project like this where we just play
along we don't care about directors even
in these cases I would not even I would
not consider working without kids so
just like keep on Khan I will remove
this h1 CSS thing because I want to do
it in line here yeah
where is h1 boy station oh it's in the
main component style see if I remember
this is that it yep doctor like that
here exactly
and I would add only add its stand with
the font size which was 54 pixels
yeah but you don't you also need to
specify it oh yeah what it's expanding
folk style of course my dear react did
it that looks great that looks even more
like the sketch sweet and now we have
these changes in the CSS file we remove
stuff and then in the app J's file we
have all these changes and let's write a
nice message here for ourselves when we
come back later in time I want to figure
out why we did this changed
cleaned up stuff yeah haha that's very
descriptive but you like you have
comment like that comment there I don't
like that now this one yeah like you
commented it out we can use now we don't
need that file though
or is it you're still not pulling in
these CSS file
yeah I'm not I think it's like if you
look now just import it and see what
changes it will Center it I think yeah
it's some margins yeah right let's keep
let's keep it let's get all right
cleaned up stuff yeah I will commit it
oh yeah so oh yeah because that commit
was before I removed the the dashes here
precisely this this thing yeah these are
the worst ever commit messages yeah but
it's fine yeah so it should be noted
that we are showing you how to use skit
here we are not showing you this is not
the best practice in all contexts no but
it will give you the most important
points again again we will give you the
backup thing that we just showed you yet
we just were able to revert a very
specific file to the state that it was
before which was not deleted but we
could also have done that if we had just
messed up some part of it and reverted
it to the specific state that it was in
before and it will also give you the
ability of going back and forth in time
at a larger scale and it will also give
us the share ability and collaboration
aspects even if it's a little bit messy
developers in production will be a lot
more picky but for our purposes here our
high fidelity prototype this is just
fine so I will just push it
we can see here that now we have three
commits and we can look at the commit
history that first we did the initial
commit then we did the clean up stuff
and then it's like missed this thing
commit so if I now want to see what
happened here I can just click clean up
stuff and it will show me what I did in
these comments yeah it's really neat and
handy
so this pushing thing what is that the
pushing is that you upload from your
local computer to the remote server and
it keeps all the remote repositories
which is gift hub in this case exactly
so what what we have failed to mention
is here is that github is a service for
git yes so git is the version control
system there are several other
competitors to github but github is by
far the most most popular one and the
funky thing would get that makes it a
bit different from many earlier version
control systems like for instance
sourcesafe that Microsoft had back in
the day and subversion is that it's
decentralized so when you're like what
we did when we were cloning our
repository that actually clones the
entire repository which with its full
commit history everything that has ever
happened in that repository from the
beginning of time which has the nice
unintended benefit that you can work
completely offline and if the central
repository has evaporates any person
that has the repository checked out
can revert the repository to their point
in time which is which is pretty cool
but pushing basically means that I'm
pushing my changes up on to this branch
on this remote and github is our remote
in the next video we'll show you how to
deploy the actual app to the internet so
other people can use it no matter where
they are yeah
join us for that
will you be using hero to another
service that's pretty popular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
