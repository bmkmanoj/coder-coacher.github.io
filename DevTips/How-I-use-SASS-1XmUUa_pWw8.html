video of the year I'm really excited
about this new season of dev tips and I
just I can't contain myself you may have
noticed the new branding and the new
motion worth doing yeah you may have
noticed the new branding on the channel
that's real fun big shout-out to Hagrid
for helping me on the motion work so
I've been thinking long and hard about
what I wanted to share with you guys for
the first video of year and actually
right in the middle of making another
video about CSS positioning I'll finish
that and share it with you guys later on
but I had the idea and I had the
inspiration that I wanted to share with
you my kind of workflow of it came to me
that I wanted to share some fundamental
tips about my workflow and coding
environment now there's a million ways
to do this but I think in the coolest
route of the year like this so that you
guys don't be confused later on when I
start showing you tools and things that
I use you'll already know how I organize
my my stuff so to start things out today
I want to talk to you guys about sass
now I touched on it a little bit in the
last CSS preprocessor video when I
talked I discussed what this and things
like it are for but today I want to show
you guys how I use it in my everyday
work before you write any sass code you
need to have a way to process the code
that you write into CSS you can do that
in two main ways the first way is via
the command line now I do that sometimes
depending on the types of work that I'm
doing but for now I just want to show
you how to use a desktop application to
process your sass there's quite a few
applications like this but I use code
kit to process my sass I really like
code kit cokecake can do a lot of things
but let's look at how it can compile
sass into CSS this is my projects folder
notice it has a CSS folder so inside the
CSS folder I'm going to make a style dot
sass file then I open code kit and just
drop my project into it code key looks
in my project and finds all the sass
files I can select this sass file and
tell it where I'd like it to spit out
the compiled CSS right now it's pointing
to the CSS folder so that's fine for me
I'll just leave it where it is
I need to make sure that I link the CSS
file that code creates in my HTML head
that's it I'm ready to go code kit will
output a new CSS file every time I make
a change to my sass file and as an added
bonus code kit itself will refresh my
browser so I don't have to okay I'm
going to quickly create a tweet style
layout that we can use as an example
here it goes this my tweet layout
example we got tweets here in style
there
I already got my HTML that I rapped
earlier and I'm styling it up some sass
that's compiling to CSS look at these
tweets there so tweet tacular does a
cool the example is setup now let's jump
back into that sass file and I'll show
you what I've done and how its kind of
organized the way I like it and I can
show you some features of sass
I mentioned in that other video that I
prefer the indented flavor of sass I
like it a lot better I really don't
understand why the bracketed one is more
popular it blows my mind now this code
is nested you can see that I'm
referencing child elements here and they
output complete selectors in the
compiled CSS
nesting is a great way to keep in mind
relationships when you're writing
selectors and also it really helps to
cut down on repetition
okay here's another feature sass lets me
use variables to keep a few constant
things straight so in this example there
are two text colors black and this light
gray to make things easy I can throw
that gray into a variable up top and
then just call it whenever I want that
muted gray text style
it's really really handy to have all
those colors in variables so that when
you need them you don't need to puss
with all the hex codes
if I had to choose only one feature to
take with me on a desert island of sass
it would be imports for sure
you
sass builds on top of the current CSS
imports but instead of requiring an HTTP
request SAS will take the file that you
want to import and combine it with the
file you're importing it into so that
you have a single CSS file that you're
serving to the web browser now this is a
really small project that you can still
see how it works let's say I want to
isolate all of those variables that I
just made into their own document I can
create a new dot sass file called bars
and pop those variables in there and
save next I write import bars at the top
of the main style page now that VARs
sass file will be pulled into the style
document before it is compiled I start
doing this I usually make a file that is
a directory or an import file meaning
that its sole purpose is to collect the
various Sask documents and order them
into an output file if I wanted to do
that here I would move all the styles
into their own documents and then only
have imports here this acts as a table
of contents kind of thing and it makes
organizing larger projects much much
easier
you
in fact I often extend this idea and
further separate those files into sub
directories so I'll have one for like
base and modules and layouts and mobile
and this way it's really easy to find
what I'm looking for and you know get to
work on that stuff at work I have a
hundred and fourteen sass files that
compile down to one single CSS file
that's one HTTP request and that makes
me very happy now there's a lot more of
course but these three things will put
you on a pretty good path to using sass
in a meaningful way for more examples
and explanations of futures check out
Sasa's website at sass - lang comm slash
guide I'll put that link in the bottom
there ok great so that's a little bit
more about how I use sass and like the
environment that I code it in and maybe
there's a few other things I can talk
about along the way about the coding
environment that I use but I really
wanted to show you sass first because I
like I said I use that indented flavor
of sass and it might just kind of like
make your mind explode if you're not
aware of what I'm doing and now that
I've shown it to you I'm going to be
using it in every video from now on
because after I've been using sass for
so long I just I feel so clumsy with
regular old CSS so that's one big reason
for me to give this to you is the first
video of the year thanks for watching
you guys we did it
first video the year under our belts
just under it I don't know what they're
doing under the belts just under the
belts anyway we also sorted out right
before the end of the year we finished
one of the one of the best kind of
series that we made so far so check them
out we've got a html5 basics here you
can take a look at there's I think seven
or eight videos about just fundamentally
what is HTML - somebody who's never
heard of it before or used it before
then we got CSS basics which has only
just finished up seven videos and take
you to the fundamentals of understanding
conceptually what CSS is about
and linking a lot of core concepts
together and then and then even more
fundamentally than that I got how the
internet works down here which is only
three videos but it's kind of loopy I do
a lot of drawing and a lot of there's
some cupcakes in the so these are all
playlists and you should go and watch
all of the videos in those playlists so
that you can become an export and export
and expert a website maker and if you
have not yet of course you really need
to subscribe to this channel that's this
button down here below what do you guys
think about this like layout here that
I'm trying out it's called an N card I
don't know YouTube okay guys this is dev
tips new videos every Monday and often
sprinkle them in between throughout the
week and love you so much bye bye bye
