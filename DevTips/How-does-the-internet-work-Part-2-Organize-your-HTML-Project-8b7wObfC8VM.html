designers a channel on YouTube where we
talk about making websites and stuff my
name is Travis Nilson
last week we talked about this this is
how the internet works if you haven't
watched the video from last week go back
and do that now it's super good this is
us here in that corner we're a space
octopus that writes HTML and CSS and
puts it on servers for the internet to
be built I want to talk about how to
organize a project and connect all the
pieces to make a really awesome thing
okay so when I talk about project
organization I'm talking about where do
you put the files on your computer and
how do you organize the folders and
subfolders and stuff like that project
organization is a very big topic and one
thing to keep in mind is that there's no
one way to organize your project your
needs will change depending on how big
your team is the technologies you're
using and how complex your project is
but there are a few best practices and
common conventions that you should be
aware of so when I develop a project on
my local machine I need a place to
develop inside so I'm going to create a
folder right here on the desktop just
call that project folder and then I'm
going to drag this folder right onto my
code editor called espresso the first
thing I want to do when I open my code
editor is create a new file called
index.html in any directory the
index.html will be the first thing that
the browser reads so our home page would
always be called index.html not home dot
HTML so now that we have a root document
I want to put just a quick filler in
here I have a few significant html5 page
really easy and now that I have my index
set up I'm going to go and start
creating my folder architecture so a new
folder and I'm going to call this assets
inside of my assets I generally have
three folders one's going to be IMG for
my images another will be CSS for my
style sheets and then the last will be
j/s for my JavaScript and I create these
empty folders because I know I'm going
to need at least these three things and
as a part of my assets and I could put
more in there for example if I want to
have some custom fonts I would need a
place for them but not right now inside
of my CSS directory on put a style dot
CSS document this will be where I write
my Styles in and I want to go get an
image just want to pop that in the image
directory and there we go okay now that
we have a small project set up let's
look at the different type of links
we'll need to understand the first one
is a CSS link right here in the head
alright link rel style sheet right here
I want to find the path to my stylesheet
so I'm in the index.html I need to
access the assets and then the CSS
folder
and then the style dot CSS now this
style sheet should be linked up to our
HTML project let's take a look and I
call my body and say all the background
to be pink hey look at that that works
the path that I took to find the CSS is
a relative path as we can see we're
starting at assets index and assets are
on the same level
if I open assets and then CSS I can find
style sheet so assets CSS style sheet
each one of these lines here represents
a folder this style of linking is called
a relative link now I want to load my
JavaScript
let's see made a function CAS file and
in my index I want to go here just above
the body and write script a script tag
is the way that you would start a
JavaScript call now you can you can
begin writing JavaScript right here
inside of the script tag or you can just
fill in the source attribute with the
path to your script in this case again
assets J s functions J s that's where my
that's where I'm keeping my functions I
want to make another script tag because
I want to load in jQuery jQuery
themselves host a copy of jQuery on
their website it's fast and easy to use
so I'm just going to use that now notice
that the path that I'm using starts with
HTTP we talked in our last episode about
how that's a hypertext Transfer Protocol
statement and what comes next is a
universal resource locator or a URL of
this of the source of the document now
when you do this and you're not doing a
relative path like the other two
documents we've linked this is called an
absolute path it means we're using code
from another website entirely we can do
this with images and we can do this here
with jQuery let's see if it works
just going to write a little function
here to turn the body and turn the body
background color another another color
let's make it green that work oh it did
so now we know that our JavaScript is
working although I much prefer the pink
background one last thing I want to talk
to you about using paths is instead of
having this pink back actually that was
fantastic but I'm definitely turning
that off I'm going to comment that out
in terms of using path names there's one
more thing I want to talk about in order
to traverse the path it's important to
know how to go backward and forward
across them so we want to use a URL for
this image to it that is in our images
folder here so we have to back out of
our CSS directory then go into the
images directory and a link out that
specific image
and because if we tried to hit up oops
if we tried to go straight to that image
directory as we might have will notice
that the images didn't show up we need
to go close out of CSS go back one level
find the sibling images directory open
it up and get that cat document now this
is an award-winning design I especially
love the lasers coming out of the cat's
eyes when we go backwards and forth
through folders and subfolders like that
it's called path traversal it's
important to keep that in mind if they
can get complicated if we don't watch
yourselves yep yep yep that's how you
organize a project now you know I'm
including a link to a github repo down
below I use this as a starter project to
prototype smaller things for larger
projects I used to use WordPress but now
I use Jekyll it's a really awesome CMS
but it's really also very descriptive
about how you set up your project I'm
not going to talk about Jekyll right now
and I will in the future to look forward
to that it's really fun that's all I
have for you today but thanks for
sticking with me if you have any
questions or have a topic in mind you
want me to cover leave it in the
comments down below please share this
video with a friend it would mean a lot
to me and if you haven't yet please
