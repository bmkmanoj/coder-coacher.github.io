series I call design and code my
personal website in 12 hours
yesterday in our 7.1 we began working on
the mentoring section now today in our
7.2 we're gonna return to the axe
section and use JavaScript to make the
testimonial section interactive so let's
stop talking and start doing so I'm
gonna open my functions file and here is
basically the functions that we used for
the YouTube video scrolling this
parallaxing move right here that's kind
of all we've done so far we don't refer
so how about we jump on up here and get
this ready function ready and I'll make
a new function and call it in the ready
and I'll call it mmm I call it mentoring
now say bubble click alright
I want my function to be about when I
click this mentoring bubble this is
gonna happen so let's check take that
name and name funk funky on functional
the function that and then some curly
braces okay now inside of this function
mentoring bubble click that's what we're
gonna have all the code that you know
does stuff when we actually click the
bubble the first thing I knew we're
gonna identify what we want to be
clicking on and that's gonna be dot face
and face uh remember we used to
right-click here a lot click is good and
but when I did the last video about the
modal somebody left a really really good
comment and I can't remember who I'm
sorry forgot your name but like we
explain the difference between click and
on and basically click ties a event to
all of them
we're on will fire only wind that thing
happens or something like that I forget
the details but basically on is a little
bit more efficient so you'll right on
and then in perennial say
click and you can also tie other events
to on as well like hover or focus or you
know mouse over you know all kinds of
things can happen to on but that's
besides the point so on click what are
we gonna do what's gonna happen I have
another function of course and then this
function will have all the stuff that
happens when that face gets clicked on
oh let's take it take it back here and
grab that has bubble open and remove the
hover okay so we want we don't want it
to be about hovers we want it to be
about having this class because they
want the bubble to stay open it's not
just a hover thing so if the thing has
this class then we'll stay up so here's
what we're gonna do if you click on a
face let's say this this face we want to
add a class of that has bubble open all
right and then we'll say siblings so
select select all of the siblings of
this thing and then remove the class of
has bubble open done all right let's
check our JavaScript didn't work it
didn't work why didn't your work no
there's no need to dot right here jQuery
JavaScript all right now try it there we
go we're moving moving moving along now
I want to have the pointer on these
things because right now if these are
not links and so it doesn't have the
finger it has the default cursor so
we'll go into here two-phase and say
cursor pointing all winter now it'll
have a yeah and now it'll be classy with
a little cartoon finger that's what
want cool already this is looking good
you click on it and bubbles up and it
will stay so you can like read it and be
like oh that's interesting show me the
next one oh that's interesting show me
the next one but the problem is that it
goes away right like it goes up under
here what do I want to do how about we
move ok ok ok so all these little
circles these little faces will be like
a sliding and you click one and it's not
positioned right it'll slide to where it
needs to be and then pop out we've got a
solution how about that let's make that
happen in these functions so how is that
gonna work what I do oftentimes want to
have some JavaScript that I need to like
think out like think out loud let me
clear this up here they clean up my Jas
for you guys and put some spaces in
between these alright that looks good
nope you do all right what I need to
think about my JavaScript out loud I
often just like write the steps the
logical steps I don't want the
JavaScript to go through and I write
them all out in the comments that's
about in comments so let me show you
comments comment is when I click a face
when I click a phase part of my spelling
click when I click a face I need to get
the distance of the face from the top of
the parent right so get the distance of
the face from its parent okay parent and
then I need to mmm move everything move
the whole container up
move it all up the perfect distance to
where it will be like here to here right
so shift it all up so it's like 80
pixels for the avatar and 35 below it
for the margin so we want to shift it by
I could find like an amount of like 115
35 yeah 115 so we want to move it up
let's say like 115 pixels
plus the count of however many it needs
to move right or whatever the math is
going to be at that point Betty
basically it's like that perfect
distance we want it once we get the
distance we've to move it the perfect
distance to where it needs to be and
then we want to it you know after we
move it I want to add that class the is
open class to the face so that it like
pops the balloon pop the balloon right I
and then and then we should be fine okay
these are the four steps that I need
okay so let's think about this okay we
already have a click method up here so
we can just tag along right there when
we click this face we're gonna have to
get a few bits of information from it
the first one I'll store these in a
variable so the first one will be a face
top like basically you know the distance
of the face to its parent right so
equals this basically dot position this
is a jQuery thing position top and
position talk will give you the distance
from the element that we're focusing on
which in this case is the face that you
clicked on through the top of its parent
we're offset top will give you the
position of that thing from the top of
the window or rather the top of the
document not
we know the top of the document so a
position top is what we want not offset
doc top now we want to do some math like
how far or how can we move this thing
right so let's take that face top which
is the position weight
let's say you're just the vertical math
that's what the app that's with this the
name of this variable is called vert
math so is the math face top you know -
what do we say it was 135 let's run a
console log I'll say vert math so that
we can check and see if it's giving us
what we want all right so we went click
here you want to know
mmm he's that's not right it's getting
the position of the top of the document
but I want the top of its parent faces
okay if I go position:relative let's see
if that has an outcome here because it
might I have a hunch I could look at the
documentation butters gonna make things
up okay okay so here's what's going on I
had to put I had to put a declared
position on faces so that it would be
relative to that parent it's kind of
like absolute positioning right okay so
in functions
there's vert math so we want the golden
number to be not 135 because that's just
one length of these things we want to
actually be the third one the third one
is the is the key right there so
let's make it 135 times 2 which is 230 I
think 2 3 let's try that 0 ok so if I
click the the golden one which is the
3rd one click it gives me a 0 in the
console.log because it doesn't need to
move it off make this console.log the
bigger right there okay and then we have
115 that means it needs to move negative
115 down to 30 Oh a 1 15 to 30 fantastic
so this is the math but I'm noticing
let's see okay now we have to take that
vertical math and according to our map
down here move the whole container up
the count right you know I'm gonna cash
the this variable like this and this is
gonna make the rest of these things a
little bit easier to a little bit more
like you know or is it less JavaScript
II intense hmm
so if I just keep it like that that
means I want to call it like this later
on and it's less less work for
JavaScript to get this okay because it's
already cached into a variable so this
this this we want to say is this and
then find its parent which should be
face is right so we click on a face and
it's a list item all of the list items
are children of the the unordered list
of face parent is what we just selected
now and we'll say move you write CSS the
top this thing pixels so top + vert math
okay so we're taking this number right
down here it's 2:30
and we're saying vert math + pixels so
we want to like
catenate that string right so it'll be
negative 230 pixels let's see what let's
see what we got going on all right
a weird I think it's kind of working
when we put a transition on it on faces
so we can see it slide okay wait that's
not right if I click the second one it
should move up but I'm getting the
second one from the bottom please
this is my surprised face
so if I click the top one I should get
get pushed down 230 pixels well I'm
getting negative 230 pixels so I've got
like the inverted integer of what I'm
looking for so I'll have to use more
math numbers math numbers well if you
use more math to to like kind of invert
it right so it's not too hard here's how
we do that we take the number what we
have right here this face top minus 230
and we put that in a / in so it gets
done on its own we still want that
number to be a little package of its own
and we'll say this is how you invert the
number it just using arithmetic negative
1 times whatever right and now it'll
basically if it was negative 2 30 or so
up is 230 now all right let's do this
I like it let's take off the pink
because that's just silly
and save I want to move it I don't want
a cubic Bezier I'll just say ease in now
and then I want to move it a little bit
lower like three there we go
a little more classy oh man I really
really like this I'm just clicking it I
was clicking clicking clicking it holds
it in it dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan
dan dan it demanded that Denton in the
next itty-bitty beauty do-do-do-do-do
all right what else am I seeing here I
did notice one thing let me refresh it
and watch this watch this beep a really
really close attention it's in the third
one and it's in the third one because I
told it to be in the third one with this
right I'm cheating but nevertheless it's
in the third one and I want it to go
into the second one
watch what happens all right I click in
word of my transition go it's gone but
now I click again and I have a
transition why is that
I'll tell you why gangsta I'll tell you
why it's because I never because right
here in there this line we're setting
the top all right I've never set that
before so I need to go into there and
set it by default faces
position:relative top ROP CIL's now it
has something to visit to transition
from it wasn't transitioning it was just
slapping a an attribute on their a style
on their so let's refresh and now you
should see a transition from the
beginning yeah the first one will
transition that's what we want
awesome ok now I'm gonna take a second
to add content into this you don't have
to watch me but what I'm gonna do
basically actually you should watch this
watch this watch watch are you watching
watch what I'm gonna do is go in here to
my mix in I'm gonna add some attributes
to mix and or variables or I don't know
what they're called anyway
what imma say is the three things that I
need to make these testimonials work are
I need a face I need a testimonial and I
need a name right so these are the three
things so let's say the face comma words
is what we'll call the next one and then
a name right so the face is obviously
right here in this in this background
image right here and this is why this is
why I included it into the markup
because it wouldn't work with the style
I would have to style each one
individually if that were just been too
much working too silly but hmm we can
use um what is this thing called what do
you called Jade we can use Jade to kind
of create a template and these templates
are gonna you know work really well in
just a millimeter I mean so the first
thing is the face I'll say face face
that's how we get the face the second
one is this words right so bam-bam-bam
words and the last one is the name so
this now it's template
templatized now where do we put the
content in well on each one of these
things so you put a parentheses after
the the call of the mixin and then for
each of these variables in the mix in
I'll put a rotation there and then you
put a comma
rotation at comma quotation so there's
three of them and they correlate the
order which you define them up above is
the order which that are used to hear so
the phase I actually have in my
clipboard this is the face
it's a Twitter image the testimonial
itself is going to go in this next
section and I'll paste that in and then
the name is el Jay Bennett so save and I
should actually only have four here
because I removed one but it should have
a face all right L Ben it's gonna be
face these the ones where imma face
having to find them yet if I click on
there the empty bubble should show up
and then let's click on l l dot dot J
Bennett's right that's his testimonial
that's it see I can't click on it
because the pointer events removed but
that's his testimonial that's his name
and that is his beautiful face look at
them looks kind of sleepy or something
it's cute I love it so I'm gonna do that
for the rest of these I think I want to
have four more I want five in total
okay I did six actually let's save it
and see how it shows up in our layout
mm-hmm okay nobody is gonna get the
bubble nobody gets the bubble by default
because remember I took the that class
it was like you know embedded in the in
the markup but I took that class off of
the one so I could use these mix-ins so
nobody gets the bubble nobody gets the
bow by default you can click the middle
one and everybody gets the like
everybody's works but you have to click
one to get it started off and that's no
good no good we don't want that so what
we do want is to have the bubble there
by default so let's go back to our
functions and you know what I want to do
I need to have a way to launch that
bubble so what we'll do is we'll add a
function that just adds that class of
you know it has bubble open onto the
face by default as the first option
right so that will be that will be in
here give it a little bit of console.log
parent this oh this is on the click so I
want it I want to be not in the click so
this is the click right here when I go
under the click let's get rid of this
these notes here go into the click and
say you know what just just these right
here let's take a look at these faces
take a look at the face and then just
filter it for the third one and then in
jQuery you can do things like like
basically very very very much CSS
selector ring like ant child 3 so we'll
find the face and then narrow that
selection although that object down to
the third one and what to say do just
add a class on to that
we'll add the class what has open Bowl
but okay yeah now when our page reloads
again it should not need to click for
that trying to figure out why this
didn't work see we have any errors these
are just Chrome extensions or not my
Java scripts huh
should have grabbed the third one let's
run this in the console and see we get
has it did it did run that JavaScript is
that the wrong class face has bubble
open Oh what i doing has bubble open
alright now when this page refreshes
it's gonna have an open mobile boom see
look at that
boom thank you so we're starting with
the third one which is the exact one I
want so I want it to look good I want to
have a bubble open great you know what
would be interesting is we have this
scroll function over here giving us this
parallax over here what if we you know
didn't show these faces at all and then
when we got to a certain scroll point
you know it would pop these faces into
view put the faces into view that would
be pretty fun and we have a scrolling
hook right here window scroll you know
what I mean so how do I do this in
addition to youtube vid scroll we say
start mmm start mentoring this is like
you know when you when you when the
mentoring section starts just throw this
function in there and then
YouTube vid scroll will do it right here
function alright so let's open some
curly braces there and let's start
talking about this function so we have
this function is gonna fire on scrolling
events so let's say that as we're
watching the scroll if the if something
happens and that something is that this
section dot mentoring not dot section so
if a section mentoring now we talked
about the difference between position
and offset when we're looking at off six
we're talking about the document offset
from the top is greater than no is less
then W scroll W scroll like this guy
right here right if it's less than that
then do this which is going to be what
do we want to do like pop it up we want
to make something happen
so let's say for that for the let's see
for the faces dot faces
that's the UL that's that's we have
moving around we'll add a class of like
something like launch because we want to
launch the faces right and adding a
class of launched so let's go to let's
just save that and then go to our CSS
and where's the faces faces faces let's
make that top start at cuz you know and
push it down push it down
I don't know like 800 pixels something
and then and class launch is zero pixels
top zero pixels is this right all right
so let's scroll down here and refresh
and there's no down here there's no
faces we're going to scroll until our
window hits the top there we go
launched now you're launched refresh
launched okay taking too long so what
we'll do is we want to pop that pop that
launch to class earlier on the top so
let's say the top - like five hundred
pixels from the top alright so there
nothing and then there they are that's
good right that's good but let's take
that with that one what makes you know
the third one have the the this one the
face and three but we'll open we want to
add that after it gets launched in fact
when I add it a little bit after it gets
launched so here's the launched and then
let's let's launch it and then wait a
little bit so we'll do a set time out
and function
and then we put that function inside
there so it'll be a set time out when
how long do we want it to wait after
that happens let's just say something
like 300 milliseconds so it'll scoot up
let's say 400 milliseconds so we'll
scoot up and then pop the bubble the
balloon see the balloon doesn't just
come already you see that do you see
that
so the faces will scoot in in lung when
they after they land the balloon will
pop yeah that's better
I'm loving this what do you guys think
about this fantastic right yeah I'm
really happy with the look and feel of
this section and tomorrow in our
seven-point-three we're gonna make this
look good on mobile devices until then
take care and keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
