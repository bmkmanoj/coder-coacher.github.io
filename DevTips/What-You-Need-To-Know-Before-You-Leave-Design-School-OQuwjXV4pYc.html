doing good thanks for coming Thank You
Preston for inviting me to be here just
quick show of hands how many of you guys
watch YouTube at all a little bit are
you keep them up how many of you guys
use online video or YouTube to
supplement your education okay that's
actually a lot more than I was expecting
this is good this is my generation here
how many of you guys this is just morbid
curiosity how many of you seen any
videos that I've made that is more than
I thought this is awesome there's one in
the bacterial cool okay so just a little
bit about me this is exciting you guys
have seen something my name is Travis
Nielsen I am a designer I've been in the
industry for about 10 years or so first
started in advertising and I did a lot
of art direction and creative directing
and then moved over to Silicon Valley
here and I do a product design for
startups I've been doing that for about
five years and most recent startup that
I was at is called tubular labs and
their job there was to kind of do
analytics and like reporting on online
video and that's kind of how I found out
about YouTube and about this idea of
like teaching on YouTube which is like
totally like a new thing when I figured
it out as it was so and I met all these
people who are doing it I like I want to
go to there so can you press the up
press the button this is easy I'll just
press the buttons so iíve made a few
videos I made about two hundred and
thirty videos on my youtube channel and
I've gotten over two and a half million
views just recently which is very
exciting for me but soon it's what's
next oh what I want to talk to you about
is not about YouTube or anything I was
just curious about where the connection
is there but what I want to talk to you
guys about is about your educational
experience right now and moreover what
you need to know coming out of it so
tonight I wanna say what you need to
know before you leave design school and
as I said these these principles that I
want to talk to you about I've been
doing this for about ten years and these
are all
kind of come out of my failures and my
heart breaks and so if I could like
imagine like you know I have two kids I
have a son and a daughter if I could
just like if they were graduating design
school every like this is what you need
to know this is what I'm trying to give
to you so the I'm just going to go
through I've got 13 principals or 14
maybe
the first one is aggressive
self-improvement is the only means of
survival basically we are in actually
raise your hands if you're going to be
doing print design if that's what you're
studying and raise your hand if you're
going to be doing like digital or
product or UI design okay so both right
I mean I did print for five years and
digital for five years
it is the interesting thing moving over
into digital and especially we know that
here in Silicon Valley we work with tech
a lot right the tech industry is the
fastest industry in the world it changes
in the blink of an eye and as designers
our job is is to represent it give it a
face and give it a soul and if we stop
and pause for just a moment if we stop
to try to catch your breath we're gonna
be like basically obsolete so it's it's
becoming of us to adopt a posture of
aggressive self-improvement because the
moment we stop the moment we're dead in
the water so aggressive self-improvement
and related to that kind of how we
achieve aggressive self-improvement is
that the idea that smart people teach
themselves you guys are in a really
interesting moment in of your lives
right now where you're going to school
and you have built-in peers and built-in
educators and you they give you
assignments and they you talk about them
afterwards and you give peer critiques
and it's just like this really wonderful
environment of learning but when you're
done here nobody gives a crap about you
nobody cares about your improvement
nobody cares about your progression and
you will find out that smart people are
the people who teach themselves you may
have heard like you go to school to
learn how to learn right
I don't know if that's that even makes
sense because I don't think that the
idea is to learn how to learn at all the
idea is to learn how to be resourceful
enough to teach yourself teaching
yourself being that kind of person who
is able to take what's available to them
and turn it into something like a
creative output those are the people who
in this slide they're the smart people
right smart people teach themselves
here's one valuable creators understand
the entire production path what I mean
by production path is if you consider
any type of crater maybe like it's a
furniture designer furniture designer is
in charge of how it looks and how you
approach it the form and feel of it but
also more than that right they're in
charge of the materials and even the
cost they're in charge of the the
vendors and their timeliness is this
vendor always late or they on time where
are they coming from they're in charge
of the the building process the assembly
process and and they should also have
touch points with like packaging and
delivery everything about the design
experience happens at the end and so we
as designers we're not creating
beautiful pictures we're creating the
end we're creating what the users use
and so we have to be aware of the entire
production path and a similar to print
design right we got to understand
pre-press they have to understand the
print process finishing packaging
delivery we just don't make pretty
pictures we make the whole experience
and you touch in print you touch and you
hold the experience right same with web
understanding I'm not saying you have to
designer you know all designers should
code or anything of that but I'm saying
is you have to understand the platform
that you're using and that you're
designing for so for example I'm doing a
product design the UI design and I
should understand and the the developers
and what they're working with what are
the what are the advantages and the
limitations of the platform and the
technology stack that we're using so
number three is valuable creators and
these are valuable to your employer to
your clients to be a valuable creator
to understand the entire production path
and related to that because the entire
production path is not just you it
involves a lot of collaboration good
collaboration is critical to good work
you can't have exceptional work without
exceptional collaboration and this
involves empathy because I mean really
you understand what empathy is it's
simply understanding what motivates
people so when you're working like for
example if I'm working with a developer
at work I've worked with quite a few in
art and I come to realize that different
things motivate different people right
so maybe somebody is motivated by
accolades maybe they're like Awards
maybe like praise maybe they're like
money or just solving hard problems and
that's what gets them going
understanding what motivates your
collaborators enables you to have
language to communicate with them and
have a successful collaboration and
produce good work so good collaboration
is critical to good work let's switch
gears a little bit talk about everything
that's influencing you guys right now
the trends that you see the things that
are popular run dribble or you know the
design blogs that you see those things
will change so I've been doing this
around a decade and what was cool when I
started is like so not cool right now if
I show you my early work and it was cool
back then and trust me you'd be like
dude why am I even listening to this guy
doesn't know Diaz talking about but the
truth is it would these were trends
these are these are trendy things right
trends are a critical part of our
industry we have to know what's on
what's hot and you kind of predict those
things and work with them but they will
always change trends will always change
and also the tools right are using
sketcher or Photoshop right tools and
trends change but principles don't they
never change
so high-level principles like
communication like organization
usability things like that they don't
change even even a little bit lower
lower order principles like hierarchy
space rhythm color these these
fundamental principles don't change ever
so if you want to spend your time
learning the most valuable things do not
leave this institution without
understanding a firm grasp of the
principles the fundamental principles
cuz they don't change trends will leave
you behind okay who here likes criticism
I like that your hand just shot right up
who likes criticism criticism is always
helpful even if it's painful even the
most even the most toxic and aggressive
and just nasty criticism is helpful to
you because this all comes from
somewhere I remember when I remember
when I was a my first kind of job at a
design agency and my manager took me
into the design review meeting for this
the first work that I ever made right
it's my little little babies and like my
little baby birds and it's gonna let him
fly and I walked into the meeting Green
is all can be and my manager says to the
client this is Travis he is the designer
tell him what's wrong and don't worry
about hurting his feelings because he's
a professional and I was like I yeah I'm
a professional that's me
professional that you can't hurt my
feelings and it was interesting that was
one of most important lessons that he
ever taught me and he just forced it on
me just like that in it in this like
really awkward social situation you
can't hurt my feelings because I'm a
professional my personal values do not
rest on your opinion of my work
criticism even if it hurts even if you
go home and cry I've done that a few
times it's not a joke I'm cried real
tears of pain you know and I'm talking
about it doesn't change anything it's
still helpful it will make you better
after after the healing happens all
right good work is not enough good work
alone is not enough
it requires an advocate an advocate
gives context to the work we can't
expect to put something out in front of
a claim
or the user and expect them to
understand everything needs content
context everything that you learn right
now everything you have learned is built
upon things that you've learned
previously so you need to learn how to
sell your work I would recommend
spending some time in take a sit job in
sales
door-to-door phone sales like work on a
sales floor if you can't the idea of
being able to speak clearly and
concisely in inform and educate somebody
it will take you so far in in the design
world because a lot of what we do is not
just creating something and in the
corner but after that we have to help
people understand why it's the solution
that they are looking for we have to do
a lot of advocating and I'm sure you
guys have seen that in your courses but
it's it's such a true principle good
work alone is just not enough I can't
tell you how many great ideas and even
great executions are on the on the
cutting room floor because somebody
didn't know how to sell it
it needs advocating all right uh here's
a fun one just talking dollars and cents
you guys are in a great spot probably
one of the most exciting spots that I
mean just amazing right creative work is
valuable it's very valuable and learning
in the last time we talked about
advocating learning how to talk about
your creations about your design your
work means that you learn how to talk
about your value when you can talk about
your value you can sell that value to
the client or to the to the employer
creative work is valuable there's going
to be a point where you're going to
learn how to not sell your hours there's
going to be a time when you can learn
how to not sell your project but sell
your value and the value that you bring
to your client that's going to be the
the the greatest expression of your
value and it's also going to give you
the biggest payday creative work is
valuable and you have to sell the
implications to the client for more
information about selling value there's
a there's a lot of information about
value-based pricing
and a good google on that okay I need to
read this one all the time because I
always get caught up in being good
enough being the best or being right but
I need to remind myself that you don't
need to be great right now because your
career is not a race it's a journey and
the fact is you don't know what it's
gonna it what the journey is you don't
know what the what the destinations are
with this stops along the way are gonna
be you don't know what troubles are
gonna have along the way or successes
you don't need to be the the ultimate
expression of yourself right now you
don't need to be great right now you
just need to be content with the journey
speaking of journeys a lot of times
especially in our creative lifestyle we
come along this moment where we have the
blank page right you guys know that that
fear the blank page there's this
resistance that comes to you it comes to
me all the time and I have this fear of
starting because I don't know how it's
going to end up I don't have a perfect
vision of if it's gonna if this attempt
is going to be a success or a failure
but the truth is you can't improve
anything if you don't start realizing
that design and creativity is an
incremental process it requires a start
somewhere and you cannot improve
anything unless you start in the
beginning so getting over the fear of
the blank page is critical to having any
success any type of success you can't
improve what you never start this one's
interesting because we're as designers
we have a lot of good taste right that's
why we're here in the first place we
understand what we like and we see it
everywhere - everywhere we go whether
it's the movie poster of the movie we
just watched whether it's you know the
the new thing the portfolio that you saw
or the news article or whatever that
these are the influencers whatever we
see a lot of things that influence us
and that drive us to be better and to
make cool things but understanding that
the people that you guys admire the
people that I admire that that put
things out in the world that we just
love and think Oh
so I could be like that I wish I could
do that they're only showing you 20% of
their work
that's a hard truth to understand
because you think that oh they just wake
up in the morning and do that but the
truth is 80% of anybody's work is just a
failure it's just utter garbage and
understanding and appreciating how much
failure goes into 20% of success would
give you that strength to keep going to
to just start right as the last slide
was saying so understanding creators
that show you oh sorry
creatives that you admire share 20% or
less of their work is their principle I
would I would tell my little baby son
alright a goal is different than a
purpose so a goal is something that you
can write down you can put it in a list
you can tick it off you can scratch it
off when you're done maybe your goal is
about a position or a title maybe a goal
is about money
maybe goal is about I want to live
somewhere or do something and those
things can be achieved but a purpose can
never be achieved that's the difference
a purpose is what drives your goals a
purpose will be the thing that in the
end is is sustaining you and keeping you
going and it will and will take you to
the next level it will take you from
goal to goal but a purpose is behind it
all the good work happens when the work
is hard the interesting thing about good
work is that not just anybody can do it
because if anybody could just do it then
it would be easy and everybody would do
it but what sets you aside what sets you
apart from your peers and from all the
people that fail is that you know that
good work happens when the work is hard
and so that's when you dig your heels in
and you have that resistance and you
feel like you can't finish it or the
time is gonna run out or there's
inspiration the fire is not there
sometimes when I get inspired by a new
idea I'm like sketching out things I'm
writing notes in my thing thing and I'm
like I got all these ideas flying around
and then you know those those those
exciting days turn into like exciting
nights and then those nights turn into
weekend
and those weekends turn into months and
soon enough like that that fire that
initially lit me to get going is really
diminished and it's hard to finish and
that was that that's that 20% that I was
telling you about earlier but good work
happens when the work is hard when that
work is hard and that's when you finish
it that's when the work is worthwhile
that that 20% I can't say enough about
it
so many people just don't do it they're
getting so close and they can't put it
past that 20% good work happens when the
work is hard the last 20% is the part
that 80% of the people never complete
this is what makes you different because
you realize that you can put yourself
past that 80% pass where the work gets
hard and then and then this this phrase
here I adopted on my on my youtube
channel like I try to end every video by
saying this keep on hacking and I teach
code on my youtube channel but this is
not a code based principle the idea of
hacking is the the ethnos of taking
whatever is available to you and making
it work if you have a problem you solve
it you're resourceful you do whatever is
necessary to solve the problem to to win
the day to win the project keep on
hacking the people who keep on hacking
never give up they never stop and ever
quit and they're the one they're the
ones who are successful in the end
the fact that you're here on a Monday
night so close to the end of your lose a
quarter or semester semester shows that
you guys are the type of people who keep
on hacking you don't need to be here
your gray does not requisite on you
being here but you are because you're
passionate about winning they're
passionate about being the people who
succeed in the end that's all have to
share with you thank you so much for
being here if you inspire me right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
