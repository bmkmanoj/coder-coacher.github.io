Travis and we have an awesome show today
ah today we have a one-on-one it's more
of a it's more of a one versus one or
like a dev tips bake-off so here's
what's gonna happen
I designed a fun little splash page with
a modal and I gave that design to Andrew
who filmed himself coding it all up and
I coded it up myself and we're gonna
watch those two videos right now at
about 30 X speed or gonna speed it up
real fast and then we'll discuss a few
things so we'll focus on what we did the
same we'll look at what we did
differently and then we'll make a few
recommendations and talk about what
we've learned but first let's meet
Andrew alright everyone say hello to
Andrew marks Andrew hi how are you doing
today pretty good how are you I'm doing
really good it's really early in the
morning what is it 3 o'clock in the
morning for us it is 3 o'clock in the
morning yes so you just as a side note
you also are a polyphasic sleep er I am
yeah and you total is is it four hours a
day it's two hours very nice do you
sleep two hours a day that's so insane
okay so I'm doing it for and I'm like
I'm not worthy so so how long have you
been doing web development I'm about
four years at this point mm-hmm but you
currently are not doing webs
professionally webs you're doing you're
doing app development is that right I am
I am I've spent about the last year and
a half so I've known you for just a
little bit now and in fact them the I
met you because you're a patron of dev
tips I am yeah well everybody who's
watching this and all the other patrons
were really excited to have you and so I
appreciate that now what we're going to
do in today is we're gonna be looking at
the work that we did together and this
is an interesting relationship that you
and I have we've shared I was looking
earlier today we have shared about 50
emails so far going back and forth day
and setting up yeah that's it that's all
and setting up this this project and
planning it out like what do you think
is a good idea should we do this how
we're gonna handle this thing and and so
I've made this design and shared it with
you and we've we've both taken
you know recorded our efforts in
building it separately and so what we're
gonna do right now is we're gonna cut to
both of us kind of like a I'm gonna
speed it up really fast and we're gonna
show both of them at the same time and
then after that we're gonna come back
and talk about what we did the same
overall and what kind of tactics we did
differently and then maybe like make
some recommendations for the for the
folks at home watching and also by the
way for you everyone watching this you
can get both of these videos in their
full length kind of original speed on
the channel as well so there's there's
about like three hours of content for
you today on dev tips so it's really
exciting day for us and it's all thanks
to Andrew so without further ado let's
do the cut
cool that was fun welcome back so Andrew
let's talk about what we did the same
and what we did differently let's start
with the same did you like what what
what feeling did you get like when I was
watching years I kind of like it was a
little bit of deja vu for example I
noticed that you know we would use like
the exact same variables and that we
both like we both have a hard time
naming things that was those were two
things that I picked up on anything else
that you picked up on that we did like
the exact same that was kind of fun and
surprising it's fine specific things
like the background we both you know
made it full-sized with like the cover
property mm-hmm that's a favorite of
them and then the first time I actually
put it together cuz I actually put this
together twice the first time I did it I
built it basically entirely using
flexbox which is what you did this time
yeah I thought that was kind of
interesting so I didn't do that what
exactly is a second - I don't know it's
just what I was it's interesting that
you've done it differently the second
time because you think like it's a it's
a dry run so I'll do it this ain't like
you know like practice or whatever
that's interesting I noticed that we use
the same you know this the same fade in
effect for the modal I didn't like we
did in my design I didn't prescribe any
like animation or anything I was just
like here's what the motor looks like
here's what the splash looks like and we
both end up doing like a fade in and
slide down at the same time I was
interesting we both for like the the
popover effect we both used like pointer
events and like opacity mm-hmm and
display properties to like make it pop
it instead of like moving it from off
screen to on screen or something like
all right yeah that's another technique
that's cool I liked it I liked the
opacity it's easier to like understand
where it's at you know I don't know it's
just my thing now we're gonna go into
the part that I think is like probably
the most interesting is what did we do
differently and kind of why and and
after we discussed this we can make you
know like some maybe we would make some
recommendations or just kind of
admit that there's a million ways to do
anything but so let's talk about some
points we did differently what did you
notice so one of the things that we did
differently is I didn't include the
hover of a call to action transition
because when I was looking at your
Photoshop document I didn't actually
have any clue what that extra layer of
the sport I didn't know you wanted that
to be like a fade in and because we
hadn't like spoken about it yeah I
didn't know what that was supposed to be
for so I just assumed you were trying
out different different layouts or so
that your assumption was correct
actually I was trying out different
different color patterns yeah oh yeah
yeah yeah that's what I thought you and
then when I did the hover I was just
like well I don't know and in fact I
forgot that I had tried that reverse oh
that's interesting
what did you notice we did oh um well
one thing I didn't know I'd noticed
which is a big deal is that you used s
CSS and I'm a sass guy so we got that
going huh yeah that going on that
interplay there our tools were
completely do internet explorer and
visual studio right on windows mm-hmm
Adam mm-hmm and you also used em along
with and I use J I did because I
everything we're not peas in a pod so
it's cool they like you know development
a developer environment aside like you
can get you know it's a very similar
yeah and it's all down to what you're
comfortable with like I like the fact
that even though like you're a patron of
dev tips and you watched up tips and
like like we have this you know thing
going on you know you're not taking what
I say for gospel so when I'm making a
video and I'm using Jade you're using
whatever the heck you feel like to make
you know to make it work for yourself
and I think that's really cool other
things I noticed were oh so you used
very specific dimensions for all of your
things where mine was actually like like
like like I put bounding like me this
will be max width I don't want it to go
any wider than this but generally like
that kind of that kind of thing that's
one of the things that I probably
wouldn't have done
if I was thinking about like taking that
project and taking it all the way to the
solution because I would have you know
had to think about making it responsive
which is something I definitely didn't
do and that's something you did do oh
yes that's right my mind if your browser
is less than six hundred pixels wide it
just doesn't work which isn't great and
I would have done some things different
yeah I think that's probably why mine's
longer not yeah yeah it just takes more
time um one thing that I really liked
what you did in your in your JavaScript
is that you used specific functions for
the results of your of your clicks so
like you would say on click and then you
would have a function right there and
then you would abstract that function
later because you also did if you click
on the X to close for example but also
if you click anywhere that's not the
modal it would close as well we're -
like oh you can only click on the X
because I was very I was like very
specific not abstract about where I put
the function so I like I really like
that technique that's pretty cool um I
also noticed that you use the jQuery on
method instead of the click like I use
so why did you use on is that a normal
thing so mostly I'm like what are the
benefits of all others is click so
basically if you do like on and then
click you can add more effects like like
on the next line you could have like a
key press event and the next line you'd
have like a blur event or something like
that so you can with you with the on
method you can actually chain different
events into one section and so like
oftentimes if I'm developing something
I'll have more than one event that will
need to be handled on one element so I
just kind of have gotten used to using
Iron Man and then the last thing is I
noticed that I think that I made a ton
more mistakes like I was tripping over
myself way more than you were so that's
cool for you that was my second time
making it oh yeah I had that but you
made it totally different the second
I don't know if that totally Apple isn't
completely it wasn't completely in a lot
of it was the same like getting the
background cover thing to work mm-hmm
I struggled to that for a few minutes
like you did as well the first time oh
yeah cool but then the second time they
knew exactly what to type so what's your
opinion as a as a an audience member do
you do you find it frustrating when you
when I when I leave in the parts like in
when I'm editing when I'm like fumbling
around do you find it frustrating or do
you appreciate that stuff I'm just
curious
um I appreciate it if it's not like a
ridiculous amount of time like at some
point you just need to cut it off and
move on but like the video that you put
in that was fine okay cool I was just
curious just for my own edification so
um last thing I want to talk about is a
few things I learned from your from your
video I did not know that you could do
RGBA and then stick a variable in there
and then turn the opacity down like that
I was using sass functions I think
fade-out or o pacify and things like
that and you just threw it in an RGBA
which is like a lot easier for me to
remember that's cool I didn't know you
could do that but another thing that you
explained really well is the the pointer
events and how that like like what
you're using that for I think I think I
used the same technique in my video but
my my explanation was like a little bit
more cloudy than yours so I think like
even though you know we kind of used a
lot of the same things and some some
things different of course I think
watching both of the videos and watching
like how we thought about what we're
doing is also really interesting even
though that what we're actually doing
was the same well I learned a couple
things from you the first thing is it
flexbox is pretty cool I didn't use it
for quite that much when I used it the
first time but I didn't use it for like
everything whereas you if something
wasn't aligned properly it immediately
got display flex and you do things that
way I'm not sure how I know about that I
feel like every time I ever use flexbox
once the whole thing turns into flex pay
I feel like it's like a I feel like it's
like a rabbit hole that you fall down or
something when you started your
javascript file you actually made like a
short little outline even though it's
pretty basic with what you were actually
going to do that button and that's
something that I think you should do
people should do more of me especially
like I don't plan it out at all and I
just start typing and then get lost in
it because I don't know like if I had
already done something or if I need to
still do so yeah that was a trick I
taught myself when I first started
learning JavaScript was I would just
always just get like really confused
confused about it because like
markup and CSS is not like it's not like
logical like you have just take steps to
find things and JavaScript is very much
like it's actually running a program so
so that was really helpful for me
outlining the the concept and the
outputs that I want first and then
filling them in and then one other thing
that you did that I thought was just
kind of great and I want to mention is
that when you were going with that like
call to action hover effect where the
colors swapped basically once you saw it
working you're like it's not that great
but you can you just kept it there you
actually said it's not that great how
about do you like you just I did it
worked out okay I just like in the
design process that you said that cool
well that's all I got for our similar
similarities and differences in my
lessons let's make some recommendations
for the people at home if they're gonna
recreate this project having having done
it now twice and having seen me do it
what would you do differently in yours I
would have probably started with a more
responsive layout in markup and I would
have built my initially stylings to be
more responsive I would have set text
Heights to be you know fixed but then
everything else to be relative to that
whereas everything my video was
basically just you know pixel dimensions
and I was just measuring in Photoshop
just pasting them in which isn't a great
okay
thank response race so I would have it
definitely make it more responsive
design
I really like the the accessibility of
your modal especially the closing of it
so I think I would have liked spent a
little bit more time in my JavaScript my
JavaScript was basically turning this
class on or off that's kind of all it
was so I would have spent time you there
I like the way you did that all right
well that's all the time we have for
