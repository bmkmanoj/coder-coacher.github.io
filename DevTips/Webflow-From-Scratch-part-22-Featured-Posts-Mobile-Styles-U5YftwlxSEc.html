is dev tips today we're gonna be using
web flow to control the style of
dynamically generated content inside the
tool last week I said that I'd be giving
away a fresh subscription to web flow
pro and this is a four hundred and
twenty eight dollar value this week it
goes to Riley Jones I sent an email to
Riley earlier today I have another web
flow Pro account to give away at the end
of this video so stay tuned to find out
how that can be yours but first look
look at what we've done so far and then
take a look at what we need to be doing
in the next twenty minutes of this video
okay so in this episode I'm gonna try to
get this list that I have going on here
to have two things number one I want
this I want this oh actually look at
this list is backwards 89 90 91 and to
us so this so okay three things 92 needs
to be at top and it needs to have an
addition of the show notes now 90 you
know the other ones not need to be below
it and they have to alternate this
border color okay so so three things
reverse the order of listing feature
this one and alternate the color of the
border first things first let's do a
reversing of the feature so I'm clicking
on the episode list and all of these
episode lists if you go over to the gear
here you can like find different things
and this is what I was hoping to see
okay filters you can filter by episode
number filter by episode number equals
89
okay so that this will only show if it's
episode is 89 not what I wanted
okay sorta Lydia so I want to reverse
the order large the smallest episode
episode number yes episode number
smallest to largest
oh and ooh the largest to smallest
coming down okay so there we go task
number one done episode 92 91 90 you
know okay now I want to change the color
of the alternating versions here to this
really nice green color I don't think it
can but I do know that it can do another
thing so what I want to do is go over
here into the exported code and grab
episode list okay episode item and then
what is the thing with the border is
episode inner rap so episode item and
then my CSS will be like length child
odd episode inner rap okay so let's
close this and do a site settings custom
code and then write a style tag in the
header style okay
Oh what was it episode item I think is
episode item int child odd yeah it will
in turn the know the even ones I'm green
episode item and child even and then
it's like episode inner rap
I think and that's our CSS selector and
that will say every other one of these
find this and turn it green I'll say
border color so I had to have no write
CSS anyway no Big D no Big D border
color that let's save and see if B this
works go to designer
the preview doesn't show me what I want
to see I have I have a weird feeling
that this designer only shows me the
things that I'm able to edit right it's
like when I look at this
publish it doesn't show me the things
that are in the head it was kind of
annoying but let me try to this then you
published this and then check it out
and I wonder if the head stuff will show
up after it's been published okay um hey
what fluid that's not great but like I'm
glad I figured it out and I wasn't
banging my head against the wall for a
long time but but that's good it worked
but also come on it could have worked a
little bit better than that but this is
good it worked this I feel like this is
too too much border here let's say five
yeah you only need some five breath okay
um what was the other thing we want to
reverse the order make the alternating
border okay this the featured episode
featured episode looks like this it's
basically the same thing with this
purple border except for there's an
extension on it to get it here's what
I'm thinking here is what I'm thinking
I'm gonna drag another dynamic list up
here and choose the same collection
actually I'll just um I'll just
duplicate this thing right and duplicate
so I'll have two of these episode lists
okay okay
okay and then for this episode list
press up to get the dynamic item this
episode list you can limit them limit
limit items limit to one so that's how
I'm gonna get this featured one and on
this one on this particular episode list
I'm gonna make it different I'm gonna
enter a rich text I really hope this
show notes yes okay yes yes and then at
a Class A episode episode show notes and
then mmm and then turn the like
background into this color right what
color is this the purple the purple
haha and the color you know the color
white ff10 are you doing it why is that
not working why is this gray
oh I think I know why it's because it's
a paragraph right and paragraphs are
gray but we need to be more specific up
Eric so how do you add how do you make
complex selectors I don't know I don't
know anyway whether the patterning here
was pretty pretty heavy let's see what
we got here padding is gonna be like 75
35 padding like 35 okay and 30 guys and
I think that's 75 this is good okay this
is good but still like can I to learn
how to I'm gonna I need to learn how to
turn this white but the other thing I
need to do is get rid of this episode
since it's like right above it in this
other thing here so and go up to this
dynamic list the episode list and do the
limiting again but instead this time
we're starting at two so I think we got
this I think we got this I mean kind of
why I don't know why it's this is no I
can't turn this text white
a nested global selector how to activate
global selectors style tab okay I think
I've figured it out and it's little
fiddly but let me show you what's gonna
happen I'm gonna go in and drag out
another rich text block here but I'm not
gonna put it inside of this dynamic item
I'm gonna put it just in a regular you
know outside of it and when it's outside
of it and it's not connected to any data
I can go in and click these different
paragraphs and h2s write an H force so
notice that these h2s are getting the
styling of this regular h2 block that I
styled a while ago and this is how its
kind of hard but this is how web flow
does like nested tags and like you know
select the children of kind of thing so
I'm gonna press up so I can get the
parent which is the rich text block and
I'm gonna add the class of notes at
episode show notes and it's gonna turn
purple because this episode show nuts
class has like a purple background right
here and that's all well and good but
now I can still I can still click that
paragraph and here's here's the bit
thick kind of will you have to really
pay attention to so I have the class
episode show notes on this block and I'm
clicking in and getting the paragraph
tag I'm gonna select the paragraphs and
then this little kind of control shows
up when you're inside of a rich text
block and if you press Plus right here
it will nest this selector so it will
select all the paragraphs inside of
episodes show notes so I'm impress that
and I have this like double selector or
child selector and now I'm selecting the
paragraphs that are not outside of the
rich text text block or in other words
outside of the show notes but inside and
I'm going to turn these white
okay now that paragraph is white and
it's inside of Episode show notes show
notes I scroll down that episode show
notes also has the paragraphs inside
turning white and I want to make their
their font go to 18 looks good looks
good there's probably more I have to do
in here I'm just gonna turn all of these
white I guess because maybe like late
and later on somebody will make a
heading and it'll be Oh purple okay this
looks good this looks good so I can
delete this block because I've just I
just used it for styling it's not a part
of my layout and the white stuff stays
there okay so recent episodes don't done
done playing this looks good okay I
probably still have some work to do to
make this all look good for mobile let's
just take a look here this looks alright
that's passing it's okay getting a
little long in the tooth here but that's
passing okay this is becoming a little
hard to deal with when I'm in what is
this mobile landscape let's take this
episode thumb and make it max with a lot
smaller let's just do 100 okay
so these will all be 100 and let's make
this not as big this headline 24 episode
number 24
and this is when let's get the margin
bottom a little shorter - Oh
just half it okay so
are the the player embeds are already
responsive so they're just kind of
shortened up a little bit right there
and I need to get make the padding on
this thing go down to if you hold a
option and drag they get shorter
together like it constrains both sides
let's do 35 okay so when we're in tablet
it looks like this still and then mobile
looks good now let's see this on the
phone okay well actually yeah let's look
at this here one thing that needs to
happen is this container needs to lose
its sides bring this down to like maybe
20 and then this needs to select a class
h2 needs to lose its um out dent of the
text right here so this will just be to
zero okay and then also I can lose some
sides let's make it 28 see if that's
good I know it should be
- no 11.4 yeah and lorem I'm just making
this all kind of like condensed a little
bit more it doesn't need to be sixteen
twelve fourteen is good and good okay
this looks much better
okay in in the case of the phone I think
for the landscape this is still okay
lockup but in the case of the phone
portrait let's take this episode in a
wrap and remove the Flex from it and
this thing can be centered and give it
some padding or margin bottom let's say
20 because how much does it have on the
top 10 Danny yeah that's fine yeah I
like that okay now it's like just that
quick
it's like responsive I like it okay I I
think that we're in a good place
