say when I when I'm gonna start a video
ah hey my name is Travis and this is dev
tips of course you're watching because
you want to learn something today and
what are we going to learn we're going
to learn how to do some spinners
spinners what's a spinner spinners are
things come on you know what spinners
are let's get started
ok and we're back in code bin as you may
have noticed and you can get the link
for this code in the description below
it's easy to find here's what we got set
up so far we have a rap in a headline
which is like this box that it's in and
then the title there we also have one
div with two classes spinner and spinner
ones I'm going to do multiple spinners
so I'll name the differences you know
I'll use that class spinner one to
pronounce the differences between each
of the spinners okay so that is pretty
much simple HTML there the CSS is very
much simple as well I have some code
here for the background and the rap in
the header the spinner as you see is a
hundred by hundred pixels backgrounds
the circle margin on it
display:inline-block all very very
simple stuff and I'm also declaring the
before and after content display block
with the Hyatt border actually have
given nope no color and no border no
background nothing to it so you cannot
see the before and after I just made
them there so that I could easily style
and manipulate them later on okay and
actually that's where we're going to
start right here so I decided what might
be fun to do is I'm going to set up a
timer of a three minute timer going and
I'm just going to see see how far I can
get with this first thinner in three
minutes okay so let's go alright the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm
declaring just the spinner one atom and
I'm focusing on the after element and
it's already been content display block
hundred pixels and all that stuff right
there so let me just show you a
background I'll just make it pink so you
can see what I'm talking about
background pink okay so the first thing
I noticed is that it's not aligned with
its parent so we need a
position:absolute and then we need to do
top zero pixels and
zero pixels now it should be exactly on
top of its parent I want to do a border
here and I'll say border four pixels a
solid color or solid and then
transparent for the color and then I
want to do border top color
I'll do orange red I've been really
interested in orange red lately let's
take this pink off this is we don't need
that okay and then let's do the same
thing and put like a another border on
here but we'll do a border bottom color
now you can see that the border being
four pixels offsets where its position
so we need to do negative four to pull
it back in and they get afford to the
left to pull it back in now it should be
right
so now let's focus on animating this
this thing and in Asian and we'll call
it a spinny and we'll call and we'll say
you know the last two seconds long and
that the timing function will be linear
and it will last infinitely and that's
all we need for now let's go to the
keyframe so I say at where's my ass at
key frames s spinny and we're going to
start at zero percent of the animation
and we'll say we want to want to do a
rotate right transform rotate and just
start with zero degrees and then go to
100% which would be 360 that work oke
not 100% on that Y is zero to zero
percent 360 work okay well let's do 100
and see that's good okay so this is
rotating around 100% our way around for
two seconds cool
but now the reason I did this on the
after element and not the the actual
element is because I want to do things
to bring
away from that circle I am oh gosh okay
that was the sorry but I won't keep
going so it why is it on boy
snorted okay okay
I still want to go fast though okay so
just rotate oh okay transform let's do a
scale and we'll scale it from one here
and then add a hundred percent it'll be
scale like one point two okay so it's
growing through the whole revolution
it's growing up to one point two and
then it's snapping back to 1 because 0
percent is 1 that's not what I want I
wanted to grow I wanted to kind of like
do this so let's put a 50% in here and
take that transform put it in here and
through let's see 50% would be 180 right
I guess you don't even need this thing
here because the implication oh there's
a no-no the implication is that from
here 0 to here 360 it will continue with
its own rotation but I do want to do is
1.2 at 50% and then bring this back down
to 1 so ok um I heard so looks like for
some reason my my spin is lost let's
take that rotate back let's try that 180
what I said I don't know why I don't
have a good explanation
yeah that but that's kind of what I was
thinking about but what if we did it
what if this was 90 so it's slower on
the growth and shrinks back faster how
about like 30 hike but 30 doesn't make
sense what about 45 because that's like
so it should be go do it and then back
do back that's kind of cool
in two seconds maybe too long one
seconds and you can have like a the word
loading in the middle or something like
that except for it would be in there I'm
not gonna mess with it okay let's do
another one
spinner - alright spinner - let's see
what we got for ya
I'm going to set the clock again maybe a
little bit more than three minutes I'm
gonna set it for five minutes because
that's scared me
alright okay um spinner - let's do this
spinner - to what do I want you to do
what do I want you to do how bout let's
do the let's do the and before let's do
and after hope you guys can't hear the
people driving outside my garage is very
close to the street anyway so before and
after we're gonna say a height let's
make you like 20 pixels by width 20
pixels 29 Ochs 20 pixels please and back
ground
let's do orange red I like that color
all right so I should have two dots
orange red so let's do position on both
of these absolute and keep in mind that
the the parent which is a spinner
it has a position relative that's why
the absolutes are hooking on to it okay
so position have solute and let's do top
you know what 0 0 present 0 pixels left
a 50% and top 0 so you'd need a margin
left of negative 10 pixels and let's
just make that top negative 10 pixels
negative 10 pixels so it could be like
on the line this should be like Boop
right there okay so so so so so how are
we going to get I want this kind of
circle to it go around like a like an
atom or something one idea is to take
this spinner and let's put an animation
of spin on it and it's just a simple
spin we'll say two seconds a linear and
infinite and then down here we'll do a
at keyframes spin from trends I mean
it's basically what this one was right
but a little bit not as crazy not not
growing basically the first thing it was
right ok so let's narrow this down here
get these scales off of it all right up
and we've got indention problem okay
this
from from 0% okay no it's outdent at all
how's that look spinning around spinning
around spinning around
okay how about okay okay I have a great
idea you guys I got a great I have a
great idea
all right ready um I'm gonna say and
after and like override a few of these
things instead of saying top negative
10% we'll say top what is it called Auto
and bottom negative 10 pixels and now we
should have on the other side so I have
two going around that's pretty cool
that's pretty cool but what what about
what if we did an animation which we
spelled animation like that animation
Disney's rolling in his grave I doesn't
even have a grave dizzy got space head
why is it okay animation let's call it a
bouncy and what I want to do is have
these balls bounces they're moving
around so um I'll just say it you know
actually let's let's say a 0.5 second
animation and this time we'll say ease
in and in finite and then and then let's
do some key frames at key frames bouncy
and what are we gonna do with bouncy
we're going to just going to do another
easy one of these ones right it's just
gonna be simple
nothing too complex nothing too crazy
translate translate why actually oh
please stop it this is getting good
enough of these timers translate Oh was
it doing translate why why Oh translate
why um well we'll just start at zero
right translate zero pixels yes good why
translate
and we'll do 30 pixels so so now it's
growing but it's slamming down now the
reason for that is because this needs to
be both 100% and this needs to be 50% so
that it can animate out and back going
doing doing it's like jumping around
with spinkle I like it I like it
how about how how about how about how
about this how about let's do before all
right so this was before and after but
after wool will overwrite this we'll do
this same thing though but this time
we'll do it for one second because the
revolution takes two seconds right okay
so these things are going at different
speeds ah they're so weird
um and what's funny is the the one on
bottom is translating up into the circle
so if I stop animating this spinning
right if I stop it from spinning you can
see that the one on bottom is okay I
don't even know what I'm talking about
oh because I translated it down okay so
so gosh this is really really funny
looking anyway so when we spin it it's
like all so you can you imagine that as
a spinner for your website probably not
let's set a new timer let's do another
one
uh let's go make an HTML element and
spinner three what should spin a three
be spin it a three be no spinner spin a
three spinner three speak to me spin a
three how about how about okay let's set
a timer
five minutes is good I want like five
minutes let's do five minutes
five minutes oh it's been a three um
what are you you are back ground
transparent or just none and then you
are also you're also border border a
border you're four pixels no you're yes
they're four pixels and you're solid and
you're also a EE so you're a circle
instead of us your empty circle your
outlined circle and let's say after
let's take a width of four pixels and a
height of eight pixels for some reason
and a back ground of what's my
background oh yeah orange red now looks
the reason looks like a spear or like a
sharper kind of thing is because the
border radius is set to UM radius is set
to 50% well I'll just send it I'll just
put it to four pixels and not per sense
and that when you use pixels it only
rounds the ends but if you use percent
it rounds like as much as a can of the
body of it anyway um I need to move that
let's do let's do let's make it position
absolute and top drop top is going to be
50% right yeah
and left is going to be 50% and then
your margin left it's going to be
negative 2 because the width is 4 so you
have to take to a way to make it in the
center ok cool let's make that 80 pixels
it looks a little long actually let's
take let's take this border radius off
let's put zero reset it to a stick
because sticks are cool yeah it looks
like nice and like cool all right 60
will may be short it's pretty good about
65 66 even better than 65 okay so margin
left um let's spin the shindig I hope we
beat the timer okay at keyframe ease
keyframes sticky sticky and we're gonna
say actually we could just put a spin on
it I think we can just do spin right we
already have spin as a keyframe
all right so animation spin and what did
we want to say spin spin what spin over
yeah two seconds no once two seconds and
linear and in finite speak to me okay
it's spinning from the center is okay
okay okay Trane's a form don't don't
bunk me as or a gym top a top and center
just hopefully that likes ah there it
goes again
did it beat the timer 125 dude I'd beat
the timer think five minutes is too is
too too much now I've like leveled up my
game but maybe I was also much much
easier spinner to make oh let's make
some more spinners dinner number four
okay should we do the timer again why
not
it's fun right let's change the sound
I'm going to cut right here so you don't
know what sound I'm going to make
alright and I'm setting the time five
minutes let's do another one let's do
another one we're gonna do spinner
number four right
spinner for spinner
number - four what should we do we
should do like let's do a pulse and what
do you have to do for a pulse let's take
that that and before and after we're
gonna say back ground or and red and
then we have to position other already
position why are they already positioned
did that happen before I don't know why
they're positioned already uh but that's
fine that makes my life easier next
let's oh hey that's just great that's
just great let's just start start our
animation animation of a pulse or let's
say pulse pulse a and let's do it over
two seconds and it's linear so a lot of
these things were you're moving things
around you want to use linear but if you
want the thing to feel a little bit more
like lively then you'll use an ease like
these these balls here use the ease but
everything else I'm using linear cuz I
want them to keep good time as they move
around okay so anyway pulse is going to
be linear and it's gonna be infinite -
lets get some keyframes going at key
frames pulse and this is going to be
another simple transform why I so simple
these days we should do something really
weird huh alright transform it's going
to be scale and scale from actually
scale from zero
21.3 now this should be growing from the
middle out alright and here we're going
to do this as well we're going to do an
O pay city 1 or 0 no one and grab that
and put it down here a 0
move it in okay so now it should be like
growing out and fading like you're like
it's like a radar or like a that's what
I that's what I call radars I call them
turkey like a turkey radar okay uh it's
been like a freaking long day um let's
do this
kay I'm gonna grab the oh there we are
and after I didn't put the coal in there
and after and put the animation on it
again but this time I'm going to delay
it by a you know 2.3 seconds
okay now notice how they're like not
aligned correctly I for some reason yeah
whatever I don't know let's do this I
don't have have enough time to like
postulate about why it didn't work the
way I expected it to so let me hit it
with a hammer absolute top a 50% left
50% margin top negative how big are
these things how 100 I think negative 50
pixels margin blue bottom no margin left
margin caft and 1/5 depression okay
now it should be how about this
this one should take longer to why are
they starting like that oh it's cuz I'm
delaying it I should do opacity 0 so so
this one has a delay before it starts at
the after does and so that's why by
default is just like this huge orange
thing and that's why it looks kind of
strange so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take the opacity and I'm going
to turn it I'm going to straight up turn
them off so they're by default they're
zero and now only one is showing up okay
now wait oh my gosh I didn't change the
same I went to I'd really like I'd
tapped through all of these different
ones and I was like you know the bowing
is the best you got a minute the bowing
is the best okay whew so this is
interesting because not only are these
circles starting at different times but
they're running at different speeds the
before is running at 3 seconds and the
after waits for 2.3 seconds but it runs
at 2 seconds fast so sometimes it's like
kind of like very separate sometimes
it's like right on the line it's
catching up sometimes it's passing it so
it makes for a very interesting
animation
I have a good idea I'll do it now I have
an idea for another one already so it's
kind of cheating there to have some idea
ready but um but I have an idea for
another one that probably uh probably is
actually good actually
I have used it before and I don't want
to give anything away but there is a
certain thing that you can search for at
Google and it uses this very animation
that I'm about to show you so I made up
this stuff and I sent it to the
developer I was like just do this just
do that one it's fun because you know
I'm a designer but can I can do this
junk so sometimes I look at I mean I
look at code as a design tool really I
don't think of it as like I don't think
of myself as developer right now in my
mind I'm designing right I'm just I'm
not dragging and clicking boxes in
Photoshop or sketch but I consider this
design anyway so I I wanted to have some
input in some loading animations and
this is what I sent this would have sent
a developer so let me do this what
number was at was at five okay so I'm
not going to do the timer this time I'm
just going to talk you through this a
dot spinner - five there it is there's
that circle and the first thing I want
to do for the circle is make it a
smaller height and width are going to be
zero pixels actually zero pixels maybe
ten maybe height ten pixels I don't know
why know which get both zero and um
that's okay because what I want to do
actually is come on a hair or five and
I'm going to put some children inside
there I'm going to put some spans in
there I'm just just three spans three
spans inside of inside of my spinner and
if you look at the HTML we have a class
of spinner 5 and then one two three
spans nothing to cray-cray don't be
don't be sad sad
not to cray-cray and uh here mmm
if I hide them with of 0y0 because it
doesn't really matter because I'm not
using this is just a container to hold
stuff I want I want three things to
happen here um I want to talk about
these these spans so span every one of
you guys in there is now display:block
and why why display:block well because
the span is is normally display:inline
and you can't give a display inline
element dimensions like height come on
height hide you'll sight uh let's say
let's say twenty twenty pixels and wit
you can't give them height and width if
it's an inline element so I change it to
block so now we should have three little
squares Oh Noi need a background
background let's put them at D D D so
three little DS that's really low at the
bottom I guess doesn't matter why are
you low at the bottom
probably because I'll tell you what now
who cares
three DS and let's make them a border
radius 50% and let's do it
top zero pixels
position okay move this down p OS idea
Shawn so new position:absolute now there
should be like on top of each other
around that's always expecting them to
go and int child I'm gonna grab the
first one and say hey transform now I
must say left and I'll just move it over
to the left let's say how about there 20
how about 40 pixels to the left okay
and then I'm a copy path and say the
third one actually the third one should
be 40 this one should be negative 40 cuz
I want to be 1 2 3 okay so there in a
row now and poor old aunt child 2 is not
written out here but it's by default is
just normal okay
and what I want to do is let's do this
animation here and we'll say bounce have
we done a bounce yet this is bounce
animation bounce what's next oh one
second
ease in out and whatever what else we're
going to infinite
I always forget infinite okay and then
let's define bounce at key frames bounce
bounce
is from let's say 0% is this is the same
thing that we did before right 100% we
did a bounce do we do a bounce we've
done it bouncing I don't even remember
it we did it we did a bouncy oh we did a
bouncy basically the same thing very
little if I'm playing but I'm gonna
repeat it down here in case we want we
want it to be a little bit different
right so but we're going to start we're
going to start there
so it's bouncing obviously we want to be
different we want it to go up
there we go negative 30 translate Y up
this is almost like perfect so let's put
it on here and hey guys was what we're
going to put it on each of these and um
why don't we delay them delay them this
one will be a delayed for let's see one
second how about 0.33 seconds that's
good and this one will be how's that
looking why is number two oh it's number
one ooh weird your number two I wanted
you to be number two - OH
move that's weird why is number three oh
it is moving okay
I was like wise number three moving well
I'll tell you why Travis because you
made it move right there you wrote it
there okay 66 but I want what I just the
delay now they're bent now they're
moving now they're moving and but this I
actually now I'm not I don't even
remember the variation I made like six
or seven that's like these you know
what's interesting like we have this
like build three dots like moving it
looks kind of cool but you know you can
do other things like this watch how
about how about fifty up okay um well
why don't we do this how about a 25 and
then you could say 50 percent here and
also 100 set so now they're doing this
interesting thing where they're jumping
off the ground and landing for a little
bit until they're all done you could say
if you change this to like 75 like you
could do this you see them jumping while
the other ones are in the air okay so
that that's all we're gonna do right now
for spinners I'm gonna make one loader
just for kicks I'm gonna call it Kurt
Loder Kurt it's got a current class on
okay so this is going to be a loader and
this is going to be a fun one I had this
idea I haven't
executed it yet but I think Italy I
don't think it'll be cool so let's try
this okay okay loader let me say to this
loader hey loader can you be a wide like
like 300 pixels and height maybe like 10
pixels let's put it background on you
like a you know that's that so now I
have this bar what oh I said Wyatt
it needs to be width okay why isn't it
centered what if I do this just boy
inline-block
it should be centered because I think
there's a text Center on the parent or
or you could just freaking disappear
what what does that mean okay position
relative a relative okay so there's this
like little line right here it's pretty
cool is pretty cool I was thinking guys
what do you think with this I was
thinking I wanted to make a pacman
illustration loader where pac-man goes
in chomps chomps chomps who's with me
who's with me are you guys with me let
me hear you say yeah let me say I'm here
to say yo all right I really hope you
guys did that at home a
position:relative what we need to do
what would you do what we need to do is
we need to do these guys at before our
and before and after now let's say
content yeah Oh display display:block
let's move this up so I can work on a
bitter I always need things to be in the
center of the screen for me to like
think about them display:block and let's
do oh I got a great idea
height and width can be can be zero
let's do a border 30 pixels yeah you
guys know where I'm going with this
solid solid and color 30 is big
how about okay and then border color is
going to be orange red because I like
that orange red today and border radius
is going to be 50% so I should have what
is what is this are they so big because
they're filling up the parent I get okay
I get it
height is zero pixels and let's be
specific about this want the width to be
zero pixels also now she gets in balls
yeah let's go back to 30 that's what I
wanted I wanted some 30 pixel balls all
right balls and stick looks like a penis
Shh
you're thinking like what kind of penis
looks like that hope your mom's not
watching okay a border radius 50% now
what we need to do is we need to figure
out a way so that this can be a
chomp-chomp right so let me say border
right trim the border right color
transparent oh my gosh it just became a
job job I'm exciting but that face is
not moving that's why we have to who who
amongst you was so astute to realize
that that's why we have two of them
because I need two pieces of the mouth
to chomp this is not going to animate
just taking a piece out of the margin
okay so let me let me get this mmm
positioning right position AB so I'm
really excited right now top let's say a
50% right 50% and then Marg Jin Jin top
is gonna be negative 15 because the
thing is 30 pixels right so it should be
what let's try negative 30 okay now it's
right on the line we got a Chomp Chomp
here let's do this let's take away the
height make it zero and then do border
border top a 4 pixels pixels um
dotted and what's it called e ha ha ha
oh oh how about 8 I wonder why oh I know
I I know it way border top dotted EEE oh
I know why because background is EEE
background should be none now let us let
us move along if the border is what for
I need to add 8 pixels for the border
border here and I need to take away 4 to
4 from here so I say 34 to move it up a
little bit there we go now right on the
chomp line this is so good this is so
great so great believe it
a couple official Kroy let's do a
and after and we'll say border color
pink so you know what we're looking at
oh snap I see what it did there yeah why
not
color pink and then we'll focus on
taking the way the right order so this
one will just say
border-top-color:transparent okay there
goes the top there and I need to do the
right - okay okay that's the pink is
this what we wanted and then oh my gosh
this is so close um and border not right
but board with bottom so let me set this
to back back to orange red now we have
this Chomper okay now we have this
Chomper let me let me left this away
ilex scoot it out so we can see these
choppers separately so let's just put it
out eighty pixels scoot it let's good it
there we go now let's do some chomping
animation animation chomp now keep in
mind that I've never done this before
this is all like right now this is raw
uncut a chop should take the one second
and it should be ease it out I think I
was just saying ease in Chomp Chomp
yeah whatever no ease out because you
Chomp Chomp yeah he's out he's out and
in finite that should be good for now
let's define chomp at key frames chomp
and this one is going to be I mean you
know these all have a very
similar thing or just moving things back
and forth the structure would be
something like this where we do it from
zero to 100% in one direction and okay
transform and let's do rotate rotate uh
like what ten degrees I don't I don't
know where I'm starting so I'm just like
picking something that like is
understandable so that I can move things
from there so let's put them both ten
degrees but let's invert that number so
10 and negative 10 so it looks like okay
so let's say 30 degrees negative 30 so
that's going in for a better chomp how
about 50 degrees oh it looks like almost
a full chomp right there okay okay okay
okay okay okay okay okay this looks
pretty good
can we get that chomp we get that same
chomp up here but it needs to be
inverted I let's put these guys let's
get rid of that left eighty moving back
onto each other oh no that's not gonna
work
all right well if probably we're going
to have to do like a top chomp and a
bottom chomp this is just gonna wait is
the way it's going to have to be guys
top chomp that's actually bottom Chuck
let's do autumn job
and now let's duplicate this kind of
structure here and invert it manually
man I was hoping I could do I could be
smart about if I make as is I don't know
I guess I'm not just that smart you you
guys probably couldn't figure this out
but I am not feeling it right now
so let's do top chomp and then we'll
flip this what are we going to flip I
will flip this so negative 50 and then
10 is that little strut there anyway
okay that easing is weird ease in out
that's much better
but we're not going far enough so how
about negative 80 that's opening my
mouth up wider okay so how about the
negative 20 uh-huh and then 10 is going
to be like oh is out of the 150 let's do
5000 too far guy too far
dang super good let's do 37 because I
could see a peak of white cracking out
in the back good Oh chop chop chop chop
chop to drop chomp hey hey hey watch
this watch this
okay
stop it stop it Chompy okay well now the
last thing we have to do is just move
the jump move the chomp move the chomp
that's going to be both of them right
yes okay so do another animation let's
do the keyframes first let's do these
keys
at keyframes and will say move chomp
with a capital C and we'll say 0%
where are you zero zero percent we're
going to say I wanted to say transform
but I'm already using transform for
rotate so I'm just going to do like left
can I do transform let's do this
transfer now left is better left is even
better actually because it's relative to
its container so I'll say left ooh
why meant caps locked left 0% mmhmm
mmhmm and then 100 percent is going to
be left 100 sat mm-hmm must move chop
loader no nut loader Kurt Loder all
right comma um move chomp and that needs
to take let's say three seconds and I
move them along at a linear path and
kind of move along a linear path and
he's going to infinitely
let's put that same comma transition
animation on the bottom and see it go
why didn't it go oh
this is good this is good okay guys
don't hate me but let's spend more time
on this let's do i okay I I want it to
go one way in flip it go the other way
and flip do you think we can do it I
don't know let's see let's just see
let's move where does that move chomp
animation here it is move chomp left so
50 percent is going to be left 100
percent again and left zero is going to
be back to 100% so let's see if it goes
back and forth back and forth okay so
now at um so let's say 49 percent to 50
I don't want it to like flip the whole
way back I want it to like flip and then
be flipped and move back how you do that
how do you do this well it's normal and
then I kind of rotate so it's so it's
going to rotate is going to be like this
transform rotate why 180
okay so that's what I want to do but
that's not how I wanted it to happen so
what I want it to okay here's the
transforms oh I know how to do okay I
was like brain farts for a long time
there was zero percent to 49 percent is
transformed nothing is regular and then
and copy this and then 50 percent to 100
like what why this takes so long for me
to think about okay okay this isn't
working because transform rotate is
already done what I could do is here's
what I would do okay guys I'm not going
to do it but here's what I would do to
make this work it wouldn't be one
element it would be two elements the
rail the dots and the actual Kurt Loder
so Kurt Loder would be the thing that's
moving and spinning and then his before
and afters would chomp independently of
him that's what I would do if I was
going to do this all over again but yes
can you guys can pretend that I did it
right in fact how about this as a
challenge for you guys you want to do
this
fix this make this work right and I give
you a big hint of how to do it okay that
is it for this demo again all these
codes they're on code panco check them
out thanks for watching that video on
spinners I hope that you liked it for me
the it was a much different video I've
never been scared so many times in video
before and I hope you that you learned
some spinner stuff now I want to just
explain how this video happens because
if
would not happen if it were not for the
wonderful patrons of the channel the the
patrons of dev tips these are these are
humans these are people like you who
watch this show and it's Masek you know
what I think this show is is worth it it
is worth to keep it going

Live Chat Hangouts that we do once a
month with me and also weekly hangouts
that are community based and we have a
community chat room a slack chat we have
a have a whole bunch of things like pay
a podcast and you guys get to see these
videos early anyway lots of cool stuff
check out patreon.com/crashcourse by
providing a space for these people to
connect with each other I'm not doing
anything anyway that's enough about the
patrons I want to thank you guys for
watching this and next week's episode
should be a little bit different because
I'm not going to be in the United States
