fantastically and recorded and
beautifully edited video from my youtube
channel called dev tips
ah today we're going to be looking at
the awesome awesome awesome community
contributions that we call pull requests
here on github comm when you guys make
awesome pull requests and contributions
to our code base I'm going to you know
I'm going to talk about it I'm going to
talk about your hard work you the things
that you're doing is are completely
awesome and super helpful in and like
you know you deserve the recognition so
we're going to go through some of the
pull requests that are available for me
to pull in and and then talk about them
and kind of talk about who who did them
so without further ado let's take a look
at who already offered pull requests
here's some credits for the people who
are doing a lot of pull requests already
these guys and girls have already
offered so much to the code base and
some of them that you'll see tonight are
actually repeat these these people love
to love to help thank you so much to you
and let's take a look at what we got all
right so the first one
utilizing markdown for the work project
files instead of wrought HTML increase
ease of use and utilize power of Jekyll
let's see what they're talking about Oh
what he's talking about is you went into
these um the work folder here and each
of these I wrote in like HTML but our
friend our friend Brian transferred all
of the the HTML into markdown so it's a
little bit easier to write and to manage
especially for people who don't want to
fiddle with all the HTML tags so I
really like that I think that's a
fantastic addition I'm going to pull it
in
right now so I'm going to go to the
conversation tab and say merge merge
alright yeah awesome pulling pulling
hash tag with the output hash tag hash
tag pulling
another one by D Roberto indeed
Roberto's name is D Roberto and D
Roberto says beloved beloved blah
instead of going to the absolute paths
like hard-coded to the root of the
project he wants to do relative paths
now this would be a good idea if your
artist theme is not the root of your
server right a root of your site it's
just the root of like it your artists
theme is um you know in your select
slash artists theme or or whatever so
this this kind of helps out helps it to
be a little bit more universal when you
put stick this on a server somewhere I
really like that can't pull it though
right now need to need to he needs to
resolve some conflicts so what happened
is he made this pull request and then I
updated with a client section and then
something is conflicting with our our
files and so I'll ask him to update his
files and pull in the most recent so we
can so we can update this can you update
would to the project ahead and manage
any conflicts done resolved
I'd love to pull it in
let's see ads metatags what is this - oh
yes it adds meta tags
okay so Brian would just add its meta
tags I'll buy that that's cool
let's do that
this next one is using the translate 3d
CSS instead of using left which is
faster and smoother on because it's
hardware accelerated so I am ready to
pull this in I'm going to say pull
awesome fold and that thank you goes out
to Anders Anders you're awesome thanks
for that 3d transition tiny fix this is
by George George George centered the
background cover background size and
position which sounds fine okay yeah I'm
good with that let's pull that one in
thanks George
okay and the underscore to the clients
dot sass great great and it looks like
he did it to a few of them he added an
exclude of the design that's cool
so that PSD doesn't get put into the
work section although that I'm the
underscore site directory
oh he renamed all of these files that's
cool
yeah this is good so in SAS if you put
an underscore before the file name like
underscore clients is what he renamed it
to it won't compile itself and create a
client's dot CSS but but I didn't have
it underscored so it was also it was
being included but also creating a
client's dot CSS which is just messy so
I like that and if I can I'll pull it in
I'm gonna pull it in
great changes thanks for the poll well
this one is fun for our face in the
client unit there instead of using an
image and and uh like nothing he uses a
figure does he who's contributing here
Eric Eric is using html5 tag names
figure and fig capture to or start
figcaption to to do those things and I'm
cool with that
that sounds fun so let's do that thanks
Oh can't pull it in
we need to need to do some conflict
management
that's probably cuz I was messing with
the clients in the last video so but I
will pull it in as soon as you get it
sorted out Eric that's a good change and
I want to do it
this next one is is like I gotta like
take a moment for this right here now
Jekyll recently updated itself if you
look at my Jekyll right here let me turn
this off and I'll say Jekyll - V I'm
running version 2.2 now Jekyll has
updated itself to two point three point
zero two point three point zero so
exciting it adds in back the
functionality that it took out in two
point two and that was like I pulled out
all my hair you see it's all gone that
was that was so frustrating but they
added it back because me and I'm not
going to take credit for it but I was
involved with a bunch of other people on
a github in the discussion talking about
it and saying you know what we're going
to use it for and why it was frustrating
that it's removed the the maintainer of
of Jekyll put it back in as a response
to these things and even at mentioned
dev tips to kind of like let us know
that it's working now and Ricardo who
was a guest on one of our previous
episodes submits a pull request wherein
our variables are kind of back into the
settings the settings file that's really
exciting to me
I was super bummed out and frustrated
when they changed it but now they're
changing it back so I'm really super
excited and happy alright let's see if
this will work out merge pull request
thanks Ricardo you are the man and then
what else do we have here okay this this
this this this this okay you guys
remember custodian right custodian has
done a lot of work already he's already
kind of a contributor is already a known
contributor on this repo he's in Russia
I was talking to him a little bit I
asked him to come on the channel like
like Ricardo and a few others have done
already but he said he couldn't because
the time difference and is quite busy
and a few other things but um he well
I'll just show it to you so all the red
is the JavaScript that I wrote and all
the green is the JavaScript that he
rewrote so you'll notice that he kind of
rewrote everything in my JavaScript file
look at all those red
okay that's it for the pull request this
week thank you everybody so much for
contributing thank you so much for being
awesome and just kind of like making up
for my general like suckiness encoding
and this is good I really appreciate the
the stuff here I know the rest of the
community is benefiting from your hard
work and and we'll see you next time
keep on hacking bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
