episode for you today we're going to be
talking to Matthew Tran from the
engineer to truth YouTube channel
Matthew also interviewed me on his
channel in that video is available now
and we talked about how to increase your
personal visibility and make an impact
on the people around you and how to get
noticed by the right people to get that
first job Matthew uses his YouTube
channel to talk about business and
careers and professionalism and defining
success and all that stuff
Matthew is currently attending a coding
bootcamp we talked to him about all
these things and more it's awesome I
hope you do it hey welcome everybody
back to another episode you say your
last name Matthew Tran yeah trend okay
that's gonna be a part of the intro
Matthew Trans here say what's up Matthew
hey what's up alright so let's do the
quick profile here Matthew has a YouTube
channel called engineered truth how
would you describe your channel
realistic career videos career videos is
it only for engineering careers I
started off with engineering careers and
the NAM expanding out to any career I
just do it based on subscriber request
and also who emails me
that's it being interested in being
interviewed I try to stay toward
practical careers so that's the general
theme and careers that are not dying I'm
not gonna interview like a history
philosopher law philosopher or something
our librarian like that's not really a
buffer so it's not gonna give me any
views and second of all I just want to
promote
I just want to steer people the
direction where they're actually gonna
get jobs uh-huh and how have you been
doing it three years now yeah yeah it
started as a side hustle and it's still
a side hustle funny enough but it was a
joke side hustle where my friends would
would laugh at me one friend said hey
Matt your videos suck you should really
focus on being a mechanical engineer and
I only had about six youtube videos at
the time super discouraged and oh no I
feel like if I took his advice I
wouldn't have in 102 thousand followers
right now you have a hundred and two
thousand yeah hundred thousand hundred
and a few thousand
which is it you 100,000 subscribers
right hundred thousand subscribers yeah
that's awesome congratulations on that
that's a big milestone did you get your
play button yet not yet having gone the
email yet a little while ago I saw your
video uh-huh so excited for you yeah
thank you okay so what is when you're
making a video what does success look
like for a video success look obviously
I mean as many views as possible to be
honest and I think I heard there's two
kind of successes for videos when it
gets a lot of views that's that success
for any youtuber the second success is
the comments where people say oh my god
like this was so helpful this really
changed my perspective and it could be
either way like sometimes I hear them
like oh like I saw the ugly truth about
this career I know I want to do it
because I heard the ugly truth and I
know I want to do it cuz I heard it the
truth about it and I still want to do it
so that means I want to do it or will be
I heard the ugly truth about this career
and I don't want to do it which is just
as valuable I'm not deterring anybody
from doing anything I'm just saying the
truth what I think is truth and what my
guests think are the truth who work in
those professions and I'm helping people
save years and possibly usually
thousands of dollars of loans of not
going to college for something that
they're not going to do in the future
right avoiding like being informed to
avoid the wrong career path right right
right right so look what types of
content can somebody who with their to
visit your channel expect you do a lot
of interviews and a lot of rants what's
our dinner area there yeah yeah so then
the interviews are my primary content
where I interview someone about their
career and I have them talk about in an
honest way
the second is monologue videos where I'm
just delivering information typically
kind of like for example I'm in a boot
camp right now so I've been talking
about all about my boot camp experience
and then the rants were just terrible
for sponsorships but they're great for
building a connection with my audience
yeah you mentioned that you're in a boot
camp where you at right now I'm at dev
Mountain in Provo Utah they're they
label themselves and market themselves
as the most affordable boot camp in
North America and I would say they have
a pretty strong reputation in being the
most affordable for a base
cost-effective it's like 100 the Honda
Civics boot camps in did you move to go
there to attend yeah the best thing
about this boot camp is that they
include house housing the price and this
boot camp is only ten thousand dollars
and when you compare to other boot camps
they're usually around like thirteen or
fourteen thousand and they don't include
housing so this one was a pretty
straightforward choice how long does it
last three months and you're coming up
to the end coming up to the end last
three weeks right now okay
congratulations do you feel prepared to
enter the like the coding workforce now
that you've been on a three-month boot
camp as a junior dev or a very entry
level position yeah I I I think learning
this stuff you also learn how much you
don't know because I'm always on
stackoverflow looking things up and then
everything is a surprise I mean I've
only learned react for like three days
three lectures mm-hmm and they're not
I'm building a group project and react
and it's definitely a struggle and when
I see some of the solutions and
stackoverflow I think to myself wow I
don't know anything by the same time I
can make some you know some pretty
impressive projects I made something
that uses Expedia API connects to you
Google Maps
this group project I'm we're doing we're
cloning Airbnb and Airbnb is sort of
weird API to work with because their API
is like way way too wide open but they
don't have any official documentation
he's like okay you make it wide open but
you don't say it's wide open so like do
you want people to go in there or you do
not want to come people have to go in
there so we're using the you know the
Airbnb API and with react and they
open-source their day picker and their
slider so there's a lot of things that
we could use in there so I know how to
use those things so that's why I do feel
adequate but I also know that as you
know when I look at these source codes
I'm like whoa I really don't know what
you're doing anywhere in here yeah so
what has been like a big surprise
attending a boot camp and because it's
just so much information thrown at you
all at once right is there anything that
you were not prepared for or this a big
surprise the main thing I wasn't
prepared
or was how little other people prepared
as I came in yeah Alec came in I would
say I was scared because I knew that is
sort of expensive typically bootcamps
attract people coming into their second
careers they kind of realized that you
know maybe they got a liberal arts
degree and they didn't pan out for them
so now they're in their second career I
thought okay they're all gonna take us
very seriously but I would say about
half of my cohort did not prepare at all
for the boot camp to the point where the
first day they came in as like first day
they learned what it did it did was so
that's the fact surprising but that's a
really interesting insight what
preparations did you make then I want a
free code camp comm free code camp is
actually the most starred repo on github
I didn't know this until the other day
but I've actually interviewed the
creator of that Quincy Larson to be it
will just be explicit there's like their
github profile their github repo for a
free code camp has 200,000 stars okay
it's a lot so so you spend time on free
code camp and you feel that you were
adequately prepared for your camp code
camp yeah yeah I feel like it is a code
boot camp right I I did all the basic
items and advanced algorithms and
intermedia algorithms well not all
advanced ones but I did most of the
JavaScript stuff and I felt like that
really adequately prepared me more than
anything else
mmm-hmm and you chose the the boot camp
that you did because of the cost only or
was there another deciding factor like
what should somebody be looking at when
they're judging all these camps costs I
mean it depends on your personality I'm
the guy that gets chipped in generic
brand everything okay generic brand
water tea okay so I'm the guy who it's
like I usually think that prank premium
doesn't matter unless it's a iPhone
sorry I ad for Apple on the Y but there
are some things that I think are worth
paying premium and I thought for this
thing in my personality type it wouldn't
be because I'm pretty good at self
teaching yourself not designer to you
I'm pretty good at self teaching but
then there's like this
I guess initial hurdle with code that
would be very hard
pass unless I went to bootcamp and the
hurdles if you guys want to explicitly
what it is isn't angular and react you
have to have like this base level of
knowledge and angular and react before
and anyone's gonna hire you but to get
that base level of understanding with
angular and react it's way beyond
anything any websites gonna teach you I
know honesty like all these team
treehouses code Academy they're gonna
get you like here here and then to get a
job you need to be like up here if you
get and then but once you get up there
you get the job and now you can learn
from your work experience but if you
don't get to that first initial hurdle
then you know you can't get a job during
those those frameworks and libraries and
did you try all the web-based courses I
did I did I've tried code Academy I
tried to extreme team treehouse and they
do a good job of getting your foot into
the door and basics but I've never seen
any of these free online courses take
you to the level that you would need to
actually get paid a full-time job to do
angular or react and is the difference
just being that like that one-on-one
interaction with the instructor is that
what what is like what is the difference
the main difference is asking questions
when you get stuck so the when you learn
online okay you have this very
structured question and they're gonna
give you the answer with being in a
bootcamp they say okay yes can do a
project these are the requirements of
the project like for example one that
requirements is like alright you got to
use three views three views and angular
connect it to your know a basic node
server you sequel to make database
queries but you can do any project that
you want so long doing that project
you're gonna run to situations where
you're like oh I want to do this code
but I don't know how to do it that's
where that having someone to be a mentor
an instructor helps because in a lot of
ways not everything's on Stack Overflow
and also if it is on Stack Overflow as a
beginner oftentimes it's you're not sure
on how to word it mm-hm and so you're
googling the wrong where the wrong
things that you don't know because you
don't know how to word the question so
the right things aren't popping up and
that's interesting in do you think that
I mean see what I mean do some editing
there obviously
yeah yeah or leave it in for personality
I don't know but we're leave it in for
personality yeah who knows so my
question is like do you think that this
this approach coding camps do you think
this is kind of work for everyone or is
it unique people that need this type of
thing or don't need it I think obviously
there's a lot of self-taught developers
I think 66% of developers are
self-taught and so yeah Quincy told me
actually he did the study a lot of a lot
of developers are being self-taught so
if you could teach yourself that's great
I think this environment is for people
that are have this thing I need where
this dear people who want to be
challenged in a very dense bootcamp
environment and I think you're if you're
the person that likes intense things
then a boot camp is for you if you're a
person that likes to do things at your
own pace obviously a boot camp is not
for you if you're more chill like I want
to learn on my own pace I mean that's
the office of a boot camp like even in
the name is boot camp it sounds intense
so I think that's that's primarily who
the boot for the boot camp is for and I
also think it's for people who are in
financial situations where they can't
spend four years in college or another
two years to get a masters and they need
to start working right away the boot
camp is the best time efficient choice
and all honestly then anything I've ever
seen none of you end up with some type
of credential or like do they do
placements how did how are they gonna
help you when you're done yeah that's
one thing I'd like to add to you you
mentioned when I interviewed you when I
was yeah when I was interviewing here
for my channel
you mentioned this you moved to
California and I think people should
choose a boot camp in the area that they
want to work generally unless it's the
most affordable one which instead on
cost I'll take the networking Vantage so
at the end of a boot camp they get on
nearby companies to come and have a
hiring day with our students well
usually that's like a smaller companies
like surprisingly in this Salt Lake City
area there's Adobe and a lot of tech
companies I was surprised about that
yeah Provo is actually a little bit of a
little mini tech hub it's interesting
you know funny enough is Google Fiber
here and it's this really small town
filled with tech companies here to you
yeah so I would say you would want to go
to boot camp where you where you want to
work because they're gonna bring in
companies that are nearby and that's
probably where it'd be easier to get
your first job there because a lot of
companies have almost a personal
relationship with that mountain where
they've so used through hiring Deb
mounting graduates that they're like oh
we know the quality that we're getting
it's pretty good but if I was applying
to start with an SF they're like well we
like some hack reactor graduates then
you know it's it's one of the situations
where people try to hire what their
customs here we call that a feeder
school right and so yeah find out if you
if you have your eyes on a specific
company find out like if they have a
feeder school go there nice nice um so
so what's next for you then you're gonna
finish up in a few weeks what's your
plan after that I'm gonna go to the
Philippines for nine weeks there should
be fun I'm gonna try to see if I can get
a remote job doing coding because I know
with coding Mina tends to be like the
lower end jobs or the higher end jobs
are the ones that are remote because I'm
the quinsy also wrote about this Quincey
Larson big fan of the guy yeah yeah so
yeah Quincey on your channel yeah yeah
we'll have a link to that down below and
he's the leader of free code camp yeah
yeah so I plan to work out in the
Philippines hopefully if not I can still
sustain with my youtube channel income
and I did create social media post or
pro-science life and I do some other
things to you so I could I can live out
there for nine weeks easily and then
after I come back I do want to work for
dem mountain as a mentor at their Dallas
location because I think it'd be pretty
fun and they provide housing for their
mentors their employees that are mentors
that's awesome yeah it's really cool
honestly it's a really cool experience I
don't think it sounds like pretty decent
job to me yeah how does it not everybody
who goes there want to be a mentor like
turnaround like I'm here again yeah yeah
experience right because I get to learn
more I can learn faster here than I
working and I just environment it's nice
right I mean that's that's a huge deal
yeah one cohort had 18 out of 24
students applied to be a mentor but then
the next mentor mentor our cohort would
only have four people apply so I think
it depends on how good its mentality
yeah and also depends on their age
oh the chance to be the older crowd
doesn't want to stick around oh yeah
there you go
get back to real life yeah yeah that's
awesome dude
thanks for taking some time with me
today and just everybody who's watching
dev tips right now Matthew is a really
cool guy he interviewed me on his
channel so you can go check that out as
well and he interviews all kinds of
people who if you're a fan of dev tips
you're gonna be a fan of his channel man
so um thanks again for showing up here
and everybody keep on hacking oh I say I
have the guest say keep on hacking can
you say keep on hacking Daniel say
anything else is right around it I don't
know what do you want to say you're
making me keep on hacking Oh what do you
want to say anything else I just it was
nice to finally talk to you because it's
funny that when I talk to my subscribers
they have bad moments and I know where
you and I are about the same subscriber
level but I watch your paralax video and
all like 20 minutes of it is one of your
longer videos and the way you explained
parallax was the best on YouTube I was
like whoa
I really like how you categorize then
you're like this is the type of parallax
and it's a yeah it's pretty revered to
sit through a 20 minute tutorial but
maybe just because parallax is an
interesting subject but I really sat
through the whole tutorial is really
cool so nice to finally talk to you
that's really nice it's been a pleasure
for me too man have a good night
thanks to Matt for enjoying this
collaboration and be sure to go to his
channel to check out my interview with
him and if you're new to dev tips coming
over from Matthews channel is your first
time here welcome we have tons of great
videos for you we have tutorials vlogs
