designers my name's Travis they were in
San Francisco and we attending a
conference about email assignments we're
gonna talk to people here and get some
tips about email design and development
so let's get started I think the best
tip starting out is to realize that a
solid foundation in HTML is still vital
to anyone's career in design and
development even though it's 20 years
later they still continue to improve it
so get a song foundation in HTML now
you'll be set to achieve anything you
look like is my biggest stick to table
my biggest tip would be to pay attention
to what you ignore yourself hi I'm
Andrew and my biggest tip for coding an
email is to add some pre the text to the
very top of your email just a short line
of text about the content and that'll
show up as a preview tick next to the
subject line and lots of email clients
like Outlook or the iPhone app or Gmail
and they all help you increase your open
rate just by adding that extra piece of
text
my biggest tip is to use inline Styles
my name is Gary I'm the creative
director at ero I try to stretch your
message over more than one email to
continue that relationship with the
subscriber
information
my name is Clara and my biggest tip is
to always always always include our
patch images hey my name is Arvid my tip
is one clear goal 20 ml with a clear
call-to-action hi my name is Joe valve
have been my biggest tip is to leverage
the resources that are out there like
there's companies like ExactTarget that
have been researching and researching
and doing website design for a long time
and very well designed specifically and
use the resources that they have
my name's Eliot goes I wanna
email design agency club action rocket
so my tip is to look responsive design
for email the things like turning off
content resizing it down the smaller
screens and then maybe stacking a key
column which you can do with two or
three classes
William Visalli I'm an email designer
programmer and
my tip for responsive email design is to
test test test over and over and
until you get it right Colin from
customer i/o and my tip is if you move
everything to a single column that'll
solve most of your problems
I am half gorillas
why to visit
you need to test everything all the time
and everywhere you can preferably
through a service
you just need to be aware of the email
is in hyperspace it's much different web
development it's more like web
development in nineteen idea I pizza
from C design and my tip on email design
and development is don't give up on
background images
so my name is Nick and my tip for email
design is before you get a table based
stuff start on your designs with emails
and it's in the paragraph tags and divs
may be used for bootstrap and once you
get approval rely design you do then you
move in the table based design protest
hi I'm Chris I have a tip on
collaborating with designers turning
your designers to make assets that are
compatible with mobile and desktop
layouts
we 2x assets for graphic text like
headlines or golf the action if you've
got a strong brand
or also icons or any kind of liner and
with that you can use the same code for
both assets and both layouts and it will
look great on like an iPad with Retina
or a laptop with right now like anything
with my height fixity or pixel destiny
look great it'll be easy awesome hey I'm
pregnant or Wistia I would recommend
that use short concrete copy in your
email hi there my name is Chris
Studebaker ExactTarget
for designers who are looking to get
better at developing is actually the
step away from here with work and start
with someone else's it's a great way to
make sure that you're in a situation
where you don't have the context and
knowledge the planning that you put in
your InDesign if you're forced to start
from scratch and that really makes you
learn from the ground up the other great
thing it does for you is
makes you realize the kind of situation
that as a designer you may have put a
developer into in the past so you can
get some context for what they're
feeling kind of input
that they need to be successful and
really produce what that designer was
attending
Alex and my tip is
designers
as many email programs as possible it's
very hard to
do this job in a bubble
what to do what not to do
just by going through 30 or 40 miles a
day or random
are about your style
the industry
hey my name is Skylar my tip is you
gotta put your data add on definitely
dig into the analytics very important
for designers it's not busy about design
got intuition or intuition but
definitely looking at the metrics and hi
my name's John my tip is to start with
mobile first and not focus so much on
desktop and think about mobile as an
afterthought think about mobile first
how's it going my name is Brian my tip
would be test like nobody's business and
not just in browsers but once you
package it and send it off to different
email clients because you never know
what's going to change from one place to
another
I'm the community manager at campaign
monitor and the author of the goddess's
has support an email it is an old just
about the code ultimately it's about
optimizing your content for this hold
screen there's home of all devices and a
lot of that isn't isn't it certainly
a design decision it's a Content
decision - it's about ensuring that you
have a call to action
that is immediately appealing
immediately graspable and of course
cutting out the blood think my ball
first
results first my name is will my tip is
really the importance of building sort
of a mobile centric experience and that
means you know you've got to communicate
your entire value proposition within a
couple of seconds of somebody opening it
and you need to sort of rely on you know
text-based approaches because they might
not see images and all this stuff so I
think just generally designing something
very short and concise it's really
crafted towards a mobile experience and
frankly like desktop users I mean there
are some of them but decreasing all the
time for most of our most of us my name
is Scott my chip is the fact you only
get one chance to capture it flip
through and get that person to read your
content there's a myth out there that
people open up a an email on a mobile
device go back later on to their desktop
and read the material that they found in
that first email it turns out that it
only happens in two to three percent of
cases so you really get only one
opportunity to get after that click in
here
actionable you don't want to look at
just an open rate because it's not
terribly actually at whole you don't
know how to change your digital design
based on an open right
we get weird people are clicking on that
email
look at things that can directly affect
your visuals I like devices where people
are clicking on those certain devices
where your drop offs are far down the
page
and just make sure all the data points
that you're gathering are action
my name is Amber and I recommend your
clip area to be a 44 pixels
how's it going my name is Dan and my tip
is always have the street people look at
your emails one person sending an email
out with no one else
so with email people are generally it's
a mobile age people don't want to open
up an email and just see a wall of text
so you definitely want to keep it as
short as possible and then really follow
people are outside of their inbox
directly to your website to YouTube
channel to wherever you're trying to get
them and then they want to read more in
depth though they want follow-up and
watch a video or something like that
that's where you want to deliver all of
your content not in the email
all right that's it for the email design
conference 2013 San Francisco there's a
lot of fun stuff they hope you enjoyed
this tips that I gathered for everybody
had a lot of fun point in the camera and
over his face make them confess their
deepest darkest tips anyway take care
