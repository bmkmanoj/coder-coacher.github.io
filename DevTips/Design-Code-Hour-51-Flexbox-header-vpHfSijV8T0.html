you're watching dev tips this is the
fifth hour in a video series I call
design and code my personal website in
12 hours ah last week we spent a good
amount of time making sure that our
project was exactly the way we wanted it
so check out those videos if we miss
them we talked about gulp about file
structures and we talked we talked about
clearing out any templates to be exactly
the way that we want to use them today
we're going to pick up just where we
left off we're going to build a header
for the site if you remember our visual
design it's that white bar going down
the left side of the of the design now
that's not a sidebar that's actually the
header and I'll show you how to end our
last video we just push to follow a code
to github and that's exactly where we're
picking up now this is my github
application and you can see that there's
no change has been made since then I'm
going to right click on the name of the
project in github and say open in Adam
because github application and Adam a
text editor are both made by github
company they kind of like work well
together also we're going to need our
terminal so let me just open that up and
the first thing we can do is just CD
into our project file which is a CD
desktop design and code and now that
we're in the project file remember we
can just use gulp and it'll set up a
browser sync and everything and the
server bars by typing gulp great now the
tasks are running and we're going to see
a browser just pop up right here alright
this is where we left off last time and
the last thing I need to open is my
Photoshop document so I can have a
visual design right with me as I'm
making choices in the code all right
I've got everything I need to start
working so let's talk about what we're
actually going to do today today I want
to focus on the header which is this
white bar here on the side and also on
the the grid that we'll be using in each
of these sections it's a two column grid
let me open up via the guides here so
this two column grid and there's a few
ways that it kind of comes about and and
displays itself but what I want to do is
focus first on this
this navigation this header actually
over here and then after that's done we
can focus on the grid so hopefully we
have enough time if we work quickly on
this header we can get to the grid today
and this will all be one video if not it
might be two videos I'm not sure you
haven't done it yet okay so let's get
started what is in the header in our
project files remember that I like to
use these Jade files here they become
includes right now I have a hello Jade
let's change that to we'll change that
to a header header Jade we have to make
sure that on the let's see on the index
file that we're not including hello
anymore working including header okay
save and then header Jade let's see what
we so in our inner file here in the
design we have a few elements in the
header we have the logo we have this
white bar that's kind of like the
background is the whole container of it
that's the actual header and we have
this navigation and I think I have a
there's an email link at the bottom
anyway so let's jump to this actually
let's put this all in a header tag and
we'll indent it in and we'll say h1 logo
I want to put the logo in the h1 and and
the logo will type out Travis Nielson
and so let's get this graphic here I
have this graphic in an illustrator file
as a vector so now this file is open an
illustrator it is a vector as you can
see here and that's exactly what we want
because we want to export this as an SVG
so that it can be infinitely scalable
and have a nice crisp lines on it no
matter what display display monitor
you're looking at a high-density monitor
display like your phone or a MacBook Pro
or whatever I don't have one of those
but or regular old 72 dpi like I have
here so the first thing I want to do is
go into my artboards actually so I'll
hit shift o to get the artboard tool and
then for the for the artboard sizing
i'll go to custom and I'll just say fit
to artwork bounds and what this will do
let me make this artboard a little bit
bigger what this will do is it will just
trim up that artboard so it's nice and
tight on the actual graphic art and you
don't have loose edges around the art so
that way you can be more controlling
over the boundaries of the graphic so
now that we've cinched up the artboard
as tight as it can be to the actual art
I'll press command shift s 4 to save it
and I'll change the illustrator file
save type to SVG and then I'll desktop
find my project but assets images and
I'll put logo - TN dot SVG okay so we
have enter we've saved this TN logo as
an SVG into my images file that's
exactly what I want so I can close this
out so I'm going to use this h1 here as
the place where the the logo is going to
be and I'm going to replace that text
with the actual background image of the
logo but for right now let's just
continue on and kind of outline the Dom
as we want to have it a little bit more
so we have this here this navigation and
it's just going to be a ul with a bunch
of allies and links inside of it so
let's put that down below here as nav
and then ul and then Li and then a
anchor ref kept lock ref equals um like
this would be a bent or hash about
because it's going to be scrolling
within the page and then in the the text
of it's going to be about copy this
and we've got one two three four five
six seven I think of these alright so
the next ones are YouTube mentoring
articles vine design notes contact and
I'm going to have that same a stuff over
here okay
let's say that and see what happens okay
so the browser has automatically
refreshed because we have browser sync
happening we have the H 1 which is the
logo right here and then a and then and
an unordered list with our navigation
items that's exactly what we wanted to
happen also I want to put in down here
another item and I'll nest it inside the
header and it'll just be an anchor tag
and it'll actually be just a quick mail
to
emailing and then I'll just say plus
email me okay cool um get rid of the
tree there and that's all we need right
now for the markup in the header but
what we need to do is style this stuff
first so let's go into the document tree
and we want to create a new file in the
CSS modules so I'll just highlight it
and press command shift P and say add
add file okay we want to call this a
header dot SS and then in the main dot s
CSS I want to have an import statement
that says import - - modules header save
ok so header what needs to be in the
header I want to have the header as this
is this strip here on the on the Left
that is the header and so we need to
constrict this width I think the width
is 135 let's make sure yep it's just 135
pixels wide so we'll say header with is
135 pixels background is white check
that out kind of white background and
135 pixels looks good and I want to put
some padding on the top because I don't
want I want this logo going too right up
to the edge of it I don't want this link
going right up to the edge of it so I'll
say padding on the top and bottom is
going to be out 30 pixels and then zero
pixels on the right in the left let's
get rid of this these this text here and
we'll do put the actual graphic in there
for the logo so what was it called logo
is the yeah
class of logo first thing I want to do
is plus hide text now this is a Bourbon
mix in that we'll just kind of get rid
of the text say it's gone and then we
want to use this space as a place to put
that the logo that we just saved as an
SVG okay
let's say background-image:url and we
have to do the path to the SVG so it's
assets images logo - TN SVG that's it
right there and then we want to see how
it's repeating here it's just kind of
rude to do to do repeat no - repeat and
n position center Center if you put
Center only once not Center center it'll
Center top and bottom and then we want
to have the size something called
contain which means that it will grow to
be as tall or as wide as it can
whichever one comes first I just want to
see the dimensions of this so I'll say
color pink okay so you can see what I
said about the height if I make this
height here like 80 pixels see how the
logo itself will grow - to match the
height of the box but if I grow it to
200 pixels see how the logo stops being
tall is 200 and starts being only as
wide as 135 which is the max width of
the container access the math max width
of the parent so that's what um
background size contain does we can get
rid of height 200 pixels I think let's
just put at 80 I look like a good size
all right and because it's a logo which
is an h1 element it has default padding
and stuff so let's take take all that
off padding:0 margin:0 and it should
shrink up there you go okay so now we
just have the 30 pixels of the navigate
of the header top then the logo and then
the navigation so everything's a little
bit more tight right now and we can
start applying dimensions to things as
needed now I just realized that we put
header as a an element tag but you know
there's going to be header elements in
other pages so we want to scope this
header to be a little bit more specific
to the home page how do we do that let's
go to index and we'll put a class around
like everything that's going to be on
this page home - rep now because we have
that we could say dot home - rep space
header now this is going to be only the
header on the home page and I like that
a lot more in addition to that we have
this element this navigation element I
don't want it to be only the I mean I
don't want this when I select it with
CSS I don't want it to be all of the
navigations ever used on any page I just
wanted to be a home navigation it's very
specific down the left hand side I don't
want that to be on every page as well so
what I want to do is take that and say
it's just the site nav but an extra
class on that so that when I go into my
CSS I can say dot site nav and call it
by its class not by its element name so
it won't be confused later on so for
site nav I want to target the UL inside
of it and I'll say list-style:none
and then that will take away those
bullet points we also need to take away
the the margin and padding
I do want margin on the top though
so say margin 20 pixels on the top left
and right at zero good and hmm the
padding should be zero good let's text
the line these all to the right and then
give them back a little bit of that
padding so I want it to be zero 20
pixels on the right bottom left zero
there we go now that 20 pixels is lining
up really nice right here with that logo
and that makes me a happy guy and get
rid of that pink though cool so we need
to identify the list items with inside
the UL and just give them some margin
bottom 20 no 10 yeah and we'll say list
item and the last child margin bottom
will be 0 so these all have margin on
the bottom but this one doesn't that's
what I wanted all right now for this
email link it's right here emails - link
I need because it's a it's an anchor tag
right now it's just a regular anchor tag
which means that it doesn't have any it
I mean it's a in line item right so we
need to change it to display block to
get it full width and then we can
text-align:right text a line right there
we go and then we want to give it that
same padding right of 220
yep okay so now it's a little bit more
it'sit's separate from the first group
but it's aligned with their styles
there's a situation that I want to have
here I want to have it as two columns
right and left and in order to do that I
want to use flexbox peak and now I have
a bunch of sections that are going to be
on the right right there's going to be
the about an event to YouTube mentoring
and so forth so while I need to have a
div wrapping around all of those
sections I'll call that div I'll call it
home
sections and inside of that home
sections wrap I'll just put a
placeholder div that will let will
emulate all of these you know very tall
sections it's like what is it like two
thousand pixels tall for our design here
so we'll say div style this is just a
temporary a block to kind of like pace
out our our dimensions height equals one
thousand pixels okay so now we have some
now we have some scrolling going on
let's make it two thousand just so we
can see what's up okay now we can scroll
here because the height of this
dimension right below it there's a div
right here which is two thousand pixels
tall but we want to have these divs as
columns so let's go into we need to make
a new file actually go into our layouts
and say new file and call it a home
dot sess and then into our what is it
called main yeah
and create a new important for that
layouts so why am I using layouts
instead of modules because at this point
we're talking about the structure of the
page not an element or an object or a
module of elements within the layout so
we're doing we're focusing on the
overall structure so I want to want to
use a layout template for them and we're
going to call this one home all right so
that is good was good that's good index
home sections so it goes home wrap
include header home sections and then
these are all the sections right here
okay so where does the flex parent need
to be it needs to be on home ramp so
let's go into home and we'll say home
wrap display flex and the min height I
don't even need mid height we know it's
going to be tall but we'll just put mid
height on their midnight right 100 VH
okay so now we see that the what's this
thing called the navigation here are the
notes of call header so now we see that
the header here on the left has a full
height but it's not the height of the
browser it's the height of the elements
in the column to the right which are all
those sections so the more sections we
put on there like the taller this thing
gets and that can be a problem because
look at this design I want to have the
logo up here and then in the middle the
visual middle of the viewport that the
navigation items and then at the bottom
I'll have that that email me link so how
I would do that is I would go into
heterosis and say in the header I want
these three elements to be display flex
and then I want them not to be the split
of you know what is it called the
direction to your row oates flex
direction I want to be columns and then
I want them to be spaced out like us Oh
was it called justify
space between okay and at work that
works exactly how I want it to put to do
email at the bottom navigation in the
middle and then at the top the logo but
the problem is its proportionate to the
HTML structure its proportionate to the
Dom so the more sections I have here on
the on the right the the more spread out
this navigation is going to be and you
know that doesn't even make sense if you
show up to the browser and you can't see
the navigation because they're like way
down the page so what I have to do is I
have to orient these this navigation to
the viewport not to the structure not to
this flex columns so how I'm going to do
that is I'll go back into header file
and I'll just put another element in
here called class header position and
then I'll nest everything under that now
in the hetero sass I'll take this flex
here and put that in header position who
sue should and messer at the end of that
okay now the header position file in my
sass that's what I'm going to orient to
the height of the viewport and I'll do
that by saying position out not
absolutely a position fixed and then
let's say top ma 0 left 0 and bottom 0
that was unexpected now I'm wondering
why did it jump out into the middle of
the road I was expecting it to be
contained by its parent here that is
very very odd
okay well let's just put that wit on it
there so right here that was very
strange I did not expect that to happen
but we got it look at where our scroll
bar is scrolling and our header is fixed
it's not moving around and it's always
going to be oriented to the height of
the viewport so if I scrunch my viewport
up like this it's going to be all up in
here while my page can scroll up and
down as as tall as it is as much as it
needs but now our remember we had the 30
pixels of padding here at the top right
here with our header that's gone because
fixed position ignores that stuff and I
said top zero so it's saying top zero
for the viewport so I'll say top 30 for
the viewport and bottom 30 pixels for
the viewport and that should fix us up
just fine yep look at that okay that's
perfect that's exactly what we wanted in
the next part of this hour we're going
to make that header and navigation
responsive if you want to be notified
