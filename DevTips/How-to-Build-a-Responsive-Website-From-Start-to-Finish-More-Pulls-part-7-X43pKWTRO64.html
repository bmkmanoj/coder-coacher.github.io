episode of dev tips you've ever seen
today unless you watch two videos with
dev tips and probably the other ones
better this one's a really really good
one
haha today we have two more poll
requests I mean I'm trying I'm trying to
do you know the next section but
honestly you guys are offering and
contributing so much awesome stuff
there's like nothing I can do except
just like be in awe of your incredible
work so the first poll request is is
about the linking you know the when you
click on the header and click on the
footer and it Scrolls to the right place
that was taken care of by you guys the
second pull request is I can even tell
you it's so cool uh I'm learning things
about Jekyll because of this awesome
commit it's so good we're learning like
better places to put all of those all
the variables that I put in the config
file better places to put all of the
inline styling that I was doing for the
header and the footer styles in the
background of the face face image I
think it was called I'm learning how to
include Jekyll Jekyll variables into the
sass that back right so cool so I'm very
excited to present these two awesome
pull requests right now
buckle up they're incredible ok here we
are at the dev tips page on github.com
and we're going to dive back into the
artist theme repository now I have
another poll request here and let's take
a look at what's going on aerial Safari
committed four times and it looks like
these commits were all about adding a
smooth scroll function for the
navigations in the header and the footer
let me show you the files that were
changed
there's the about HTML which is adding
an ID about - me to the
section header and then we also have
down here the ID footer added to the
footer and then each of these links he
added a hash link to it so so when you
click on the link it would jump to the
section the only section we have right
now is the about me so if you clicked on
this link it would jump up to the the h3
I with an idea of about me now there's
no JavaScript needed for this to happen
it would it would jump by itself just
using plain HTML tags but I asked I
asked Arial Safari to add a JavaScript
function that would you know make that
transition really smooth so when you do
click one of those links it would
smoothly scroll to that section now in
that JavaScript commit here earlier for
that individual page Arial Safari notes
that this line number two here the
smooth scroll argument this is easily
manipulated by the end you know the end
user you guys when this project is done
to determine the speed in milliseconds
of the smooth scroll and it looks like
I'm Moritz who is our contributor from
last video is excited about this feature
too so let's jump back into that pull
request and go over to aerial safaris
repository right now and I'm going to
copy this URL for the repository so the
purpose of cloning it and I'll jump down
into my github client which is called
tower and I'm going to add a remote
repository I'll name it aerial Safari
and then the URL is what I just copied
there and I'll input my own username and
password now I'm tracking aerial safaris
remote repository here and I want to
pull it into my local head
so yes I'm going to pull it from aerial
Safari and looks like that pull wind
alright so let's jump into our code here
our code editor and take a look at the
changes
in the includes in the header we have
these hashes for links and also in the
footer looks great and then in the About
section my h3 has the idea about me
great and then finally to make this
smooth scrolling happen functions hat
now has some some code in it and this is
the first time that we've ever done any
JavaScript I believe on dev tip so this
is pretty exciting and it's not even me
doing it this all credit goes to aerial
Safari let me kind of step you through
what's happening in this JavaScript here
okay so first of all we have a ready
function this says that don't run the
contents of this function until the
document is ready now we're calling the
function of smooth scroll and there's an
argument of 1000 that will come into
play later so here's the function smooth
scroll that's being called and there's
the argument called duration and what
the function does is it looks in the
whole document for all of the anchor
tags with an href starting with a hash
or actually that that says that a hash
can be anywhere in the href so look for
them all and then be ready with an
on-click so if you click them then this
will happen first store a variable
called target now this target will look
at the link that you just clicked and
look at its attribute of the href and
store it now what's clever about this is
that when you're like let's say if you
have a link a graph
and it looks like this when what this
will do it will take this part and store
it so your variables will look like this
right now we're going to say if this
target has a length meaning if it's not
just a blank hash then prevent default
this says because this the event is the
click right and the default would be
that you would follow the link like as a
Roma hyperlink to ever it goes basically
reloading the browser in this case it
says don't do that don't reload the
browser is what that says what we should
do is take the HTML and body and animate
them start scrolling and scrolling to
the target which if your link is this
and remember how he put our h3 ID as
about remember that
so how do we in with jQuery or CSS
identify this thing really simple
remember this that is how you identify
it which is actually the same thing as
this so it's been clever it's using this
hash to say it's the ID so when you call
the target you're you're talking about
this guy right here
the idea of about an ID that matches the
same hash as in the in the link so when
you're going through here your header
about me needs to match your your link
ID or your your header ID right here
needs to match your link a hash about me
so when you do that when you found that
a header animate the body to its offset
from the top so if it's you know a
thousand pixels down you're going to
animate the the whole body scroll it to
a thousand pixels down and you're going
to do that over a time a duration of
1000 milliseconds so let's see how that
works
refresh and about me yeah that's a
thousand millisecond let's take a look
at changing the duration this is 300
milliseconds refresh a lot faster that
that's exactly what I just can't even
say how great that is that's cool this
is perfect now I'm going to jump back to
github and I'm gonna look at the pull
request and I'm going to accept it great
job
pulling it in now cool
so we've accepted this pull request into
our main branch and when we look here on
our F tip / artist theme we can see that
these changes are part of our commit
history all of the all of the work the
aerial Safari is done so I mean just
show you quickly assets JavaScript
functions boom there they are right so
uh that's it we'll actually one more
thing I want to go into my github client
I want to pull this time not from aerial
Safari but from my met my own origin
master which is a dev tips page and now
I'm pulling in from Depp tip so my head
is kind of up to sync with its own
master and then I can stop tracking
aerial safaris Fork and we are up to
date cool I'm really happy with this
this looks awesome and so cool
sorry I'm just eking out about
all right already welcome to depth tips
once again we find ourselves on the dev
tips github page because inside of this
artist theme or pilot ory we have
another poll request now this pull
request is a little larger than the
other four that we've done in the past
few videos and it's one that I really
want to take kind of a long time to walk
through with you guys it's it's actually
really really an Benham it's actually
been really enlightening for me to go
through it as well I've been learning a
lot from him this is also the last poll
request video I'm going to do for a
little bit because we really need to get
moving on to the next few sections of
the site or we're just never going to
get this thing done first of all let me
show you who did this this is from
Ricardo who looks like he is from Italy
yeah Venice Oh Venice I have a friend
there and and he's done quite a bit it's
it's it's a big commit there x' ford
separate commits but there's nine files
changed in total so let me step you
through what he's done and we'll try to
make sense of it all what's really cool
here is that ricardo has done a really
good job of commenting on what he's done
and kind of laying it out for us so the
first file here that he touches the
configure llamo you noticed it when i
when i went through and i added these
variables in the configure he really
just knocked them all out he took them
pretty much all out config yeah Mel is
now only three lines so that's pretty
aggressive um port and then he added a
new section called underscore data and
this is where he moved all these
variables to so site settings like I had
in config is now in a data under
underscored data slash portfolio MO and
here he has the portfolio settings
exactly as I had them and then he adds
another item menu item list which is as
he explains in his comment so it's
really really helpful when you're collab
to comment on specific lines and groups
of code it helps the collaboration to go
a lot more smoothly so what he's
explaining here is that these names and
URLs are intended to be a part of the
navigation structure so it looks like he
is defining the menu here and then later
on he'll pull it out I'm assuming
through a loop although I haven't dug
too deeply already I just kind of wanted
to wait for the video to really dig in
so he has the menu item list and then
the next thing is the skill list and
this will be represented by in our About
section those little little graph with a
circle dots skill management system he
says add or remove a skill and select a
value between 0 and 10 and then it
displays automatically on the list this
is cool I can't wait to see how he
outputs this stuff but right now we're
just in the settings within the data
portfolio yamo which is like the
portfolio settings page next he has
changed the site default image and
content here we're again looking at the
logo background image avatar and blurb
now these were set up in the in my
previous video to be in the again the
config file and he just moved him here
to the portfolio mo hmm okay so this is
what he's done in the About section he's
removed the face backgrounds so all this
inlining style has been taken out of the
like the face image and I know he did it
later on in the hero header and footer
too and hmm in order to call in that
information that we see up here this
blurb it's a different call so it'll be
in a set of site blurb it'll be site
data heartfully o blurb which is fine
that's really good and actually it's
better because it makes it more obvious
and more organized when a user of this
theme comes in later on wants to add
their
but have been though more clearly where
to find it instead of just like the
general config file I like that
here we're wiping out the entire skill
section and we've got a for loop now
this is all this all these things are
what Jekyll uses Jekyll uses a
templating language called liquid and so
you can do fours and Wiles and things
like that so he's using a for loop so
for each skill that we define up here in
in his skill list and the value it will
output in this little loop right here
this is really great because because
it's just so small right it's like what
is this ten lines of code and he's
wiping out I don't know what sixty lines
it's pretty cool it's really cool he's
using Jekyll a lot more elegantly than I
was and I'm like I said I'm learning a
lot this is really looking really cool
when I when I first started reading
through his commits I was like breathing
heavily anyway here again he's removing
the inline styles from the footer and I
think that he's gonna put them back into
the sass file at least that's what I'm
hoping he does I did that and I was okay
with having them as inline Styles
because I you know I was controlling it
pretty well but but yeah it's better to
have them in in the actual style folders
you know that's where their brothers and
sisters are so I'm inch emic just to see
how he handles that later on down in the
commit so else okay we also have here
the navigation another for loop so for
each item that you define way up here
here each item that you defined will
output an element in this navigation is
this it yeah a little output an element
in this navigation and we'll fill it in
with a name
and URL that's cool and so that was the
footer here's again the same for Lupin
in the in the header and they these two
line changes for the header where it
says artist theme and then the the
kicker is just again in the more
specific placing placement so nothing
has really changed here other than the
place where you define these variables
and that's it for the header the
background image of face now this is
what I would had in line let's see how
he's doing that he isn't used to finding
the background image and the URL he's
using a an inline sass variable okay
that's what this is this hash mustache
and end with the mustache in here is the
sass variable and you have to use the
hash mustache to make it in line or else
like sass wants you to have it on a
single line of variables really easy to
do but you have to kind of do this stuff
if you wanted to be in line with other
text like so so is using a variable of
Avatar path and that's a sass variable
he's doing the same thing logo path in
hero path and this is in the footer sass
and the header sass I expect the same
thing yeah okay and assets all okay so
here we are this is how is doing it
apparently a path management system this
is a great way to remove the in line
style maybe not the only one it I'll
have to do a little bit more research on
that but you can't use right here this
is a a Jekyll variable and you can't use
that on inherited or imported files like
these ones but in the main but in the
main sass file it looks like you can and
I'm really anxious to to kind of so
that's the end of the commit I'm really
anxious to get this out of my local
system
and test it out and play with it so this
is going to be a really exciting video
that's a tour of what Ricardo is done
and really hats off man this is so cool
so how do we get this on a local system
we've done this a few times now I'm
going to visit his I'm going to visit
his branch here so it's RK pasilla and
I'm hoping that's how USA your name
Atari artist themed so it's not dev tips
and I'm going to go copy his URL from
his forked branch or a fork repository
and I'm going to walk over to my git
client here and add a remote repository
I'm going to name it Ricardo so it's
easier for him to remember and then put
in put his URL now I'm going to put my
username and password here so now we're
tracking Ricardo's branch he has two
different ones let's try master first I
want to pull from master and yeah
pulling it in let's run over to our code
base and see the changes that Ricardo is
made the configure file is really small
again really nice and clean and now a
lot of those early settings are stored
in data slash portfolio llamo and we
have the menu defined here with the hash
marks that were defined earlier by
arielle Safari and hopefully the Java
Script is there again yeah it's still
all there super um skills and all of the
all these are the variables that I
defined earlier on in config diamo so we
just took a tour of all this I just just
like wanted to see how he did it's
really cool this is really great so test
of truth let's run over to our site and
refresh and see what happens
absolutely nothing happened and that is
how we know that awesomeness happened
because if it broke we would know
something you know there was a problem
but it didn't break which means she
means it didn't break which means uh you
know so it's a great commit I was I was
actually expecting this to be longer I
was expecting there to be problems and
we'd have to go and do merge conflict
and stuff like that I was kind of
looking forward to that because I'd be
something interesting to show you how
you deal with conflicts but yeah it
looks good so let's give it a test um
pretend I'm mr. Joe guy who wants to
change the thing pretend I want to
change communication or let's say
planning I got I got a little bit better
at planning on I move that up to an
eight planning value eight and save
refresh oh wow
and one of the cool benefits of
Ricardo's way here is that you don't
have to stop and start your server all
over again so that's kind of cool when
you're editing these things where you
did if it's in the config um oh man I
just can't say how excited I am about
this poll what a great great thing so
yeah I really like it I'm going to go
into the the poll requests here on
artist theme and I'm going to accept it
this is what I was talking to him about
it earlier okay I just hit a merge here
the Carter knows what he's doing
okay so that just got closed so now I'm
go back to my github client and discard
local changes okay and I want to pull
from my master and then I want to not
track Ricardo anymore
Wow cool and so now I have the most
recent version locally awesome awesome
awesome if you just watched this video
you are now like ten times smarter and
more beautiful really like you look
great
it's nice thank you for watching and
thank you for just being awesome and
thank you to our contributors thank you
to our contributors today of for the
video I am not here today I am off in
Anaheim for a convention of youtubers so
I'm going to go you know meet a bunch of
thirteen-year-old girls who are like who
want to hang out with was that guy with
the glasses the gay guy he likes tacos
like Taco Bell I forgot his name have a
hair anyway and I'm gonna go hang
because I do I work with YouTube for
like not for dev tips but like for my
job anyway I'm just like I'm just so
excited by the content of today's
episode and now I know you're thinking
like Chou's when will we get to the
portfolio section we will do we will get
there we'll get there next week I
promise I'm not going to do any more
poll requests even if more awesomeness
comes my way I'll be super excited but
I'm not going to do a video about those
things until we're done with the
portfolio section and then after that
I'm sure I'm going to get a whole bunch
more possibly I don't know maybe because
guys are like guys are so skilled and
awesome and I'm learning from you like
just as much or even more than you're
learning from dev tips dev tips is no
longer just Travis it's it's us so thank
you very much for being a part of it if
you have never commented before if you
watched a few videos please just say
