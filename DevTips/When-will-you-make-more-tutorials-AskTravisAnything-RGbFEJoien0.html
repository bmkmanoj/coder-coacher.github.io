Travis anything hey guys i'm here in San
Francisco at the adobe offices looks and
I just finished up a live stream on
their twitch channel and we were talking
about UX design and the principles the
tools that we use in designing user
experiences for the screen I really
enjoy myself and so kiss that if you can
on twitch or Adobe's youtube channel and
i think i'll actually be posting a copy
on my youtube channel in the future too
so that's fun for this as Travis
anything I'm going to take a break from
the ones that recorded earlier and kind
of insert this one here because this is
a question that I've been having a lot
since I started we asked Travis anything
serious or let's call it season 1 Avast
Travis anything the question is from a
lot of different people in in a lot of
different ways when will you begin
making tutorials again Travis that's a
great question before I answer that I
want to say you know thank you for
everyone who has found meaning in the
ass Travis anything I did this to try to
open myself up to you guys and not only
for your benefit benefit for mine like I
wanted to feel connected to you guys and
I think that I've achieved that goal in
in in a very big way I feel very
connected to what you guys need help
with and how I can provide some type of
health in those areas so I recorded 2880
A's in one night and I think it's kind
of funny because if you watch them all
in order you can see my I get
progressively more and more tired as the
night goes on but that's just the nature
of things and I'm okay with that right
now so I just have some notes here to
answer this question I'm going to be at
VidCon so the question is when will be
making more technical tutorials I'm
going to be at VidCon for the rest of
the week right now i'm recording this is
wednesday and i'm going to be you know
kind of out of town for the rest of the
week i want to be i have a hotel room
with scott from level up Tut's and we're
going to be doing some things together
and a few other Creators i'm going to
meet up it's going to be
really fun time and I plan on doing some
vlogs and some you know other content
and I'm really excited about it but none
of that is technical tutorial content
and that won't be available don't have
any time to make anything like that
until not this coming Monday but the
Monday after I can hope to get a
technical tutorial type of content out
the door for you that's my goal that's
the that's the answer to your question
um but but on a related note I've been
spending a lot of my mind Sheriff and
splitting a lot of my mind chair for the
killing it with jquery course that I'm
developing and I've been thinking a lot
about it and how I can make it really
good I don't want to rush through it
people have asked me winds that coming
out a lot as well and basically I don't
know I don't want to put a due date on
it I know that means it will just take
longer and longer and longer but I think
for this specific reason I'm okay with
it because I'll be charging for it I
want it to be really really good I don't
want it to be just a few YouTube videos
that I make and charge for for some
reason I want it to be a little bit
different a little bit more special so
but i do plan on getting back to making
tutorials not this next coming Monday
but the Monday after that hopefully I'll
have a new technical coding tutorial for
you in the meantime we have a lot more
great questions we have some coming up
about gender equality in tech we have
some coming up about what inspired me to
make dev tips in the first place we have
a new ask Travis anything video every
week day of the week until I do post a
new tutorial which will be coming soon
and I just want to say thank you for the
love in the positivity and I know that a
lot of people are finally getting your
questions answered I think the reason I
started the ATA was because I've been
having a hard time answering emails and
answering youtube comments and tweets as
YouTube as dev tips grows it's it's
getting harder and harder for me to give
everyone the
the attention and care that I really
want to and so this is me making an
attempt doing the experiment to try to
give that to you guys so thank you for
your your support and encouragement in
patients with as I you know try to
figure things out in the in that realm
if you've asked a really good ATA since
I started doing this season or this
round of questions I've logged them and
have them in another document and i'll
do another kind of season of a TA at a
later time anyway that's kind of like
the answer to the question and a lot of
other questions of women will I start
making video tutorials again or coding
tutorials it will happen soon and you
know just keep on hacking thank you very
much thank you for watching ask Travis

you want to ask me and you feel like two
other people would benefit from it then

pengoes ask travis anything or tweet me

get those questions on next season of
