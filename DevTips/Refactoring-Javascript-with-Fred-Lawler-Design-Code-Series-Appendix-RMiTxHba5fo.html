end of this series where we've been
building my personal website for the
past few months I'm very excited about
it there are a few odds and ends I want
to tie up and one of the things that was
really bothering me it was the
JavaScript that we wrote was mmm a bit
messy Andrew put it best in the comments
when he said that the JavaScript was a
bit clunky so I asked someone who's a
lot better than me at JavaScript to come
on the show and do a kind of code review
for us in the real world things like
this happen all the time
you might inherit a codebase and you
have to figure out what the original
developer was intending you might be
contributing to open source projects or
you might be asked to help a friend or
just return to code that you did a while
ago and and be like whoa what the heck
so today we're gonna see in real life
how someone would approach the task of
refactoring so we're gonna be looking at
three things optimizing the scripts
maintaining drive principles and coding
style so let me introduce you to someone
I just met
a few weeks ago at circles conference
say hello Fred hey what's up I'm glad
that you could join me tonight I know
it's staying up late for you you're on
the other side of the of the continent
but we just wanted to get this done so
the the discussion tonight is about this
javascript file that I sent you and
you've been kind enough to look over it
for me already and you have some notes
for me I'm ready to learn all right okay
so at first glance of this file it looks
like that you're trying to achieve
certain jQuery functionality for your
home page of the website
right that's right okay so so one of the
key concepts and I'd like to talk about
tonight mainly involve module is a ssin
variables scope and strict standards and
additionally Dom Dom loading of certain
of these objects on this computer screen
so currently what I see here so one
thing that's good is that you kind of
kept up to some of the functional
modularity that's going on here but some
of the problems include are definitely
or some of your problems are most
certainly
how do you handle events so for instance
one of the first things I did when I
looked at your file was I said okay so
we have this mobile math we're trying to
swap out classes what's the best way to
do this so the first thing I did was is
I tried to break it up into a self
invoking function so to start off as
self a bulking function you pretty much
start off your functions like so right
so this general construct not only
encapsulate whatever content you're
going to put into it but also invokes it
the moment this script is parsed and
loaded so what you know the computer
science world this is this is what's
called a lambda function but in
JavaScript you might know these as
closures or anonymous functions so first
things first we need to pass in our
parameters so first things first jQuery
is globally defined in a window which is
just this right here windows always a
variable video career is defined in it
so we have to bring it into the scope of
our functions so to do that we pass
jQuery in as a parameter into our self
invoking lambda function so by doing
this we can now encapsulate whatever
functionality we're going to do so what
I always typically start off with is
writing in a document if I could spell
it and then dot ready
and creating a closure inside of that so
typically on jQuery Docs you'll see a
dollar sign you know within the as part
of the function parameter right here but
since we're already passing in passing
it in right here
we don't necessarily need that so
another thing to note is that according
to this function we have this selector
right here which is a mobile map toggle
and we have another selector mobile nav
so the next thing I did was is I
determined you know what do we really
need for mobile navigation and for this
I was just like okay so just by looking
at your code I knew that it was a toggle
right there so so I did right here is I
defined a variable within the scope of
this function that's globally accessible
via all the other functions to bring in
the the toggle button so that we can
directly attach event handlers to it so
to do that well you kind of have already
was correct by using the dot on this
means that if it hasn't loaded yet it's
going to attach a binding event to it
regardless however in this case we've
ensured that it always loads so whenever
the documents ready this function will
always be ready to be invoked so Fred
what's the difference in doing like the
work on line number nine and combined
with line number twelve versus what's
happening on line number one um that's a
good question okay so a lot of times
when working with JavaScript you're
bound to run into conflicts right for
instance there's no guarantee that this
variable right there which is defined as
a jQuery object by default since jQuery
is loaded in there's no guarantee that
that's actually going to mean jQuery for
instance if you're using other libraries
a lot of times dollar sign is a sign of
something else so technically if I did
you know dollar sign equals the string
yo
that's gonna break all that and then all
of your jQuery from within would
throughout the rest of the document so
by doing this self invoking function
right here
we're directly passing in the jQuery
library into this encapsulated function
right here right so the dollar sign used
in here to access jQuery over writes
this globally defined dollar sign up
here does that make sense it does yeah
okay so everything that I would be
writing in this entire document would be
inside of the how do you say it a self
invoking function um we'll just call it
lambdas but yeah lambdas that's one way
you'll see later in my code that I broke
this I broke your follow up into several
self-contained modules that and this is
for an entirely different purpose
which I can always talk about a little
bit later but that answers my question
for now okay yeah so so what I attended
so what I tend to do next is I create a
function for the actual you know click
events so on
you know button click right now there's
different ways you can go about creating
these functions this is just my
particular style and taste
javascript is one of those languages
were you can do the same thing you know
almost millions of times so this is just
my particular flavor so I always you
know pass in the event because when you
invoke these events it's always going to
pass in that parameter so button click
this is the exact same thing as just
writing in well actually doing this
right here pretty much except we're kind
of decoupling at that from the actual
binding event there's reasons to do this
more control that's all I can think of
right now to top my head but so that's
just something I generally like to do
okay so moving on so then so when this
gets clicked we want to fire this
function right so this function does a
couple of things
first it checks the status to see if the
clap or if this particular element has
the clasp is open and then if so target
two more elements and then swap out
their classes now the funny thing about
this here is you straight-up did a
branch statement you know if status so I
assume you know we're going to say if it
has the classes open it's going to be
true so if it's true
remove the classes open so we can close
it else open it right mm-hmm
well jQuery has a neat little function
called toggle class so when I went
through your code
I literally replace this whole if
statement with just doing to toggle
classes so I'll demonstrate here that
here in a moment so another thing I like
to do is like any variables that are
that directly pertain to the scope of
this function I always like to divide to
define them so in this case it's a
mobile nav and the toggle button itself
now why would you want to cash those if
you're only going to like dip in kind of
once is it more efficient that way even
though you're only doing it once um well
that's a good question
um you know in this particular case I
guess it doesn't really matter who's
good practice you're saying yeah because
what JavaScript does is it hoist
variables up so technically if I defined
a variable right here so right so if I
define this variable here at the bottom
of the script what that does is when it
comes time to interpretation for the
JavaScript it's gonna take that variable
and then shove it up top so then it's
gonna become you know similar to
something like this right so this is for
performance of the actual JavaScript
runtime
you know in the computer science world
there's a very good reason for defining
your variables up top because if you
think about it you can't access memory
if you don't have it defined it is one
way to you know look at it
so what javascript does is and hoist
those variables up to the top so that
way it's saying okay let's define what
we're gonna put here in memory first
before we access it because otherwise
you're gonna get nasty JavaScript errors
of you know XY and z is of type
undefined because well it hasn't been
defined right so you know it's always
good practice to define your variables
first but also it's worth noting that if
you're not careful with and this is a
huge issue with JavaScript in my opinion
but if you're not careful with scope you
have the potential of overriding
overriding variables accidentally by
sheer hoisting alone so if I defined
food down below right and I named it
like instead of named naming it bar
defining it as bar and I named it as say
my name Fred there's a potential for
food to be overwritten with Fred if it
just happens to hoist it below the
current definition of foo which is fine
if that's what you're expecting but but
what if that happens before what if it
wasted up before foo or if who is equal
to Fred and you need it to be Fred but
instead it's bar right so you know
hoisting you never know what the orders
gonna be for your variables so it's
always good practice to define them up
top and then also you know for the same
reason that you know JavaScript does
define all their variables up top this
is the same reason why we're gonna do it
here you know we have to have it defined
before we can access it right right so
that's what we're just going to do right
here what I did next in regards to doing
the events I just you know did I
shouldn't have said you know but
is open well can you guess what that
does yeah taqwa class is a jQuery a
function that will check and see if the
thing the element has that class in this
case is open and if it does it will
remove it and if it does not it will add
it mm-hmm
so that's correct so we replaced these
lines of code with simply selectors dog
classes open so yes you'll lose some bit
of control by removing the the branching
statement which is an if function or not
function if statement but at the same
time though we're looking for you know
efficiencies at this point so this is
one way to be more efficient with your
jQuery is to really know what function
does the job you're trying to do and in
this particular case what we're trying
to do is we're going to say okay on this
click find our selectors right and they
just all go classes open up it might in
my actual code review I broke it down a
little bit further so another thing I do
is I like to define if I'm referring to
the element that's invoking this this
event I like to at the top of the
variable or at the top of the function
always say dollar sign this equals this
so what I'm really doing here is I'm
saving us the trouble of having to type
this multiple times throughout the scope
of this function
yeah now the benefit of this of defining
this as this is that we're not
instantiating new jQuery objects every
single time we use it we're defining it
once and it applies across all cases
because this is this right so this is
another performance boost or enhancement
right here because by defining your
selectors multiple times throughout the
lifetime of the function you're invoking
more instances of these
objects you're assigning to the
variables therefore using up more memory
so I always like to define this at least
four events mostly at the top with this
equals this so that way I can kind of
distinguish okay I know I'm in this but
do I really need to create new instances
of this all the time right right and
then as the same below for selectors
since I kind of removed the other class
I just did this dot toggle class is open
selectors that type of class is open
okay okay so that's a lot of concepts
for one function am i right no this is
good that's what we want I wanted to
learn how to write you know optimized
and dry code right here and like with
good style as well I think style is kind
of important when when you're having
your code reviewed by other people
especially when you're going for like a
job interview or something like that oh
yeah definitely rehabilitates
hang in the land I suppose readability
maintainability those should be your
goals when writing software efficiency
is definitely coming in at a close you
know third or second but you know there
is a time and a place for efficiency but
if you can kind of get that happy mix of
all three you're actually writing you
know very good software and by
maintainability
I mean we're creating this this lambda
function as its own self-contained
module and that's another concept too is
modularity within your code which later
on when I actually show what I did for
the majority of this file you can see
how I kind of use modularity to my
advantage to create the set interval for
your little gems like these shaky tiles
on here that's right yeah the shape on
page and that's what that does so I use
modularity pretty extensively to to
get that functionality and then also to
extend it so that way if you ever needed
something else you can you can use the
same code and it will get the same
effect just different results on the on
how you implement it I suppose okay so
we went through the whole basic process
of creating a small little modulized
little event handler right so what do
you think tackles something a little bit
more complicated well so so let me just
ask you a few questions about it
Aquis grow up all the way again yeah
okay so now what I've been doing in the
past is using that function that you
find on line number three as the jQuery
initial function so it's like once the
page is loaded then run these other
things and that's just kind of how I've
been doing it for a few years and I like
it for a few reasons number one it's
kind of like a kind of like a table of
contents if you will it keeps track of
all the functions that are on this page
as well as you know makes this make
certain that they run at certain times
and at the right time how would you kind
of like document that this self is Stan
she ating function is here or this
lambda function is here and that it's
running files you'd break this the from
Lion 11 to 27 into its own file line 11
and 27 yes absolutely okay well I mean
depending on the situation this is
something I would consider as a global
from Pete or functionality piece so I
would kind of you know kind of group
global things together so you know more
global stuff like let's see here so some
of the global things that I've
identified at least with this particular
file so far was really just the the
toggle mm-hmm and then also the where is
that at ah and then the your click right
here to kind of do that smooth scroll
throughout the application
I kind of implemented that a unique way
to if you wanted to go through that as
well sure let's do that all right cool
so you know following this following a
similar process as before in this code
if we just consider this you know lambda
as our global functionality right so I
just kind of named this as blank ad tags
or something right so we're gonna select
them and save them almost like the set
it and forget it commercial from the 90s
right so I'm just gonna do some copying
and pasting real quick just to make
things a little bit easier on me all
right
do you want to kind of tell us what
you're doing while you're copying and
pasting
oh I'm just sending this up exactly how
I set up the bun click for right now
uh-huh okay huh yeah I'll just give it
an arbitrary name
so as far as readability goes you know
clear clear function names clear
variable names kind of are necessary to
kind of describe exactly what's what's
what on within the code just thought I'd
make a little slight mention of that
okay so this is something I tend to do
is if I'm directly extracting very
pieces of attributes or information from
an element I generally try to break it
up into their own variables I tend to do
this just because usually in software
that I write there's always a huge
possibility I have to change it later on
or modify it in some way so having an
already broken up into its individual
components really makes it easier on me
at least to to manipulate work with
change whatever right so I'm going to
going off of your code right here I
noticed that we have a specific target
that we want to add ma to so this would
be this target dot offset right here so
for all those you all of those who don't
know target not offset is basically
saying get the elements position
relative to the scroll or the document
height or width or whatever and then top
is obviously you know where the where
the elements it's on the page relative
to the height I think the other ones are
left and right right I think it's just
up and left Oh top and left okay so it
basically gives you the coordinates or
pixel coordinates of where this thing is
located so we'll just keep that in mind
so I noticed that in order for a scroll
to work we need to have a target right
so one of the benefits of breaking out
of breaking out the href is that I can
explicitly define the target element
that we're trying to select and just
plug it into a jQuery
object so and this gives me free rein to
modify that href whenever I please but
not affect the target at all that's all
I've never seen that before oh you never
have well yeah
it's fair to your mind blown okay so um
length pretty much every function object
array has this length property to it but
basically it does exactly what it says
it says how much elements are contained
or properties are contained within this
object jQuery is weird and that it when
you when you actually print out a jQuery
object on the screen it's kind of like
an array with properties not really an
object I don't know it's it's kind of
strange but always know that there is a
length part to it so this will give you
the exact elements that are there so you
always want to make sure that if you're
going to be using the length you always
want to check for greater than zero if
you want to make sure that something
exists because otherwise if is equal to
zero it does not exist and if you have
multiple ones you just don't want to
check for just one because if you have
multiples maybe you want to know only
run this branch if there's multiple of
XY and Z right so so let me just kind of
tell you what I was going for and and
you can kind of tell me where I went
wrong so what I was trying to say is now
mind you that target at that point is
that is the href of the link you just
clicked which should be a string value
so like let's say your href is equal to
the About section so a hash tag about
mm-hmm so what this is trying to say is
if you click on something let's make
sure that there's something inside the
href and that's all I was trying to go
for it about I mean yeah well tell me
what tell me from knowing that where I
went wrong um I wouldn't say went wrong
necessarily this is too
this is two different approaches to the
same problem okay you know because
obviously if if the okay so for those of
you don't know one way to to scroll on a
screen without using jQuery or anything
like that just by default HTML scroll on
the screen if you create an element with
the ID of whatever right yeah if you
have it about yeah if you have the if
you have a link that says hash tag
whatever the name is if you click on
that link it'll automatically take you
to that spot on the page so what this is
doing here this function is just
smoothing out that process yep so based
off that information I know that the
href is going to contain the ID of the
element that we want to get right so
just by saying okay let's go ahead and
target that now if it doesn't exist fine
we're not going to run our branch but if
it does exist and if there's multiples
of it we know that so we're going to go
ahead and animate the window right so we
do that by simply using this selector
and then animating to the targets offset
now one thing I did do is I did break
the the body out into here I did break
that out again this is for the same
purpose we don't know if we're gonna use
this throughout the rest of this this
lambda so it's always good to kind of
but if we might if we do decide that
we're gonna use it throughout it's
already gonna be defined for us so we
can always reference that within here
because it is in the global scope of
this whole self-contained module okay
and that's pretty much all I did with
that one um the the only the only
difference that I really came up with
was other than showing you know a
different use for how to get the same
effect I did define a settings variable
on top here there are instances and
you'll
see this in my code in regards to the
timer module that I created that
sometimes you want settings so if we
have a duration of you know 300
milliseconds we can define that up top
and then down here we can say settings
dot duration and that way if we ever
want to change our duration we can just
go hey top of the file I want it to be
one second right boom done one thing I
forgot to mention
depending on how your files are loaded
into the into the Dom some times and I
did demonstrate this in my code but
sometimes you may want to define your
jQuery stuff down here the reason why I
don't is because using this self
invoking Rory assuming that jquery's
there
therefore it's able to find the elements
but in the event it's not sometimes it's
good to define your variables back here
but at the same time at the top I have
them be like that so you can still
access them throughout the function if
you're using an IDE or something that
does auto completion I should have made
that a little bit clearer sooner but
that's something I also do Oh
interesting
yeah but for the purposes of this video
we can ignore that for now you guys will
see it in the code later okay yeah
that's that's pretty much it that's how
I defined your your global functionality
of your website okay so maybe I would
call this global Jas or something right
and just include it in the header the
the the page if I could make a new file
from 11 to 48 and then make that a
global they're saying mmhmm yeah got it
cool is is that they're kind of like I
mean we're not going through the whole
file tonight but like this kind of
pattern of like modularizing things
mm-hmm is there any other things that
you saw going through this that
you would you would kind of give me a
tip at um that's a good question um
honestly not really I mean other than
you know just some you know some quirky
thing quirky things with with some of
the jQuery like you know the you know
knowing when to use toggle versus
actually you know branching out and
doing your own switching yourself you
know other other than that mainly you
know what I noticed most was you kind of
had an idea or a grasp of modernization
but from what I could tell is that you
know this shows that you that you
understand the importance of it but
you're not you're not doing anything
with scope you're not doing anything
with hoisting you're not doing anything
with efficiencies as far as you know
declaring variables once and then using
them throughout right mm-hmm
so you know that's that's mainly what I
noticed in regards to inter in regards
to your code that's right well that's a
lot less severe than I thought it was
gonna be oh no no no I mean trust me
I've seen worse I remember it worse so
and then just one last thing I want to
point out this fancy little statement um
you strict we all hate internet explorer
we don't want to complain about our
JavaScript so you strict what does that
do now okay so you strict by defining
this within a scope of a function you're
basically saying strict standards only
so that means no goofy JavaScript all
compatibility works everywhere good
stuff okay cool man thank you so much
for coming on the show tonight and you
know everybody who is cringing about the
JavaScript I was writing helping them to
relax a little bit how can people find
you online Fred well thanks to circles
