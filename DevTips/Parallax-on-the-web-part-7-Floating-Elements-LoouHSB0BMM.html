this is the seventh video in a series
called parallax on dota and today we're
going to be making these things these
are little blog posts that fly in from
both directions and land in their place
but unlike the other landing elements we
did in this series these ones are
different and then they're completely
controlled by the users scroll speed
remember that you can go to github.com
slash dev tips and get all of this code
organized by video for free now I
usually wait till the end of the videos
to thank my patrons but I wanted to make
an exception for this video because it
is being dedicated entirely to the
people who are suffering from the
earthquake in Nepal 100% of the money
that this video raises will go to
disaster relief effort there and if you
can help and you think it's worth it I
recommend that you donate what you can
so to my patrons thank you your
donations are going to an even better
cause then dev tips this week alright
let's get into it okay we're going to
start by replicating this kind of
pattern here by just grabbing that
content really at the top of our markup
and the index jade file copy and then go
down here to where we left off below the
large window and out dead out dead and
make a pasty paste command V to paste a
pasty paste and there we are clothing
store another one another section title
of clothing store I think you should be
different right we should spend some
time to name these things so the first
thing is called clothing store how about
not clothing store at the top let's just
call it let's talk about attributes you
unique style yeah and then after that we
have yang style clothing store or to be
like fine fine tailoring and then the
one we just made down here not clothing
store mmm let's have a section where we
talk about like the history of the
company so say like rich history
now it's a little bit more a little less
generic rich history cool and another
thing we can do to make it less generic
is like change the page title come on
guys what are we doing here uh we'll
call it uh black bird CEO thank you okay
cool
now let's get to business rich history
what are you doing buddy well first
let's go to the periscope and add some
bottom add some padding to the bottom of
it cuz that is too much too much a promo
text a large window margin top margin
bottom 100 1000 pixels alright that's
better now rich history so now I want to
add some you know just some variety to
this homepage and you let's say that our
clothing company blocks right because if
you don't blog if you're a clothing
company then you're not doing it right
so so let's add a section here called
blog posts and this needs to be a row
with our you know using our skeleton
grid here and each post is going to be
columns 4 so 4 columns wide means that
there's going to be 3 of them on a row
and this first one must be called post -
1 now in the post each post is going to
have a you know post title post tuttle
silly bear and an image I've sourced
some images out already here this one is
going to be in the images folder posts
and it's going to be a one dot jpg I
think and then below that will happen
need to have like a little bit of a you
know a little bit of a blur
so I'll say lorem right oops
Lauren will give me some lorem and then
below that I want to have an anchor tag
so I'll have an acre and I'll call it
class button which is a which is a boots
not boot strap what is this a skeleton
thing button ref h equals doesn't matter
and want to be like I read more button
wrote basically read more okay there
needs to be three of these that's what
we said earlier
okay let's look at it okay so we got
these post titles and everything looks
great here except for there's way too
much text in these in these posts which
is fine which is fine I just cut some
out great
so here's of the here here's of the
posts let's change this up here this is
going to be two and post to post three
post three there you go
they look a little bit different now
okay we're done with the markup section
let's go over to the styles and the
styles let's go down to the bottom and
create a new section called posts okay
so the container of the section is
called blog posts and it's it's going to
be really simple so we'll just we'll
just say whoa and it needs a margin top
of quo isn't 100 pixels for all home
let's move those posts down okay
so inside of the blog post is a post and
let's put a border on them one pixel
solid AB and it will make the color like
really light there you go
looks nice and let's put some padding on
them 20 pixels padding that's good
except for the bottom doesn't need 20
pixels so we'll put it upon twin pigs on
the right on the left and then zero on
the bottom that's good but now this one
text is too much let's cut off this word
here there we go okay
that's what we wanted just three three
cute little boxes now what I want to do
is have these boxes kind of like be
controlled by the scroll and kind of
move into position based on how far the
user has scrolled so let's start it off
with with how they how
want them to start right so I'll post -
one to be actually so on post - one to
be transform trans late 100 pixels and
20 pixels okay you need to make the
background of these posts white so they
don't look like they're invisible on top
of each other background white okay and
then I also want to do the same with
number three
but I want to put it the other way so it
would be negative 100 not positive 100
so the all movie in and then when we
scroll up they'll kind of like blossom
I'll kind of move out and the rah-rah
but post number two needs to have a
z-index of you know something more than
one and in order for the z-index to work
they need to be position:relative okay
that makes more sense cool let's go into
our functions and go down to the bottom
of our scroll function and we get this
same logic up here fertile you know
they'll be due the last time if the
scroll is greater than large window so
we'll take that copy it but this time
it's a little bit different it's if the
scroll is greater than what we call them
blog posts that container of the blog
posts then do this stuff make a jQuery
object of posts one and again we'll do
that same style of CSS but this time
we're going to be doing that this this
right here transform translate transform
like the singles better
translate a CSS transform translate okay
so let's work out our offset the offset
needs to be negative 100 pixels needs to
be negative
we'll make a variable called offset VAR
offset now the offset is equal to our
active element which is the W scroll
minus the offset top of the container
okay and then we'll do plus the window
height again same formula oh it should
be pixels right here oh you say that
it's flying in towards the bottom ok so
right now the the final position of this
thing happens when you know the window
is is right here so we want to move this
up so we'll say - offset top window
height - like 200 now we should see it
happen right there at minus 200 see that
boom Shakalaka
let's look at its position
that's interesting okay
so what we have right now is the reverse
of what we want it's like starting where
we want it and then flying off which is
weird and not good that's because it's
negative right there now it's going to
fly off to the right but the problem
remains that it's flying past as I
scroll up it's going it's continuing on
so what we need to do is we need to put
a minimum number that you know this can
can scroll to so we'll say offset
math.min open paren 0 comma and now
inside of that we'll put this little
formula and we'll close the print and
what that says is that it won't let
offset be larger than 0 so it will float
in and then stop right there let's
increase this number so we can see more
of this animation cool I'm a fan of that
will do it for host 2 as well they look
silly we only need to you actually for
post 3 that's the one we wanted but we
don't want post 3 to come in off the
from the left we wanted to come in from
the right so so what we want to do on
post 3 is take this offset and again
throw some math on it this time we'll
use abs which is absolute so instead of
being negative we'll make it positive so
it'll be coming in from the right and
meeting in the center OOP we have some
sound-effects kind of like epic now
let's raise them up a little bit as well
and we'll do the same thing as right
here
translate plus plus plus all that stuff
right there
so we remove xx pics and put math
absolute offset now it will fly in I
mess up something that there oh I need
to add pixels that's what it was great
now it'll come up to an angle but it'll
end exactly horizontal at the top it's
coming at to sharpen angle it's like a
40 degree angle it's just linear we can
offset that by like multiplying this
like let's say multiplied by 0.5 and now
it'll no longer be 45 degrees no more
like a so whatever degree is that is
that's nice
0.2 okay I want that same thing for this
other one so 20 pixels gets replaced
with this which is pixels and that looks
good okay and they all float up to meet
it in the middle looks good I like this
one a little blog e post there as you're
scrolling up they find view and and I
like it I really like things that are
controlled by the users scroll instead
of just triggered like these ones up
here before because these are these will
never be as exciting as they were that
one moment and if you miss them it gone
but these ones here like the the promo
scope and these blog posts flying into
view it's a lot more fun I think for the
user it's fun for me anyway
and I hope it was fun for you too this
video of course would not be possible
without my patience these people have
gone to patreon.com
pledged a dollar amount of their own
choosing
they give videos early and sometimes I
even help them pick out what to wear for
an upcoming interview again 100% of the
money that this video raises will be
sent to
to relief efforts for those suffering
from the earthquake in Nepal all right
that's it for this week we have another
paralax video coming up next week and
until then keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
