everyone welcome to dev tips my name is
Travis no it's is live now okay I got it
out it lists there's a lot over here
yeah well I'm not sure exactly when the
recording started so this is all this is
all part of the recording right now
alright what's up everyone my name is
Travis and this is dev tips we actually
have a really special video for you
today an unexpected one I got an email
from a from a good good friend of the
show Brian Jones who's been a friend of
the show for a while and we've never
would never had you on say hello Brian
hey everyone I'm Brian yeah so now how
is he a friend of the show well I of
course use code kit an application that
allows me to have a developer
environment really easily set up on my
local machine and they use that when I'm
doing a lot of a lot of the code
tutorials that I do and Brian is the
independent developer he's the creator
of code kit and Brian sent me an email
and said hey Travis we've done a few
things in the past he's given away some
code kit licenses I've done some
tutorials just all because all because I
really appreciate what you do and the
way that you do it and when I had a
chance to just bring Brian on the show
to talk for a little bit that's a really
good idea so we're gonna have a special
episode right in the middle of the week
well thank you very much for uh for
having me
man it's a delight I've been following
you no code kit ever since even before
code kill one before when it was just
about mmm it was just less right low
less app yeah it started out as just an
app that processed less files that's all
it did yeah how many years there's been
like five or six years oh man let's see
I started writing that less dot app
there it started as a plugin for Kota
and then you know everybody was like hey
I don't use coda I use this other thing
what can I can I get a plug-in for that
so I wrote that app and let's see that
started back in 2008 yeah predates this
node and and all the other stuff that's
come since then yeah it's been a long
time it's been a while yeah and it looks
like it's been working out for you
you're able to sustain yourself as an
independent developer so far yeah I've
been been very lucky I have
really great customers that that let me
not have a real job I thought I like the
way you think about it if I correct me
if I'm wrong but you went down to
California for an internship or like a
summer kind of yeah so I actually I grew
up on the East Coast and then moved out
here for grad school I came out to get
my MBA and I was gonna be a kind of a
consultant really you know one of the I
don't know how much profanity is allowed
on the show but one of those douche bag
you see run around in suits and ties and
you know like the yuppies I was gonna do
that which is you know just a tragic
life choice okay and on nights and
weekends I started teaching myself to
code and you know built code kit instead
of doing an internship and got yelled at
by like all of my professors and
advisers and stuff and yeah managed to
turn that into a job so I got again very
lucky yeah I think that's a really great
success story in that somebody can you
know find a way through all of these
options that are out there and find a
way to make themselves viable and a
pretty crowded and pretty saturated
market oh yeah I'm a really big believer
that at no other time in history have
you really had all of the options and
abilities that you do right now that
that tech provides right if you're
willing to sit down and just learn you
know how to code or develop things you
know there's no end to what you can do
and think about the guys you know like a
hundred years ago if you wanted to make
your own way in the world you pretty
much had to be like a rockefeller or you
know what have you or have some access
to capital right now all you need is is
a crappy hundred dollar notebook and you
know iTunes U which is all free that's
that's really cool I really love that I
love that ethic that approach to things
so let's talk about what you're doing
lately you email me because you just
recently launched code kit three yeah
yeah whole new version of yet yeah yeah
so um like I said we've used code kit on
the channel dozens and dozens of times
most of the demos that I do are using
code kit and there's also specific
videos on the channel about code kit so
you guys watching it
if you're curious like what exactly are
they talking about go go check out those
videos they're about coca specifically
but let's talk about the update what are
the big changes what's the big release
about yeah so for a long time you know
web development was kind of done on a
very simple basis she had a folder and
he had some files in it and then you
would modify those files you know you
would write your CSS and your HTML and
you would upload it to a web server and
then stuff like sass came along you know
and and when you start using just one of
those things you know you might just put
your sass file next to your CSS file in
the same you know subdirectory of your
site and then when you go to upload you
just tell your FTP client hey ignore the
sass files all I need are the CSS files
right well over time that's gotten more
and more complicated right because now
we have like Java Script that combines
with CoffeeScript and you got 80 files
that get merged into one
you got bower components everywhere so
you got all this stuff and so what's
involved kind of over the last few years
has been the idea of building a website
the way that you would build like an
application like code kit itself right
you take your source files you process
them all into a separate folder and then
that's all nice and clean so you can
upload it to the web and the major
feature of 3.0 is first-class support
for that whole modern workflow and by
that I mean you can take a project that
you've been using for years without a
bill folder check one box in code kit 3
and then all of a sudden everything will
just compile the way it should with the
right output paths to a build folder
that's nice and clean and then you just
upload that in in an FTP client or
deploy it however you know you're going
to deploy your site so the whole build
process is is the major new feature of
3.0 aside from you know lots of stuff
like little additions es land babble for
transpiling writing future JavaScript
today whole freaking idea but hey let's
do it and you know all of that stuff is
now built in so it has support for
modern you know more I guess advanced
kind of web development workflows and
but that the build process is is really
the big tempo feature I noticed when I
was looking at the code kit 3 website
that there's new extensibility built in
so yeah you're claiming that any
language can be
is now in Kok it if you just add it
basically so the way it works is code
kit you know gives you a basic set of
options for every kind of file right
where where does the file go when it
gets processed what's its output path
and what do you want to do with it do
you want to just copy it you want to
ignore it
you know you might skip you know certain
files in your project or should it be
processed and previously code could only
supported the languages that I add to it
manually and now you can go in there and
say hey I got a file it's extension is
dot ABC and when it changes I want you
to process it to this you know name it
the same thing but give it the extension
XYZ and put it in this folder and then
you just tell code kit alright how do i
process that file you give it a little
script like you would at a command line
or in a grunt file window file and say
hey this is what I want you to do with
ABC files when they change and that's
all very nicely baked in there with a
nice visual editor and you just copy and
paste your your little script and
usually it's going to be something like
you know run this command line tool and
and compile ABC files so you can do that
with all kinds of stuff handlebars would
be a great example if you use mustache
or you know templating systems like that
you can now tell code kid hey when my
dot HB files change just process um
using this script and and the the
browser refreshing and everything else
just works like it should well that's
awesome yeah speaking of custom
languages or languages that you know you
make a baby see how are you still
supporting kit yeah absolutely it
actually got a bunch of new features in
in 3.0 I had mainly because when my
designer I the guy that builds my
website is guy Meyer he's fantastic and
he also does the the visual design of
the app and the website and all of that
we were building the website together
and he was like hey this is a real pain
in the ass and I was like man if only I
knew the guy that handled this language
let's take care of this so we ended up
adding like four features of the
language just to build the code kit
website that's awesome
yeah it was my kid kid is still very
widely supported and actually it really
surprises me how many people have
adopted it and used it you know I
thought man knew this will be a handful
of people but it's actually you know I
get a pretty wide
I mean just based on my emails pretty
wide assortment of folks that use it and
like it yeah
really quickly tell everybody what kid
is and what it's for oh yeah so kit is a
custom language in code kit and I really
I got to say upfront it's not meant to
tie you to the app it's also open
sourced and there's like a node module
that you can install to compile it if
you don't want to use my app but all it
does is it adds some special comments
and import statements to HTML files so
you just write your HTML file and you
know say you want to bring in like a nav
menu right you know you put your nav
menu in another HTML file and then you
just import it into each you know sub
HTML file that's that's part of your
website and you can use variables too so
you know you can declare a variable
right in your HTML and then use it in in
any subsequent part of your code and 3.0
has optional variables they're actually
modeled after Swift and basically they
let you very easily do stuff like active
States on nav menus based on you know
which page you're on that's always been
kind of a pain and that makes it really
simple and easy to do it so yeah it just
adds variables and import statements to
to HTML files that's awesome and it's
really cool that like you updated the
language or made it more robust just for
your own needs so it's exactly it's it's
dog food the whole code kit website is
just all kit files right so speaking of
the code kit website it was designed by
you just said it minutes ago yeah guy
Meyer he's a friend of mine here in San
Diego and a really really great designer
and a good friend so he's the one that
builds the actual site and then I write
the content so if you have issues with
my my content definitely email guy he
loves he loves that the the what do they
call like when you get a quotation like
a like a customer quote you know or oh
yeah yeah those have always been a treat
so you guys watching at home go to the
code kit it's cookie app calm right yeah
it is yeah my favorite this time around
were Syria actually force it out of her
but turns out she's a big fan yet yeah
so tell me about working with guy Meier
is this the first time you've you've
worked with the designer on the design
of the app and the website no so guy
came on board for code kit - okay which
was back in 2014 although we started
working on it in I don't know like 1979
that took forever to get it out of the
door but no working with guy has has
been great the only problem that we ever
have is is get because we're both kind
of get started and get for us we just
there there are always challenges when
we when we get down to using get
together but otherwise no working with a
designer is definitely the way to go if
you're out there and you're wondering
like oh should I hire designer do it all
on my own if you have the the resources
to do it you know if it makes sense
definitely hire the designer it's it's
totally worth it yeah that's that's
really good advice I I've always been
impressed with the way that you approach
design I remember reading like in a few
different places the way that you look
up to panic the company software
developers and like Lee you're often
talking about like your ultimate goal is
to try to beat them make it better out
what is it about panic software that
you'll you that you admire so much um
I the thing that it's hard to quantify
really but it's kind of panics whole
ethos of software development right they
they take this view that it should be
something that is a magical and pleasant
experience and their apps are just they
flow really well they are joy to use
there's all kinds of the the little
things that you discover as you go that
make you go oh man whoever whoever did
this really knew their stuff right it's
like there's a saying that luxury
products are a series of small delights
right small surprises and I find that in
panics apps right and and it's it's such
small details like I want to I want to
configure something so I just I drag you
know an image or something to where I
want it to drop to and it responds right
it knows what I'm doing and in code kit
I've tried as much as I can to do that
as well like if you want to set a custom
project icon all you gotta do is drag an
image and draw
but where the stupid icon is right it
just works but yeah that is not you
don't get that for free you have to
consciously make the choice to address
those little details and things and like
in in Prior versions of Coke it it
doesn't anymore because build folders
are a technical nightmare but used to be
that if you renamed an output file in
the finder right the app would keep up
and just update the output path of
whatever file creates that right you
rename your CSS file it'll go find your
sass file and say okay this is the new
output path you know little details like
that that you just a lot of times you
don't even notice them because they just
make the work so fluid and easy that's
what I see in in in panic software and
and just the attention to detail and
that that really carrying about the
users and and and how their experience
is you know that's awesome that's what I
try to me like yeah I mean that that's
something that we as designers we look
at that kind of stuff all the time it
sounds like you have a very very very
close eye on the design and even though
you're working with a professional
designer yeah yeah he definitely wishes
I was less opinionated I mean it might
make the work go faster but like it you
ever remember X we uh we spent literally
two months arguing back and forth about
the size of check boxes down to like
should they be one pixel larger in
dimension that was a two-month debate
but I won yeah we got larger check boxes
but I won that's all that matters
let me ask you this during your time as
an independent software developer was
one thing that you've learned that is
like kind of surprised you the most yeah
um god there are so many so many things
that I could go down here with but you
know the thing that surprised me the
most I think about code kit is just the
support burden that comes with creating
an app like this right because I become
people's first line of defense when
anything doesn't work and and that gets
down to like you know they forget
semicolon in a sass file and their file
doesn't compile so the very first thing
that happens is they email me and tell
me my half is broken so I end up you
know asking them for their sass file and
then you know spending a lot of time
debugging and things and saying uh yeah
actually the problem is in the app this
is this is what's going on and this
support burden for for an app when it
when it becomes popular is much higher
than I anticipated really so just kind
of budgeting the time for that and and
you know day to day waking up and and
having tons of emails to reply to which
you know first of all problems obviously
but you know that can really it almost
kind of drains a lot of time right
because if I do that then I'm that's
time that I can't invest in developing
the app and making it better so that
that I think is the thing that I was
least prepared for is you know just how
much kind of frontline support would be
involved in the app yeah the burden of
success yeah yeah well thanks a lot
Brian I really appreciate the time you
spend with us this evening to chat about
the work you've been doing I understand
we have some some code kit licenses you
want to share with the community yeah
absolutely
um you know I done this before where
we've rattled off a few licenses through
dev tips and I'd like to do it again so
I'd like to give away five and I think
you're gonna you're gonna put a link
somewhere down there that'll yeah we'll
have a link in the description and it's
just going to be a you know sign up
there and then we'll pick five at random
and send you guys a license yep alright
um thanks again for your time thanks for
making code kit it's been a big help for
me in my in my development career it
honestly has oh well thank you very much
I'm glad the app works come back for
code kit for we're gonna raffle off a
Tesla nice alright good night good night
