another comment Oh Rama so today we're
gonna look at a question that comes from
lowes evil looks legal ass I was
wondering do freelance web designers
actually have to make dynamic sites with
PHP and databases and stuff or do their
concern lies only in the field of design
and front-end the web design term
perhaps is self-explanatory but it's
hard to imagine a client being happy
with the static site no matter how good
it looks
I know this sounds really stupid but I'm
kind of new to this freelance cycle
thing man like anything it really
depends right so I see two questions
here number one what a clients want and
number two what is the responsibility
that you have okay so the first thing
clients mostly want to have something
that they can touch and change if they
need to
because plan you know people change
their minds about how they want the
headline to be phrased and stuff like
that so if you give them the opportunity
if it's like a really like CMS or
something like that in my experience the
ended up being expressed as a Pete or as
a WordPress site so I've built WordPress
sites for clients and they can you know
go in and change the title of the
website or the headline of the home page
or whatever in the custom fields and the
second way is that was the second
question second question is what's your
role oh yes your role could be it will
depends on your skill set right so if
you're really good at design but not so
great at code then maybe you know you
team up with somebody and you
collaborate together and you know split
the treasure and find a good find a good
balance that way if you're really good
at code and not too good at design maybe
if you don't get some help from a
designer if you're good at both and do
it all whatever you know this just just
it's just how it works out is how its
business how business is done so that's
my answer really quickly let me throw it
back to you guys in the community what's
your thoughts on on what does your
client expect of you and what's your
role in that process all right thanks
everybody for watching this has been
