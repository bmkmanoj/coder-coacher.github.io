my name is Travis and this is Jonathan
Jonathan is one of my very best friends
when I uh not even when I moved to the
Bay Area when I was trying to move to
San Francisco I called John and I barely
knew each other back there I say hey
John we go help me find the place to
live in E and he didn't even know me but
he got in the car and drove me around
pretty much all day that day that was
pretty awesome of you thank you for
doing that so John is an awesome
designer and does codes as well he is an
incredible person all the way around and
there's a little bit of a story John and
I have made this a project a while ago
it was it was a really cool project John
did some research on his family tree and
wrote some excellent like biographies of
people and his family and he designed it
and it was just so beautiful that I said
John please can I be a part of it kind
just develop it out for you
and I did it using Jekyll and I when I
handed over to John he got really mad he
hates Jacko John had a bad experience
with Jekyll so what we're doing today is
so since we did the video earlier on PHP
academy' I wanted to talk to John and
get like this kind of you know more
dynamic view because I think Jekyll is
great I want to talk to somebody who
does not think Jekyll is great and see
if I can't either just understand why
the pros and cons or if I can't convert
him over to the Jekyll loving can so
John say hello hey how's it going John
also has an excellent beard have noticed
John tell me why you were sad my check
will make you sad
well I was expecting to not have to do
any kind of code editing or any kind of
like opening up HTML files and editing
things inside of tags in order to update
content I was expecting something a
little bit more bare-bones
type of WordPress environment where I
can just like dump content in and format
it a little bit with some markdown or
like upload an image and it would
automatically compress things for me for
different types yeah displayed on the
website yeah so you you wanted it you
wanted a GUI back
kind of idea you wanted yeah I wanted
the CMS eventual see mmm-hmm
well there are we at the end of the
episode we'll have a CMS and and a
Jekyll is not a CMS it's not intended to
be um I mean it is in the roughest form
because it does manage your content for
your content is separated from your
design templates and to be honest when I
use Jekyll on your project it was one of
the first times that I used up all and
so I think that I didn't use it as
template II as I could have right so in
the case of like let's say where do I
put my headline right instead of where I
made you write write out h2 and then
your headline and then close your h2 tag
we could have like put a spot in the
head matter remember the last episode I
talked about the head matter perhaps
right
the episode that's on PHP academy' I
talked about the head matter and how you
can kind of use those as what are they
called in WordPress like form fields or
custom fields custom fields in WordPress
so um if I if I did that custom fields
for the headline and like let's say the
names of the person's siblings or
something would that have made you
excited or yes it would not like leave
the logging in and seeing code a problem
literally or is it just that you had to
write tags format it I think it's just
mostly the tag section of it just
because it's trying to flow in thoughts
and concepts and mix it in with like
tying it into the part of your brain
that's more attuned to like developing
things you know like structuring
elements together and it's hard to like
bridge the gap in between the two now
you mentioned markdown did we ever talk
about did we ever use markdown on your
project no I don't think so
okay so this is another quote of feature
of Jekyll is that because it's blog
aware meaning well it can pre the blog
um you can create content with markdown
and it will translate that into markup
so we're we to set up where because it
was like a really early version of this
I mean a lot of etymological now I've
used it a few times
um we're we to create it now I would say
like let's set up those custom fields on
the top which are which are literally
like this name :
Jenny Garofalo like it like it's like
it's that easy right next the next line
what would be like another custom to
occupation or something I just write or
like the like relation to yeah right and
then you could type out a few
relationships and then I would have a
place in the template where I would say
if there is a name in that name field
then throw out this markup if there is a
relationship throughout this markup and
loop through how many names are or
relationships are you can do that pin
jackal right so there's a reason you
hate Jekyll is cuz I sucked it setting
it up like yeah so what's the main
advantage of using Jekyll over something
like WordPress when developing like a
site that's the other sides of this that
we're working on which isn't huge no
it's not good it's it's not you know two
or three pages that are static that are
linked together but more of a complex
thing where we're trying to like
navigate people through a certain
structure
mm-hm when you have a site like
WordPress you have you're dealing with a
lot of moving parts you have the
template you have the database and then
you have the backend where you're
actually editing and entering content
right and these three these new things
are abstracted from each other in
WordPress and and that's really good if
you're going to be doing a lot of
content editing over time and what
Jekyll will help you do is keep things
lighter and a little bit faster right so
so for example Jekyll doesn't have or
doesn't use database so if you don't
have a database there's a few things
come from that number one when when
somebody visits your website and they
require get say it's WordPress and
somebody visits your website they say
WordPress give me this page WordPress
says okay let me talk to the database
okay here's my content let me talk to
the template okay here's the page that
should go into its
together and then here we go server the
Sherpa says here you go John with with
checkol all of that logic happens before
you even upload it onto your server and
so literally when you visit a Jekyll
page you're visiting pre-rendered HTML
there's no database that has to talk to
that latency is completely overt stepped
over right and that also will give you
if you think so number one you to speak
you have to worry about latency number
two it gives you security because it's
not there's no database to hack it's not
based on PHP you can't get inside of it
and I mean other things flow from that
like it'll be cheaper to house in fact
you can put it on github pages of what
we did we'll give you a free hosting
which is awesome I love free
yeah yes I think there's light and
there's also this this kind of cool
thing about it being text files right
the back end is completely gone we don't
need it because we're a little bit more
mature in terms of like our technical
capabilities and there's something kind
of cool about them that I like now if I
would have set it up right and you could
have written markdown and we had like
those strategically placed the in head
in front matter what I told him again
custom custom fields custom fields yeah
I think it would probably have been a
different experience treat well like how
malleable and like I get the Jekyll is
very modular that's good for making
things that are not expected out of that
engine right so like how how much can
you stretch and pull the Jekyll engine
is it something that's expandable like
Drupal where you can just like basically
make any website that you could ever
imagine or is it something that's really
kind of limiting um if it is limited in
a big way by the database right so you
can't do things like people cannot log
into anything
there's nothing belonging to they can't
have accounts they can't they can't give
you content they can't contribute
anything without touching your ear files
and those are pre-rendered files so they
would have to like if you did have
another contributor they would have to
get your pre-rendered files edit them
render them and then load them again so
in that in that way it's a little bit of
little bit of work now some of that
complexity is taken out when you when
you factor in services like github which
will allow for collaborating and really
in a really streamlined way in fact you
can edit and create those content pages
on github
and there's actually a service I am
blanking on the name right now but I'll
put a link in the show notes below but
there's a service that will it adds that
GUI it adds that back-end kind of feel
where you can log in type the name of
the title of the post and write the
content out and I'm blanking on mine
yeah it was act yet it was actually made
by the guys who did whitehouse.gov which
is on toggle no way yeah yeah Barack
Obama's campaign last campaign season
was their platform was on Jekyll their
contribute funds and they and is there's
a really interesting articles by the
guys who made it and they actually I
give a link to a podcast in the video
that's on PHP academy' that hopefully
you guys have watched already because
this is supposed to come out later um
and and it's really interesting the way
that they are using like these
third-party services like things like
like PayPal or stripe to collect the
payments and like you can use things
like discuss to have like the
interaction on your blog the commenting
system and stuff but you still have this
static output of a blog that you don't
you know you're not managing through CMS
or through WordPress or something like
that right so it seems like it's the the
candidate to like quickly spinning up a
website getting it online without much
hassle without having to set too many
things that as long as you understand
them like the structure of things and
how they read her together
yeah like I I think it's a really good
candidate for a website that um you
yourself will be able to touch pretty
often or a site that if you are going to
hand
off to a client they're only going to be
touching the block if they want like
feature pages and stuff it gets it gets
a little bit more complicated now Jekyll
does similar to WordPress in that they
have posts which like blog posts and
pages which are more more like evergreen
kind of entries into the site but but
again because they're like everything's
based on text files it's not as
welcoming to somebody who's not like you
know a little bit development savvy as
WordPress would be all right I think I
think if I was going to do more work for
clients I'd probably end up using
WordPress I don't think I've ever used
Jekyll for a client it's just easier to
handle it yeah the handoff is going to
be limited if you're if you're a small
business owner and you have you know a
desire to have a website for your
business you're going to be familiar
with the concept of CMS and if that's
true you're going to understand
WordPress WordPress is like ubiquitous
with you know CMS's for small businesses
and things like that there's also other
options like squirter space or something
that was a little bit even more
hand-holding right then WordPress and it
seems pretty good to have a lot of
options like it would have been probably
a pain to fill DeRosa in WordPress yeah
I think I think the data relation thing
would get really confusing yeah so
that's right there like because we're
Jekyll is so malleable like you can just
make up the idea that you can make up
ways that things can relate to each
other like on the fly
whereas WordPress because it takes a
little bit of knowledge of how WordPress
works in like the deeper WordPress to
like to add a custom field is a little
bit more work for you like use a plug-in
to add a custom field which is a little
bit seems like not the right way to do
it you know like and whenever you do use
plugins you have be like the author of
the plugins opinions about how things
should write work yeah so but yeah but
like like a
in my office I built our our website and
we've been using Jekyll actually that's
where I learned to use chuckles the bit
their site was based on Jekyll so when I
went into it and started working without
like oh this is how they did it that is
interesting you know like it's it's it's
really cool it's really cool
such like a fanboy or not yeah sorry
so is there anything else they have
about you at all Jekyll yeah so on
DeRosa in particular I'm using one image
several different times so I'll have
like a picture of my uncle that I'm
using for the main header for the
article about him and I'm also using it
as a navigation element on the homepage
carousel and I'm also using that as a
secondary navigation at the very bottom
of the article and there are three
different sizes and it's not too
complicated to to render those allens
but those out in photoshop but having to
go in and like place those in the
specific structure in the directory and
then have to go and text replace each
like thing you know like we've been
naming about yeah the naming and the
naming is all different for yeah yeah I
think well I guess the naming for each
one would would solve a little bit of it
if they were all consistent but I think
just like being so used to a CMS where I
can just like drop an image in and it's
just gonna automatically render it as
like you know mm-hmm a thousand pixels
wide 600 pixels wide 250 pixels wide and
you know they like use those as
different components it's like
navigation are like big header
descriptive images yeah yeah Allen think
daunting there's anything for Jekyll is
extensible which means that it has like
plug-in type things and other things we
don't think there's anything like that
for general but as Jekyll is a
command-line tool if you're in the
command line there are tools that do do
that you can I'll put a link to one of
them in the show notes
other than that whatever the doodlee
below the video but yeah you would like
type it out and how big you want it to
be and then it would constrain to those
proportions or
I have you now I know that's like I'm
like yeah something else does that it's
not Photoshop or not WordPress of it
well you're right I mean that that is
something that it's not going to give
you out of the box the command line I
think is just particularly scary for me
not knowing how to use it I think that's
probably a fault of my own like it's
hard it's hard to place like blame on a
program when it's just like blodge don't
know how to use it
user err yeah suck but you know spinning
it up and like having to like locate my
directory in the terminal and then like
spin it up and then like oh shit or
sorry oh dang I didn't set the right
flag on it so it's not actually updating
anything when I'm pushing new content oh
I have to go find that flag no
documentation right and then apply it to
it like restart the server watch yeah
five yeah yeah so that brings up another
point look like like Jackman Jekyll
because the command line two was a
little unfriendly for people like you
and I who are designers first and then
programmers and coders much later so
that was a huge obstacle for me like the
first night I tried to install it like
I'm downloading command-line tools
forever and like getting and update Ruby
and stuff so yes it can be very
problematic there's there's another big
for you right there except I got nothing
for you
but um here's here's one nice thing
though I used to have to run Jekyll and
parallel with sass to have that flow
right but the new update of Jekyll which
happened like two weeks ago Jekyll 2 big
update um sass is a part of Jekyll now
that's cool little Ward Co hit no more
crashing coke it no more crashing coke
dick yeah kitty kitty catty or things so
crazy so instead of running a command
line for Jekyll and a command line for
sass that group that's actually running
inside of your ejectable installation
there's no more that check will will
compile your sass and then compile it
the mark up into a Jekyll structure
that's very exciting that's also so yeah
that's a that's the new Jekyll there's
there's more integration with these kind
of like services that you had your own
on the outside so you were using
code kit and Jeckle at same time yeah
and I was running into a lot of like
errors or something or I don't know I
don't know if it was the combination of
the two because other projects were
using SAS compiled fine when I was
compiling my Jekyll project would crash
finally 80% of the time could crash code
kicks yeah interesting
I'm really I'm still searching for the
answer I'm still trying to find the the
magic work flow that allows me to use
like a live reload with my browser to
refresh my eyes what I save okay so like
like hi hi okay code kit does that
built-in and so that was really nice and
I got used to it and then now I'm not
using code kid anymore Museum and lining
stuff I know that there's a way there's
like library load has a command-line
tool and there's like a way to use it
with grunt which is a package or like
we've got a workflow manager and so like
after you spit out your jet hole and it
sends a trigger to go and refresh the
page
yeah just hack it bro oh that's your
advice
pack it house just get Angelina Jolie
she zeroed cool he'll do it um my
Christmas wish list for check hole would
be that I get to open my template page
and I can open in my browser and I go in
I could change the text live and I could
hit a series of cool hacker key commands
just save the file back down render it
out and publish it to the Internet what
I want to open I want to open my website
and type things into it and then save it
oh so uh right ends in the website
interface like typing and I would live
and to be able to like grab pictures and
take them out and then drop any picture
in alright so this is not chuckle at all
no so my reject a wish list is that it
would not be Jekyll anymore ever so
you're not sold on Jekyll anymore
yeah also this is on the front for a
different project let's make the call
are you sold on Jacqueline not for this
project for DeRosa not for - Rosa Wow
for for a project where I know that I'm
going to be consistently updating only
the text content and maybe an image or
two in line
I think checkol would be great mm-hmm
for something that has the components
that Drogo has and it's not very
complicated in itself uh-huh but it's
just the management of the files I think
the AI is just a little bit too much for
me to endorse there we go we did not win
John's heart he's not he's not pro
jackal for this through this project and
likely will never be with any project
I'm first
I'm just making I'm making an assumption
here that there's no project that you'll
want to use it for in future probably
probably something where any quick
deployment and free hosting mr. good
things yeah all right like like a single
page website cool yeah fine just make a
single page most I bet at that point why
we have a cool templating system there
we go alright thanks everybody for
watching this episode of dev tips thank
you so much John for being on dev tips
thank you yeah this is awesome uh if you
enjoy what you saw today if you have
liked John's um opinions of jet look you
share them or if you don't if you want
to argue about it guys your you fight
about it right I'm in the comments below
we love to like to start some arguments
about this Jaclyn adds life I won't
gently still and you'll never stop and
I'll always be a bird about it alright
thanks guys thanks for watching the
video tune in every Monday at dev tips
because we do it we do it Mondays we do
a dev tippy bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
