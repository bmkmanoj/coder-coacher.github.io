series I called design and code my
personal website in 12 hours my name is
Travis and I talked too much ah
in the last episode to build out the
design section of this height it's
basically a list of links to my
portfolio elsewhere on the Internet
today we're gonna get a little weird
with it and try this funky ID I had
you'll say welcome back we're picking up
right where we left off as you can see
over here we have the design and we made
sure that it works on mobile we have
like you know the the colors of pink and
green from the the different places
where the images are stored what I want
to do today is kind of just make some
fun stuff happen in the in the realm of
hover effects I just kind of explore
some some creative solutions they don't
have to be great it's just gonna be fun
when I extracted this ping of the
background that the topography map that
I showed you earlier I wanted the colors
of the brands like dribble inba hands to
come through and I wanted to use just
one pin you know not just like two
different flat images so I made it
transparent and kind of like you know so
any color can come through what if we
what if we made it so that when you
hover over one of these oops it's going
to don't go there what if we made it so
when you hover over these things you get
like a different background color that
comes through like the highlight of this
image is yellow so maybe the yellow
would come through or the red here the
the tan here the purple here or the blue
here let's try it out it might suck okay
so how would we do that how would we do
that let's go into functions not find T
functions jeaious and and let's just add
a new function in our list here called
design bv stuff and that's what we call
it let's start that right here
background stuff okay so what do we want
to do inside the design background stuff
the first thing we want to do is
identify when a hover happens so like
the what's this thing called design
image link and when they hover over that
we want some stuff to happen so let's
capture the hover there's the first step
the second step would be like what do we
want to happen well hover in jQuery the
hover add function or whatever it's
called method has two parts the in and
the out when you hover on when you hover
off so what do we want whenever on hover
on we want to find a color and then
apply that color to the background of
the parent and then on off we want one
to revert the color okay so that makes
sense let's start with a step one design
image link however that's really simple
with jQuery we're just select it and
it's this selector here okay and then we
write dot hover cool inside of the
however we're going to do a function and
break that out and then you do a comma
and then a new function and that's the
revert right so let's put this step
inside of this hover and then put this
step inside of whoa this step inside of
that alright so the thing we want to do
in here is find a color and apply that
color to the background
so the hard part of that is finding the
color where are we gonna put the
information for these colors
let's put them let's it let's put them
on the design image links themselves so
when we did that mix in here we defined
two things a link an image let's define
another one called color and then let's
say that anchor ref has another
attribute called data color equals pound
curly color cool and then for each of
these images we want to get a color so
well let's just play around with it
right now so comma and then the color
will be orange for just for testing and
then save that and we have the color now
we can just pull it in with a data
method we want to apply it to the
background so we want to start with this
what did we just hover over and find the
parent so let's look at the dom and um
here we go
here's a little anchor tag and we see
that the next parent is this column here
column one and then this column is the
one that we want to attribute the color
to so if you go up to parents in jQuery
you just write the word parent and it
kind of travels up the Dom so apparent
now that is now that's pointing to the
column one we want to go up one more now
we're pointing at column - 50 and what
do we want to do to that parent we want
to change the background color property
so we'll say CSS quotes back ground
color comma and then pull in that data
so it'll be
this which we just started from data
color that should work so when this
refreshes when I hover over the first
one because the first one is the only
the head alone the only one that has
that attribute we should have the
background color change to orange nope
do you have an error oh that's not a
semicolon it's a regular column oopsie
now it should work it didn't work
oh I didn't put the keyword function in
front of this what am i doing right now
sorry JavaScript I will never do that
again please work
thank you that's fun it just turned this
turned orange okay so that worked now
let's go to this next part of the
function the the off the Roloffs so we
want to revert the color so we need to
just in the same way that we kind of
stored the variable of the color on each
of these things let's store the original
color in the parent itself
so what is the original color here is
the original color for dribble let's go
into the dribble section and we'll do
data equals no no data - orig color
equals this with a pound cool and then
in our functions we'll do the same thing
here except for this time instead of
looking at this data data color we're
gonna looking at or Ridge color bridge -
color we want to look at the parent of
this this so
and this this parent put the background
of parent parent data does that make
sense so we're going to going back up to
the parent and saying background color
you should be starting back at the thing
going back up color the color that you
had in in on your attribute so if I'm
right this should change to orange and
then back to pink when it roll off
orange pink orange pink orange pink
orange pink lunch pink orange pink
orange pink that is really weird that's
weird but I kind of like it I kind of
like how weird it is so why is it weird
it's weird because the thing that you're
targeting with your mouse is not the
thing that's reacting that's what's
weird about it I think there's some
things we can do to soften that so for
example the background color right here
if we put trans ition back around color
like 200 milliseconds ease in out that's
a little bit better it's softer nicer I
think we can speed it up let's put it to
150 okay good and then let's make the
actual image link react as well so say
and hover and ever and ever
let's say transform scale
one point one just one point one see
that makes a little bit more sense but
we need to have a transition on that
scaling as well transition trends form
the same 150 milliseconds and ease yeah
there you go now it looks like when I'm
targeting the icon or the little
thumbnail I feel like the thumbnail is
causing the color change behind it which
is a little bit more legit okay so I'm
going to quickly go and register more
colors I'm probably going to speed this
part up okay so I've got all the colors
as data attributes on all these chips
let's just look at it and see how it
looks it's interesting some of these
colors like the orange very bright and
very vivid work a lot better than like
this muted grey here purple blue orange
those work really well these are like a
little bit more boring okay so I think
that the design works I think I could
spend a little bit more time crafting
these colors but overall I'm happy I
think it's a little weird but that's
cool I'm cool with that we're gonna
leave it there maybe on my own time you
know after the series is done I'll come
back I'm like really you know rethink
the colors but overall it's good that
was fun I like to explore weird ideas
like that every now and then and that's
the nice thing about being both the
developer and
designer for this project is that I can
design in the browser and just follow
where my ideas lead you know
anyhow thank you so much for watching I
am very excited to get this project done
soon come join us
at patreon.com slash dev tips and I will
see you next week
keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
