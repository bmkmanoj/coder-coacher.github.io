McKenzie child and this is episode four
out of five in the Ruby on Rails from
the ground up series ah last week we
discussed the basics of the Ruby
programming language and I'm so excited
because this week we're gonna jump in
and start building our rails application
so I don't want to wait any longer
let's just jump in and get going okay so
now for the fun part I found that the
best way to learn rails is actually by
building a rails application as we go
through this video I'm gonna stop and
explain what's going on and the various
concepts that we are using but with that
said let's jump in and start going I'm
gonna open up a sublime text the
terminal or I term as well as Chrome so
inside of your terminal if that's where
we're going to begin let's a CD our CD
stands for change directory and I'm
going to go into my code folder and
inside of there I'm going to make a new
directory so I'm going to do mkdir which
stands for make directory and I'm gonna
create a directory called Def tips I'm
going to CD into that dev tips directory
then inside of here we are going to
create our new rails application so very
briefly before if I do rails dash V you
can see I'm using Ruby 2 point 2 point 3
patch 130 or 173 and if I do rails - B
I'm using rails 4 point 2 point 4
alright so to create a new rails
application it's very simple you just do
rails new and then the name of the app
so I'm gonna do rails new and I'm just
gonna call this blog alright so what
that did is if we scroll back up it
created a whole bunch of files pretty
much everything you need to get up and
running very quickly and it also did a
command called bundle install and what
that does is it goes out and fetches and
downloads all of the gems required for
rails to run properly and a gem is
simply a bundled up
package of code so now that that has
been created let's CD into the app so
I'm going to do CD blog so now that
that's done let's make sure everything
was installed correctly by running the
rails server so the rails server command
boots up the web brick server that comes
with rails by default and allows you to
code locally so as you can see it says
rails four point two point four
application starting in development on
localhost port 3000 so let's copy that
go over to chrome and paste that in take
a look so it says welcome aboard we're
writing Ruby on Rails click about your
application now you can see rails
version four point two point four ruby
version two point two point three so
congratulations you have just created
your first rails application so at this
point your rails application doesn't do
much of anything so we're gonna go
through and add a bunch of functionality
to get our blog up and running but first
I want to briefly go through the
structure of our rails app and discuss
some of the files that we're going to be
using in this video so go back to the
terminal I'm going to hit ctrl C to get
out of the rails server and then I'm
gonna do a command called let's say I'm
gonna do CD dot dot and what that does
is it jumps a directory up so I'm going
to go back into the dev tips directory
from here let's do open space period and
that's going to open this up in the
finder so from here I can simply drag
this folder on to sublime and have that
open there so let me X out and CD back
into the blog directory cool let me
clear that now inside of the blog so the
very first directory the app directory
this is where you're gonna be spending
the majority of your time and effort
building your application this contains
the models views and controllers or the
MVC framework for your app as well as it
has assets helpers and mailers the
assets directory is where you're going
to store your images
your JavaScript as well as your style
sheets so if we move on to the bin
directory so the bin directory contains
app executables or Ruby scripts for
using things like the bundle command the
rails and the rate command that we use
inside of our terminal next the config
directory this directory contains the
configuration code that your application
needs for the tiny amount of
configuration may need to do when
building your application inside of here
that database yamo file is where you'll
configure the database you use for each
environment rails uses the SQLite 3
database by default but on production
you will want to use something like
PostgreSQL or MySQL later in the series
when we deploy our application to Heroku
we are going to be using the PostgreSQL
in the production environment but we're
still going to be using SQLite 3 to
develop locally next we have the routes
dot RB file the routes to RB file
handles the mapping of incoming web
requests to your application this we're
going to add new routes for our app
based on the features we want to build
for example when we want post we would
create routes inside of this and then
that is how we would navigate through
our application alright next we have the
DB directory so this directory contains
a few files and sub directories called
migrations so as we build our rails
application you create database
migrations which is how you can create
and modify tables in our database those
files do not show up just yet because we
have yet to create any models in our
application but once we do those will
show up here the Lib directory this
directory is for reusable code libraries
it comes with two sub directories assets
and tasks but unless you have some
custom stuff for example custom rate
tasks I'm not sure it makes sense to
have stuff here as most stuff would make
more sense to live in the
app directory next the log this
directory contains the application log
files which are good for debugging when
working in the development environment
you'll see the development dot log file
and there will be different ones for
test and production environments next
the public directory this directory
contains files like the 404 dot HTML the
500 HTML etc basically like the error
pages for your application these were
put here because that these files will
still work even if your application
crashes anything put here will be
available for anyone to view for example
if they went to example.com slash 404
dot HTML they'd be able to access this
file so don't put anything in here that
you wouldn't want the public to see next
we have the test directory if you write
tests for your application to make sure
it runs the way it should
test-driven development is the idea of
writing a test first then writing the
code to make it pass then refactoring it
if you write any tests it should live in
this directory next the temp directory
of this directory contains temporary
files such as cache PID and session
files for intermediate processing then
we have the vendor directory this
directory contains the assets needed by
third party gems next we have the gem
file in the gem file lock these files
allow you to say which gem dependencies
are needed in your app they're used by
the bundler gem which again goes out and
fetches the gems you'll be using and
then downloads them forward this
application the rake file is used to
locate and load tasks that can be run
from the command line and then finally
the readme RDoc this file is used to
tell other developers what your
application does how it works
think of the readme as an instruction
manual for your application you can
really put anything here but it's good
to inform other people working on the
same project what
the application is all about okay so now
that we've gone through the structure of
the rails application let's begin by
setting up a model controller and a view
for the posts in our application so in
our blog we want the ability to create
read update and destroy posts those
actions are otherwise known as crud to
be able to store and manipulate data we
need a model remember models are Ruby
classes that handle the business logic
and do the heavy lifting in your
application they talk with the database
validate data etc so let's hop into the
terminal and create our first model
first thing I want to do is let's run
the rails server you can run rails s has
a shorthand for the rails server and
then what I'm going to do is hit command
T and then from here let's CD into the
code directory and the dev tips and then
the blog application the reason we are
doing two different tabs is because one
we want to have our rails server running
so we can see what we're doing in one
and then on the other we're gonna be
working and writing our code all right
so to create a model we're going to use
the rails generate command so a
shorthand for that is rails G or you
could write out generate and the thing
we are generating is a model so we do
rails generate model and then the name
of the model we're gonna call this post
and then we want to add a few attributes
so I post will have a title which will
be a string and then the body of the
post which will be text so quickly what
exactly is happening here well first off
we're using the rails generate command
to create a new model called post but
what about the title colon string and
the body colon text these are telling
rails that in addition to creating the
post model we also want to add these
columns to our posts table in the
database with the attributes of string
and text there are several different
attributes you can use for various
in the database which are meant for
different things the majority of the
time you'll be using a string a string
is used for small data types such as a
title columns are strings by default so
for example if I just said body it would
create a body column but it would create
it as a string it's but instead we want
text text is used for longer pieces of
textual data such as paragraph that's a
hit enter and run this command so this
command creates you can see under DB
migrate creates a migration file creates
our model under app models post RB and
then it creates some test files for us
as well so if we go into sublime text
and we go under app models and post RB
you can see we have class of post which
inherits from active record base also
the database if we go under the migrate
folder and look at that migration so in
addition to the post RB file this is
what that created for us so this is
going to create a table in our database
called post and that table is going to
have two columns title and body with a
tributo of string and text so the post
model hasn't actually been created just
yet we have to run a command called rake
in order to migrate our database so back
in our terminal let's run rake DB :
migrate so that went ahead and created
the post table inside of our database
and you can see if we go back to sublime
text under DB there's now a file called
schema RB so the schema Darby is
basically a snapshot of the current
state of your database you never
actually want to edit anything directly
inside of here because that can get very
messy you want to manage your scheme and
dot RB through the use of migration
files alright so now we have our model
setup but we need a way to interact with
it so for that we're going to do a
controller and we're also going to
create
a view at the same time so remember the
controller is what lives between your
model and your view the controller gets
data from the model and then renders it
to the view so we can generate a
controller much in the same way that we
did our model what we would do is back
in our terminal we'd run rails generate
and instead of model we would do
controller then we would want to do the
name of the controller in any actions
that we want so let's do rails generate
controller posts notice this is plural
and then we are going to do an index
action so hit enter and you can see that
this created a bunch of stuff for us so
it created a post controller dot RB file
as well as it created a view directory
of posts and inside of that directory
there's index that HTML GRB as well as
it created some test helpers and some
JavaScript and CSS or s CSS files for us
so you may be wondering what the action
does well first off you don't have to
have that in the generate command it's
completely optional if you do include it
rails will generate a view file a route
and will write the action inside of the
controller for us for example if we go
back to localhost we can go to localhost
/ posts / index because of the index
action and we can see we have a view
file that was created for us now back in
step we go to views posts and index.html
GRB you can see we have an h1 with posts
index which matches up with the browser
post index so in addition to that it
created the controller for us class of
post controller which is inheriting from
the application controller and then I
went ahead and created a deaf index
method for us and then finally the
routes if we go under config routes to
RB you can see get post / index so rails
went ahead and created the route for us
which allows us to access this view
inside of the browser so congrats you
just created your very first page in
your rails application so the power of
rails really comes from
dynamic content so now we're going to go
through and add the dynamic
functionality and the ability to create
read update and destroy post so let's
begin inside of our routes we want more
than just the post index so what we're
going to do is first off I'm going to
remove all of these comments because we
don't actually need them and then I'm
going to change this line get post slash
index to resources coal in our space :
posts so if I say that you can see what
that did actually first off let me undo
that so we have get post index if I go
back to our terminal and run rake routes
you can see all of the routes currently
in our application so if I go back and
change that to resources posts and then
hit the up arrow and do the same command
rake routes you can see we have all of
the routes needed for our crud actions
so we have post create post new post
edit post show post update and post
destroy so very quickly I want to go
through and explain what each of these
are because I was a bit confused by it
when I first started so the prefix this
column right these are unique routes
that you'll be using in your views these
are named routes and are usually
combined with a suffix underscore path
or underscore URL to form helper methods
that we can use in our views for example
back in our view if I was to write link
to I'll say new post we would do the new
post path and if I click that link it
would go to post slash new let me undo
that so next we have the verb so these
have to do with rest or representational
state transfer a communication protocols
rest uses for HTTP verbs which
correspond to the crud actions for
example the post right here corresponds
to the create action the get corresponds
to the read action the patch corresponds
to the
day action and the delete corresponds to
the destroy action so that create read
update and destroy next we have the URI
pattern
so this basically specifies the URL
associated with each action in the
controller for example we have the post
index action so the URL would be slash
posts we also have the post show and
then we would do slash post and then the
ID of that post and then the controller
actions these are pretty
self-explanatory if I go back to the
post controller that Harvey so the post
: index is the post controller index
action and inside the post controller we
have the DEF index and we'll be creating
the other actions of here shortly all
right so let's set up the ability to
create posts so back in our post
controller dot RB let's a drop down a
few lines and do def new and then end if
I save that and go to Chrome and go to
post slash new don't be alarmed we do
get an error but it tells us exactly
what we need to do so it's searching for
our template and it cannot find the
template so it's looking inside of our
views under our post and it's looking
for a new HTML dot your B file but that
file does not exist so we can fix this
error by going under our posts let's
click and save a new file and we will
call this new HTML GRB so if I go back
to Chrome and refresh you can see we
don't have anything but that error went
away so on this page we want the ability
to add new posts so on this page we want
to write a form that's going to interact
with our controller action and then save
into our model so if I do h1 and say new
post
so let's write the form next so let's
drop down a few lines I'm gonna paste in
some code and then I'll explain what
everything means so first off let me
start with the greater than % equals so
what the everything inside of here is
Ruby
code so our file is named new HTML GRB
the dot yarby stands for embedded Ruby
this means that the template has both
HTML plus Ruby tags and these opening
and closing tags are how the template is
able to differentiate between the HTML
and the Ruby that needs to get run next
we have a form for so this is a rails
helper for showing forms in the view and
saving the data to our database so this
app post is referencing our model we
still need to tweak our new action
inside of our controller before this
functionality will work properly but
this is what will allow us to save the
data to our model and then we have the F
dot label and F dot text field for the
title as well as the body notice the
body has a text area if we refer back to
our database go under DB migrate look at
our migration remember we have two
columns title and body so what this is
doing is it's taking when we fill out
this form and hit submit we are taking
this data and saving it to these columns
inside of the database so what about
this F so really this can be anything
but it's common practice to just do F
because that stands for form so the F
dot text field colon title for example
this is where the data from that input
will be saved into the title column of
the post table in our database whew that
was a lot so let's move on so if I save
that go back to our browser and refresh
we get yet another air it says first
argument in the form cannot be nil or
empty so remember when I told you we
need to tweak our new action inside the
post controller so let's do that and
close out of this and open up the post
controller so inside of here we need to
define what this Pat post means so if I
do at post equals post new and then save
this we can go back and refresh and our
form now shows up so the at post equals
post new
creates a new post and assigns it to a
instance variable called @ post an
instance variable or a variable
beginning with an @ symbol the @ symbol
is what allows us to use it inside of
our view for example if I took this out
and just had post equals post Newt we
wouldn't be able to access it inside of
our view so let me undo that alright so
now our model and our views are
connected by the controller and
everybody's happy
so when we refresh our browser now
instead of the air you'll get a shiny
new form instead if we go ahead and try
to create a test post I'm just gonna say
test and just put in some copy fourth
body and hit create post unknown action
the action create could not be found for
the post controller so when we submitted
the form rails tried to create a new
post it looked in the post controller
for a create action to know what to do
but when it got there the create action
did not exist so we can fix that by
going back into our post controller do
def create and end inside of our create
action we need to write a few lines so
we're gonna do at post
equals posts new but this one's gonna be
a bit different we're gonna do open and
close parentheses and then we're gonna
write posts underscore params so what
this is for this is going to refer to a
private method so before we forget let's
write that so down below let's write
private and then let's define what that
post params means so the reason we do
this in a private method is because this
method will not be needed outside of the
post controller dot RB file so anything
below here is only accessible inside of
this file what we want to do is write
params dot require and then we're gonna
require the post table and then we're
gonna permit the various attributes
title and the body so rails 4 has a
security measure called strong params
basically you have to permit
the different attributes for example
title and body that you want to allow to
be written to our database so back the
inside of our create method let's drop
down a line and we're going to do if at
post save let's a redirect to at post
and then we'll do else will render new
and so basically what we're doing is
we're assigning the create method we're
doing at post equals post at new and
we're permitting the attributes with the
post params then if the post is able to
save we're going to redirect to the post
show page else we're gonna re render the
new form so if I save this and go back
let me refresh and under test post and
I'll just put in some copy and hit
create post so we get another error but
this is a different error says the
actions show could not be found but if
you look we have a local host port 3000
slash post / 1 so this went to the slash
posts if we refer back in our terminal
the post show the URI pattern is post
and then the ID of that post so we went
to the very first post that was created
with the idea of one eye so we can fix
this error by going back to our post
controller
let's do def show and so inside the show
method let's set right at post equals
capital capital P post that find and
then we're gonna find the post by the
params of : ID so every post we create
will have a unique ID and that's how
rails is able to find the correct post
that we're talking about so if I save
that go back to Chrome and refresh we
get yet another error but this one is
different so we have a missing template
here so if we go back to sublime let me
clean this up real quick inside of our
views posts it's looking and it's
looking for
showed HTML GRB which does not exist you
just yet so let's create that let's do
show HTML GRB so if I go back to Chrome
refresh we don't get any errors anymore
but nothing is showing up
so this is where stuff gets pretty cool
let's write the following code each one
then we're going to do opening Ruby at
post title and then below here let's do
a div and then we'll do opening Ruby at
post body and then close that so if we
go back and refresh you can see is now
says test post and the gibberish we
entered when we created the post so what
this is doing is it's a taking it's
referencing the at post and our
controller is able to find the correct
post access it through the database and
our view is rendering it inside of the
browser pretty cool stuff right alright
so next let's create the ability to read
posts what we want to do is view all of
our posts on our home page so how can we
do that well let's go back to our
index.html GRB file and let's write what
is known as a loop alright so I'm going
to do opening Ruby one thing to note
real quick is we have two different Ruby
tags so this is a Ruby tag and this is a
ruby tag the difference between them is
the equal sign so what this does is this
runs the Ruby code inside of our file so
this does the same thing
but this will print out the result of
that Ruby code into our view so back
inside here let's do at posts dot each
do post and then down here we'll do and
inside of here let's write h2 and then
we'll do opening Ruby post title and
then let's do a div with opening Ruby
post dot body and then let's create a br
tag and then let's do opening Ruby let's
create a link to that post show page
so we can do link to and then we'll do
say read post and then we'll go to the
post so if we go back to our browser and
go to just slash posts we do get an
error you can see the app post is trying
to run so back in our controller we need
to define what at posts me and so if we
do at posts equals posts all and say
that refresh all of the posts are now
looping through and being printed on
this page can't really tell much since
there's only one post so real quick I'm
going to create a bunch more posts
alright so as you can see we are looping
one-by-one through all of the posts and
they are getting rendered by our view so
basically back in our sublime what this
is doing is it's going through at that
post variable which if remember it's
grabbing all of the posts and assigning
it to that variable then we have the do
block and we have this post so remember
in our post show page we have at post
we're using the @ symbol because we are
not looping through leaders are finding
a particular one related to at post but
inside of the loop we just referenced
the single post so this is going one by
one through each of the posts the app
post is referencing each individual one
and for each one it's printing out the
title and the body and creating a link
to that post so back in chrome if I
click on any of the links it does go to
the correct post now you can see post
that for po / one pretty cool so a few
things I want to do real quick it's back
in our post controller in our index
method let's do dot order and then
opening parentheses created underscore
at de SC so what this is doing is it's
ordering all of our posts it's grabbing
all of them then ordering them in
descending order based on what time they
created so the standard blog has the
most recent post up top so if I save
that refresh you can see the most
recently created posts is now up top and
the older posts are down low pretty
awesome the next thing I want to do is I
want to use a helper method called
truncate so basically what this is going
to do is we're going to wrap this in
parenthesis the post that body and then
we want to do comma length hash rocket
equals less than and then I'm gonna do
35 so if I save that go back and refresh
basically this creates an excerpt so it
takes 35 characters and limits the body
to the first 35 so if I change this to
say 150 go back and refresh you can see
the first 150 characters I think about
250 would be a good number so it gives
us a little blurb from our post on our
home page and then if we go and read the
post we can see the full text here so
this is coming along great one issue
though is if we go back to localhost
port 3000 we still have the welcome
board you're writing Ruby on Rails page
we don't want to have to force our users
to go to slash post each time in order
to see all the available posts so how
can we get the index action to show up
on our home page well it's actually
super simple if we go back to sublime
and go into our routes file we just need
to add a single line root posts index so
what this is going to do is it's going
to go into the post controller index
action and make that the root of our
application so if I save that go back to
localhost port 3000 refresh you can see
the post index action now shows up on
the home page pretty fantastic all right
we are making pretty good progress next
let's add the ability to update text so
for example if I say notice there was a
typo
the title we would need a way to edit
that text and then save it back into our
database so to do that we do it much
like we did for the create action I'm
gonna go below def show and I'm gonna do
def edit and and then while we're at it
do def update and so inside of here we
are going to do a post whoops @ post
equals post dot find params of ID and
then I'm going to copy that because
we're going to use the same thing in our
update action but this one just like the
create action is going to be a little
bit different we're going to do if at
posts that update based on the post
params we're going to redirect back to
the post show page so we're going to do
redirect to at post then else we are
going to render the edit form and so as
you mabel to be able to see already this
is getting a little messy we have the
same code written three different times
which we do not want to do one of the
principles of rails is dry or don't
repeat yourself so to clean this up a
bit we are going to create what is known
as eight before action so right up top
right below the class of post controller
I'm going to do before underscore action
and then I'm going to call this find
post which we have not written yet how
about we will so we're going to do
before action find post and we only want
to find the post on those three that
were duplicating so the show edit and
update so I'm going to do only : and
then show edit and update inside of
space between those now we can remove
these three let me copy one just to
alright so this does not work just yet
because we need to write this find post
method so under the private methods
let's create the DEF find underscore
post
or fine post the inside of here we're
gonna create that at post equals post-op
find by params of ID before this gets
run we're gonna run the fine post and
it's going to find the post based on the
ID for the for the show edit and the
update method so if we go back and
refresh everything should still be
working correctly as it is awesome so
let's a go ahead and continue on with
our edit action so back in the URL if we
go to post / po / 3 and then we had
slash edits we get template is missing
so as before what we need to do is
create that template inside of our view
file so under views posts let's create a
new file and save this as edit that HTML
yarby so if I go back and refresh we
don't get that error anymore but it's
blank so what we want to do is add that
same form from our new file and we're
going to use that for our edit but again
we don't want to repeat the same code in
multiple places so what we're going to
do is create a partial file so how we do
that is let's create a new file say this
we're going to do underscore form HTML
GRB so I'm gonna go into the new HTML
here be copy this form and then paste it
here so let's save that and then we can
close out of it and then all we need to
do is render this form so we're going to
do opening Ruby and then we're going to
do render form so if I copy that same
line and go to the edit let's say h1
edit post and then below here and we'll
do that go back and refresh you can see
the Edit age now shows up with the form
but it's already preloaded with our
content and rails is smart enough to be
able to use the same form inside of our
partial and differentiate whether we are
editing or creating a new post which is
pretty fantastic it as the bulk of the
work for us
so back in our post controller we have
the def update
action written so if the post is able to
save we're gonna redirect back to our
post show else it's gonna create or
render this edit form again so I'm going
to say change the title to this works
parentheses I hope and then let's update
the post cool so now you can see we are
back on post / 3 and we have the title
of this works beautiful back inside of
our show page let's add a link to be
able to easily get to the edit under the
post body div let's add a link to method
link underscore - and I'll say edit post
and then back inside of our terminal if
we remember the post edit action we
would do edit posts and then we would
append path so we're gonna do edit post
path and then just like we need to do or
the title and the body we need to find
which post it's talking about so in
parentheses do at post and then let's
close that save go back and refresh now
if we hit edit beautiful it goes to the
edit page perfectly all right now to
delete posts so we're almost finished
with the crud functionality all we need
now is to the ability to delete posts
back inside of our post controller below
the update method let's create def
destroy and end then just like the show
edit and update actions we need to find
which posts we're destroying so instead
of writing that again let's simply add
it to the before action so we're gonna
add destroy and then down here since
we're finding the post all we have to do
is do a post destroy and then we need to
redirect the user to wherever we want to
redirect them after they destroy the
post in this case we're going to
redirect them to the root path which is
the home page so save that and then
let's create a link to destroy that
inside of our show file so this one's a
little bit different
let's do a link to and I'll say just
let's do delete post and then we are
going to do the post underscore path and
then we're going to find which post were
referring to and then this one's a
little bit different we're going to do
method we're going to do delete and then
data opening curly confirm colon and
then in parentheses or in quotations
we're going to do are you sure and then
let's close that Ruby tag so save that
what this is doing is it's finding the
post and we are doing a method of delete
on this link so it's not going to go to
a separate page but instead delete this
post and we're also going to throw up a
confirmation so if we go back to Chrome
and refresh the delete link now shows up
if we hit that the confirmation pops up
are you sure and if we hit correct or
okay it deletes that post and redirects
us back to the home page beautiful so
all of our crud actions are working
correctly let's see next thing I want to
do is let's add some navigation let's do
layouts and go to application now HTML
GRB so this is the file that gets loaded
on every single page in our application
so for example if I just say h1 and
write some gibberish save that refresh
you can see it shows up here and it also
shows up on the post-show page so this
will show up on every single page in our
app so obviously I don't want that so
I'm going to remove that line so one
important line on this page is the
opening Ruby and then the yield so
basically what this does is it renders
our various view files inside of our
application template so if I for example
commented this out and went back and
refreshed nothing shows up
so let's undo that all right so I want
some navigation to
be able to jump around between the pages
so we want a home link and a new post
link so to create the home link we'd
simply do a link to tag and I'll say
home then we go to the route path the
through is our home page and close that
then the new post will do another link
to say new post and then we are going to
go to the new underscore post remember
back in our terminal we have the rake
routes new post and then we append paths
so save that alright now we can access
the new post jump home and that is on
every single page in our application so
let's take a minute and review what
we've done we have created our models
views and controllers so the full MVC
framework so we have the functionality
to be able to create read update and
destroy post so at this point I'm pretty
confident that you know the basics of
rails alright guys that was a long one
but thank you for sticking with me till
the end next week we are going to take
the application we built today and we're
going to use the Heroku hosting service
and deploy it live on the web so that
