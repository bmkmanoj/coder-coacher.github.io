so next let's take another look at our
wireframe and see what else we got all
right we're going to move down here and
do this thing now and this is a
navigation item with some tabs at the
top looks like we have one two three a
four or five six tabs fantastic we can
do that bit strip actually has
navigation built into the boot strappy
straps of the boot Zuma I think that's
in the components navbar navs tabs mmm
let's do tabs yeah we want tabs okay so
it's going to be nav a nav tabs roll
presentation class active okay I think I
got that we need to set up the grid for
the nav so let's go back back back to
the row and I'm gonna call this row what
is it going to call nav data class nav -
tabs now it's too early to do that we
need to put need to make a column column
XS actually let's - small 12 I'm gonna
save these naps because we're going to
put a nav I don't know we can do it and
now there's going to be 12 columns we're
just trying to think here like how to
nest these things best so nav is is
going to use the element of the HTML
element of the nav and make it 12
columns wide inside of the row that's
going to be a div I guess it could be a
section it could be an AB itself and
then make this just regular 12 columns
let's do that and um we're gonna have a
ul inside of here
not a capsu Oh a ul and we're going to
make that the nav the the bootstrap nav
let's put some space we can see that
ourselves here okay and then inside of
that we're going to have some list items
and we can actually make a few and we'll
use the trick on Kota to do multi-line
edits list items
and needed to make a nested anchor tag
in their graph so that we can have it
linked to stuff and then inside of there
we're going to put the lists the names
of the labels of the tab so I'm just
going to like maybe this is like an
Amazon store so like books that's good
enough okay so I zoom that up so you
didn't have to watch me like decide on
what to put in these things but these
are just a general navigation let's
press save and take a look at what we
hope fillet we do have some navigation
so to make the first one active the the
list item has to have a class of active
oops not class active and then it will
be it will have like that you know the
border around it cool looks good uh in
our wireframe though we have like a more
of a border like a more of a separation
not just this line that bootstrap gives
it gives us but we can harness the style
of already of bootstrap and kind of just
add a little bit more style onto this so
style equals a background now I know but
some of you are cringing right now
because I'm using inline styles but this
is not about styling and setting up in
organizing style sheets that will be you
know useful in the future this is about
just using the bootstrap grid which is
what I'm hopefully doing right here and
I'm sure a lot of you actually more kind
of used to the bootstrap methodology as
well and hopefully I don't know you're
doing a better job than I am as if
you're following along so let's put some
border radius on this mug and that's
going to be like looks like maybe five
five fifty fifty five pixels five pixels
so when you're doing shorthand for
border-radius here's how it works the
first numbers going to be top left and
then top right and then we're just going
to move around clockwise
I'm right bottom left so I want zero and
zero for the last two and that should be
good there we go so it looks more like
our thumbnail example we have the gray
behind it and there's a little bit more
padding above not like that fantastic so
we have our header and our navigation
and we're going to try to work through
all of these columns and these different
modules in this video it might be a
little a bit of a long video guys I
think we're already at like 10 or 20
minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
