with another dev tips one on one with
Sam Denton's I who say it Sam that is
all right Sam I don't know you very well
I've seen you hanging around dev tips
and I'm excited to get to know you um
it's not crazy morning and a crazy night
I stayed home from work on working from
home today so that we can do this and I
left all my files in the office and
everything so I'm already so anyway uh
let's talk about you what what's your
story you're from the UK yeah I am um um
down south and a little town called
Bexhill Bexhill right right on the beach
no no um I am 18 and I go to college but
college in the UK I think is the same
for as high school for you yeah it is I
think so and then after next year I'm
going to uni right thirsty which is
college for us college for you yeah so
what are you studying engineering or
development or what's am computing to it
I'm I studied computing IT and I also do
photography okay nothing I enjoy I'm
looking to go into the computing
industry mm-hmm and see how does he how
does photography work into all that um
is it as a hobby or is it something
you're gonna like working to your
professional offering it's at the moment
it's a hobby um if I can work out a way
of hello not in oh well there's
something I really enjoyed awesome what
kind of cameras to use I mean I you know
do the YouTube here so I'm interested in
your head up I've got a
SOR uh-huh this is the 600d okay well so
I got in reach I've got a nice little
lamb Polaroid's that I haven't used yet
you've never used it no I bought it for
five pounds in a local just recently
yeah um and look I think the couch is a
like 20 right oh yes oh man I totally
forgot about analog photography like you
have to like be aware of how many
pictures you take yeah yeah she is i
used to shoot on 35 millimeter back in
the day and i would like go to concerts
and try to like take pictures of the
bands and I would be like wait for the
right moment because i only have you
know like 24 frames or something like
that oh yeah hey back now with daisy
could you can text many functions as you
want I guess yeah yeah so what kind of
photography do you shoot all sorts um I
actually I've always been interested in
photography mm-hmm as but as well as
film I always thought I was going to go
towards the film industry okay I used to
shoot shoot all these these little skits
with friends when I was younger that's
adorable have you seen this cartoon
called home movies I haven't I oh it's
like it's one of those weird cartoon
central kind of like like early two
thousand kind of era yeah like um but
everything was like squiggly like dr.
Katz style anyway it would it was it was
the the story or the series was about a
bunch of kids who would like go in their
basement and just record films together
and look totally really weird in funny
ways they would do it
always around there oh yeah um it's
photography's just something i keep on
the side and I've I guess i will I think
um web development and web design then
came from my my fascination with
photographs and video so I wanted to
create and create a website but like a
portfolio yeah yeah and initially I
actually got someone else to do it for
me he offered so yeah go for it and hens
have got interested in how everything
was happening and started tinkering with
things and breaking it and figuring out
how how I'd broken it on your site after
he had already built it for you yeah
okay and so did the whole life ah no it
is nothing that no it was on it was on a
subdomain enough someone else's site so
yeah did you did you revise a lot early
on or just like just messing around a
little bit um initially it was just
messing around um and then coming
towards the end of high school in the UK
I said I decided that this is something
I'm really really interested in and
actually getting pretty good at mmm
so-so discovered PHP um which are
thoroughly enjoyed using learning so
let's remain gig as a making PHP web
sites uh yeah yeah engine did you find
web dev tips through PHP academy' I'm I
it i think i came across yay wait
you did like a hundred subscriber video
or something a hundred subscriber video
I watched that one night I watched one
of your CSS and I'm guides okay and and
then noticed that you had a hundred
subscribers but I didn't subscribe to
you I'd lost you I couldn't I couldn't
find you again and until um Alex I
didn't pay streak Adam II had put out a
video with you on it 10 I remember him
it's so crazy okay and subscribe so I
don't lose him again yeah I remember
that video i did like slow motion yeah
yeah like a confetti in the air and
everything oh my gosh about 100
subscribers it seems like so long ago I
was crazy you watch the show back then
that's cool we're like uh was like
long-lost buddies that got reunited yes
cool so oh so what do you do with this
stuff now I mean you're learning are you
building stuff for people or um I get
the old serve I find people come to me
rather than having to go find other
people and I had a um during high school
the school actually did a live radio
broadcast the other week once a year um
and i did the backend system for their
website program i thought it wasn't that
good it fell apart and i don't know what
a less everything yeah well getting your
students to do your your work that you
should check yeah yeah um and then he's
oh my goodness well
um I part of my course college is is um
project-based mm-hmm so I've had a you
have to go find someone that needs some
sort of application is quite it's you
can pretty much do whatever you feel
like um as long as it has codes involved
under script yeah um so I had someone
come to me who runs a and a revision
website and that he is a group of people
that they bill record record songs for
students that are revising history and
english they build songs the mix songs
for them yeah yeah um and the website
looks like it's from the 90s um I think
the most of the internet looks like that
yeah I know that I don't visit that
stuff a lot but it's just my hypothesis
that most of the internet is like table
based 90s looking layouts with like
animated gifts and like a little man
it's like under construction that's
that's my I'm pretty certain of it um
but it's a subscription-based okay okay
they look at guessing subscriptions from
schools and things mm-hmm and whenever
they get someone paying they have to put
all their information in manually get
the pet center invoice off and it was
horrible so I kept every time they want
to send an invoice they do it manually
it's like every month somebody's doing
this yeah well a school site a school
sees their website goes all we quite
like to listen to some of these tunes
and they pay whatever
Christian faith oh do I forgot the
revising man studying for you oh it's
revising a little different route it's
related but it in American English
revising more means more like have
something and you're making revisions to
it like you're changing it yeah where if
I'm correct me if I'm wrong but in UK
revising is just like I'm reading a book
and I'm learning yes that's that's right
okay you guys thought so just once again
by the way everybody who's watching we
have a bunch of people watching now um
there's a Q&amp;amp;A app on the Google events
page gonna ask questions to Sam where I
we can field questions in a little bit
after Sam gets done talking about his
education and things like that but I
thought that might be fun to takes a few
questions from the audience so use that
app right now and load some questions in
here for us and then we'll get to him in
maybe five or ten minutes so uh tell us
more about what it was like to program
for your school um difficult it's my
lego professors like hovering over you
watching it or like they like to UM sort
of don't give you a little bit guidance
hmm but obviously some of the professors
teachers don't know the language that
you're coding in may be there maybe have
like a brief knowledge of it Nina come
on they can't have a knowledge of
everything that everyone's doing in my
class so we've got this I'm obviously
doing PHP um my sequel HTML CSS um it
was people in Java in the inner for this
is like a programming class that you're
doing it within the professor or the
teacher was less familiar with
you er um this is we do eight levels in
the UK mm-hmm and then a qualification
come out with and use those two that
would be like an essay p here yet yeah
um so we spend two years guessing these
these qualifications and it's not all
it's not just coding your own theory
based um you get more nitty-gritty with
the computer um so how processes work
and all sorts binary great fun there um
edit the coding project takes up the
most time but is worth about forty
percent of the final grade okay and then
this for the final grade you're the what
you're doing like their billing section
of their of this played this company's
website I'm doing the whole website okay
how did that end up i'm still got it oh
you're soooo you're not done with your a
levels yet no okay all right winnie you
done then when Wendy you when's the due
date sep tember hopefully September that
just passed I'll be I'll be going to
know next September i will be going to
university I think you'll be doing the a
levels for a whole nother year yes oh so
that so this project this one project
does not due for another year um I think
we have a deadline for january maybe
okay and then we'll have I all get sent
off and marked um and then we'll have a
theory exam in June time read interest
adults results come out in August and
then we're off to eating
we're do plan on going um um we've got
rehab send off an application for
universities and so we boast how good we
are white white why you want want us and
you send it off to five universities
mm-hmm and they'll look for your
application and go yeah we think we
quite like this person they'll send you
an offer maybe you have to get um 1 a
and 2 b's maybe in your subjects mm-hmm
get that you're in um now i know that
some european countries have the unions
are you are state-funded is it that way
in England I can't remember um the each
year a university mm-hmm is 9,000 pounds
or just flat for any University um the
max is 9,000 but the majority of you
nice half at 9,000 I haven't come across
one that um isn't that is that's
brilliant same we know I know people who
have spent over two hundred thousand
dollars on their education here that's
crazy that's just crazy so it's less
about how much you have to pay for it
over there although there is mantas
knowledge but it's more about like just
trying to qualify yes we're spending two
years in a levels it to the two years
right yeah what's interesting that is
very interesting we have it kind of
different over here it's more like spend
a few months on the test to qualify of
course you know spend your high school
career like getting a good grades and so
forth but it's mostly about like you
know how much money like where you can
afford to go yeah and who you know that
can get you in whale yeah wet the the
fees will go on to a student line and
they all just it will just rack up over
our
um university years mm-hmm and in the UK
don't start paying that off until you're
earning over a certain amount per year
is it accruing interest the whole town
um I don't think so Wow I think it's one
of the best loans but that I'm never
gonna get in my life I know it's awesome
and I think you even it gets written off
when you get to a certain age you know
you do not like to pay it long enough
they'll just be like yeah yeah and it
just comes it just comes out of your
paycheck when you don't have to worry
about it oh wow so Wow so like if you
just like don't get a higher enough
earning wage until you're like 40 or
something yeah they'll just like okay
he's never gonna pay us anyway oh that's
really crazy um cool so we have a
question for you here this is from kaha
lead and he says sorry if I butcher your
names guys I'm really sorry about that
he says how do you see yourself in five
years from now as I hard to Danang yeah
i'm i just i will probably only just be
out of university by then night and on
taking a four year course um one year
involves me um having a year in industry
and so i can i go find a job and work
for a year and then come back and do my
final final exams um I'd quite like to
be in a web development job somewhere
yeah um what is what is the web
development industry like in UK i am i'm
familiar with a bunch of I don't know
about like famous designers or like you
know like more known in our circles kind
of creators but what is it like for the
average person who's who's like looking
to get a job
were there or like do you know people
who already work in the industry or
anything like that um I don't know
anyone and and whenever I've looked at
possible jobs I all ask for a minimum of
something like three years experience
yeah almost every almost every job seems
to on previous experience mm-hmm which
horse is quite hard to get if all of
them want that um it's hard to get it
wet it was probable and one that were
you going to get those mm-hmm what's
your plan for that honestly I don't know
um I'd love to find a startup yeah um I
think that would be really really
interesting mm-hmm um maybe come over to
the US and have a look around yeah I
found that a lot of British companies
seem to be falling behind um technology
wise hmm would even Philippine you know
just just looking around with there's a
couple of companies maybe two hours from
from where I am mm-hmm and I spent it
was during high school I spent a week
with one of them working with them hmm
and it just seems that they were
charging huge amounts of money for
nothing fantastic to be honest it was
just it was um lying a CMS slapping
their name on it and downloaded a couple
of modules for it we don't think that
that is unique to british agencies I
think I think everything out of
outside of London yeah is that say
anything I've had experience with yeah
well you'll see that what I'm saying
that you'll see that kind of stuff over
here too like I used to work for
advertising agent season and sometimes
it was just like really didn't like
you're charging how much for this a man
how much am I getting paid for this yeah
so um let's see we've got a question
here from wasim he says is it important
to get a college degree to get a job in
the field of IT in the UK the you plan
on taking but the general question is is
it important i call it like mmm my
college degrees think he means yeah yeah
i think so i don't think so um we can do
those opportunities Prentiss ship
opportunities um I take no I haven't
researched things enough to be honest um
be a problem probably get on that do you
think an apprenticeship would get you in
faster I don't know um I've always been
told by um people I've I've may be
emailed or contacted briefly then most
places just look for um experience in in
like the last few github profile baby
yeah so they're more it's more based on
merit than yeah yeah that's cool I think
that's a good way to go and go for III
appreciate a good meritocracy thanks for
that question waseem we have another
question from Jurgen uh will you do an
internship at some point in school um
mentioned that your last year of uni is
basically in office work
and second to last year hopefully I'll
give you um yeah you can you they expect
you to do a minimum of something like 40
weeks of outside experience really yeah
it that'll why I don't know if that's a
lot I never did anything like that um
that's almost full time I think work 40
weeks though in a year okay um and you
you have to go oh yeah that it does a
lot I'm like thinking like how many
weeks are any that's 52 right yeah 52 m
so you have to get all these interviews
and try and find places many people will
go abroad looking for things i imagine
that euro you knew would help you like
find placement yeah I think I do I think
they've got the university that I'm
looking at have a connection with Cisco
in the US mm-hmm oh yeah so some
students will go work with them um in
the US um it's interesting but that's
good they're over here in San Francisco
yeah i think i think he is the sounds
from san francisco um yeah that would be
good there was this goes up so much fun
here's a here's a not really question
from a money mud i sorry not really
question but keep your eye out for
courses that provide a sandwich year he
calls it so you get the chain the chance
to do a placement i think that's what
you're talking about hannah's well
sandwich here okay and then we have
another question from both I you which
is for kind of both of us I guess is
koda
also for Windows he's talking about the
video that I posted yesterday yeah um
code is not for Windows sorry damn
Macintosh application are using windows
I am oh no we can't win coda I think um
i'd love to change to a mac um yes
money-wise it's quite difficult 11
they're also really really expensive
over there right like it like it they're
expensive here they're like a premium
computer here but I go over there it's
even as I think I think for a basic
macbook pro you're looking at a just
under a thousand pounds oh that that's
about to 2.3 here I think right i don't
know the exchange rate right now but
it's usually about double and change so
um Callie asked then what code editor
are you currently using that's for you
Sam um I switch I've been switching
between um sublime and um get hubs Adam
Oh is adam i didn't know Adam was for
windows but basically the same kind of
thing at the same idea right um what but
Adam is free obviously is it yes I
thought that Adam was the one that you
had to pay for no I'm sure like i was in
beta better right so you will have to
pay for it eventually I I take no I
always thought it would be for it be
open source oh I guess until they say
differently but then and then there's
the there's the sublime text which is
not free but everybody never pays for it
I yeah my mind's on registered well like
it's like really really low low friction
like right like what are the
requirements you have to like watch an
ad every now and then I don't know now
that I think it's obvious every now and
again it will come up asking you to pay
for it yeah like a little quick at like
a like a buy this don't forget to buy it
kind of you click no and your dinner
good for a month
if I don't switch to Adam I will but
yeah okay so we've got um oh k lid says
it's pronounced Caleb sorry sorry i
mispronounced it buddy um we've got a
question here from meth I you the plays
he says why is it Mac better than
windows and why do you think it's better
for coding that's for you man well till
until recently I've been absolutely fine
with windows enzymes I've started
booting virtual machines for development
um have been running a parallel you've
been running wet laravel okay um else
you can still lots of different
applications for that and it's it's far
easier to install these through an
abundant machine or a Mac machine yeah
um so I haven't used Windows very much
at all this decade but I was reading
recently that it's not it's not going to
be a huge stumbling block there's ways
around it but the command line on a
linux box or a Mac computer is a little
bit more complete and a little bit
easier to work with out of the box yeah
but I don't I but I've never ran into
anybody that's had like a full stopping
problem like for example when we were
doing the Jekyll serious a lot of people
are like how do we do this on Windows
Windows and it is possible like there
were people who are helping hoping out
there mmm um the only the only problem I
run into is Windows limits the length of
a directory so the windows limits the
length of the directory URL oh okay why
is that a problem at all when folders go
really really really deep mm-hmm
just shuts off and goes no so some like
the length of the name like if you had a
really long name for your foot yeah so
beautiful my queen in malden folders
within folders yes did folders yeah
that's it doesn't it doesn't like that
yeah whereas I don't think Mac or Ubuntu
have have any problem with that that's
interesting i've never heard that one so
when i'm a sharer share a folder between
my windows computer in the virtual
machine mm-hmm and if something gets too
long in that folder it just crashes mmm
interesting of trying to I've been
trying to get um grunt grunt oh sorry i
was reading another question do i use
grant um well we do use grunt at work I
haven't used it yet for a personal
project although I do think that I
should yeah now I quite like the sass
and auto prefixing and um uh where minna
Phi's code and it looks quite cool but I
can't get it to run cuz red you can't
get it to granite you can't get it to
grunt on windows um certain things no it
doesn't doesn't play nice i'm sure
they're i'm sure there is a way around
it I just haven't had time to work out
yeah interest am okay so we got another
question here from Stan do you like
these questions is fun for you yeah this
is fun for me it's like a little
pressure for me I don't want to code in
for you guys okay um when you're done
with this is a question from Stan Stan
Van how I am just ok so for everybody
i'm reading your name I'm just so sorry
I am this ridiculously sheltered white
boy from America so I'm sorry and I'm
aware of that I air of ridiculousness
not being all to pronounce anything but
this is from Sten he says when you're
done with college would you prefer
to do freelancing or work for a company
um I don't know um I quite like the idea
of both if I can if I can get customers
and clients I quite happily freelance um
but I think you need to adapt donate
whatever gets you must experience may be
free not while looking for a job yeah I
think that's the wonderful thing about
what we do is that you have the option
at any given I am like if something does
happen and you get you know your company
gets downsized and you get laid off or
something you can just turn around and
start working mmm for yourself at any
given moment you know the thing that I
didn't like about freelancing is that
you have to be everything you can't just
be a creator you have to run around you
have to build people you have to pitch
you know clients you have to like in
like talk to them like yeah like we're
going to do this if you want this much
how much will this be I don't know let
me think about it i'll get back to you
like I never really liked the
administrative part of freelancing but I
think that that experience is really
valuable and it actually does come into
play even if you even if you continue to
work at an agency being able to
interface with clients and manage their
expectations is like actually a really
important skill that you don't see in a
lot of places that you would expect it
to be yeah I can imagine is um i think
for me it's a time I wouldn't feel good
enough to freelance I feel like I need
to gain some skill like some like
confidence wines yeah but of what was
that called the imposter syndrome or
something I've never heard this the
imposter syndrome what is this ah who I
did know how to explain it she mouth
Google ah alright in the meantime I'll
look at a few other questions here we
have a question from Kate that says ftp
for uploading on mac ? I'm not sure
what that means you can do you ftp for
uploading on Mac there are ftp
applications in fact coda the editor
that i did a video on yesterday has a
built-in ftp uploader and there's also
free uploaders so i guess hopefully that
answers your question Kate have you
found out what you're looking for uh
yeah I Wikipedia em but imposter
syndrome is um where you you have the
skill mm-hmm and and that skill um has
evidence mm-hmm but you still don't feel
like you have enough um like with I know
you should you should always be be
learning new things as a web designer
web developer it's always changing like
you learn you learn one thing and then
all this is this other thing that you
feel like you should have hmm I didn't
know that that had a name I thought that
was just life I thought that everybody
feels this way I didn't know that it's
only it's a syndrome yeah I definitely
have experienced that like where you
just my god I'm and I've expressed this
a lot actually in different in different
forums where you know sitting across the
table with some really intelligent
people and thinking like how the heck
did I get here you know I don't even
belong here we have a lot of questions
yeah oh can you see these questions yeah
oh cool um I saw one it was not a
question it was have you guys heard I
guess it is a question this is from a
moon sorry Moon Munn Abe how would you
say that money AB yeah have you guys
heard of the github student developer
pack yes that's why I've called I I
haven't heard of this this is worth in
it came have you ever used um I don't
know whether the web pages hello um
yeah already the rest of it it says it
provides a bunch of useful tools like
Adam github with a couple of private
repos and tons of other stuff for
students if not check it out thanks it
knows it's fantastic all you need is am
an email from your school do you sign up
with that and well you I mean Adam is
free yeah application is free you get
some private repose which is nice that's
like 25 dollars a year i think that's um
have you ever used have you ever heard
or used digital ocean yes the cloud hmm
that will provide it it gives you a
hundred dollars in credit birthdays so
that's enough for two years worth of
hosting on their basic plan that's cool
that's really that's really nice
actually yeah um do you want to pick a
question what is actually the difference
between an object-oriented programming
and just programming normally um I don't
know if you to use OOP well i am not a
I'm not gonna consider talking
programmer your designer I mean like
finger waving yeah I'm a designer that
knows how to code front end so um I yeah
you object oriented but I think maybe
what it is I wouldn't know how to
explain it object-oriented programming
yeah well it it's like the idea that you
um instead of like do I don't even want
to try and not necessary that you're
using like objects which are like like
modules like you know you can use them
in different instances instead of like
programming for one thing every time
stop children that I know that I miss I
was gonna stop right there okay let's do
another one you pick um I was one for
you there by from Eric
hit the select button I don't think I
can nah i can tell you can't cook so
work from eric with the you you who are
here yes okay what resources um oops
it's moving okay what resources this is
from oops no I picked the wrong one ah
well just go to this one first and
because I like I think another one
popped up when I was trying two clicks a
hand with the wrong one okay so this
one's from Jason Riviera a rivera what
resources or what strategies did you
learn did you use to learn web
development and do you focus on more
front end or back end I think this is
for you um youtube has been my friend um
a lot of things I've learned from
YouTube um I hate to think of the amount
of hours I've spent watching videos
rewatching videos trying to find certain
parts in videos just to find that little
bit of code um I've got up like three
books belonging to one on HTML one on
CSS from the pie sorry um so mostly
youtube then that's your strategy yeah
and the second part of that question is
do you focus more on front or back end
um I do both but I find myself enjoying
and back in or where is it I did I enjoy
saying things come to come together
uh-huh um for instance recently I spent
um a week and a half maybe learning how
to take credit card payments music
stripe them and they've got a lovely API
that you can hook into and it's that
fist pump yes it all works um yeah yeah
well that's okay so what
the one you wanted okay Eric here eric
says will you stop using your beloved oh
this is for me will you stop using
beloved espresso and swap to Kota too I
will ya for the for the moment i'm not
i'm not a loyal i'm not a loyalist to
code editors i use different ones all
the time but um yeah i'm gonna be
focusing on Kota to a little bit because
they were just so cool just to give me
some licenses and stuff to give out and
so I'm going to be using them i've been
using them all week at work and i'm
going to be using them to using it to
make new videos for the next little bit
and we'll see how it goes a lot but i
like it so far it's really good thanks
for asking what else we got you could be
you pick one ah do you have a github or
something where I can see some projects
you have work tom that's for you um
that's fine jurgen by the way sorry that
the who asked that his name is Jurgen
troop okay um I do but everything is
private I don't actually have any public
repositories um it's probably something
that I should look into um yeah you
mentioned you mentioned that that's kind
of what wit employers are looking at
right they want to surf your github and
see if you're active you know mmm um but
I i I've always known about github
scared me a bit sort of so I was thought
it was come online based right um have
you tried their desktop app they have it
for windows right yes um i've got i've
actually been using their one of their
competitors app to use what's it called
and it's thermos um it's the the free
the website that you can create free /
private repositories Oh like bitbucket
is it returned answer it again you use
bitbucket i use i used to use big bucket
until it the
github student pack came out I got all
these free private repositories miss any
since then I've been using github oh so
you are you saying that you use the bit
bucket client for github yes oh now I
understand that's pretty funny you
should try to get hub client I've been
using it and like I really like it i
used to use a different third party one
called tower which I think was more
powerful but it was like a lot more
fiddly to this one's really good i like
it um I don't like the windows on I
don't know is it different Isis if it
was the same I don't know whether
whether it's different to the mac
equivalent okay yeah but on github
github I'm just / Sam Stanton and where
you can see all my private repositories
okay we would see have you okay that was
a good question thanks for asking you
again um we have a little bit more time
I have a question for you Sam do you
think do you think and maybe everybody
can kind of chime in this on the
comments or whatever but I'm thinking
about what to teach in the new year I
wanted I want to do a small series on
something I have a few ideas and one of
them was a github series do you think
that would be interesting like how do i
watch that neither I'm not interesting
and I've still have patched together
things ah i guarantee that I've been to
open using github and completely the
wrong way I'm sure that I am I am too
actually and that's kind of one of the
reasons I want to do a series about it
is that because I learn a lot when I do
these serious and I figure like if I
could just like mess up in front of
everybody then i can get corrected and
now i can get you the right way but well
well came through other people's github
profiles and repositories i noticed that
they make very little changes and then
um what's it called um send it up
I meant it yeah right I'll like code for
a day then send it to get help once oh
yeah trying to cope code yeah that's one
thing that I'm kind of becoming more and
more interested in as well because like
at work I I do a lot of the front-end
code but in conjunction with a lot of
like more experienced programmers and
who do you know front and back-end and
and so like I'll do like a bunch of
stuff and the only one a little bit and
they're like yeah chaves fix it you know
like give me just a little bit softer
like cherry pick stuff over to a new
branch and push that up and yeah Oh
requests with them and so if it's fun
i'm learning a lot but i think that it
would be fun to kind of do a little bit
more publicly and kind of dive into some
of the features that I'm not currently
using to learn more so you guys if
you're watching this or if you're
watching this throughout the week
sometime not even live leave a comment
if you do want to see a github series
and all a kind of like bump that Oh
William says yes I'll bump that up in my
kind of list I keep a list of what i
want to do but it's always changing
note of all these video ideas you get um
where you said talking about um keeping
nights of videos yeah I do I have a
Trello remember Trello from I any long
series i key i have a trailer board of
deb tips production schedule and have i
have like a big huge list of ideas and
move I move them along from video to
filming to writing and public yeah okay
um what to do b'doop do let's do like
two more I'll pick one in the new pick
one ok ok do you only go first um one
from eric island about uh yeah okay okay
Maribel and stripe again whether I've
used our costs yes I have um that was
when I first heard about laravel as I
said website that I first landed on if
you ever you ever heard of it me no I
don't even heard for um what you've
heard of you've heard of laravel but the
framework yeah like I just heard that
it's a framework but there's so many
it's hard to pay attention everything
yes what's unique about this oh it said
with the framework it's been gaining
quite a lot of traction recently and I
think currently is one of the number one
used PHP frameworks outlet PHP framework
that's why i haven't paying much
attention to it yeah PHP is I mean it'll
it'll be different between the different
circles that you run into but right now
everybody that I know it's kind of like
yeah PHP no mm no I know um I think I
think a lot of people see PHP is dying
at lee side yeah the the new hotness is
um as far as like i am kind of seeing
and this is not definitive this is not
official but the new hotness are like
javascript frameworks like angular and
backbone for the front end and then kind
of like python is getting a lot of heat
and then and then also i'm aware that
the rails is also very popular for
people who kind of want to get something
done fast
hmm as and their language is that I
quite like to to investigate hmm I mean
no I i I've spent time with WordPress a
lot actually so that's kind of my pee my
PHP kind of begins and ends with
WordPress hmm i think basic core PHP is
horrible you the sis it's clearly been
patched together and you see lots of old
code mixed with new code and all these
different naming conventions it's just
it's it's a bit ly over the place and I
find with these new frameworks mm-hmm
they just clean things up a bit but
there's a lot of frameworks that on top
of PHP i think in levels one of them
right like there's cake and a few others
yeah kicks been around a while though i
think i never used it though yeah um
yeah lasts is a paid um learning
resource for um laravel okay cool huh
all right we're going to do one more
question and there's to hear that i
think would be kind of good one is about
san francisco and one is about like
general career stuff which one do you
want to hear about you want to hear me
talk about my career history or doing
here to talk about the city of San
Francisco um life haha alright um oh
yeah we'll do both yeah sure so let's
start with San Francisco the question is
from Zach beers how do you think San
Francisco compares to other cities as
far as web design opportunities as far
as web of opportunities uh so I don't I
mean I don't have a anecdotal experience
with every city in the world you know I
only know San Francisco and
the Bay Area and I compare I got grew up
in Las Vegas and I did web design in Las
Vegas so I mean that's like a really big
difference of course every day San
Francisco is going to be better but but
it also like growing up in Las Vegas and
then moving to a place like San
Francisco we're like it's just like
baked into the culture like like like
most of the people i meet on the train
or walking around that i can safely
assume that they know how to code it's
just it's weird yeah like and there's
I've never seen that before before I
came here and um is so okay so there
there is a big difference now I remember
watching this this video is a TED talk I
think it was done by the one of the
cofounders of github is that right um
and he was saying uh his one of his
biggest points of advice for people who
want to get into this kind of work is
moved to San Francisco yeah and I was
like what what's what does that mean I
was still living in Vegas at the time
like how could the how could that even
be good advice like it's a it's a
telecommute world you know like
everything's connected we can just kind
of jump on a Skype or a hang out like
this and all of a sudden the distance
between us is not even there but I I
just have to say from experience like it
is different out here it it's it's
indescribable almost like the amount of
opportunities like for example right now
in my work we are like desperately
trying to hire people and we can't we
can't hire enough evil because everybody
else is hiring them you know like like
it and we're just kind of like here do
you want some money in and they're like
yeah money okay sure but what else you
know like food like what else do you
want i don't know i have to hit you up
off to after University yeah if anybody
is watching this and wants to come in
and you know and also we're very picky
as well we're not just hire anybody but
is call if I hit me up I'd love to give
you a job anyhow so that's that's the my
story about San Francisco I think I
don't have enough knowledge about other
cities I know that their other are other
cities where things are heating up New
York comes to mind in humburg is pretty
big or now um and also berlin and austin
texas in chicago really yeah yeah austin
texas is actually really big when i have
like several friends who moved from here
to Austin and um let's see whoa whoa
whoa Brazil's low Brazil pretty big what
what what made you finally decide to
move problems it vegas yeah what made me
move from vegas to the bay um I got a
job here I that was the thing so I was
working in vegas at a creative agency
and i felt like it was time to move and
so I just put out some feelers and then
this this company that did a lot of
really cool exciting work like they did
they did work for entertainment acts so
I got to work with the killers and Janet
Jackson and Bon Jovi and like these like
really like big WOW yeah but it was so
fun so fun and that kind of like opened
my eyes to like what's out here and I
moved up here and it was cool it was a
really good experience and then I kind
of learned like because the agency that
i was at did um did services like
building sites for people but they also
did products they had like um like some
startup kind of product things and like
I was like looking like over like what
are you guys doing over there limit
that's how i got like interested in this
idea of building of building a long-term
project instead of building something
and giving it away like 20 and yeah
that's that's how I fell in love with
the idea of product design and and I
when when the opportunity came to move
to a company that did products
exclusively as a product designer I
jumped at it and I've been
that for the past few years and it's i
really i really enjoy it which actually
dovetails into the second question that
we were going to say which was by a
korea yeah the best thing that happened
to you at your career life till now and
that's from West same um I feel a I feel
it's really difficult for me to kind of
talk about this stuff because I feel
that it's unfair to a lot of people i
feel like the the opportunities that
I've had and like just like the random
luck that's kind of fallen in my lap is
is just really unfair to a lot of people
who are more talented and more skilled
than I am and I and so I worked a lot of
my guilt about it that's good yeah I
don't know it's just like this thing
that I kind of like think about
sometimes and but anyhow so the the best
thing is like is is a number is like a
number of small things that kind of
added up to place me where I am like I
made a friend in Las Vegas who was going
to take this job the one that I just
described and then he didn't and then he
said hey hire this guy and they then
they did they hired me so like it kind
of like really fell into my lap you know
like this kind of like move out to
California and be a web designer there
and then like from there and actually
going back to the other question as soon
as you can put San Francisco in your
profile on behance or Twitter or
LinkedIn you're gonna have you're gonna
have so much like job offers and stuff
because like so it's like as soon as I
ripped down San Francisco and my
linkedin and my behance like I started
getting like a lot of emails all the
time and just getting noticed more cuz
like the recruiters they search for that
they search for there's a lot of job I
don't anyway so so yeah just like these
kind of like really lucky breaks and I
don't think that I'm like the best
really at anything I just think that I
try to be mindful of what I am doing and
I think because of that I've
I've met a lot of people who have placed
me in great situations my current
employer is I just I'm so lucky to be
working with them they're they're great
and actually that's what's gotten me
into YouTube because my company does we
work with YouTube and work with
youtubers and people who are interested
in in online video and so I would kind
of like lead up to that like like being
a part of dev tips it's like a really
big part of my life now for the past
year and a half or so I've been doing
this every week and kind of like meeting
people like you and people like IP last
week and everybody else that I'm kind of
meeting it in the comments down below
and and it's just really blowing my mind
when I think that um you know I can make
a video or just like talk to a camera
and the next week you know like 3,000
people will see it lamb I think that's
probably the best thing that has
happened to me I mean I've been I've
been so lucky in so many ways but I
think that one thing if I had to put my
finger on one I just really enjoy the
idea that I can influence people and
hopefully like for the for the better
you know and sometimes I get these
emails you know like like thank you so
much I i was able to do this thing and i
got a job or because of this i decided
to go back to school or you know or
whatever it was yeah like I just like
really makes my day when i get these
like random emails or messages that are
just kind of like that kind of helped me
to understand that the dev tips means
something to people more than just
learning a cool trick in CSS or
something now i find i personally i find
your videos quite motivating um um thank
you and and I remember that with your I
think with your Jekyll tutorial using
this this book to draw out yet you're um
scale my sketch pad yeah and I think the
very next day I went and bought
ah took me ages to find find a Booker
had these little dots yeah grant arts
and that was because of you know nice ya
doing it it's brilliant I love it yeah
just stuff like that right like like
small things like hey now I found out a
book that I love that it's gonna help me
be better at my work like that means a
lot to me that really does it makes me
feel great about all the the energy and
effort I put into this stuff so like
last night I was up to four am like I'd
seriously have gotten three hours of
sleep because yeah because my little
girl came in it actually she came in at
seven or 630 or something I so maybe
even less than three hours but anyway so
she cuz she has a ear infection she's
sick she comes in crying insta so like
I'm like some sleepless right now but
last night I was just like recording and
editing this video that maybe is going
to go up next week maybe the week after
but it's like it's if not it's no code
it's just it's just talking about how to
be a good creator and you know and I'm
really really excited because i don't
know like that stuff even like gets me
even like way more jacked like like i
love i love code i love design but i
love like the ideas and i loved like
like the philosophies behind this stuff
you know like how to be a good creator
over the long term how to be healthy and
and like how to have a good career
that's what i'm really really interested
in yeah i think dev tips is a great
medium for that to help people in being
introduced to these ideas a little by
little while they're trying to learn
some code there's someone someone
retweeted a one of your videos that was
similar to what you're describing Oh was
that um the advice for advice yeah nice
and crap for young creators yeah well i
watch i watched that for the first time
when I think whoever retweeted it need
you favorited or whatever and and I
thought that was brilliant I was um
again found quite a lot of motivation
from that I was
thank you yeah that that's one of those
I mean those kind of videos come out
late at night so that one would like it
to in the morning I remember that and
this one last night was definitely that
like that as well we're like you know
it's it's like I'm not tired enough to
fall asleep but I'm too tired to make
sense so here's just the mine is so I
hope you guys like it that'll be
probably it depends on a few other
things coming together but it might be
monday or it might be a week after I
don't know see photo cool so thank you
so much for your time today we've we've
reached an hour and I didn't have to do
any I was I was telling you earlier on
the chat before we started the life oh I
forgot to do like a prepare a code
example so I'm scrambling to like like
downloading all these files and like
organizing my stuff right and you're a
nurse like I don't worry about it like
okay so yeah we we did good though I
think I think your question part was
like a lot of fun um thanks thanks for
everybody that a that offered questions
i think that there's a lot I mean
there's a lot of questions we didn't
even get to here as a hell of a lot of
questions yeah I'm not looking expecting
that money isn't it cool like like I'm i
don't know i'm just like this good this
dude whatever and like we're just
talking but like people are interested
that's what like what really makes me
excited about deaf just people
interested in you started to video code
with a random British came to the
commented on new videos right and then
all like all around the world people are
asking you questions about what are you
gonna do in five years like do you plan
on doing real and like they're
interested in you person yet I just love
that but these are such but the people
who watch dev tips I i brag a lot to
other youtubers that I talked to like I
have the best audience you know like
like my dev tips crew where our family
where they really cool with or the best
I think you've probably got one of the
highest um I don't know what to call it
um you you integrate with your audience
quite a bit I think yes I things
I try to answer every question and it's
not it's not always possible but I think
I hit like ninety-nine percent some of
them like YouTube and Google+ like it
gets I can't even answer there's no
reply field and it's and some of them i
really want to like there's like a
really good question and like yeah i
don't i just i can thumbs up it i can't
reply to it because google let me i
don't know why but i think that's like a
Google+ YouTube like problem i don't i
don't know yeah anyway so thank you so
