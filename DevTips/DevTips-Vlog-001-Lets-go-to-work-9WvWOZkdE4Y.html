so what I was at the tree most now there
is a an announcement that came over
overhead that said to the person who
does speak wording arms of platforms
just come to the back of the train you
drop something and we'll give it to you
I was like I didn't drop anything you
want to give me a ticket sitting here
I'll never know
check this out it's 40,000 subscribers
on YouTube so today is a special day
I've ever done this but Louis is gonna
give me a call in a few minutes we're
gonna do a podcast not a late-night
podcast this week
oh we will come out Clark the podcast
but it is his week to host and young
peasant and he hasn't been in town for
fun so we've been running on and Eve for
the past few weeks we ran out of back to
back up episode so we have to scramble
for an episode for the podcast to go out
tomorrow so he's gonna call me on it's
9:15 few minutes and he's gonna have a
podcast walking around walking around
town during the afternoon
there was an awesome blog / podcast I've
never done them before by think what
turned out really well
Bose is a cool guy you know who those
people that you don't meet that off and
really glad it a millage and they doing
things like this with me and it's making
my life so it's a big day for tubular
here at work but it's also a big day for
dev tips today we've reached a milestone
of subscribers 40,000 subscribers 40,000
subscribers that just blows my mind I I
don't even know what to think anymore I
don't understand how to approach 40,000
people that have chosen to watch and
possibly watch another episode you know
how these things work but you know every
day every time I upload a video there's
there's gonna be five thousand of you
that watch it that week there's gonna be
you know ten thousand view that watch it
that month and that's it's just amazing
to me but therein lies the rub it's
something that I've been struggling with
lately is just kind of how many of you
there are now and the the level of
Correspondence I need to do to keep up
by early on I started responding to
every comment that has ever left on the
channel if I was available to barring
the weird Google+ problem so I respond
to every comment and I've been doing so
for the past two years and it's just
been it's been an amazing experience
it's probably what sets one of the
things that sets my channel apart I hear
a lot that you know they're surprised
that that I respond and there and people
who get responses from you're also
delighted in and I
that I can delight like that that's
amazing right the problem is though
train the Train the Train thinks is that
Tyrannosaurus Rex is the Train asaurus
rex little joke the problem with having
such such a high volume of engagement
and if you can call it a problem it's
one of the things that I love about the
community about the community about the
channel is that it's starting to become
such a constraint on my time that I'm
often neglecting some of you know I
missed comments now I keep dropping the
ball a lot I feel really bad about it
so so here's what's gonna happen I'm
still gonna read every comment and I'm
still going to answer everything that
they can I definitely want to answer
every comment that's left on the new
videos of the week you know so but for
comments you know on older videos I
don't know if I can get to them anymore
I'll try but I can't make that promise
anymore so what I'm gonna try to do is
something that I've been doing with this
video is I want to start answering
responding to comments directly with a
video and I think that this does two
things number one lets you know that I'm
still listening I still really
appreciate the encouragement I really
appreciate the support and just like the
outpouring of goodwill and love from you
guys it means the world but also it
allows me to take the the the concerns
and questions that you guys have
individually and broadcast them to the
whole community to do two things number
one answer them please try to and give
you my spin on on the on the question
and secondly to promote that question to
the community
itself which will open up a conversation
about your question right
so today I've hoodwinked of Shang
shanghaied I Pham boozled three of my
colleagues to answer three of the
questions that I got last week here on
dev tips and we're going to do your best
to answer them some really good insights
are going to come out of this and what I
would like to see is in the comments
your take on these questions because
they're there's no real one answer right
to any of this stuff and that's why I
love this stuff but but then again
there's just so much interpretation that
can go on so there we are and and this
is going to be this video is going to be
the first of a series and I hope that I
can make short ones shorter ones and in
answer the questions and talk to you
guys and promote you and let you know
that I'm still listening I still really
appreciate that
the encouragement and the comments and
the love the likes the subscribes that
follows everything and the conversation
is still alive and well it's just gonna
it's just going to evolve and take on a
new form alright so let's get started
our first guest is my colleague Maggie
downstairs okay um this is Maggie Maggie
Moreno and she works with me and she is
a front-end and back-end she's a full
stack developer here at tubular and I
like Maggie because she makes my
drawings turn into real living websites
and that makes me freaking happy so I
asked Maggie to answer a question that I
got from you guys I got a question from
Renee Renee Reed
question is what do you think are the
three most important skills for an
aspiring professional developer okay so
I think the
three most important skills for web
developer right let's do that yeah okay
it really depends on what you want to do
mm-hmm
so so four if you want to focus on user
interface and isn't like creating
beautiful yeah like beautiful front ends
then you're gonna want to focus on HTML
CSS and JavaScript that's like that's
gonna be your core competency however if
you want to to do a little bit more if
you if you want to not only focus on the
user interface but also work on the the
data that's coming in to that then
you're probably going to need to learn
in addition one of the more back-end
languages like Python and the web
framework Django or Ruby and the web
framework rails mm-hmm
but yeah and it's it's funny though like
so it used to be that that front-end
engineers like he was like looked upon
as like engineering white mm-hmm to to
do just HTML CSS and JavaScript but now
they're at least big front-end
frameworks like angular and backbone and
react so that and not that many people
they're not really taught in school so
like not that many people know about
really yeah or no or people know about
them things they're not very good
necessarily and and so so now being a
more front-end US Android developers is
like kind of in demand it's hard to hire
people like that really yeah but it's
really a very like there's so many
tutorials for things like that and it's
like very accessible very easy to teach
yourself these things she would say laya
HTML Javascript and CSS foundation yes
and then stick a JavaScript templating
or not templating but a JavaScript and
then stick a JavaScript front-end
framework on top of that you'll be ready
to go yeah I'd say so it's good advice
all right I have another question for
you
because you do a lot of interviewing
here we're trying to staff up you do a
lot of interviewing you do even more
sifting through resumes what is one
thing if you could put your finger on it
that that turns your head on a resume
yes
so there's a lot of debate about this
within the engineering plate within the
engineering world as to like even the
like even the utility of like of a
resume or any one particular aspect of
your resume um you know a lot of people
will tell you like oh if you've gone to
a great school it almost doesn't matter
what you've done or um you know they say
like oh you know you just have to get
that one first job and like once you get
that one first job you're golden but
really um when I look at a resume oh and
it's very different like when eyes and
engineer look at a resume versus when
some Human Resources person or Rick
Kruger looks at a resume because they're
looking at that kind of different things
you know they're gonna they're gonna
look at whether or not you have grammar
mistakes whether or not your resume is
formatted nicely hmm um and they're
gonna look more alike in school with the
classes you've taken or something like
that right but when I look at a resume I
look I'm very impressed by projects that
you've done if you have anything that I
can go see if you have a really really
hot Stack Overflow profile if you have a
bunch of work on github if you've
contributed to open-source projects if
you have a whole frickin website that's
like your baby and like I can go look at
it like that's that means a lot to me
and I mean and it could be like it could
be something that you've taken the
initiative and done mm-hmm it could be
something that you did for an employer
if you're lucky enough to be able to
show the work that you've done um but
like really anything that you're excited
about like I'm excited about
yeah anything that you want to tell me
about you just like oh man like I did
this project I'm like yeah I know it's
for school or whatever but I just got so
much out of it did this that and the
other that's super cool to me
tell me all about that I used to say
that when I would interview the number
one thing that I would look for is
passion yeah because you can teach
anything but you can't really instill
passion the way
and everything else yeah thank you so
much for your time Maggie it's been
awesome thank you for talking to me all
right all right
our next guest is is Kevin Lee kevin is
the lead developer living front end what
was the thing yeah I'm the tech lead of
the front end team attribute like that
so Kevin is the guy that if I want to
make some code it goes through him and
he tells me no or already changes it
completely and I'm grateful for it see
what makes it better so Kevin uh thanks
you thank you for coming out what I want
to do is I want to ask you a question
that was given to us buying a watcher
objectives and this is from Sergio and
he has a question about he's learning
all these new things all this new
technology he's awesome tutorials on dev
tips but the problem is that he takes
them to work and they're not appreciated
they want to stick them the same you
know the same road that they've been
driving down for the past few years they
I mean they developed for IAE they're
kind of like they have like you know
maybe these clients that don't want to
budge on new technologies
so the question is what are some
technique of some what are some
approaches that he can use to introduce
new ideas and new techniques and new
technologies to his team hmm that's a
really good question actually I have
some first night experience with it a to
yourself since when I got to the company
we were using backbone and I really
wanted to use angular and so in order to
prove that it was valuable to the
company and the team to use angular over
backbone I introduced like a small
framework within the current application
that just used angular for that feature
and I showed that it required a lot less
code and a lot less time to develop and
using that as an argument I could prove
that we should start experimenting more
with using it throughout the whole
project instead of just a little part
that I developed so what would have been
the cost if they said no so the cost of
they had said no would then that we
would just have to work
the work I had done for that one small
feature and go back to using backbone
for it but by just developing on the
small thing I could make a proof of
proof of concept and like show off to
the higher-ups and the rest of my team
members like what it was like to work
with angular on the project and how we
get introduce it to the rest of the
codebase like a little bit at a time so
there's like some ease of transition
there and how did you approach that that
meeting saying like this is what I want
to do here's my plan to do it easy like
make up a presentation did you just tap
him on the shoulder and whisper in their
ear was like what was that like oh so it
was a really informal process at the
time only about two or three people I
had to like really convince and we just
like I did the work and then I like
calling them all together and then we
like discussed it and people had the
like arguments for and against but
eventually we came out for it and now
the whole the entire project is go today
is there any more backbone in there no
no back to all Midwest and to go ripped
out the backbone
cool thanks a lot Kevin just to
summarize there you go a little bit at a
time man just give them go get their
feet wet little baby steps and then make
a case I like how you did that you made
a case study and then presented it to
the people and had a an open discussion
about I really like that thanks a lot
Kevin thanks for having
all right our last guest on the show
today is
yiannis aggelakas who is a so I'm a
software engineer here tubular mm-hmm
and I'm mostly interested in the backend
of making sure that the data we have is
processed efficiently to show up for
customer sometime right okay and that
fabulous accent that he has is from
Greek by Greece so that's a really
really good reason excellent this
question is from Lance Gunderson who is
a fan of dev tips and he is coming out
of the Navy he wants to be a web
developer and he asks basically how much
experience should I have before I start
applying to jobs anything about that so
I would say the amount of experience
that can be took out is related to how
confident you feel about the field that
you want to work on so I think there is
no longer right answer it depends also
on the company that you are looking
forward and the kind of jobs but I would
say if you have a feeling that you kind
of know what to expect in your
day-to-day work then you are at a good
place if you are feeling like not very
sure about okay what my work day will be
I'm not really sure about the tools that
I will be using like not the actual
tools themselves but rather the
philosophy behind those tools and then
you would need to spend some more time
working on it yourselves before like
applying and being really successful in
what you are planting
so it's interesting you say it's a
matter of confidence rather than being
certified or being you know at this
level or whatever it's a matter of
confidence and touch to a matter of
maturity in the sense if you kind of
very sure about moving to the next step
I think then pretty much you are ready
next step I really like that sometimes I
like to think about this idea of being
confident with your tools in in terms of
being able to like fix problems how I
judge my like like if something broke
how how do I feel about fixing it that's
how much judge my confidence yeah
exactly and I think it's important to
make a distinction between knowing the
actual tools that you are going to work
with versus knowing the foundation
behind those tools because if you know
the fundamental so then you can apply
them to different tools okay maybe we
spend a day or a couple days figuring
the details of a tool right because you
never worked
is it before but example we're talking
about here tubular we are working with a
lot of tools that I didn't have that
sound so work before and like for
example we use distributed databases and
that I hadn't used before I think is
though that because of my service and
what I was doing on my spare time before
I had understanding for how these tools
work under the hood and I had some
experience with similar right right so
when it was kind of easy to apply this
knowledge and learn that means wind up
the new technology fast enough to be
able to do things with you know so I
think mostly that's what experience buys
the ability to be able to transfer
knowledge quickly because at every job I
actually know what the experience would
bias to use the ability to transfer
knowledge quickly that's really good one
no it's a good job
yes but I think actually that's in every
new job you are going to encounter new
tools and new technologies because also
well developing is a field where
everything changes fast right right so I
think that's the most important thing
and when you feel it
when you really really honestly be
honest with yourself and you feel that
okay I can do that I can transfer my
knowledge and I'm confident that I can
learn new things and work with them
right that's nice
well put it man thanks a lot this is
again this is Yanis and in basically a
sage wisdom over here of Jana so I
appreciate the time and oh thanks for
having me and that's it this day kids at
9 o'clock
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
