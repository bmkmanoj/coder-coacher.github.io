video it is the last video of this
series I mean as it is right now we
might come back to it and discuss finer
points but this series we can call it
done the site is done we've done it
we've had over 20 videos over three
months of weekly videos and like
interspersed with with some bi-weekly
videos you know it has been quite a ride
and here we are the last video let's
look at our Trello board and see what
we're doing last video that we did we
made the headed responsive and that was
fun it looks great everything looks
fantastic right now today we're going to
talk about getting this site that we've
built locally the whole time set up on
on an external server so the world can
see it okay this is going to be a lot of
fun let's get started ah okay we have
the artist theme right running on our
localhost this is where we've been
developing the whole time and we've got
it just the way you want it's so
beautiful and so wonderful it's like a
little baby bird we will let it go off
into the world okay so we have now this
is the super awesome thing I've been
waiting three months to tell you guys
about if we go to Jekyll's website we
can notice that down here we get free
hosting from github pages and github
pages actually uses Jekyll now I want to
be clear about something
there is a momentary hiccup in the
process github pages supports Jekyll up
to versions
two point two point zero and we're using
version 2.3 so there is going to be an
error but I want to take you through the
case of it not being an error with when
when github does update to Jekyll 2.3
shortly so that's what we're looking at
first and then I'll teach you how to
make your way around it okay so it's
really easy to do we're going to go into
our dev tips artist thing now if you
fork this right here if you're one of
these 71 people who have created Wow 71
of you guys who have created Forks all
you have to do is go over to your master
branch right here
and create a new branch type th - pages
now you have a new branch that's been
created it's called gh pages and you'll
see that up in the URL with the gh pages
it's like it's like a special name of a
branch right you can name branches
anything you want but if you name your
branch gh-pages it does something really
cool and awesome it actually runs Jekyll
on the on the repo that's in that branch
right this is cool
you
all you have to do after you make that
new branch is go to dev tips dot github
do slash artists theme like that now
right now I'm getting a 404 but again
after github updates this this should
work fine and you won't get a 404 but
I'm getting a 404 because they want get
a Jekyll 2.2 and I'm using a feature
that is causing an error because it's
allowed in version 2.3 but not to point
to which they support but they will
support 2.3 eventually and that's you
know for you guys that are watching this
in the future this is fine it will work
right now but for you guys watching
today or you know whenever this is
released this is a problem that we have
to overcome ok so what's happening
there's a Jekyll error now get up pages
will run Jekyll and give you and kind of
display the output right here normally
the other thing it will do is if you're
if you have a site that's just you know
what does it called like ecstatic but if
your site is already static HTML and CSS
and JavaScript it will run that too so
I'm going to go into my github
application and I'm going to sync it up
it's going to be syncing with the the
new branch that I just made and I'm
going to branches and see that the new
branch is there ok so I'm going to
switch the branch right here to github
pages and then I'm going to make sure
that I'm going to make sure that it's
actually compiling the Jekyll here this
looks good and I'm going to check my
local host 8000
is running the gh-pages branch is
running Jekyll right now and that's how
I'm getting this localhost it's
important to listen to this next step
turn off Jekyll so I go into terminal
and I press control C and that will turn
Jekyll off and if I hit refresh again my
localhost it will get a nothing there's
nothing will show up there can't find
the web page okay so Jekyll is not
running right now but we already have
the rendered output
of Jekyll in underscore site so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to take
everything that's not underscore site
I'm going to move it to the trash now
it's gone I'm going to take everything
that site gives me and pull it out and
move site to the trash okay now when I
go back to my branch I should have a ton
of deleted things and a few move things
or rather new things right these are all
the things that were generated by Jekyll
before they were all deleted okay so I'm
going to commit this I'm going to call
this on Jekyll commit okay now that's
gh-pages right now when I switch or back
over to master I should have the full
repo as normal and when I run a Jekyll
again I'll cover your fingers please
okay it's fine okay turn Jekyll off with
command C and switch back to github
pages now I can take this branch and now
that have that commit I'm going to sync
that to github and I'm going to go back
to this 404 page that I had which is dev
tips dot github got io / artist theme
and refresh now it doesn't show up right
away keep on clicking that refresh and
it will it will be fine because it needs
a few minutes to propagate but here we
are look at it as dev tips github Daioh
slash artists theme is a real URL that
you can go to and everything is working
super fantastic this is it this is this
is like that the exciting thing
everything that we've done on this this
whole this whole thing is free I mean
our forms are sent to us for free
hosting is free Jekyll is building and
managing our site for us for free

done on the cheap that's great I love
