code repo called the dev tip starter kit
and the idea was for it to be a
lightweight starting place for small web
projects in fact I've been using it in
most of the coding tutorials here on dev
tips channel well it's been the year and
I've learned quite a few things so I
went back into the starter kit and did a
massive overhaul of the structure and
the presentation so today I want to talk
to you about dev tips starter kit
version 2 and I want to show you what's
new in the kit the first new thing is
that there's actually a nice little
landing page built for it now and that
can be found at dev tip starter kit comm
from here you can download the code
directly or jump to github to fork it
and make it your own
the most important thing about the kit
has always been its SAS architecture
this is why I made the kit in the first
place to share with you guys how I
organize my projects so here we are in
the kit let's jump into the assets and
then CSS you can see that I've rewritten
and reorganized the SAS to make it
cleaner and simpler to understand
everything has been broken down to
smaller pieces and they're much more
expressive so they're easier to find and
and change to how you want them to be I
remove my own opinions about things like
colors and dimensions I updated
third-party code like normalized and
bourbon and jQuery and I even added
mr-mrs colors which adds a lot of
interesting and and simple color
variables for you to use there is a new
font and there are in each section a few
example pages see these these ones that
have the word example in front of them
these are not meant to be included in
every project you just go in and delete
them as you like but they're a way to
show you how I organize these modules
and how that I include them in to the
main sass right here alright that's it I
just wanted to show that to you I hope
that this new starter kit version is
useful to you and I look forward to
being able to use that in future dev
tips tutorials here on the channel
that's it for this morning's video
thanks for watching and of course keep
on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
