Travis and you're beautiful that's not
enough for you you want to code some
stuff I get it ah
I'm calling this series design and code
my personal website in 12 hours now keep
in mind it's kind of a flexible 12 hours
but welcome to our for today we're going
to be setting up the project this is an
important step I'm going to be talking
about all the tools we want to use and
how to get them into a place where
they're all working this is a critical
stage in the development process if we
start out using the right tools we're
going to have an easier path to success
in the end we want to have a wonderful
development environment so that we can
work from our happy place
ok so similar to the way that we did a
lot of the planning before we got
started in the last phase that design
phase we need to spend a bit of time
planning out the development environment
before we can execute on pulling all
this together alright so what I want to
do is to just make a quick list I'm
going to call this my project wishlist
and now I'm thinking to myself what
would for me be the the best and most
comfy and like the most awesome place
that I would want to code my website in
because I have free reign over the whole
tech stack here and choose anything I
want and I want to choose the thing that
I'm I'm you know is familiar to me and
also you know because I'm the person
that's asking for this I can you know
make myself uncomfortable a little bit -
I can push myself on the edges and so
what I want to do is I want to use
Jekyll as my as my kind of CMS as my
platform for this and I also want to use
Jade for my markup language and where
I'm pushing myself in in this is how I
get these two to work together they
don't natively go together Jekyll is
more of a you know a ruby based
application and Jade is kind of comes
from the house of of node J s so getting
them to work together is not exactly
easy and
going to show you in this video how I
ended up doing that but let's talk about
what other requirements I want in my
project number three I would say is
going to be SAS I need to use SAS for my
CSS and another thing I've been toying
with lately mostly on the demos that
I've been doing it code pin because it's
easy to use but something that I've
never used natively yet but I really
enjoyed it is autoprefixer that is is
going to be a lot of fun to use and it's
going to help me write native code in
front of you guys that will be you know
more standardized in the long term
instead of using mix-ins to handle
browser browser differences and the last
thing that i've never used before that I
think will be a lot of fun and also
something that code pen kind of just
kind of put me on to is something called
a browser sync now this is not I mean
code pen isn't the only place I've seen
this before I you when you use a code
kit or free prose you know there's
browser sync and brown auto refresh in
there but I'm going to build this into
the whole Jekyll and Jade and sass and
autoprefixer flow and I mean tell you
how I came upon this okay so this is the
wish list here if my development
environment can do all of these things
I'm going to be pretty excited okay so
the first thing I did was of course
start with Jekyll and then move into and
I know how to do that I'm pretty
familiar with it and I want to run into
Jade how do I install Jade on that well
I did to a site earlier where I did this
and you know not on dev tips but I have
a little experience and I used this
plug-in right here it's called Jade
jekyll plug-in built by snappy labs and
it's pretty good all you have to do is
basically use this RB file and just
stick it in your plugins folder in your
Jekyll installation and and all your dot
Jade files will get rendered into your
underscore site folder you know Jekyll
installation just as you hope they would
the I did run into a few problems and
you want to like you know find out what
they are I made a made an issue here on
snappy labs Jay Jekyll plug-in
repository kind of explaining the issue
that I was having and I did get some
help from deluzy but it in the end I
kind of describe why I didn't use it but
I'll leave that to you if you want to
find out there though will be a link in
the description below now these other
requirements led me to find this this
really really helpful video here this is
a it's a video but it's also like
attached to a repository so this person
Shane Osborn made this repository here
which is not so much a tool similar to
you know this jay jekyll plugin it's not
so much a tool or anything like that but
it's kind of like a starter project for
jekyll which involves a gulp workflow
and the gulp workflow involves SAS and
browser sync and also a few other things
like autoprefixer and that just takes
care of these last three that i wanted
right SAS autoprefixer and browser sync
and and NJ and jekyll of course and then
number two came down to me how do I work
in Jade alright so that's what kind of
this video is all about so here's here's
where we're going to start I'm going to
download this repository with a right
click Save Link As and I'm going to save
it straight to my desktop and here it is
now that that zip folder and on my
desktop double-click it to open it up
and then I'll just throw it away
now this folder here is the repository
that shakey Shan has provided for us let
me take you through what makes it
different shakey Shan here has a great
of getting started guide here so I'm
going to go through it with you
first thing we're going to do is install
Jekyll and I have Jekyll installed but
it doesn't matter if I install it again
just to make you feel feel safe and
secure gem installed Jekyll and then
that will run and it'll download the
latest version of Jekyll for you
fantastic
we installed one version of Jekyll okay
and then the second thing to do is
installed nodejs which is really simple
- it's actually not as complicated or
intimidating as everything else you just
go to node.js and then click install and
it's I'll just let's do it with you
notice about 14 megabytes but when you
click it you'll see like just it's like
a regular program that you know here
york install on any day but I've already
had installed it so I don't need to go
through this but you just go through
that you'll be fine next I need to
install gulp itself gulp is a technology
that will manage the dependencies and
kind of run tasks for us such as
building the site including a you know
assassin hopefully Jade in the future
when we write that part but to get that
started we going to do this right here
and if you're a Mac user you want to do
this in sudo mode sudo npm install
g for global that means it's installing
everywhere not just where your where
your current terminal is point in and we
write gulp password i forgot it
just kidding
alright that looks pretty good I think
let's test it out gulp - v4 version okay
we have version 3.8 fantastic
that worked out now we want to jump into
CD CD into our project here so I'm going
to say desktop Jekyll Jekyll scope SAS
browser sync master and then I'll write
NPM install okay and that what that did
does it looked for any of the
dependencies that I didn't have that are
in this that are in this project let me
show you what I mean drag this file down
to coda and we can look at what's called
a package.json now in here is something
called dev dependencies and we're
looking for things like gulp gulp sass
browser sync and gulp autoprefixer now
remember that I've kind of like waged
through all this before and so that's
why it didn't find any and install any
on my machines already had them but if
it didn't like for example for you it
would it would do a little bit of work
and then be done but we're there now now
what it know what gulp is going to do is
it's going to look into the gulp file go
pjs this is really cool this this file
here might be a little intimidating if
you've never used gold before or if
you're unfamiliar with these kind of
JavaScript tools to run tasks and build
processes and stuff but it's you know
and to be clear with you and be honest
with you I was pretty scared of it and I
thought it was weird and hard two days
ago but you know it kind of suffered
through it and now I'm kind of a little
bit more comfortable with it and I've
got it running things that I need it to
do and the first step is using the work
that shakey Shane is done for us right
here so the way that you enact all this
is just simply by being in that project
and then typing out typing the command
gulp now what with all that gulp stuff
does is it you know starts the sass
starts doing Jekyll it watches the files
and even builds our site for us and
opens a browser and here we are now
what's cool about this is we have
browser sync so let me show you here if
I open the CSS in the sass here and go
to main and it's background white and
they change that to yellow save and
automatically it's it's a updated just
as fast as that it's pretty cool huh
this is what I wanted for the project
and I think it'll be nice for you guys
not having to make watch me go back and
forth saving and refreshing we got
browser sync we also have a few other
things we wanted that's number 5 I
oughta prefix let me show you how that
works here is background yellow if I say
actually let me open this terminal here
for you and we're going to look at the
background and it's got yellow I must
say background display:block and save
you see how block shows up right there
now if I say display flex it's going to
have the different permutations needed
for the other browsers in here so
display flex MS flex and WebKit flex all
show up so what brown what autoprefixer
does is it goes - can I use com I think
and looks at all of the most recent
updated you know browser compatibilities
and these things and kind of sorts all
that out for you so what you can use is
basically the most modern way of writing
the CSS and it will backwards
compatibility fill it in for you I
really like that okay so now is the big
problem I want to use not HTML here but
I want to use a jade what I ended up
doing was just focusing J
aid on not necessarily the pages but
mostly the the includes right so if you
make a folder called underscore include
and in Jekyll you can write let's see
here
copy new file about dot HTML you can
write something like section class about
and then you would just write yeah zoom
right in J stuff already okay
you write h2 about me and then you would
make an image tag source equals HTTP
Phil slash 100 100 and save now you
would take now this is just an include
it's not a page itself and go to index
here and let's get rid of this stuff and
you can write something like include
about dot HTML and then when you did
that
the included file about me and a picture
of Bill Murray so what I'm getting at
here is that when I build a website most
of the work that I do are in these
includes because I like it to be you
know small and and manageable and then I
just kind of in the pages the actual
pages I just put a bunch of include tags
in and you know maybe some other things
or some wrappers around the includes to
change their scope but but mostly it's
all about these includes and I figured
the compromise could be you know with my
desire to have Jade is my programming
language that I could use Jade on on
includes well how do I do that I found
this really really great video online
called getting started with gulp part 1
where Maximilian Schmitt takes us
through the process of gulp and he
explained a lot to me
make me made me feel real good but what
he's doing is helping us to do
gulp Jade right so you can check that
out for your own on your own but what
I'm going to do is just kind of take you
through what I learned right now so I'm
going to open gulp file here actually
then go into my terminal and quit my a
gulp server and I have to get a new gulp
task or whatever it's called a new gulp
thingy
so I'll write npm install the gulp -
Jade that's the name of the thing we
need and if you write - - save dev that
will put a marker in your in your gulp
file that that you shouldn't go over a
certain version of gulp Jade so let me
download that oh great we got that now
and if I look at my package JSON now we
have gulp Jade and this is what that - -
save dev does is it marks it as an the
version number which doesn't allow us to
go past the main version number so if
anything breaks we will you know keep us
from that happening and now that we have
gulp Jade installed we need to go to our
gulp file and create really the task
that will allow us to use gold so we're
going to grab one of these require
statements and just copy and paste it to
duplicate it now this require is going
to be called just what we download
you're basically COPE Jade and we're
going to name it Jade make it line up ok
I mean give me some room here
okay let's walk through this file and
see what we got going on first we have
the the task of building the Jekyll site
this is going to be kind of like the
main thing that happens we're going to
build the Jekyll site notify browsersync
that it's happened and then and then
you're done right
rebuild is kind of like if you enacted a
rebuild by doing something else like for
example if you save a file this will
happen the rebuild will actually cause
Jekyll build to happen and then it will
notify browsersync and then you're done
browsersync let's see what that does if
the Sask task or the Jekyll rebuild task
is is triggered then browsersync will
kind of refresh the page will do it it
does and it will base its page off of
underscore site which is the Jekyll
output site okay now here is the sass
function and we're going to revisit this
a lot actually because it's pretty
biased as CSS and you guys might know
that I'm a I'm a sass man of s CSS man
but what happens here is it it's
basically running the the task of you
know turning all of your s CSS into CSS
and then it's interesting here it does
two things is it sticks a version of it
in underscore site so you can have your
deployable site with the CSS there and
then it reloads the browser and then it
also sticks one locally into CSS for you
the reason for that I think is because
Jekyll is a little slower than gulp so
it it sticks it in the CSS and quickly
reloads the browser so this is all for
speed and I'm just guessing of these
things mind you I just kind of figure
this all out you know two hours ago but
yeah so that's all for speed and then
and then it'll stick it in the kind of
core directory here in in CSS and then
Jekyll whenever it gets done we'll move
it into the underscore site CSS
basically rewriting
what we just did I think that's why we
do that twice I don't know we'll have to
ask shakey Shan okay now here is a
really important thing for us this is
the watch task so we're telling gulp to
watch for in this there's two of them
right the first one says watch the CSS
and then when that is you know change or
updated run the CSS command which is
just what we talked about you know
compile it put it here and put it there
the second one is watch for anything
with HTML watch anything in the layouts
HTML or posts or you know we could say
dot MD as well but posts dots a post
slash star it kind of catches all that
if you you know trigger an HTML file or
something in the post directory it will
trigger a Jekyll rebuild not a SAS which
SAS will just inject it quietly it
doesn't do it by Jekyll rube rebuild it
does a browser seem to reload which is
like sneaking injecting CSS in there
quickly instead of rebuilding all the
Jekyll so there's two different kind of
outcomes based on what file you save and
that all happens with the the watch task
and then down here is the gulp default
task which is a browser sync watch so
instead of writing gulp watch you can
just write gulp right so let's use that
information and start a Jade task I'm
going to come down in here under the CSS
and flip I don't know make a comment
okay and I was called as commented
okay
now we're going to we're going to try
okay so our goal task is going to start
like this we just invoke gulp and then
we say we're going to build a new task
and in that task we'll say this is going
to be task Jade and , and then want me
to make a function a callback function
here okay when Jade is ran as a task
what we want to happen well we just want
to return a few things alright so we'll
say return gulp return gulp source means
tell gulp to go and get some Jade files
right and in this paren here we're going
to be looking for basically star Jade
anything with a Jade file and after that
we'll take all those files and pipe them
or basically put them into Jade itself
the this is Jade right put them into
that gulp Jade and run that process and
turn them into HTML files now after you
have them in HTML files
well again pipe them into something else
well we'll send they'll use gulp as and
use the method of dest which is kind of
put them somewhere right destination and
we want to put them in the underscore
includes section remember when I said
that most of the work I want to do is in
the includes so what this is going to do
is is enable us to write any Jade file
and shove it into the includes folder
and so to keep it a little bit cleaner
I'm going to make a new folder in my
project I'm going to call it Jade files
and because I have a Jade files instead
of just Jade I can write underscore Jade
files slash not plus ok now that will go
into right the source will be Jade files
dot anything with a dot Jade run Jade on
them meaning turn Jade into HTML and
then turn place those in the includes
folder and from the includes folder
Jekyll will let's see
Jekyll will be able to insert them as I
showed you here it you know like into
our layout right so let's say that and
see how it works I'm going to create a
jade file here by a new file and I'll
call it hello dot Jade and I'll say h1
hello
and let's see hello hello
so let's look in our under includes
folder and go back to our terminal and
we have to do this know gulp is not
running right now and I don't have a way
to invoke Jade using you know with those
watch statements yet so I'll write gulp
Jade which will target that task
directly and when we run that it will
find the Jade files
hopefully in underscore Jade files and
let's see it took it 20 milliseconds
which is super fast let's refresh this
folder ok and hello see hello got
transferred here yeah this is exactly
what I wanted this is exciting so now I
can go to this index file and say hello
and then when I'm mmm let them go up and
along
you'll say hello here instead of you
know the about the About section and
what I need to do now in that gulp file
is find a way for me to say hey you know
how you guys watch the sass files here
and how you watch the index.html files I
want you to watch those Jade files so
I'm just going to duplicate this line
and come in here this doesn't even need
to be in write and say underscore Jade
files slash star Jade alright anything
on anything in the Jade files directory
with star Jade run Jade on it now I'm
hoping that when these Jade files get
placed into the includes you know what
I'm going to do I'm going to change post
to includes I'm going to use I'm not
using this as a blog right now so so
includes will be ready for a Jekyll
rebuild so Jade files will do get turned
into an HTML and stuck in the includes
includes will be like oh hey there's
something new here Jekyll rebuild what
happened this is what I'm hoping will
happen okay let's go to our terminal and
find out all right I'm going to say ctrl
C to stop the you know the server and
then right gulp and hit enter I'm going
to close these browsers here okay a new
browser is opened with browser sync and
I'm going to go over to hello Jade and
right bye now that we have a
notification is running a Jekyll build
and a browser should sync up and change
it to by there we go so as it stands
right now we have
these these includes that I'm building
in Jade and they're being output into
HTML and being kind of taken into this
this Jekyll oh man this is exciting
now there's let's just review our
wishlist here we got Jekyll going on we
got Jade going on autoprefixer is
working browsersync is working actually
let's talk about browsersync when I save
here this little black boxes
running up here I don't like it it's not
my favorite I don't like it there I know
that it's connected thank you very much
so let me go to the goat file here go to
browser sync browser sync or yeah okay
here's the browser sync task as I as an
option here is server I can hit a comma
and then do a new option and say notify
false fantastic now that little
notification will go away when we when
we relaunch gulp next time so that's
exactly what I wanted to happen with
browser sync cool the next thing is is
sass it is working in terms of is the S
CSS there and stuff but it's not working
how I like to have it you know it's very
specific about how it uses the CSS
folder here and then the s CSS folder
here and there's no subfolders and it's
just very unorganized and kind of a mess
let's clean this theme up because it's
not what I wanted so I'll just get rid
of this I don't I'm not going to use a
blog on this right away as I said so I
can don't need posts don't need these
post folders cite CSS node modules
config package readme okay now we're
back in our gulp file what I want to do
is let's quit let's quit let's quit a
gulp server right now because I'm going
to be doing some really Tecton
what I like to do instead of having an
underscore s CSS file is I just like to
put everything in the CSS I don't it I
don't like do I don't like make
one-to-one translations of my sass so
like I don't make a reset CSS and a
syntax CSS I compile everything into one
main CSS file I'm okay with the word
main sometimes I do all sometimes I do
app sometimes I do style main is fine
for whatever but the point is I do it
like he did it right here with an import
which is good okay so but the thing I
did I just threw away the underscore s
CSS file or folder and in in our gulp
task he's you know he's looking for this
this s CSS file so we need to make sure
that we can sort sort of sort it out how
the way we like it and also you know
make sure our gulp task is working with
us so how do we like it then well first
of all I'm going to create a new folder
here called
assets and then I'm going to just drop
my CSS into that alright so I'm going to
put my images here I'll create a new
folder called images and create a new
folder I'm going to call this jsy put my
JavaScript I put these assets in here so
so they're not like so cluttery right I
want everything to be organized so
inside of my assets I don't have
loose-leaf CSS right you guys know that
I make a pretty strict folder structure
here so I'm going to create a folder
called zero dash tools and another
folder called one dash base and another
folder called two - modules and another
folder
called three dash layouts will probably
not touch the layouts very much because
this is going to be a very focused one
page of the website kind of tutorial but
there's going to be a lot of pages in my
website so this will come in to play
later but modules is going to be where
we'll focus mostly on this whole series
right but anyway so tools what are these
tools for tools are for like resets
solves Gregg this reset in here I don't
need what is syntax dot CSS yeah this is
for if you're doing like code
highlighting and stuff which is fine of
us know what I need so I'll move that to
the trash okay so on the only thing
outside of these four folders ever
should be the basically the directory
file and there should be no native
styles inside of the directory file so
it'll log a syntax will be gone and just
deleted that so reset will be more like
zero - tools - reset so that's the
structure that I want just that all of
the imports will be done in the main
file right here and then all of the
actual kind of working files that we'll
be doing will be organized into these
one of these four specific folders now
there's a few other things I want to do
like I'm not going to use reset I'm
going to use normalize and a few other
things and I'm going to do those
off-camera but what I want to focus on
right now is getting these to import
properly and to kind of just work nicely
with our with our gulp file okay so the
gulp task says when you're running the
sass function take a look inside of the
underscore s CSS for main CSS but we've
moved it right it's no longer there so
we're going to say it's in assets slash
CSS slash main that's where it is now
and the include path is no longer s CSS
it's just C
as is the path well we are when we when
we place the file I explained before
when we pipe it into the new
destinations we want to go into
underscore CSS but we want that tip to
mirror our assets here so we'll say
assets as well and then the same for
this assets CSS okay now we're going to
go to our terminal and run gulp again
and see if our CSS compiles correctly
for us all right it's launching and
there's no CSS it looks like going on
here but actually there probably is it
looks like that but there probably is
CSS going on because we deleted a lot of
of the stuff that was already there so
let's check a look let's check it a
check at a look in resources Styles main
there is no main why why oh I know why
because we didn't change it in our
layout the layout is still up here
looking for main when it should be
looking for assets save okay that
retrigger to relay out and I guess the
reset or whatever had a black background
gosh whatever don't want that so I need
to spend a few minutes cleaning out this
project and getting it into a state
where it's something that we actually
want to work with when we start our
first video next week of actually
building this side out right and right
now it's in kind of a state like you
know hand-me-down from somebody else's
project and it's not exactly what I want
although all the tools are working
together how I want them to the state of
it you know like it's God pull this like
all this junk scan get rid of this crap
okay I know that was a lot and to be
honest I've spent the last two days
being pissed off and googling every
combination of why won't this stupid
thing worked the way I wanted to and
what am I doing with my life it wasn't
pretty
you
visit the github repo linked in the
description below to download the code
at this point or you might want to do
the exactly what I did and find yourself
in gulp hell and struggle through that
and learn a thing or two about yourself
this video is all about getting our
development environment right but we
still need to do a little bit of work on
the project to clean it up to get it
into the right place to start working as
you may remember I inherited all of the
shakey Shane defaults which like a black
background catch all that in the next
video
thank you for watching my name is Travis
and keep on hacking hey do you guys want
to see a cool trick watch this this is
the part in the video where I think our
patrons the patrons of dev tips are
these wonderful people they are so
generous enough to support the show so
every video that you watch here on dev
tips is made possible by these people
and how that works is they go to
patreon.com/scishow and they they select
a dollar amount that they would like to
to donate for every video of depth tips
that's created and they pledge that
money and then when a new video of dev
tips is created that money goes to the
show to create more videos to get new
equipment to provide bonuses for example
we're coming up on a milestone where
we're going to be doing a really cool
poster and I'm I'm organizing the
printing of it right now and I'll have a
video for you guys documenting that
process but it's really exciting stuff
if you're interested in becoming a
patron please check out
