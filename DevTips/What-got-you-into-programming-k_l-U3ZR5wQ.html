programming I was thinking woke up me
into programming and what is programming
really what do I use programming for
you're watching dev tips and I'm David
okay we're back in the yoga studio space
spring is coming to Stockholm and so our
allergies in the mid-90s I was 12 or so
for some reason I don't know why my dad
brought home a modem I don't know why he
brought that home but I'm thankful to
him that he did this was just before the
internet had taken off and become really
mainstream at this time you still used
BBS's bulletin board systems so it was
this kind of server you connected to and
there was one client per one phone line
so these BBS's they had really really
cool graphics I thought they had an C
graphics so even though this was when
Windows was around I really enjoyed the
like style of the an C graphics it was
like a ski but with color I wanted to
make my own graphic I wanted to make my
own BBS this this is what got me into
programming and I wanted to show off my
graphics that I had done offline I was
using a program called the draw some of
you might remember it and I think this
deeper urge of showing off is human even
though people are grown-ups they're
still like children trying to show off
for their mom mom hey look at this thing
I can do so I don't know it just seems
like it's very human to want to show off
your creative work so my first
programming this I think this was my
first programming was actually
configuring a bulletin board system I
wanted to have a BBS to show off my
graphics to other people to the world
think it was only one I only had one
user apart for myself and it was my
friend it was like down the street
because the BBS has used phone lines and
my parents didn't want me to sort of
like hog up the phone line I can sort of
understand that so setting up the BBS
didn't actually involve any
it was a lot of configuration though but
what is programming really so I wasn't
coding I was configuring but isn't that
how all programming sort of starts you
take something and you adapt it just
sort of hack it perhaps you had a
wordpress blog and then you started
adding plugins and then you wanted to
modify the plugins because they weren't
that great so you went into the editor
and then you're sort of like edited just
a line of code to perhaps have it shown
red instead of blue or something like
that that's when you go from the first
step they're configuring like adding the
WordPress plug-in to the next step of
programming which is sort of the coding
when you start to edit actual code I
think this is programming to me you
modified technology to create your
vision I wanted the world or my friend
down Street to see my antsy art and to
create that I had to set up this VBS I
used a tool called remote access it
doesn't have to be code to be
programming in my opinion many things
are done through configuration services
so if you're setting up like Microsoft
Internet Information server what is it
called IIS most of that is done through
a configuration UI whereas if you were
to set up Apache or nginx perhaps you
were writing sort of configuration files
they sort of more like look like code
but it's sort of the same concept you're
modifying the technology to create your
vision I think this is sort of like the
programming mindset so as soon as you're
starting to make things that have I
don't know a decision tree if this then
do that but if that then do this that is
programming to me and it doesn't matter
if you're using configuration a
configuration is just like a like a
high-level programming language is
higher than JavaScript and JavaScript is
perhaps higher than C++ and C++ is a
higher level than assembly which is
higher than like the binary registers
down in the CPU people put programming
and programmers on a pedestal and it's
not that much different from what most
people are doing whether sort of
adapting things we shouldn't make
programming feel
flex and hard and of course it can be
hard and difficult but I don't want to
intimidate people from starting to
program if people just realize that
editing excel is programming excel is
like a functional programming language
you're like having a function which is
then returning results for another
function which is returning results to a
different function
they are programming when they're using
Excel not by writing macros but when
they're just using the average seller
stuff just equals something plus
something I think people think program
is too hard it's not that hard and
programming is everywhere what do I use
programming for today after the BBS's
I got online on the internet and then I
saw a website so I wanted to make HTML
I'd learnt to CSS and also there was
there was something called flash at that
time do you remember that a Macromedia
flash which had a programming language
called ActionScript which is sort of
like JavaScript and then when I started
working you started as a front-end
developer and then I had you back in
stuff like Visual Basic 6 it was and
then I found sequel SQL standard query
language with meit which was like a
language to query things from databases
so even though my last job title was
analyst not developer not programmer nor
coder I was programming every day to
solve problems I was trying to get data
out I was trying to analyze data I was
trying to track data everything involves
some sort of programming I say
programming as a mindset on how to reach
your vision how to solve your problem
today the programming mindset is very
useful because most of the things around
us is sort of like based on software in
some way and that's when you really need
programming and the programming mindset
that was it for today but I'm sort of
curious what are you using programming
for today and what got you into
programming what was your BBS what was
your first thing that got you into
actually using programming to solve the
problem or reach your mission thanks for
watching this non coding programming
episode of dev tips I'm David and I'm
really looking forward to hear from your
journey into programming see you in the
next episode bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
