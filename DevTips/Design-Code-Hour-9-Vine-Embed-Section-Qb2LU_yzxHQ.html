designing code my personal website in 12
hours
thank you so much for doing this with me
I'm so glad that you made it this part
you're a trooper
you're like the Chewbacca to my Han Solo
it's you and me against the Empire ah in
today's video we're doing the vine
section so let's check it out we've done
the hero image at the top we've done the
youtubes done the mentoring last week we
did the articles and right now we're
going to stick a vine a stick stick a
vine in there the divine section so
let's take the columns actually you know
what this this vine let's look at it
let's look at that's a good idea
look at what we're designing it's going
to be very similar to YouTube right
except for it's like switched the phrase
background and then like just a widget
in them in the middle there's not gonna
be too much uh too much of this is not
gonna be too difficult all of the
interactive interesting stuff is gonna
happen in this widget that works can I
actually use as an embed similar to
YouTube I'm going to use as an embed
from vine calm so pretty straightforward
this week actually so because it's so
much like YouTube let's just copy the
YouTube section or duplicate the YouTube
section rather duplicate and we'll call
it section vine and then we'll go to the
main no not mean it's called index and
after articles we'll add section vine
okay there's that and then the next
thing we need to do is add a section
here
a new file is underscore home debt home
- vine dot s s hi ash and then we'll
just put that inside of here and now we
are set up for a new section perfect the
only problem with our new section is it
immediately looks like the YouTube
section because we just copied it so
let's go to this section call it vine
and we'll go to oh it's this Photoshop
and get this text here cool
it's not gonna be order first though
because let's see the order of it is the
input on the left so to remove this
class order first it's gonna be second
and the call to action is called
check out fine check out vine the
capital C and green colors and stuff
that's just styles
alright structurally cool and then like
actually let's just do the colors and
stuff okay that looks pretty good just
as like a default setting let's go to
the sass and make it look very Viney
section vine and want the background
back and ground to be I don't know if
that color lose this color no that color
what is that color that color
whatever this is copy that color and
also I want the I have an image to
background image what did I call it
where are you background image post some
nails
I call it vine BG URL vine - BG jpg is
it JPEG jpg okay now we just need to
make that what is it called size cover
cool let's make the color white text
text color white and then we have the
home - CTA and we want the color of that
to be this Viney color it looks pretty
good right let's compare Taurus PSD
basically it's flawless
basically it's perfect basically is
amazing okay now let's go get a vine I
have the dev tips vine I call it just
anyway okay so we're gonna do is go find
the loop we want this is the one we want
you look beautiful about you look at
this look at that face beautiful face so
we're gonna go to the embed and we will
capture the autoplay audio off so just
be silently running and want the 300
pixels size and we do want to in a
postcard you can have it in a just just
a vine running or in the vine branding
but I want it the purpose of this is to
showcase that I do use vine as a
platform to you know do things so I'm
putting in a vine I'll just grab this
embed code
and get rid of the video strip here get
rid of flex video just basically put it
in the column and wait for the Refresh
basically amazing oh look at that face
I love it you're so cute okay we do need
to Center this here and let's just do
the same thing we did before with a dot
the SC wrap and then indent these two
things into the description wrap and
then we'll make a description wrap no no
it's not de se what is it you wanted
okay so this time there's two columns so
I'll make it I'll just put extra class
on this one called description do you
know we did this last in the last
article of last video with the article
section but I just put it on column one
that was bad put on the description and
we'll call it display flex and what's
the other one a line items center boom
boom boom boom boom let's make it mobile
boink okay a few things here this could
be better let's do a media query at
media our mobile size is a mobile site
is it not mix with max max max with the
640 pixels geez what do I want to do I
want to look at all those call ones
actually call ones and make the text
aligned
Center okay that's what I wanted and
then also when we're smaller like this
let me just grab that description and
add a margin top of 50 pixels thank you
and then one last thing let's go this is
outside of the merit media query let's
just check this media query my colleague
walk a while right here okay you're
beautiful you're beautiful beautiful
you're still beautiful you're beautiful
you're beautiful you're beautiful you're
still beautiful oh my goodness it never
ends
okay we need to what is the last thing
we need to do okay here's one thing we
want to do the design has a I could drop
shadow under this widget and this has
the widget has none so let's make an
iframe and say box shadow and we'll say
0 mm 320 for the spread or if the blur
and then rgba 0 0 0 that so that's black
and then like 20% that's good
% that's good okay and then the very
last thing I want to do is actually
change the URL because I don't want this
to go to youtube so lamoureux URL I want
to go to this URL pretty simple no not
the embed URL that you know not that URL
I thought you were like yeah you're not
yeah this one good of a whole list of
them that's it
look at that you're so beautiful and
then here you can share it and smile it
and go see other ones check out check it
out yeah cool so that's that's the last
part of the vine video there's not even
going to be a
part two it was just that simple because
all of like the really interactive and
heavy working heavy heavy lifting is
done by vine itself I'm making a video
that plays like when you're scrolling
down here you're like Oh scrolling oh
this is JavaScript
look at those Ted eyes and you're like
oh it's a playing video try this
that's stupid mustache it was the
smiling it's stupid alright that's it
we'll see you next week this video is
made possible by the lovely support of
the lovely patrons if you don't know
what that is you should head over to
patreon calm down its patrons are people
who support the show by pledging a sum
of their choosing per weekly video these
patrons get deeper access things like
patron podcast early videos and hangouts
