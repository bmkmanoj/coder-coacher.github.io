let's make some code ah this is the
sixth hour in a series I'm calling
design and code my personal website in
12 hours so it's kind of like halfway
there
this is an intensely personal project
one that I've been waiting for a very
long time to take on and I am so glad
that you're coming with me on this
journey today we're going to be building
the very first section on this webpage
this is called the introduction or the
hero section this sets the tone for
everything else we'll be doing on this
entire webpage so I'm very excited about
this so here we go okay we're starting
right where we left off in the last
video on the right here I have the this
is the grid that we made in the last
video and on the left here is there is
our code editor and we're gonna start
editing code so we're gonna add make
let's look at this columns a file this
is the these are they the columns that
you see here so flex enter is like the
two that are together spaced around is
the two that are floating in the center
each of their own column we have column
two which is six hundred and twenty
pixels wide one single column that's two
columns wide
one single container that spans the two
columns in the center and we have a more
complicated nested column system here
which is which is column 50 which is 50
percent not that there's 50 columns okay
so what we're gonna do is we're going to
start with these columns and start to
build on build on them and actually
flesh out the design so let me show you
the design that we're gonna be making
today this is the this is the design so
it's kind of you know this guy's face
here and it's got some just some text
Travis is trying to grow up but instead
spends his time and then the next thing
that what we're making is the
continuation of that sentence teaching
everyone how to make websites on YouTube
and then you know it goes on and on and
on like we designed earlier so let's
look at the
columns here we have two columns and the
first column is basically empty and the
second column is has the content in it
and at first the first paragraph in is
content it extends outside of the column
as stylistically and and that's cool
that's really fun so let's just let's do
that let's do that so let's grab let's
actually just grab this about calling my
copy down and I'm going to create an
image a files when I create a new file
I'm going to call it section about Jade
and then I also need to create a new I
need to create modules and layouts may
house modules this doesn't really fit in
either of these because these are a
section not a layout layout is the home
within which we have like our grid and
everything so it's like the whole thing
modules headers a section not a module
because we're gonna do we're gonna
reorganize this again just really quick
here though really quick here a new
folder and that will be called every
name in the order I say okay three dot
sections
okay three - sections and then I'll
rename three layer layouts here to four
layouts
okay a little bit more standard here now
I'll take header and remand and move it
are you naming it to three sections
okay cool so so now I have sections -
about and then in my sections sass I'm
going to create a file the new file
called about I'll call it home about
table sass and then to finalize all this
we need to go back into our main s CSS
and kind of sort all those things out so
modules to modules has nothing in it yet
right there's nothing in it we need to
put some models in that later but right
now we want to change the three sections
there you go
header and then the second one we want
to add is Oh about that sass
I think that makes sense right so we
have we have header taken care of and
home account taken care of in that three
sections Oh
for or layouts that's important or
layouts alright let's do a quick test to
make sure this is all working in home
about sections will say section section
dot about background thread okay yep
that's working sort about section comes
from right here this is remember we
copied that from the columns file here
is the About section and when we looked
at our design a few seconds ago
we noted that there was two columns the
first one is generally empty and the
second one has the content in it so
we'll go to the second column here and
start generating our content so we'll
make this in h2 and we'll just say you
know Travis is trying
to grow up , and then a paragraph but
instead it spins this time an ellipsis
now this is not a normal paragraph it's
obviously much bigger it's gonna be 36
points so let's make that a lead maybe a
home - lead and that way I can use
because these this style of is 36 point
text is all the way through here so I
need to have a hook for that and age to
just kind of happens once on the page so
we don't really need a class for that
okay so to do to do so let's jump into
our design oh oh we haven't yet that was
the last thing we forgot to do we didn't
go into our index file and actually
include the let's see I'll be right here
in columns we need to include this this
sections about sections about dot HTML
okay now Jekyll will render and
browsersync oh we love that there we go
Thank You Jade oh and let's open column
again and get rid of let's get rid all
these names here because I'm gonna be
using these classes later that's why
this looks like a duplicate and it has
like the fourth of the red but I don't
want to confuse myself so I'm gonna get
rid of all those class names okay I
think we've got it ready so we're ready
to like start building a design okay
let's look at the design then in the
Photoshop so let's spend some time
actually with this background image our
background image is gonna be not red
but it's gonna be a few things so we're
doing make a nested style declaration
here image and it's gonna have i've
already extracted the image here so i've
named it about - BG and so is a URL
image about the - BG jpg
okay cool and we need to position it and
we'll position it centered horizontally
and then vertically we'll just put up
the bottom there we go and then I don't
want it to repeat but I don't really do
that the repeat doesn't really matter if
you use background size and that's what
we want to do as cover so we want to
stretch it to fill the the size and now
it's not going to be repeating at all
okay so I got my kind of like creepy
looking face poking out there next let's
open what's making everything pink here
that will be in my home phone size from
there yeah follow these weird
declarations to show you the colors get
rid of these bags backgrounds alright
now that's the background image let's
spend some time with this text to get it
where we want first we have the h2 here
and then this P home lead so let us look
at the h2 now when the h2 is going to be
contained in this about and I'm not
going to use this style as we can see in
the design I'm not gonna use this style
anywhere else in the design on the home
page so I will contain the declarations
for that style inside of the About
section let's do that right here with an
h2 and let's grab the color it's right
here
be cool and then for the color
let's see what's font size to double on
it to me let's grab all Vista font size
is 16 and the family is actually going
to be changes as well because right now
I have the default styling for this is
to like use open sans I think let's it's
open a vase
that's a stand right here we're using at
the bottom you define we wanted to use
open sans but my design calls for
different font it calls for it calls for
fiery sans now fortunately fire sans is
a like an open as a open kind of font
and you can find it on google fonts now
let me tell you let me tell you what's
up with google fonts open fire stance
and google fonts fonts I'm just using in
the whole design actually just used in
normal way of fire so I don't have to
get the Bulls and I think they do want
to grab the italics that do I use my
talent right here okay so on a grab
normal and normal italic and this link
right here is gonna leave me directly to
the app font face declarations
I don't want to include a link into my
HTML page I just want these font face
declarations so I'll copy these and if I
was being meticulous I'd probably leave
out you know the extended Latins and the
Greeks and the Cyrillic and just get
just getting Latins actually let's do
that so here we need to create we need
to go into tools and create a new
file called the fonts diet SAS nope
what actually wanted to be as CSS the
reason we want to be s CSS is because
these things you know they're already in
regular CSS notation style so like they
have their you know that all the
semicolons and the brackets so we don't
wanna waste our time on doing all that
so we'll just use them so copy that this
one is the italic version and then we
want to find the Latin for the normal
version have your honor so now we don't
now we're not importing like eight fonts
we're just reporting the one save that
and then go into our main SAS and
importer funds okay and then we go into
our going to our base and change this to
fire a fiery sans
let's take a look at that let me save
here and see the font just just updated
right there right or right in our
browser I love browser sync it's awesome
okay now we have the right family so we
don't need to type that out but we do
want to do the wait see it because it's
at h2 is naturally giving that bold
weight so we want to say waived is 400 I
wanted to have that same slimming
look.this up here nice elegant it's a
400 regular weight at 60 pixels font
size looks good it looks good
let's do this why tonight tighten it up
a little bit for for body text I usually
do like one point six line tie-in for
headlines if I want them really tight
I'll probably do like just one and
they'll crunch it up a little tighter so
that's that's what I'll do right here
now there's a bunch of others not just
the it's not just the About section but
a bunch of other sections are you gonna
use the home League class as well so I
want to find I think it's in Bayes so
base has a bunch of typography
declarations we have small and big and
like all these kind of classes right
here I think this is a good space to put
it so I'll say home actually no I
shouldn't put it in here this is the
best place to put this would be in
layouts to you why then the typography
here I'll say lead and home lead needs
to be font size is it 32 36 36 PX okay
okay good good and I'll give it that
same wine and height actually because
it's kind of a headline two of one a
little tight let's open it up a little
bit what one's good okay now let's get
rid of this text here because we don't
need than that in fact let's just get
rid of the whole column and what that
will do actually is will Center this it
will Center this headline in the center
and we don't want that we want it to be
pushed right and so we're gonna have to
make a new class in our you know in our
home set so let's go over to maybe call
after the columns what had like a helper
class on there called push right so they
add margin left and the margin left is
going to be equal to it's gonna be equal
to a column which is 300 pixels plus the
two margins on that one column which is
10 pixels each
so that's 320 pixels plus the width of
the margin that were removing or that
were supplanting from our first column
right so it's going to be 330 pixels for
the marginal left and let's add push
right on to column 1 yeah push right on
the column 1 all right now let's take
care of that the h1 h2 like being pulled
out because in our design we have this
style of it coming outside of the
outside of the margins just a little bit
let's see how much we asked for about
one hundred and K okay let's see what
yeah go to the h2 and how we're gonna do
this is we're going to add some margin
on to the left and we'll say negative
negative 1 of 8 pixels right brilliant
now in my design I noticed that I mean I
have a little bit more at the top I
don't want at the top it's a little bit
tighter up here if I have a lot more
space below so I want to identify the
home lead that's in just this section
about we have a different home lead that
takes care of the font size and the and
the line height but this one is going to
be a just adding structure
- or about section so we put that only
here and let's see and padding to the
bottom about when I do about 150 we
think a little bit more right okay
okay and I need to cinch up the top here
a little bit more - so I'll go into the
h1 it will say margin margin top is zero
yeah it looks pretty good I'm pretty
happy with that what you guys think cuz
you know the guns here all right now we
need to make sure that it looks good
when we have a smaller browser size
going on
it all looks good looks good looks good
and then pop right here we got the
sidebar going to the top but it still
looks good this section looks good we're
squeezing it in oh right there alright
see what happens here we get to the
point and I think it's like 640 right
we're we're a columns break and we did
find that in our home in our like our
layouts those columns watch what happens
to my text up here when the columns
break down here it's not pretty
that it's getting kind of hairy getting
kind of hairy like it's even worse as
this goes in yikes
okay so what we're going to do is we're
going to add a we're going to add a
media query to the
- I just added media query to the home
of the bug here say at media max with
equal to was at 640 right that's when
the break happens and in there we're
gonna take this section about take the H
- H - and we're gonna tink
hmm take the margin left and say auto
margin right and then you're max with
what the business oh I was thinking it
as that hard in the weird Martin we're
doing to pull but what's actually
happening here is our remember when we
did the pull pull right push right right
here mm-hm
you buddy let's do another push right
right here Marja left a lot oh no we
don't want it to be auto warranty 10
yeah that's what my problem was
okay squeezing you dance we sing in
looks reasonable reasonable reasonable
that's reasonable what do think they're
reasonable it looks really mean but if
let's say we got this on like a iphone
six-plus doesn't look too great what if
we did right here
you know you know wait what if we did
right here a max width 300 pixels so
it'll collapse lower than 300 pixels but
yeah see see and I want to do that to
paragraphs
only - there we go
this is looking nice okay so it big
looks fine coming down sidebars gone it
still looks good that looks good and the
inner looks good oh right so we got a
home section
fantastic now there's a little floating
Travis head at the top of my webpage I
fluff it now for the end of the video
where you mentally check out it and I
plug everything else I do chat me up on
Twitter at dev tips show sometimes I
share exclusive content there but mostly
I just misspellings listen to my sexy
voice whisper sweet nothings in your ear
on the podcast that I co-host here's a
snippet from a recent episode all you
have to do like in terms of design mmm
literally for road owned real long
specifically do what you got to do right
is look at those principles of design
and change it yeah there's like five ten
maybe I don't know there's six seven
actually yeah scale hierarchy rhythm
color balance symmetry you know like
just change something one of those
things pick one yeah be like okay
symmetry how do I change that yeah and
then see what happens
yeah an insight will come from that
change you know sooner then looking
around on behalf yep you can find that
podcast at trav and Louis calm send it
from my notes I said they'd insightful
or fun or just a dumb email to about 900
people every Thursday about a third of
whom read and enjoy it anyway you can do
that at travis nielsen calm slash notes
stop by patreon.com slash dev tips and
so
the show in fact this show was
generously supported by these people
these are my patrons not only do they
get the warm fuzzies but they also get
videos early and access to exclusive dev
tips chat here is something someone said
recently about their membership in the
dev tips patreon community you can find
out more about that at patreon.com slash
