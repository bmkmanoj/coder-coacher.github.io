deafness and I'm sitting with Brendan
getting him from the last video that we
did he reserved and we're all sitting
here with Jeff so it's an exciting day
today because we're talking about
foundation 6 which is the as of now
unreleased next version of foundation
and hopefully get this out before it's
published but this is the exciting
things we're gonna have a preview of it
going to show us a few highlights and
talk about the best use cases for it so
Brendan tell us about foundation 6 why
did you make a new episode looks like JJ
Abrams one directive you guys will be a
lot of fun there's a lot of improvements
that we want to make for a foundation
for site 6 here there's now three
foundations your chat about that I think
of a lot of stock if you haven't heard
about that go back Deb shifts you know
long ago a galaxy far far away and check
that out I think we're gonna get sued
for the last time we were here at serve
the chair of the description but um so
what is different this time uh yeah
we're we traveled actually observed
world tour we went to a lot of different
locations I went to Hong Kong myself in
New York some Jovians went to Australia
Ontario Canada a lot of fun places and
we talked to a lot of people and we
talked to a lot of people just you don't
want to see you talk a lot of on their
agencies and see how people you know do
their Studios work and to talk about
Foundation and you know I met I put a
lot of foundation meetups a lot of
things we've heard from people were
things that we had gripes ourselves
right so that frameworks are sometimes
bigger than they need to be so one of
the bigger things that we did was the
CSS in foundation is now actually as of
today I think like 40% this or so yeah
yeah the last version foundation that's
the rule
lot of different methods of pulling out
a couple plugins that are rarely used
and put into their own repos but this
was one of the things that we didn't
necessarily actually have that much
savings from the authority of it was
probably just from refactoring one of
the SAS to be more efficient yeah I was
like really aggressive like pruning of
like kind of bad CSS or like bad uses of
Stasik sometimes we were using SAS in a
way that was actually people learning
our CSS output we did always realize it
and then a lot of it was also just
making components like simpler in
structure and style but she have even
more CSS we loved it that was we were
like obsessed with everything just just
stringing that file size you know the
11y friendliness trying to make sure
that people who build with foundation it
some cases are almost forced to build
with accessibility standards in mind we
saw the responsive design was helped
quite a bit I think as far as its
popularity by frameworks in general
we're hoping to do the same with
accessibility in design so it's an
important next step the next uh next
like playing the wave right now
exactly yeah right and then we're and
you don't think it's really sad that it
was this long before that flag started
getting waved on the internet again
is he not the early 90s with a lot of
that stuff I've been 90s a lot of stuff
and then we kept the kind of dropped off
there's been amazing people in that
community the whole time being like
please those under us and everyone is
now and we have a lot of good people you
can reach out to us and help us do that
because yeah a lot of stuff it's really
unless you have experienced diverse and
my own to a conference just two weeks
ago and there was a gentleman speaking
about accessibility and he had a vision
impairment and he showed us how he uses
his screen reader and how fast it wasn't
and everybody in the audience we were
all have a dumb space attack but it's
like yeah okay we will do we're sorry we
just need to like send him across to
every month and it's in America and I
think everyone go yeah yeah it was
pretty good someone so what do we got to
show today
yeah Jeff's gonna show us a couple
things most of what he's going to show
us long in the stuff we've done to make
our nation more of yours so how you can
custom
a lot of the areas of sass and I guess
I'd love things in foundation easier
than you ever could before so Jeff is
gonna go ahead and show us off some some
sweet sweet stuff and yeah I'll turn it
over to Jeff is it alright alright yeah
so a lot of December showing today's
dinner walk around sass so sass
something we've used very heavily and
foundation since version three and you
can actually part of version two as well
for version six we were trying to very
aggressively audit how we use fast just
so that we can get more efficient CSS
out of it the mall so show some some
from JavaScript as well as a little bit
about what we're doing with our likes
like blank starter project templates
we've always had four people but we're
kind of trying to suit those up a little
bit just to make them more useful for
people so the first thing I'll show here
is just a few things around the sass so
you know in a common criticism of
frameworks which is you know more or
less deserve is that you know they often
invite people to just kind of print all
the CSS as it is regardless of if
they're using it or not you know people
thrown around statistics like Oh
on the average bootstrap or foundation
site only like 25 percent of the built
in CSS that should be used by the
developer so for responsive design for
people with slow network connections
this is a huge deal because it's a lot
of extra code that's been sent to you
that is not even being used in your
design so foundations always have ways
to strip out components but it's always
been a little hard for people to
understand so we've been trying to make
that as simple as possible so that
people will have an immediate
understanding of how to get a default
CSS mm framework and if they don't want
to use the default CSS but still want to
use the internals like how they do that
so like a common example of that big
grid you know we give you you know small
12 medium six large four columns and
that's like 50 classes which are really
good for making a sec quickly they're
not always good for making a base
sustainable because you end up repeating
yourself in a lot of different places
without your crit classes so with that
in mind you know for example you might
want to turn off our grid classes but
still used all of the mix ins that we
wrote to build a semantic rhythm so as
an example where we wanted to be easy to
get the guts of the framework but not
our default CSS okay so this is what now
a a kind of starter a CSS file and a
foundation project would look like
so the popular importing foundations
walls motion UI which is our recently
open source library forage and component
transition and innovation so this gives
you the entire framework at once but
just as importantly lumen doesn't
actually print out any CSS but it still
gives you access to everything in the
framework so you know I can get to I get
to a grid column mixin if I want to and
get like my primary color I can do any
of those things but I haven't actually
printed any CSS yet the CSS itself is
stored in individual component mix-ins
so basically every file or whatever you
make like a starter project for
foundation you'll just have this big
list of components and now turning them
off is as easy as just commenting them
out so if I want the grid I can turn off
but you know I still have the ability to
use all the crib Nixon so cambric row or
grid column your composition things like
that so creates a very clear separation
between what are the internals of the
framework but the pieces like like you
can use the tools be used to build the
CSS or you can just use like CSS as is
so we think by making this very
transparent like this we're hoping that
it'll it'll kind of make developers more
inclined to believe think about what
pieces of the framework they're using
because if they don't use half the
framework and we even find this in some
of our client work here we don't always
use you know breadcrumbs or to use the
schedule information five the pricing
table which have been removed in
foundation six there's no longer any
pricing table so cover the pricing table
yeah so there's a lot of things like
that was like okay you know we we've
dropped with the puppy we drop
components people didn't use that much
and the pricing table was kind of be key
example we've we moved you can still
have access to that yeah we cooking with
it somewhere yeah we have but it's not a
thing a framework or like a new art
frame or doesn't need to do it's too
specific in its use case it's not a real
like scaffolding
you know component so yeah so this
basically aren't half done a CSS so the
next thing I'm gonna show is some
features on the grid you know perfect
bridge the signature component of
foundation we've always had grid mix-ins
in foundation for six we've tried to
make them a little bit easier to use and
we've also wanted to add new features to
the mix ends to allow you to create more
customizable grids so if you've ever
used an
or Susie or Jeep I flip those twos that
they would like like that your money or
that maybes like crazy for definitions
you can build and we kind of want to
introduce some features like that so
that users can have more control over
their grids if they don't no way to
learn people holding to a 12 column grid
so I'm kind of show what that would look
like so let's say that we have maybe
three classes for our grid you know we
have a container we have a main content
area which this day is going to be you
know like eight columns right so with
the green classes you say like a large
eight and then we'll have a sidebar
which might be like large for so the
first thing we'll do is say include grid
a row and this is the same as in
combination five so now my container
class has all the structure of a row
and then the side of that we can say for
it column and only to be a shorthand
version of the mixin that we have since
axis introduced mobile first we always
want to start with like a 12 column wide
you know column for our at mobile styles
we didn't want on my great stack on a
small screen so normally for that you
say like three column twelve like I want
this to be 12 out of 12
but because 12 the default I can just
include it as is and I can do the same
for my sidebar the next thing I want to
do is I want to change the size of the
grid column within a media query then
media queries we've also made easier to
use in foundations 6 before we use
string interpolated variables it looks
something like this and strain
interpolation is probably one of the
more confusing things for designers you
have to like reason about like how
exactly it works no designer observed
even any idea like I know they don't
know the gosh
so there's a hash tag in there so
instead you don't have a breakpoint
mixed in and this actually allows us to
do things beyond for the string
interpolation will have this to do so
I'm going to use a word medium because
your foundation has just kind of
built-in breakpoints like small medium
large extra large so I can just say a
complete breakpoint medium and then the
sine of that will stay pretty column
size eight that is on the size when I
call them and then I can do the same
thing in my sidebar I can say fork so
this is basically how you build a
semantic grid in foundation 6 then uh
now the nice thing about this mixin is
actually it has more flexibility that's
using the named breakpoints I think
things like medium only or I can say
medium down if I don't want to do things
mobile first or I can put in any
arbitrary value I won't admit unit so I
can say maybe 500 pixels or a 5
megapixel down I can use REM values if I
want the nice thing about this is that
we always convert every single value to
an end at the end because some browsers
still don't have a remedy to queries but
we're able to just convert all those
values for you no matter what you want
to put in one that's cool yeah so just
put that back at medium so there are
other things we can do this actually we
can we can actually do that work kind of
precise sisal comes so one feature
people have been various shouldn't have
any foundation is the ability to have
basically multiple kinds of prints so
typically the foundation you have a
12-pound grits all your grits are going
to be back structure you can change the
global default column count but you
can't mix them you can't have like a
12-pound grid like a 7 column grid
although realistically the main number
to people it is 5 into by 12 by 16
divided by 2 3 4 and 6 but not 5 so 5 is
something that people often want to do
in britain they can't for the 12 column
structure so what i'm going to do here
instead of saying 8 I'm going to say for
example to say that I wanted to do like
7 palm grid so for this one I'm gonna
say 4 of 7 so that's going to give me a
a four column grid with a 7 column
context which you know is realistically
I'm just dividing 4 by 7
rather mostly just divide numbers so for
this one I can say 3 of 7 at the next
one - so now I've basically broken out
of the 12 column grid then I've been
able to kind of create a custom
definition now the other nice thing here
is I can even get more specific by one I
can just type in a percentage if I know
what I want I can type in a decimal or
like I said before I need to say 4 of 7
and it's going to do that math for me
now the nice thing about this is that we
can actually extend it a little bit
further so if for example you like up
here our row doesn't know that it's
seven columns with both of the
individual columns do so we can actually
make this code a little bit more
succinct by kind of planting the 7
column definition up here so to do that
let's say we're gonna have a weird grow
together realistically this is a weird
row so we say food grid row
so when I did printer up here I just
kind of used it as is if no parameters
there's no parentheses yeah so when I do
it this time I'm actually going to give
it a column count and then I'm going to
that's more code inside of the Vixen so
now every time I create a column inside
of this row it's automatically going to
have seven columns so I have a weird
main content which is four so now I want
to say four seven anymore because it
already goes at seven columns I just say
four and then I can see weird sidebar
and I will say three and it
automatically goes into three out of
seven so that's your handy so we have a
lot of little enhancements like this
like this right the biggest thing there
one feature we are working is responsive
gutters so you'll be able to change the
spacing between columns on different
screen sizes and have that be responsive
the mix-ins themselves are a little bit
more robust so for example if you know
what push and pull is in foundation for
source rendering we've conveyed that a
little bit easier to reason about so I
can say great column position if you
want to push something forward you use a
positive number like maybe they put a
push for three because I'm starter in it
if you want to pull backwards you use a
negative number as we can just kind of
combine those two into one thing that's
nice and every single feature of the
grid hasn't mixed them like this so we
can do Center if we want and then if we
needed to change it in a different
screen size we could say on center and
you know we have the same thing for
margins you can do offset you can do
source or any previous do everything you
want to do in the classes you can also
do any nixon's as well and this is going
to let you create without how to use all
the residential classes if you want well
maybe even for largest are elements I
think like agenda showing right here we
we do like to say okay if I have a main
content area that I know it's going to
be on 50 pages it is a lot easier to
call the main content area a lot more
semantic obviously been saying eh yeah
because like the grid definitions can
get really long if you're not careful
like you can end up with things like
okay here's a column and then it's gonna
be like all right medium six large four
oh but I want to source order it so I'm
doing you know medium push six and large
push four so now I have
five classes here and if I ever cut and
paste it somewhere else for a different
layout and I didn't change it I could
change it in every place at once it
would be a lot easier if I could just
say pain and then say sidebar so that's
that's kind of a benefit of Vixens but
we know that like they're both
approaches are useful in their own way
which is why I could give people the
option yeah yeah and end of it when were
you know rapidly creating something and
serve we want the ability to just you
know use these presentational classes as
quickly as possible and then having to
think about ethics and rank like that
right and and it's also a really great
way as far as I'm handing off code to
people who are going to continue to
tweak it after you just to say like a
little bit of changes here a little
things like that yeah and we have
clients that about halfway through a
phone call will be like okay I want that
then a sidebar would do a little bit of
Biggers maybe pick that a five and they
have no even code is the grit they
figured it out yeah so then the last
thing that will show the sass is some of
the customizable aspects so using some
newer features in SAP sort of come out
like the past year year and a half we've
been able to make the framework a lot
more customizable
so for example break points foundation
ships with five quick points right now
and small through extra extra large and
you know give you like three grid
classes right so you can do small medium
large classes so there's kind of a
subset of the breakpoints that you can
use his actual CSS classes it was very
difficult in foundation 5 to actually
create new breakpoints even changing the
default values was a little harder than
it should have been because of the weird
way that you set it up so with that here
is basically your new method of
configurable breakpoints you have this
sass map and basically you have the
names of your breakpoints on the left
here as keys and then the value of each
one is the kind of minimum width of that
breakpoint and these are pixel values
what we do convert them to ends once
again because we prefer your kind of
grams and nibs over pixels so with this
you know it's very easy to change the
default values if I want I can say this
like 640 it's easier for me to add new
values of Pi 1 mm thick soles it's also
easy for me to change the names of the
breakpoints apply one so I don't have to
use sizing classes like this you may
have saw the example that I erased off
there which is kitten fighting the
breakpoint on kitten that is 2,000
pixels men
I can do that and basically the
framework is going to be aware of all
these things in timing book places so
when we use that breakpoint mixin we're
able to reference any of the breakpoints
in this list up here so I can say
include break point kitten and then I
know that I'm going to get a minimum
width of 2,000 pixels and I can say you
know getting down and it's going to be
only that break point range and down or
I could say old Li and it's only gonna
be within that range and then this is
just great for organizations in general
maybe you know particularly meeting
schemes are using or again a family well
I've become ADIZ maxine code bases that
their break points are named like handle
active desk or so yeah and maybe they
just make more sense so maybe there was
like legacy reason or it was just one
crazy dead Kristin see is this Trixie's
Papa Bear mama bear baby bear like I
don't think you need to do that you know
like just saying there's more
yes--that's jerax other using explore we
have our break points but then in our
CSS we have that kind of subset of the
break points that we actually want to
use in our code so you know by default
foundation is small medium large which
means that you know when I have my grid
I can say like you know small 12 medium
six large four by default I can't say
extra-large - if I want to so this was
also an option in foundation 5 once
again like it was actually only French
the large so there wasn't any
flexibility and create new breakpoints
or building CSS out of those and the
reason we do that is just because
presentational classes are just
expensive in smile sighs nobody by
adding another breakpoint in you're just
increasing and printing out more the
hour so if you want to do that download
the SAS version add your yours your
breakpoint classes and you're all good
yep and yet I don't really feel like
most people have not needed more than
three break points for this kind of
stuff if three great career definitions
is already a lot to think about so most
people need
but of course we want to get people that
flexibility to do it
you never know I'm the github
discussions right now as a lot of people
talk about TVs and things and and our
TVs and we've done a lot of stuff in
that space lately is that it's not
unnecessarily about whiter it's probably
your TV's probably about the same as
like a tablet and what you want hewing
wines you just want to increase that rim
value so that everything is yeah it's
like that was the many people asked
about TV break points like what TV is
already makes one twenty by ten eighty
it didn't but about the difference of
the viewing distance so view is being
bigger but there's no media queries for
what a device thinks it's distances
which would actually be like really
interesting yeah that's good on that
browser matters w3c yeah yeah yeah so I
want to add that extra class I need to
do that extra large to this list here
and then if I go into my code I don't
get them do extra large extra extra
large if I wanted so and the last
example of customizability here is in
typography we have a lot of other little
examples like this it will have this for
the responsive Gunners for the grid as
well basically ways you kind of define
things based on breakpoints so here
we're actually showing you with the
typographic scale where the headings are
on different screen sizes so become free
to find these two based on specific
ratios there's a default scale more
compressed and then a mediums screens it
up there is a wider scale that kicks in
but if I want to do like and you know
just happen to the breakpoints that I
have up here I can just say like oh you
know Marge whatever the height you just
copy all these values and I can make a
new scale and all these things are
interrelated and we have other examples
like that where if you have like a menu
maybe and your menu is like vertical on
a small screen where you're more narrow
and you might say like medium horizontal
like so that exact system up here is
being tapped into where you're saying
okay I know that there are four
breakpoint classes if I want to say like
extra-large vertical to pull it back I
can totally do that so it's actually not
just the grid that is aware of these
breakpoints actually other responsive
components as well that's kind of our
customizability aspects of the
foundation it was get a lot of that
through just uh using a lot of newer
features and sass again you know cuz I
kind of computer pushes you have more
features for framework developers
specifically like they've got features
around like building selectors and
things like that or you're probably
using variables in different ways a lot
of us I'm super useful for people like
us yeah like there are definitely things
that like normal people who use staffs
do not need the average stats developers
not need features like this but it's
super nice for us because we can make
all these awesome tools well so when is
this available I don't actually get all
on one week from today which is not the
day of the launch the next so November
19th this will be pushed out to the
community and we're ridiculously
exciting there's been a little light
it's been a long time than making me get
this thing that's awesome and where can
we get it you can get it at
foundation.com and well will spit out
that direction and you can find all the
good stuff for that yeah that's awesome
thank you so much Brandon thank you so
much Jeff cannabis no mix we really
appreciate that you guys put so much of
your own time into these it's just a
really awesome gift well thank you for
having us on your amazing
ready so you guys say keep on hacking in
unison yeah why to keep on backing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
