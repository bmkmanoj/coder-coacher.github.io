tips I'm away from my normal recording
equipment I'm in tel-aviv so I decided
to share something special with you
today it's a little bit different than
normal one of the most common emails I
get from fans of the channel or of the
podcast or of my writing they often say
thanks that was really interesting and
really good and helpful but now what and
that's what I want to talk about so let
me introduce you to something called the
challenge graph this graph is a tool to
help us understand the efficacy of the
work that we do
ok this tool this graph was first
presented by and I always get this name
wrong I'm sorry but his name is Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi and if I got it wrong
I'm sorry but he's the author of the
book called flow the psychology of the
optimal experience so now I'm going to
draw this graph for you on on this iPad
and we'll do like a split screen thing
ok first we have the x-axis which
represents skills and then we have the
y-axis
which represents the challenges now
according to chicks with me hi we all
start right here when we're learning
something new you worked hard and it
felt good and you want more so what do
you do now well according to this graph
one of two things can happen the first
is that you move to position to position
to means that you improve your skills
every day to the time when the things
that you're doing become easy and maybe
even a little bit boring and that's what
this is right here this area is a
potential for the work that you're doing
to become not challenging boring you get
stuck in a rut the other option is to
move to position 3 which is up here you
have increased the challenge and it's
often above your level of skill you're
trying to move quickly and learn quickly
and it can often lead to frustration and
stress and if you go on too long it can
even break you down
cause you to give up so this area we're
gonna call anxiety now the ideal
position to be in is right here in that
middle in that in number four which is
like this area right here called the
flow channel this is when your skill and
your challenge is met up nicely and
you're experiencing that feeling of flow
and so what you really need to do is to
get back to position of four you need to
get inside that flow channel and it's
really simple once you understand this
chart if you're at position two in your
board you just need to increase the
complexity or the challenges that you're
facing yourself with and if you're a
position three you need to stop
roll it back a little bit and find a
place where the challenges that you're
trying and attempting meet your skill
you need to be pushing yourself I'm not
saying make it easy for you guys what
I'm saying is that you need to have a
harmony between the challenge and skill
it needs to push you so you can see your
skill and grow but that moment of flow
that's the optimal experience that we're
looking for which except Mihai explains
that this is why flow activities lead to
growth and discovery one cannot enjoy
the same thing at the same level for a
very long time we get either frustrated
or bored and it's that desire to enjoy
ourselves to get inside a flow that
leads us to push ourselves to stretch
our skills and discover new
opportunities for using them when I'm
creating my whole goal is to achieve a
flow state even maybe even more than
creating something valuable for others
if I'm completely honest all I'm ever
really doing is chasing that drug called
flow thanks for watching I really hope
this was helpful I originally presented
this idea in a newsletter that I write
every week to people who follow that
it's on Travis Nielson comm slash notice
if you like this video um let me know
because I might share more of this stuff
in the future I have over a hundred
notes in the archives that I've sent
my subscribers things like this and so
if you want more of this style of video
let me know in the comments down below
and a huge thank you to the patrons of
this channel who are so supportive of
the work that I do and we literally put
their money where their mouth is and
support this channel with every every
new video we come out with and they also
enjoy other things like early videos
hangouts dev tips chat and a patreon
podcast learn more at patreon.com slash
deaf tips see you next week when we pick
up to the CSS animation series we have a
few more episodes on that and until then
keep on hacking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
