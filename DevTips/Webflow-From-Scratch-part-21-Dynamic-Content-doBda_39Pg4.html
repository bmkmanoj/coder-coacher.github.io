some webflow thanks for tuning into web
flow from scratch
part 2 last week in part one I taught
myself how to get started with web flow
and also how to make a navigation that
is responsive and then I also went back
and we did you know that about section
on our project is pretty pretty fun
stuff I also said that I'd be giving out
a free coupon for a web flow Pro account
that's a $420 value and that coupon goes
out to Benny s right it's called you
emailing Benny later on this week to
give him but you know the coupon to sign
up get your free blood flow Pro for a
year account I will be giving away
another web flow Pro account at the end
of this video so stick around same kind
of rules apply and we'll see you on the
other side of the video for that but
right now we're gonna learn how to
create dynamic content and stick that
into our web flow layouts it's pretty
cool stuff I think you'll like it okay
in the last video we did the headers and
first section here and we're gonna jump
into the second section which we have a
big old blank spot here for let me show
you how I got that blank spots hey I
took a footer and I made the height of
the top margin 500 pixels because I
didn't like how it was like budding up
again like I like to scroll past the
bottom like that anyway
so what we're gonna do is insert the
next section section to let's take a
preview of it in Photoshop this this
mock-up says it's number two recent
episodes in your earholes and then
here's just some placeholder text and
then we have the actual podcast episodes
and I'm just looking at the content
right now I'm seeing a date I'm seeing
an episode number I'm seeing the title
I'm seeing a lot of place a thumbnail
I'm seeing a player and I'm seeing the
show notes I'm also seeing for the
second and third episodes a player
headline date and those things but no
show notes and I'm also seeing the
colors of the border reverse and also
this is
like the color of the play head is
switched out now that unfortunately is
something that I cannot control because
it's a part of the embed that comes from
the server of our podcasts simple cast
they control like you know what it looks
like you can choose if it has a light
background or a dark background but you
can't like specify the color of the play
button and stuff although I do like how
this looks I can't do it and then a
button that says subscribe and then a
prompt to load more so what I want to do
is jump into how webflow handles
databases basically and we're gonna use
kind of like a like a blog loop if you
will on the home page and then when
somebody clicks this button here load
more it's not gonna load them in line
it's just going to take them to like a
full page right cool
so this style here the title and the the
paragraph are you know they're the same
thing we've seen up here so let's I
think a really fast way to get started
on this section would be this to start
right here and kind of actually right
here in this home section I'm gonna hold
option and drag out another so now we
have two home sections it should be two
number one so yeah great
and I'm gonna delete that and I'm gonna
delete that and we do have a button at
the bottom so I'll leave that button and
I'll change it to say subscribe via
iTunes okay cool cool button dude
alright thanks man
this one is also going to be any to
change the text here too recent episodes
in your earholes
okay so now we have kind of the setup
for this section and I need to figure
out how to get the data inside here and
I'm not totally sure how to do this and
this is like really the fun of this this
series is that we're exploring how
simple web flow is now I understand the
basic concepts of it I know that we're
gonna be using these things which are
called collections these are basically
like database tables
and I currently don't have any
collections and I could watch this video
which I probably will end up doing you
know how things are but I'm just gonna
try to get started and I mean like I've
worked with databases and like things
before I get it you know key value pairs
and you pull in loops and stuff I'm
assuming it's gonna be very similar but
like but like with GUI you know like a
graphic user user interface so let's try
it out I'm gonna create a new database
or a collection in the parlance of web
flow collection settings the collection
name is going to be called podcasts
podcast episodes episodes and plural
version podcast episodes singular
version podcast episode that makes sense
they have some templates here and I'm
imagining blog blog would be like
different fields so here on the editor
preview on the right I'm seeing
collection URL this will not be editable
after this collection is created late
nights dot with podcast episodes podcast
episode page okay so this is the like
the slug basically and that that makes
sense to me podcast - episodes I might
shorten it to just episodes I like that
mmm collection page template is created
for your podcast episodes in the pages
panel pages panel Oh a collection page
template okay so that's the the
collection page template is like if I
click more it will create the you know
the actual like in the in the language
of WordPress it will be like single dot
PHP if you will you know I mean it's
like that single page for a blog post in
this case a podcast episode post okay
make sense collaborators can create and
edit podcast episodes in the editor
that's what I want that's great
structure for each podcast episode okay
so here we're getting into like the
table the fields basically so name is a
required field and that's what this is
web flow comm slash episodes slash
example cool and I'll add a field here
there let's go over to my current
website and this is a this is a page so
there are a few pieces of data and they
kind of resemble what we have over here
right we have date number title this is
a thumbnail and these are the show notes
we have your date title we don't have
episode number here but that won't be
too hard I don't think we have the
thumbnail a download link and this is
the description I don't do very long
descriptions lo stays really long ones I
don't because they're boring
so what I want to do is make sure all of
the fields that I'm creating in this
editor match the needs that I have so
the first one let's cancel out here okay
so the first one is name that's the name
of the episode got it number two would
probably be date but like I can here we
are other fields like date created date
edit and a publisher automatically added
so I want a thought so we do need an
image for the thumbnail so I'll label it
some name nail and save that field and
we need also what do we need here
episode number I don't know if that will
be captured number number number field
oh this is cool when you hover over it
it like changes this to the right so
give you a hints number it could be
interesting let's make a number field
just in case and then we'll just delete
the field if we don't need it I'll say
episode
number and then save that and what else
do I need I got the name number
thumbnail I need a description so let's
add another field this could be rich
text episode and description or I'll
just say I'll call it show notes and
help her text no no it doesn't matter
and the last thing I need is the this
this embed code so let me go over to
this is my back-end for simple cast
where we host our podcasts now we have
this embed code right here which is
basically an iframe player here and so
if I copy this could that be wet
let's see add field this is the embed
code now plain text
embed code single line okay so this is
looking pretty good in terms of all the
data points we need right we have date
everything else we don't need okay
episode number
let me move episode number up because
it's kind of like you can drag these
things around I'm noticing here
thumbnail shownotes embed code okay so
I'm gonna create this collection and
that creates kind of like the template
for all of the podcasts that we're gonna
be running through so now I need to
create the first one you have zero
podcast episodes in your collection
create some fake ones fake content can
help you start designing faster this is
cool add five or ten and twenty items
I'm assuming it just fills it all in
with lorem so what I'm gonna do is I'm
just gonna I'm not going to do that I'm
gonna create a first one here and I want
you to watch me create the first entry
into this collection the first episode
and then after that I'll like I'll like
jump cut to having four or five in there
okay so the first one let's go back I
already have that embed code paste
mm-hmm let's get the let's get the title
here meditation made easy and that's the
name of it
episode number episode number is 92 I
can get that from my URL the other one
so let's call that 92 thumbnail I'll
just save image as I'll save this to my
desktop and then
and then I'll just upload it here and
show notes and grab those just one
sentence that's fine and we have the
embed cut right there cool so I'm gonna
create the podcast episode and here it
is okay so I'm gonna cut right here and
then I'm gonna make like a few more okay
so I've got all these podcast episodes
kind of like added in there I took a few
minutes to add these episodes entire
podcast episodes collection got that
right let me get rid of this that's
annoying okay
episodes these are the episodes cool
good okay let me close this now now what
I need to do is I need to get that
collection displaying as like a dynamic
element and there is this thing right
here called dynamic lists and this is
kind of what we want so I'm going to
drag it in here and I want it to go
right above this button right okay right
above the button yeah okay cool so now
what we have to do is connect this list
to the collection that what you just
made and we only have one collection so
when we choose a collection there's only
one there boom so there it is four and
there here's the titles of the names of
the items in that collection the podcast
episodes and you can like mess around
with different styles here like
different like I guess there's grids
built into this thing or just have them
full width and that's kind of what we
have right here it's like a full width
episode right so this is how you do it
this is this is the connection so what
you need to do now is get those titles
here's a heading put it in here and I'll
just call this episode
right episode number and then he has
like a okay let's just say episode 70
and then a dash like that like a cool M
Dash and then that's good
let's go out let's bring another one in
there another title heading put it right
above not above but we'll fix that
litter this is well say like it's
episode title okay and you see how let
me pull this ah pull this below that
working okay okay now you see how let's
go over this navigator you see how these
these two headings that I dropped in are
for each dynamic item now this dynamic
item here is actually all four of these
because when you look at this collection
there there are four items right so
there are four items in this dynamic
list
this is listing out all of them but
they're represented as one because it's
just looping over the the elements or
the objects in the database this is so
exciting okay so now what I need to do
is make this this heading I need to
connect it to collections so I needed to
say John lacks closing T handle acts the
future of design okay
so if you click this little gear you can
get from podcast episodes and then
select the name well this is exciting
this is exciting because it's like yeah
I'm getting the same like what's it
called like discovery rush that you do
when you're doing like JavaScript
JavaScript when I'm doing my JavaScript
you know like doing all that stuff it's
like the same emotion but like it's a
little bit
or weird because it's actually like if I
feel like it's like a not it's not
exactly a design editor but it's on that
level now I need to make sure that it
says episode and then remember I have
the episode number I wonder if I can if
there's like a span there a span element
container heading link text block what
is a text block this is some text inside
of a div block if I go here I don't want
to delete that so what I want to do is
create like a span and then have that
span control the episode number and I
can pull it in pull the episode number
in paragraph text link rich text block
quote these are all like block level
elements I need to end up
I need a label let's try to be sneaky
does this work form elements can only be
moved inside of a form block okay so
that's not gonna work
sorry web flow form elements snap maybe
I could write out 70 for each one
instead of just a number I don't like
that okay well here's here's what I'm
thinking I don't know what I'm thinking
I need to get this thing and amick what
if one of this
I'm in bed
that's right here
okay stop for a second what happened
episode 70 - the number so this is the
number that I want 92 91 90 89 so let me
delete this number and basically and
then put the - after that it's what I
want look look look look look look
so episode 89 episode 90 89 90 91 and -
and I just need to style this thing now
so I'll give it a class and call it
episode - number and then episode number
will get you know the bold look and it
will get you know whatever this is like
24 or something oh my gosh this is great
this is this is great cool so I got that
figured out episode 98 I got John lakhs
I need what else do I need any other
thumbnail so let's get an image an image
image image right here and bring that
into the thing it's good episode image
get image from thumbnail BAM we need to
make it smaller for shizzle
let's go and so call it episode - thumb
and what constrain it with max width not
100% but like like 80 pixels or
something and another 80 pixels cool 80
it might be too small in fact let's
measure what this says this wants to be
180 okay
yeah that looks good okay so let's do a
quick check here we've got episode
number title thumbnail we need a mmm
what's that thing called a date episode
8 that can be a text block no no text
block and get that from created that
published on date well it's not been
published yet so let's say create a date
okay so there and then we can also
choose these formatting so there's a
bunch of different ways to represent
that date he has a May 17 comma year so
October just like that okay
so now I'm not worrying about all the
design yet I'm just kind of getting all
the data in there so let's do a
checklist that got it got it got it got
it and then we need this embed code okay
I did the embed code on the collection -
so embed let's do that embed embed here
we go alright this will really either
just like make or break the whole
situation embed code embed code
oh no no I don't know to do that
why did that happen
why did that happen that must have
happened because okay so the the embed
code is getting rendered as if it's text
right but why and what can I do about it
I thought embed would be like code code
I'm writing some code code here to see
if see now this code code code code say
okay see where it says hey that's in a
strong tag so my question is why did
this code get rendered but the code that
gets spit out from this field right from
the collection not get rendered as code
well maybe I could render all of maybe I
could render all of this stuff as code
in the embed block thing there and then
the only thing that really changes from
one embed to another is that is the like
is the episode ID and since that gets
inserted as plain text let's try this
let's try this hey don't don't make it
hey put like plain text inside of a
strong let's say I like name okay so
plain text inside of an HTML tag in I
think okay this is getting too much for
my brain I need to I need to do this
okay here I'll grab this embed code copy
and get rid of all this and then if I
save it so the player here okay
so right now the embed code just has the
the idea of whatever one like copied
from this other site but if I can make
that ID the dynamic part see all these
timestamp numbers if I do this right
these timestamp numbers will change so
what I would need to do is what I need
to do is edit this collection I need to
edit the the embed code cancel I need to
edit individual bit embed codes okay so
simple cast get this embed code and
bring it in to my collection not here we
go not as not as this whole embed code
but just as this unique ID right save so
now I'm gonna go into these other three
and do that process right there I'll
jump in I'll jump back I'll be back in a
second it'll be like no seconds for you
but for me it'll be like two or three
minutes by okay we're back and I've you
know I put all of the just like the the
was called the unique IDs in the embed
code field so let's get out of here go
back into this place get rid of the
unique ID here and insert the embed code
okay so hopefully this will all render
rent this will all render as HTML and
the embed code will render as plain text
inside the HTML which means it will
switch out the actual embedded file okay
so hold on to your butt Oh check it out
check it out 50 minutes 47 minutes 27
minutes
one hour so in other words it worked so
oh my gosh I'm like so bummed right now
I feel like a mad genius when you figure
this stuff out so we have basically all
of the content sorted out right the day
episode number title
there's the embed episode thumb now what
we have to do is go in and style this
stuff okay so there's two two different
styles there's this one and then the one
the one right here which has the show
notes displaying and this one doesn't
and also they alternate colors which
might be hard and I don't know if web
flow can do pseudo elements we'll see
but if not there's always like the
custom code anyway let's get started
with with that so I'm gonna I'm gonna do
okay so here's what here's a tip guys if
you click on an element and you press
left or right you're gonna you're gonna
go to the siblings and if you click and
you press up you'll go to its parent now
down to its children that's pretty cool
huh so the thing is this thing dynamic
list
it needs some padding bottom how much
padding bottom
50 it needs 50 so let's say episode -
list and you need padding or margin
bottom 50 cool and this will call at
this OH - item and it needs to have some
margin bottom let's say 50 cool and then
you know I'm seeing that the date is
outside of this bounding box so I don't
want to put this border on the episode
item I want to create a new div inside
of the episode item right here dip block
it's just you know whatever here and
gosh that's a mess what do we got here
you have a div block I'm gonna move that
up here and though thumb is in it text
block what is text block I don't know if
that is i think that's the date HTML
embed heading where's that where's the
date that's called text oh it is
textbook okay so that's gonna go above
it and then all of these things here I'm
gonna go inside of it inside of it okay
and then I have a thumb and then we're
gonna have another div around these
things select a class for what the div
that I just made okay select a class for
the div I just made it's gonna be called
it's gonna be called episode text
because it handles all the text that's
fine let's put all of this stuff in it
because we're gonna put all the things
that need to float:left into episode
text like the episode number like the
HTML embed like the heading except for
the heading goes above the embed so
number and heading embed and then the
episode thumbnail and then the this is
should all be in a div block and then
text above the block and then the
episode item all right so let's see a
div block div block you need to be lets
say episode date you need to just be
like text right you know there we go
and like Smalling gray let's get this
color here copy and fourteen maybe
twelve okay that sounds good now episode
thumb and oh this thing here this div
block div block needs to be a pisode
inner wrap I don't know maybe thinks is
hard guys don't judge me episode inner
wrap and this is the thing that's gonna
have the border on it so let's make that
border it's gonna be like 10 pixels
solid black it's to a color of that it's
a default color this purple okay
and it needs some margin 10 pixel
padding wears padding 10 if you hold
ctrl and drag out no that's not it you
hold shift and drag out it affects every
one of these things so there is 10 pixel
padding you see all four of the sides of
the box model get that padding because I
hold hold shift when I drag if I hold
just I think it's option yeah just the
opposite side gets it but a little tip
for you throw a little tip bag right
there and then I need to go to I'm
inside the episode interrupt I need to
make this a what's it called flex and
this child you need to be flexed no
stretch and align Center no a-line top
whoa okay and you need to have margin on
the right let's say 20 let's say 50
let's say not 50 let's say 25 okay does
that look right guys hmm this thing
looks like it should be centered there
we go this is looking pretty good this
is looking pretty good
I'm noticing now that these are circles
so let's just do the circle border
radius 50% there we go it looks kind of
cool so circle and then what size do you
think this font is height 32 what font
is this hitting three episode number
this is going to be font size 34 and
line height right I don't know if the
line height should be just like one
yeah one's good Frank and then like
padding's and margins need to be okay
none heading three this thing needs a
class we can call it
episode title episode title you are
going to have a line height of one also
but we had changed this to - and what
was the height of episode number
the font size 34 so let's change this to
34 also I like it very much
we need more padding below that thing
the date so let's put some margin bottom
like 10 ok I'm noticing that this goes
only as far as the title here whereas
these ones go all the way because the
title is much longer so what I need to
do is find the press update to the
parent and you need to be a flex grow
which that this yeah flex grow and then
this one is flex don't grow so this one
will grow the full width if this gets
bigger let's make it smaller and see
what I don't can't do it okay let's get
tablet mm-hmm yeah that's fair okay but
this is looking pretty good let's take a
look again what it should look like
versus what it is this one needs to have
these things on the bottom this should
be purple but it can't be so don't worry
about it
subscribe via iTunes
how much space is here 50 right yeah I
think it looks pretty good guys pretty
good this color is a little different
than what I have let's see what we have
here copy this color can change hmm not
gray blue pretty happy now the only
thing left to do is to get this first
one to have more content in it and I
really don't know how to do that I'm
gonna cut it off there actually I'm
gonna cut it off there and I'm gonna
make another episode later in the week
and you're gonna see like a 2.2 of like
how to get this thing to be like a
featured element let's say and I have
like a little bit of a different
presentation and also I need to figure
out how to make these alternate in color
with a green border so it should be
interesting and I'll show you that later
