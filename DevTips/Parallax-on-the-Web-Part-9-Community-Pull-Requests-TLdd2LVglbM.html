knew that ah last week when I uploaded
the eighth video this series parallax on
the web I got a lot of comments and
emails like can't be over and looking
back I can tell why
dry your eyes you're far too pretty to
cry
welcome to parallax on the web video 9
while I've been making these videos and
posting them here on YouTube a lot of
you guys have been taking the code and
making it even better and you know
submitting it on github as pull requests
it's really cool so today I want to take
a look at those changes and improvement
and give some depth to those people
those deaf tippers who have submitted
the code and contributed to this
parallax on the web project just a word
before we begin this is actually the
third time I've done this video the
first time nothing recorded at all empty
file weird and the second time I did
record everything except for my face
didn't show up and none of this none of
this happened now you can make that
argument that that might have been a
good thing but in the end it was not
exactly what I wanted so this is the
third time I'm making this video now the
reason I say that is because what we're
doing today is pulling in poll requests
and instead of doing pull requests with
you live like I did in the first video I
am actually just showing you pull
requests that I've pulled in already so
that's going to be the difference that's
what you're going to be seeing but
that's okay let's just get started so to
actually see the pull requests let's
look here at the pull requests tab right
into so I'm in get on github comm slash
dev tips and then this is the parallax
repo the parallax on the web repo we go
into pull requests and go to close
because these are the ones that have
already pulled in in the in the past
videos it's been such a night okay so
we'll start here AJ speller just hacking
stuff this is really cool what AJ does
let's go to files change oh let's look
at his commit his commit is added code
that will only apply parallax
transitions while the bird box container
is visible so let me show you what it
means over here on the bird box this is
the bird box we have these parallax
elements going and they're animating
while you scroll the webpage
well what he does here is he sets up a
variable called P container hi
and it's equal to the height of that
bird box and so so you captures the
height of that bird box and then puts
all of this parallaxing code into a into
a conditional statement that says if if
the scroll position so basically if we
scroll past the height that is equal to
the height of that bird box then stop
the parallax so we're not going to be
parallaxing that box when it's off the
screen and so that's a really good
optimization it'll cut down on a lot of
the making the browser think about stuff
where and repainting stuff that's off
the screen anyway so that's awesome I
did pull that in thank you very much AJ
you are a boss going to go back to pull
requests and look at the next one
the next one is by Andrew P marks Andrew
modified the timing of the figure
entrances so let me show you what is
normal this one is the one that I did
and here all the figures when i refresh
here they're going to animate in right
and they're going to do so linearly
meaning that the time between the first
and the second one is the same as the
time between the second left third so on
between the eighth and the ninth right
so they're just going to not the
positive just like doo doo doo doo doo
doo not dang it I listen this is how you
do it doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
done right there's no there's no
difference in the timing of all but but
Andrew said oh I have a great idea and
let me look at it let's look at his code
first of all it's slowed that down that
was a little fast for him so taking was
it point three seconds to ease in he
changed it to 0.4 seconds and he made it
instead of going from 20 pixels it goes
from 30 pixels so kind of like made it
more dramatic by just changing those
numbers and then down here in the
JavaScript where I have just like a
linear 150 milliseconds between each one
he put a little bit more of a
complicated
was I think called math thing equation
down there now when i refresh this
you'll see that the the space of time
before we see you know between the one
and the two is going to be a lot shorter
than this the timing that happens at the
bottom between for example the the
eighth and ninth for example so refresh
see what kind of come in fast and then
slow out that's pretty cool I don't have
any problem with it it wasn't I mean I
like it so I pulled that one in thank
you Andrew you are also a boss next
let's continue on scroll down to the
bottom here unifying the background of
model - this is from Nick's Alistar
Nick's what have you done oh here we are
yes Nick's basically did not like the
background of the photograph so he
removed it this is cool fine yeah I
don't care that's fine uh what I didn't
want to show you some cool feature here
in github just as a side note so github
will mark the differences between you
know revised
code and also images I don't know if you
knew this but Gael will track the
differences between your images as well
so here on the Left we have the original
and on the right we have the modified
version now there's a few different
views that are kind of fun so here we
have the two of you you can go to swipe
view and you can grab these little
handle here and just kind of move it
across and see the new version like look
look around his ears you can see that
clipping path is a little aggressive cut
off a bit of his earlobe there both of
them now is your low bliss so um and
look at his hair is smaller - it's cool
you can notice these things a little bit
better when you're using the swipe view
and there's also another view called
onion skin which basically overlays the
old on top of the new and you can adjust
the empty up a city and see a
move in so that's just a little github e
thing I did pull in the yeah I did yeah
I did pull in the pull request because I
wasn't too picky about it and if it's
your preference Nicks
then I'm cool with that man we're cool
we're cool so I just really appreciate
you doing the work and contributing the
pull request so I pulled it in let's
continue oh you're also a boss yes
that's true okay um do do accurate promo
scope opacity so this is from Jax Dios
and what happens here is we go down to
this promo scope where are you promised
cope look at the code I have see see
this 400 here what that means is if you
remember it means I don't start the
fading in of the promo on top of the
periscope until the promo scope is about
400 pixels let's make a selection here
say yeah BAM 400 until it's 400 pixels
from the top of the viewport right but
Jax wanted the animation or rather the
fade in of that of that promotional item
to start at the beginning so he just
rewrote the code so where it starts here
and it ends here and while wow that's
not what I intended I wanted to start
later I wanted it to be a little bit
more of a slow reveal that's just a
design choice it's just that was just my
choice so I'm going to leave it how it
was I'm not going to accept this pull
request because I didn't want it to be
different from the people who followed
along in the code this is not really an
optimization it's more of a design
choice and so that's why I did not
accept the pull request but I still
think it's awesome that you did it I
think it's great when you guys are just
digging in experimenting with ideas like
you know Jax is like oh I think I want
it to be like this and then worked out
the problem of how it would be like that
and that is the that I mean that's the
reason I make these videos and put the
code on github so you guys can
experiment with
and try things and make them your own
and just be a boss so Jax you are also a
boss let's continue on continue on a
master ok so there's a ton of stuff in
here
that it was like really awesome and I
don't I'm not going to try to say your
name because I will ruin it but anyway
the the code that our friend has done it
is a is a lot a lot of stuff right so
like you can see there's no there's a
lot of requests in here but this one
here the relative pass is one that I put
into another branch and then accept it
so it's so it's his code but let me show
you what it does basically this this
commit is really good added relative
paths to all the assets so here's the
issue people would often comment in the
comments of the previous videos that
they would open up the code and there
would be no images where's my images
well when I develop this code repo I did
it on a local server so I used absolute
pass I didn't think much of it because
it's just kind of a normal thing to do
but when you just open up the click
click the index.html without having in a
development environment it can be it can
be confusing because there's no you know
because the images will be absolute to
your hard drive right your system hard
drive not the project folder so what
this does is it changes all if I see
these slashes here in the beginning it
changes them to dot dot slash and then
you know it basically just makes them
all relative to the document where they
should be and that way when someone
downloads the code and just clicks the
HTML the index of HTML it will show up
how they expect if you want to learn
more about relative and absolute paths
check out the html5 beginner series
there's a lot of really interesting
information that you know it's kind of
basic but also super useful like you
really need to know that kind of stuff
so check that out if you're not familiar
already
and let's move on polar quads closed
okay Master don't reposition the
elements too much this is by King King
one two three
don't reposition the elements too much
what do you mean by that
mm-hmm well this is really cool so the
idea is that when you're animating
things in like let's look at this bird
box here when I'm moving things around
sometimes I scroll and and the the
difference between one position and the
next is less than a pixel this is true
because the function can use decimal
places so let's say it moves like 0.8
pixels the browser will actually have to
repaint the image but it will be
visually the same as it was before so
nothing has really happened but we've
spent some JavaScript cycles so what
this poll request does is it sets up a
variable called offset and that offset
will look at just how far that scroll is
going to be and then it will put the the
code which moves things around it will
say if the if the new position is less
than zero don't do it if it's greater
than zero if it's a whole number or more
than go ahead and repaint right it's
pretty good that is going to save us a
lot of JavaScript brainpower and browser
load so this is a fantastic pull request
and I did pull it in King King one two
three you are a boss z-index and
overflow this is a good one this is a
good one by davido so there's two
problems here one is that when I did the
production code for this footer I did
not realize that the footer when you
have a like a short browser like on a
laptop or something the footer actually
comes on top of the bird box which is a
z-index problem and I thought that I I
thought that I got that but maybe when I
was coding
it for the video I didn't do it but
anyway and then the next problem is when
these are these posts here are way out
here they're outside of the of the
viewing area viewport they cause the
browser to have a wider limit you see
this how it's like a horizontal
scrollbar I didn't catch that because I
have a a Mac and the scroll bars are
kind of like not there unless you're
scrolling so it's like a style thing but
it does cause that problem of you know
not catching those horizontal scroll
bars so what I love about this PR is
it's very very clear on what the changes
are and what the problems were so
Advaita included images it's right here
so here's an image of the the footer
being on top of the bird box and here's
an image of that horizontal scrollbar
that if you're gonna do PRS um including
images is so cool it's so helpful for
the person who's like like trying to
understand what the what the problem was
and what you fix so anyway here's how it
was fixed basically go to the content
box and put overflow:hidden so now those
that those scroll bars won't show up
because they're not they don't need to
be rendered outside of their parent
container and then we also have to some
z-index fixing and moving around here
and that that made the footer work
better so thank you so much davido you
are a boss I did pull that one in also
now those are are those are the ones
that I pulled in those are the closed
poll requests I have two that are open
so let's take a look at those the first
one is called little image adjustments
and it's funny that they're little lid
images doesn't look at how long this PR
is so many different things now that's
actually why I didn't pull it in because
the PR is so complicated and what
happened was a little idea from lugal
turned into like a big change and there
are some really good things in here but
they're mixed in with a whole bunch of
other decisions that are not going to be
kind of
relevant to people watching the videos
later on and let me show you what I mean
Luke will created a space on their
domain to show us an example and let me
show you it's actually really cool so
the first thing you'll notice is this
fancy schmancy spinner look how cool
that is that was a part of the poll
request we never covered it in the
videos which makes it me which makes me
kind of like you know hesitant to
include that in the in the in the code
repo and people who download it later
will be like what so but this is it this
is a great example of someone taking the
code that we do here and just making it
their own really owning it so for
example this this bird this image right
here just flipped around flip the bird
flip the bird flip the bird get it
flip the bird anyway um and added a
subtitle for this these hovers are
really you know instead of zooming up
they sue and reveal a really interesting
blue border we have we have 2 promo
scopes one for a winter collection and
one for the autumn collection oh and
look at all these new images right so
looool included all these new images I
just had these three dudes that would
just like repeat because I was being
lazy but lougle sorted it out and then a
new style for these blog posts of bigger
images and full width and then also
there's another post here at the bottom
that that still kind of parallax's in
you see how the rate of the the movement
of that boxes is is more than the rate
of my scroll and it's three columns wide
which is really cool so these are all
great additions and then also the color
change here in the footer these are all
great great additions and really awesome
the reason I decided not to accept this
pull request is because it changed
things too much visually you know and
the problem would be were people coming
in you know off of the videos to be
confused by it so but this is a great
example of someone really owning the
concepts that we talk
out and making them their own fantastic
lougle loo gold TK you are a boss let's
go back to the poll requests this last
one is from Marcel Marcel I never made a
pull request actually yeah he had
emailed me the code I would normally
wouldn't accept that but what he did was
like really cool so let me show you this
post title down here these guys they are
linear in the way that they animate in
right they are the same speed all the
way and then they just suddenly stop
right so what Marcel wanted to do was
add easing into that and you can see his
code here
I was changed a lot of interesting you
know JavaScript thinking goes into this
and you know in fact Marcel made a video
about it which is really awesome made a
video about his decisions and the
changes and you can see that video it's
about six minutes it's really really
informative really interesting I'll put
a link to that in the in the description
of the video that you're watching right
now and also it's a part it'll be part
of the playlist it'll be like an
appendix to this this series so let me
show you an example of the effects of it
right so here's the easing transition so
right now it's like a linear ease and
then when i refresh it'll be Marcel's
work which is more of a you see how
they're faster on the outsides here and
they come in there like a little bit
more smoother so it's like ooh that
feels good really really cool work
really is really smart kind of working
but I didn't pull it in and here's why
I'm it reactors the Java Script a lot
and they're not bad changes they're
really good changes but the problem is
is that they're drastic changes so again
I'm thinking about the person who's
coming in from washing the other videos
and what's their experience like if the
Java Script is nothing
like what they saw in the videos they'll
be confused disoriented and kind of have
a bad experience but what I did do
though is I made Marcel's work into a
separate branch so if you come to so if
you go to github.com slash dev tips
slash parallax on the web dev tips
you're going to have the master branch
which is like the code that you're going
to expect and then there's another
branch called post easing function and
that's by that's the work of Marcel and
so check that out I mean just download
it and see the work that he did and
watch the video that he made as well
it's really really good stuff now
that's all of the pull requests that
we're going to talk about today there is
one issue though so an issue would means
that he didn't submit any code just
wanted to talk about stuff this is from
alex booker alex says hey I kindly
request that you make a live demo
ideally using github pages I'm curious
to see the end result Alex did not want
to download the repo which is actually
very reasonable I mean hey watch this
video and if you don't want to get your
hands dirty you just want to see I just
go see what's going on why is there not
a demo available on the web that's
really weird Travis and Alex pointed
that out so let's just let's fix that
I'll show you how easy it can be because
of the tools that we're using we're
using github if I go back to the repo
page and go to the branches and create a
new branch and just call it G H - pages
gh pages is a branch name that is very
specific to github and I enter now we've
created a new branch called github pages
or gh pages what gh pages does is it
takes the code repo and renders it out
and puts it somewhere on github servers
so now if you go to dev tips dot github
do slash the repo name which is parallax
on the web dev tips you're going to get
a render of the project so you're going
to have the black bar at the top and the
dudes here the zoom and stuff the pair
of promo scope and everything so it's
all right here and it's all up for demo
now and thank you for this suggestion
the Fantasmic
suggestion by Alex Booker that's it for
this video I'm going to hand it back to
big Travis who's going to take us home
alright there we have it I am so pumped
that you guys have taken the stuff that
we've been talking about and changed it
and improved it and made it your own
that is incredible and that's not even
to mention a lot of you people who have
commented and written me letters saying
that you're using these things in your
own personal projects aside from this
tip tip project it's really really great
for me to just to hear that and know
that that's Austin now does this mean
that the the paralax series is over I
don't know I mean parallax is a really
big topic and there are a lot of
interesting things that you can do with
it and a lot of smart people who are
doing new things with it like everyday
so maybe we put like a to be continued
sign right there with a question mark
right after it Oh will it be continued
oh no I heard that Bill &amp;amp; Ted's
Excellent Adventure is getting a sequel
so pretty much anything is possible
alright let's wrap this up you know
these guys these are my patrons these
patients made this whole series possible
and in the duration of this series we
raised $500 to send to Nepal for
disaster relief and a lot of the patrons
told me that they were really excited
about the idea and glad that they could
be a part of that effort
it's really awesome patrons enjoy these
videos a little bit early and there's
also other benefits like a google
hangouts and we have a dev tips chat so
if you're interested in learning more
about being a patron and we really want
you to join us check out
patreon.com/crashcourse video series has
been really really big so many comments
and shares and like people are finding
depth tips because of this video series
and I just want to say thank you so much
for your participation and involvement
and excitement and enthusiasm and
support and encouragement and all those
kind of words that mean thank you for
incredible see you next week when we do
something entirely different and until
then you should keep on hacking what
else is there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
