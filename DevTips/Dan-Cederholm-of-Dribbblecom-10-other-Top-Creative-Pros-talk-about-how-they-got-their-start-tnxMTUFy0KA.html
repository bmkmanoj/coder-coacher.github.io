this is deaf tips au Tube channel where
we talk about website design and
development and we have an extra awesome
episode coming up ah so every now and
then I crawl out of the garage where I
filmed this show and go and meet people
and last Wednesday was one of those
times I was lucky enough to attend a
dribble comm meetup held at the yahoo
campus here in California I met a ton of
really awesome creative some who are
doing design so I'm doing development in
some doing both and this time I wanted
to ask these creatives a very special
question about how they got their start
namely what was that catalyst that sent
them upon the path of this creative
lifestyle now to start us off we have
the co-founder of dribble calm himself
mr. danzeeger hall
I'm dance eternal I'm the co-founder
animal and I think the inspiration for
me getting to design was a couple
different things there was I was a
musician and I was really the music
packaging and house also to
skateboarding and the branding that goes
along with that and so I think
throughout my whole life I was a
designer and didn't really know it until
the web came along and the web kind of
brought all these interests of mine
together in one place and gave me a
platform to create things on my own and
it's sort of I think it made it made me
realize that anyone could be a designer
if they want to be a designer great
things and the computer made that made
that possible I think a lot of it goes
is that I want to give back to the
people that taught me everything I know
about design from from the web and the
community on the web
and so I'm always grateful for that and
I want to give back to the next
generation of people that are learning
and I've always thought that the web and
the creative community online is kind of
an amazing thing and that you can it's
so supportive people are are
sharing their knowledge freely and I
always respected that and I always
wanted to do the same so that's why I'm
involved I would say you know don't
don't be afraid to
to design and call yourself designer and
do it I think one of the things that
tripped me up was that I always thought
you needed to go to school for you to be
specially trained or use certain
equipment to do it or whatever I always
thought like design was just this thing
that other things other people did and
it's not true I think apply this to
anything life really but just jumping
into it and experimenting and not and
not worrying about the products right
away just start experimenting and do it
and
I'm smashing and I got into design was
by
I think this bird since I was little to
organize everything and I think
the appeal of universe designs actually
bordering the pixels
that's what got me here and that's what
I'm keep doing it over and over again
just to
the world I guess the web maybe
I just need to do it it's like a therapy
and that's what brought me here I just
or in our Don it
I'm Mike I'm a UI developer at Yahoo and
how I got my start was making products
for engineers and focusing on the
usability aspect and how people interact
with
I made the transition by taking on small
like contract jobs at night and
eventually that connect group to become
my whole time
my name's Travis some Engineer here
Yahoo and I got my start pretty
traditionally I was a computer scientist
through school kind of got hooked by
starting my own company it's kind of in
the web space and then I jumped from
sort of the start up doing anything and
everything and then that landed me here
at Yahoo so I guess some nugget I'd like
to give to kind of future developers out
there would be to kind of explore
everything you know be it kind of front
end back end everything just kind of get
your hands in all the areas you never
know we're gonna be doing
hi Sean
a designer based in San Francisco and
still love to here by the school for
graphic design mostly focused on print
and I just saw the transition over time
that Franklin's not gonna always be
there it's the Train reading and just
the scene in the world so I went from
started learning about Web Design design
which is not where I'm at now so one of
the biggest things I learned after I got
out of school was that because she has
those transitioning from printing to
this web and mobile focus is not to give
up because I search for over a year for
a steady job doing odd things here and
there and I know a lot of people that
have given up in the process doing
something similar and if you're really
passionate and love what you do just
keep on doing it
hi my name is Susie and I'm going to
talk about how I kind of became a
designer in college I was majoring in
industrial engineering
in oil painting believe it or not and
right out of college I went to a big
Accenture and worked in their technology
labs which is where I learned about data
visualization and kind of gave data
visualization its own start at Accenture
and today amanecer difficult Silicon
Valley data science
and I'm a data visualization expert
which involves a lot of front-end design
and user experience and
having this huge massive data that's
really complicated you don't know what
stories are in it and finding those
stories and then being able to tell that
to I guess it was a lot of I was always
told engineering so we have to do
engineering so you have to do and I've
always loved the arts and kind of tried
to straddle both the Arts and Science
and
data visualization is
the closest thing I found that and I
still get to do both art and science so
it's been great
getting over that field to find
a real job that lets you to act
I would say that the side projects that
you're really interested in make a
really big difference they end up
affecting your work a lot I love seeing
influences from this
don't necessarily have to do with the
main focus good foundations that have
influences with me
you can see sheet music
design principles kind of flowing into a
visualization and things like that so I
think the biggest tip is continue with
those site projects
a lot of them turn out really well in
the state really influence your work
hi my name is Chris I'm going to tell
you about what my aha moment Britain was
I think when I was 13 I went to Maggie's
school
i T and at the time I was really focused
on engineering
I was learning the more I was seeing
that engineering was interacting with
the sign
I think the auto moment for me was when
the MacBook and its internal components
and found out about the logic board and
how
allowed us to make computers that were
more
well-designed and practical for use I'm
starting to see like we were able to
now think of a engineering solution in a
more design standpoint and I allowed us
to then think about him how
people and how to use computers and from
there I just started following design
although it may have been engineering
the complex everything about how to make
it well design and following from there
that led to me doing workshops in New
York City to learn about design from
other peers and then also taking courses
at school that focus around that and
eventually that led to me
Najim into the Silicon Valley
by some I give to young people starting
right now is I definitely look around
for variety of resources your friends
around you the internet books and just
follow your heart in terms of what you
want to learn and you'll be able to
pursue what you want to pursue always
keep an open mind to that
don't doubt yourself and always treat
because you want to create
that that's what I could
my name is such and how I got started as
I was I actually used to be an engineer
and I was building products in China
where we are making these stoves for
South Africa and so what we were doing
was very going through and we're trying
to build a perfect home stove for a
country we've never been to
we made these incredible stoves and then
we've set them all the South Africa and
the product absolutely so a couple we
ended up having
containers full of stoves that we had to
bring back and the reason was we had no
idea how people actually cooked it in
South Africa so we actually never been
there and when we finally found out how
people are using these things they're
using them on the ground
and crouched down in front of them and
what we had done would be reverse
engineered a camp which made no sense
whatsoever when you're cooking on the
ground so it was at this moment when I
realized there's this thing called
design that I didn't really understand
so why I understood how to make stuff I
didn't really understand how to make it
so that's what got me into go to go to
design school and start
lots of times people ask me like what I
think indicates whether like a company
or a small group of Design Center my
answer is always how much do they talk
to their use
maybe so for whatever it is that you're
making
actually using it and talk to them as
possible I think the biggest biggest
barometer for whether somebody's beside
suburbanite is how letting they are to
ask questions and show whatever they're
making off to the people
and realize if it's
convenient
hi I'm Shelly Newton
I guess that moment for me was mainly
when I was just starting doing web web
development I realized there was a lot
of sites that just didn't look
good and I knew how to make them look
better in a way so just getting into it
and jumping in to design myself as a as
a front-end dev I got really into the
design part of it
decided to take a couple design classes
while
I was originally a business leader and
just read into it and now in
been designing for the past six
seven years
start designing like it's so important
to just dive in there you know redesign
your friends website redesign
your uncle's website
redesign a website that's out there it
already looks good but make it even
better so I think that that's the way to
go just jump into other products and get
onto illustrator Photoshop
hi my name is Andy long and the thing
that gets me really excited about design
and got me started in design was the
possibilities of it I really like
understanding why people do what they do
and why they make the decisions that
they make
especially with interacting with an
application or website
so really understanding that and how I
can influence decision-making through
design was something that got me really
excited about it so that's how I got it
I think young people especially when
they start with design right now if
you're coming out of a school you need
practical experience so whether you're
going to you know actually go out there
and get clients or just start out you're
designing these for your friends like I
think that's great go through and find
tutorials online that interest you
design styles that interests you one
dribble and try to recreate those maybe
don't sell them or anything like that
because you might not see - I own it but
but try those styles out
see what those things are to you and see
how you can kind of put your own spin on
things I really enjoyed going to that
Meetup and thank you to everyone who let
me film them and that's the thing right
they would they would let me film them
and that's kind of my the process that I
like I would talk to them about the
subject in the look you know we're doing
here at dev tips and kind of get them
wound up and then you know I'd kind of
interrupt them and say let me get this
on camera and that was kind of you know
the process there was one lady there who
we were talking to and her answers were
so good I literally forgot to stop her
and start recording and so I'm I didn't
you know record her saying her name I'm
sorry I really messed up on that one
luckily loast Montoya was there helping
me out shooting some b-roll and he
caught some of her remarks so I'm sorry
that this clip is kind of out of order
and not really in the same style as the
others but what she has to say is really
worth the watch though thanks for
watching and we're gonna end this video
with this gem rather than choosing one I
decided to bowl which was incredibly
reckless yeah yeah and
honestly I went my entraining spine
Pharisee here without necessarily
choosing one in particular
but I think right sort of fell in love
with design earlier than I do
it had been a summer I was off of school
I had really nothing to do and my
stepmother traffic slider
I asked her I was like how can I better
design I don't know anything about these
programs how do I learn InDesign and
illustrator and Photoshop so she set me
with the tabs she gave me the Chicago
Tribune she gave me the newspaper and
she said design this front page
replicated entirely on the computer Wow
and so I looked at this thing it's like
what the hell am i doing so I opened up
into mine and through the next two days
I spent the entirety of my time going
through these online tutorials making
these mistakes just creating this entire
hodgepodge of whatever you might even
call a layout but at the end of it
I created this your perfect replica
leave the clutter in the novel and
knowing that I had created this thing
that other professionals at one point
had created regardless of how long it
took me was so incredibly powerful the
fact that I had made this my phone and I
think the power of these things enabling
you to create such wonderful products
literally what it's like starting down
two points always get a contract
it's have your clients Lana contract no
matter how young you are
and second find a veteran
yeah find a mentor regardless the
position between you in this mentor no
matter how fantastic you think this
person is and how terrible you might
think you are is such a lowly young
designer your mentor will help you out
more than you ever anticipated and
they're glad to help I've learned so
much from strong mentors in my life that
I don't know where I would be without
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
