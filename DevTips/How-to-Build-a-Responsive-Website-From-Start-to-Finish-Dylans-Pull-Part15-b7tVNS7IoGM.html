special super special episode of dev
tips I am just like recording this quick
introduction under an overpass look at
that thing it's like a rage or something
I have an episode for you where we're
going to be talking to another
contributor from github Dillon you may
know him as @z design on github and he
has contributed so much we're going to
talk over his pull request I'm going to
talk over what his goals were and like
how he went about it some really really
interesting stuff things like multiple
on animation options of JavaScript fall
backs like CSS animations and stuff like
that so really really cool guy really
really cool video there's one problem
with my recording I recorded on my phone
as well there and I couldn't see the
phone so like it's like my head is like
this the whole time so anyway if you can
ignore that I hope you guys enjoy this
video and I will be back here on Monday
with when we're going to start the Linux
bit what's it called client section
testimonials something like that take
care guys keep on hacking we'll see you
Monday ah welcome back everybody to dev
tips we have a super another super
awesome episode this week yet another
contributor is being featured on devtas
because you guys are just making this
awesome
pull request and you guys are like doing
more work than I am these days it's
pretty great so right here we have a
Dylan speaker to hate say hello Dylan
how are you tonight I'm pretty good how
are you I'm doing great now you're
you're in Canada yeah Ontario oh right
over on the east side yeah so it's
pretty late for you tonight thanks for
staying up this late to have a chat with
me great so Dylan has been contributing
like I've said to the artist theme and
he has done a lot of really cool work
and I just wanted to give him a little a
little bit of a platform to talk about
what he's doing and also it makes it
easier for me to just kind of like let
these things come in and then I can
focus on the next section so let's take
a look at your pull request you
sharing your screen with us and then you
can kind of walk us through the bigger
parts and like the things that might
impact the way people would use that the
artists theme as it is alright so um
basically with Michael request what I've
tried to do here is there's two parts to
it really the first part and what I was
doing first was to fix up the animation
for when you hover over one of the
thumbnails and basically at first it was
I was trying to clean up the CSS that
was used the first time to do the
animation that was what we had pulled
from bounce J s and we had to sort of
Jake the clock on properly
it was your pulse thing so what I tried
to do at first would just clean up those
classes right on but then from there I
decided to take it upon myself to allow
the user to choose the animation that
they want to use for the UM for the
hovered so when you had first started
doing this over here when you first
started building it you were trying a
number of different animations and I
figured there's a chance that the user
may like one animation more than another
so basically what I went in and did was
um within the where to sit here and the
tools I created a new folder called
animations and basically just coded a
number of animations where I set the
initial conditions and then the ending
conditions of the animation and I just
did this for all sorts of different
effects where it comes down from the top
or from the left or fades in or whatnot
and then from here I went into the
actual work dot sass file and over here
right this
would you be able to sorry would you be
able to zoom in your text a little bit
is that easy for you to do yeah what's
that that's really good yeah we want to
be able to see it yeah awesome um yeah
so this section was the section with the
where we had originally defined the
animations I made to find what we wanted
it to start off as and what we wanted it
to finish as and so basically all I'm
doing here is I've removed all of the
animation classes from these um
selectors here
and I'm just extending on what I've
called animation starts and then down
here somewhere oh right here I extend
animation so I've defined a variable in
my all dots as right here called
animation or just define I gave the
animation a name and I define it to me
whichever animation I'd like it to be so
in this case I'm defining it to be top
down which is just comes from the top
down into it which I think is one of the
first ones we were working on yeah right
so all of all of these animations
they've all just been given on a class
name where the initial conditions our
animations start underscore and then the
animation name and then the ending
conditions are just the animation name
as you would find in the variable and so
then what this allows us to do is just
go into our sass file here or in the
settings if you're running with the
gentle version that's compatible or have
your workaround set there and just
change this from right now it's top-down
but I could do something like a tin save
that come back and refresh the right one
maybe it's over here actually yeah and
so then the animations fading in and so
I've gone through and I think I've
defined
ten or eleven presets right now that you
can just change in the in the sass file
here than your settings file and just
define what you want the animation to be
but it's also it's it's built in such a
way that it's rather easy to go in and
add whatever animations you would want
so all you have to know is what do I
want it to start off as and how do I
want to finish the animation so it
allows you to go in and sort of be
creative with how you want to do it
without having to change or overwrite
the actual yes yes s there I like that
because it's not just expanding the
offerings in terms of these animations
but setting up a framework whereby
anybody who wants to add anything and
later can just use your use your kind of
method and there we go up another option
that's cool exactly so yeah so that was
the that was the first part of the pull
request that's what it sort of started
out as mm-hmm and then from there I just
sort of use the same pull request to
work on the accessibility of the site in
that we were using javascript to pull
this type of animation here where when
you click on it it moves over and then
shows the proper content or whatever yes
it's very intuitive and whatnot but the
only issue comes from if you are someone
who is browsing with javascript disabled
so you can just go in and did that or
throw this here so it has to be clear
what's happening here is we're using
javascript to switch the classes on the
parent and it'll it'll slide because of
the class and there's a there's a CSS
transition in between and what your yeah
so what what are you doing here so what
i've done actually have two separate
solutions here one is is nicer in terms
of the usability but a lot less nice
from the back-end perspective and
vice-versa so basically what i've done
is i've
try to mimic the same type of animation
using just CSS so um the one is if you
click on it here our status it's done it
here and it shows this sort of generic
message and whatever content you would
like to be displayed there only so the
initial project is not going to switch
projects for you it will just show you
the default project and then give you a
notification at the top of the project
yeah and so basically it is pulling in
from where in the settings down here
I've just find this um gamal variable
it's a bit cheeky yeah but uh but it's
just and you can have to say whatever
you want in fact you could pull in all
of your images or whatnot and so um
that's the first solution that I came up
with and this it's not that hard to
implement in terms of the code but again
it's not like from a user's perspective
no matter which project they're clicking
on they get the same yeah sort of
message so it's nice because you've
taken some consideration to if they
don't have the Java Script like they can
still see something with your work but
obviously not as ideal as with
JavaScript on the other solution that
I've come up with again it's more
complicated on the backend but if you
click on it it'll actually pull up the
proper project and if I click over to
another one it'll pull this one in as
well and so again this is running
completely with just plain CSS or will
find in sass but no Java scripts needed
to do this effect here and so I mean
it's uh yeah so how are you building in
the project with that one without using
javascript so pulling this I'll go over
the first is that the slide animation on
both of them so just what pulls the divs
back and forth yo start with um is
actually using labels and checkboxes in
HTML in a sort of hacky type way so um
if I go into where you yeah no make or
dump
um yeah in my work uh HTML file at the
top here what I've done is I have put in
radio buttons corresponding to each
project and just given them a class of
trigger and so there's just one that
corresponds to each of the thumbnails
and then added one additional one here
that will correspond to the back button
right and so those are added in as extra
markup and then from the actual thumb
unit so the where over here so these
different pictures or boxes there I've
wrapped those in an HTML label and the
label is for each one of these radio
buttons so basically what will happen is
when you click on the each one of these
it will select one of the radio buttons
and that corresponds to the has the same
ID as um whatever this four tag is yes
so so there's a label and then I've also
wrapped this back button over here with
the label that corresponds to the extra
radio button here right and so then
where the actual transitions happen um
comes from the a CSS selector tool
checked and so basically you can style
based on whether or not a checkbox or
radio button is actually checked and so
what I've done here is when it's checked
I move the work belt to
negative 100% and when it's not tracked
it returns to its default state mm-hmm
and so that's how we get the slide going
back and forth is because these labels
check these on radio buttons which I've
hit in but I can actually just remove
the hidden you can actually see a little
bit better how it would work out there
so um when you click one it actually
will check one of the radio buttons and
based on which radio button is checked
if it's than this one the detect it'll
return is the D ones have just been
programmed to slide over to the left
100% yeah so in both both of the
solutions that's how the sliding back
and forth mm-hmm um works out no let me
um let me say two things about that
number one on line 11 that tilde there
in between those two selectors right Oh
would you mind going back to the code
okay that's an adjacent sibling selector
and that's like kind of what makes the
magic work there and for more
information about this and to see an
example of this using a kind of like in
a navigation like sliding out navigation
check out this other video that's on a
PHP academy' that I did a long time ago
and the show and the bit link to that
video will be in the notes and we're
using the same principles involved here
and it's a really clever way of doing
anything that's really cool
I'm really really interested in how you
did the projects okay so um yeah so the
projects like I said um requires quite a
little bit more complexity on the back
end um so first thing that I had to do
was because Jekyll is very I'm picky
about where you're including from I
actually had to replicate the work
folder within the includes miles so that
we can actually with Jekyll pull in the
UM
the different projects that we want in
there I'll show you a good idea anyway
yeah I mean it shouldn't really impact
you on your watch you're actually
rendered your site so the only part
would be maintaining the two copies but
it's not a huge well we could we could
rewrite to where we're using the the
included work for the for the regular
version you know oh yeah that's true too
um but so anyways so the works been
moved into there and it's just the same
files that were being used before and
then within the work a chain ready Oh
buttons at the top um and through and
then the same labels as well
wrapping them and then down in the work
wrap section here I have no script tag
which basically will only render if the
person has JavaScript and disabled and
browsers treat this a little bit
differently but what's nice is that most
modern browsers will actually just take
whatever is in here as plain text if
they have javascript disabled so you're
not rendering all of this unnecessary
HTML and in the event that they do have
JavaScript enabled with so within this
no script I have a for loop again just
looping through each one of the projects
as is defined with it in um the jekyll
settings and it's just a div with a
class of no script as well um the ID is
content - and then whatever the project
folder is so again we need those proj
approach to approach 3 so on so it just
would just be content - whatever and
then the actual I'm content with inside
that div is the title with the project
name just pulled in and then this class
no script load which is we're then just
including project file and so what I
actually had to do was within the
settings Gemmell had to add in this file
on all of these projects
because again with you can include a
variable file so long as the variable
name has the entire path in it and so
otherwise I could have I mean you could
change around the folder or whatnot to
make it work out the same way but I've
just added this file in to all of them
so basically what we have going is um
it'll be for each one of our projects we
have all of the content just being
pulled in on to this these this no
script tag and into these on separate
dips now within our SAS I have um I have
hidden the no script is to undie fault
and then I have this for loop here um
which will loop through each one of the
projects as defined within a SAS
variable which I guess is in this file
so I have this just projects list which
just proj one brush to the same as we
would have within our Jekyll but again
um I just pulled it in and hard-coded it
into my satisfied here but yeah so we're
looping through each one of those
projects and outputting this really
nasty selector here we're happy idea
when this ID of project is checked we're
pulling from the work belt and then the
Warcraft work container the no script
tag and then we're highlighting that
content - project which is that again
it's just that div that we've output all
of these or pulled all the content in
from the Jekyll includes uh-huh and then
we're just displaying that as a block as
opposed to here it's displayed as none
by default and then for each one once
you check the corresponding check box it
will use the selector to display that as
a block so again really what we're doing
here is one
clicking on refresh this I click on one
of the is in that particular checkbox
with the particular ID and that ID is
triggering which one of the divs should
be displayed as a block but all of those
are actually in there rendered currently
um and so they're just it's just really
a CSS hiding or displaying of elements
at this point Wow
Bravo man that's really cool that's
where I feel like I'm teaching less and
less these takes this is so awesome so
would you say that those two the
animation options and then these kind of
like JavaScript fall backs or are the
main thrust of your pull request ah yeah
I'd say that those pretty much cover
everything that I did I mean there are a
couple other um just small additions to
work so for instant and swift it and
it's um within rjs file here what I've
done is on the work belt function I'm
actually just removing those radio
buttons from the rendered HTML using
JavaScript just so that it cleans up the
source once it's actually been I'm
rendered by the page yeah um but beyond
that it's just getting those two to work
using the sass send HTML and yeah that's
pretty much what the I'm impressed it is
it's a this is really smart out of rust
I like it alright well um if that's it
let's uh let's conclude but I want to
say thanks for doing all this and then
after after we're done recording this
video let's make a plan to integrate
this pull request into the main repo in
that way everybody can benefit from all
your hard work awesome
cool man do you have anything else do
you want to say it before we're done I
mean is the only other thing to mention
about this whole process here is that
again it's not perfect like there will
be browsers that don't support these
types of selectors and I mean you can
find a list of every browser version
that will support this type of thing but
if someone's in ie6 it's still not going
to work for them but it's it's just it's
really when you're when you're designing
something or creating something it's
being cognizant of all of the different
people that might be coming to see your
website so it's just good to take into
consideration every other possibility
that it can some awesome cool all right
well thank you very much and then um
hopefully I can get this video out
before next Monday so we're going to
have a few videos this week actually so
if if I don't um then check back Monday
and we'll see you guys we'll see you
guys then keep on hacking thanks Dylan
