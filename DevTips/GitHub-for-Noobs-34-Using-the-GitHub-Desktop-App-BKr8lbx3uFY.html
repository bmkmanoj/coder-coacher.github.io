and I'm a noob just like you that makes
me the perfect candidate to present this
third episode in a series called github
for news hopped up on that back to get
out the noobs in the last two videos we
looked at the history of git and github
and then we looked at how git is used a
simple workflow and a few github e terms
today we're going to look at a practical
tool that makes getting started with git
and github pretty simple it's an
application built by github it's awesome
so let's get started alright the first
thing we need to do on this little
adventure is sign up for github or log
into github if you haven't already after
that we need to go to desktop desk table
and desktop github.com and download this
application and this is what we're going
to be focusing on in this video I'm in
the dev tips account right now and so
I'm going to go down and create a new
repository and I'm going to call this
repository git hub - four - noobs and
this is kind of like what I'll be
working in for the rest of the episode
it's a public repository that's
perfectly fine and one of the things
that I like to do so I like to create my
repositories on github and then pull
them down and the reason why is that
github allows you to create a git ignore
file really easily and so I'll just type
in OS X is there there's nothing to show
there okay
I'll just type anything in there how
about Jekyll there is a Jekyll ok and
create the repository now that git
ignore file is kind of important and
I'll just go to get ignore do do get
ignored il and I'll tell them and I'll
describe my system to them alright get
ignored IO
I'm on OS X and I i'll be using code kit
maybe
yep and maybe Jekyll but I'm not going
to use Jekyll this time but still so I
got these three things and it's going to
generate the GUID ignore this file will
tell git what to ignore so for example
OS X it's going to ignore the DS store
files which are like my folder structure
metadata we don't need that in github
and not get so it's going to ignore all
these files and this is why I like to
create my repositories on get first so
that all of this stuff is already set up
before I pull it down and I have a
chance to contaminate it so I'll edit
this file right here and just on github
they have a they have a file editor and
I'll just paste everything that I
created it get get ignored
I owe and I'll commit those changes and
now when I go to my repo I have one file
and it's updated with everything and
it's good to go ok so now I'm going to
go download my desktop app alright if
this is your first time opening the
github desktop app this is the first
thing that you should see it's a little
tutorial it's quite nice let's continue
so I'll do my login and password here
and I'll see you in a second the next
screen is your git config this is trying
to capture information that will help
set up your your your git repos every
time so it'll put your metadata in there
your name and your email address
and then install command-line tools you
bet you're a little bit cool cool cool
and continue which repositories would
you like to use ok these are it's going
to find local repositories if you don't
have any local repositories then just
don't I'm not gonna check any alright
done alright there's a really handy
walkthrough that's great I'm going to
delete this thing so here we are with
the github application we haven't done
anything yet we've only just signed in
so to get started I'm going to go over
to this plus button here on the left and
I'm going to be given three options here
I could add meaning if I have a local
repository already and I just want to
find it here and add it to the sidebar
the second one is to create a new one
entirely new and then the third one is
to clone these are to find all of the
reap the repos that you have on github
and start bringing them down to your
system cloning them and working on them
there so this is what we're going to do
because we already created that other
repo on github called github - four -
noobs so let's find it
github for noobs right here and what the
cool thing about this is it'll show all
your accounts so I have Travis Nielsen
account and if I have like a company and
I'm a part of their organization it'll
show up my dev tips organization shows
up so all of these things show up is
pretty handy so I'm going to clone
github for noobs and I'm going to clone
it straight to my desktop and clone whoo
cool so github for noobs is really
really small it's just a let me open it
up here open in finder so you can in a
sidebar you have a lot of options if you
right click on it you can view it on the
website github you can open it in your
finder in your terminal and Adam which
if you have Adam like we explored a few
weeks ago this is all really handy
because they're all kind of like in the
github ecosystem they'll work really
well date with each other ok so when I
open the get
hub for noobs folder you can see that
there's kind of nothing in it if I show
you the invisible files you'll see a the
get ignore file but really there's
nothing in it yet so we need to add some
files so I'm going to open this repo in
Adam our favorite text editor and you
can see that get ignore file here
created already and I'm going to add a
new file and we call it index.html this
is not even a part of the tutorial so
I'm just going to paste in some index
stuff and I'm going to create a new file
called style dot CSS and in style I'm
just going to paste in some Styles here
in these Styles and index these are
taken from the the dev tips starter kit
I just robbed them so save there and
save there now cool thing cool thing
about Adam Adam specifically look at how
these files are green now these green
files means that there have been new
lines added so remember our last kind of
commit in github was right here when we
updated the get ignore we did that on
github and the only thing that we had at
that point was just this good ignore
file so look at this see that right
there that that dot is the commit path
remember in the last episode we have
Rockville's moving red dots these are
the commit paths the first one was the
initialization this is like just the
initial commit this is what I like set
up the account or the set up the repo
this next one is when I edited to get
ignore you see how it changed and this
kind of broken line here the broken
circle line thing right here is where we
currently are and I've added these two
files and I can see all of the lines
added right here with this little plus
sign you just close this sidebar here
you can see all these plus aligned this
is these are everything that I that I
added and an atom reflects that's those
same changes by saying that these two
file files are green and then you can
see the number of added lines right here
84 and this one added 420 lines so that
should be good let's go
been up let's open up this with a
browser see what we look like okay this
is the dev tip starter kit cool you've
seen this before let's make a few
changes along the way and let's say go
to that style and go all the way to the
bottom and I don't even know what's
going on we'll just a body back ground a
background will be red pink you know I
was going to do painting right
hey thoughts candy red I'm not gonna be
red pink let's see if it changes it all
here
refresh okay we have a pink background
now okay so we've made a change let's
let's check check these marks right here
this these check marks are pretty
significant they mean that this file is
is added to get so what's gonna when you
make a commit these these files will be
added to that commit so to make the
first commit I'm gonna go down here into
this box and make the summary and say
added and you want to be pretty good
with your commit names and then write a
description I mean if you're having any
problems or if like you know because
because the idea is that you want to
document this stuff well for yourself if
you come back next year and for like
where was I or if you like are sharing
these files with a team if you're on a
team you want to you know be a good team
member so you want to document them
really well I used to be kind of famous
in the office for just writing my lunch
orders in in the in the in the
descriptions there and some engineers
got really mad at me after a while so I
had to stop doing that so what I'm going
to do right now is I'm going to hit this
button commit to master and I've added a
commit and you see this little line just
jump down so that was the the commit
that I just made me rewind the view here
click on this there we go
so that was blue so I'm looking at an
old commit and there's two files changed
in it there's index and style so you can
see what's in each file you can see all
the files that are
in the commits and let's go back to the
current view and go back into Adam and
let's remove that background line here
save and cancel refresh and it's back to
grey and we can see over here that the
github app has been updated with that
change that I just made there the line
that said background pink has been
removed and I've added a blank line so
the this is the way that you view it the
removed and added there you see the line
number is the same it just means it's
been changed and the tab up here says we
have one uncommitted change our style
has been updated and will say removed
the pink background committed now we
have another commit cool all right so
we're cruising along our commit path or
having a happy fun time but then all of
a sudden like our designer comes up to
us or our manager with like this crazy
idea or we have this crazy idea and
we're like hey instead of having a grey
background or a pink background and try
to pink it doesn't work why don't we do
a purple background purple no how about
lavender is even crazier than purple so
a lavender background let's switch over
to Adam no actually wait before we do
that before we go into Adam before we
try to start changing codes and going in
all the crazy directions why don't we do
this let's go into our github
application and use this little button
right here it's like a commit stream
with the plus button this is the add
branch button so we're going to create a
new branch and when it says from this is
me this means like where are we going to
start from what are we going to base our
new branch on so we're going to base the
new branch on master and we're going to
call it crazy add via and create a new
branch now notice that my branch is
shown right here see that we're
branching off and we are on the crazy
idea branch the crazy idea path right
now and if I go over here and click this
view branch I'm looking at just the
crazy idea branch and not its
relationship to and
other branches so notice that the crazy
idea is an exact copy of the the master
branch the master branch remember we had
all those commits in it so if I hover
over one of these added the index and
style files change the background remove
the background pink all of those all of
that commit history is part of the new
branch it didn't just start like a
little fresh new baby at that point like
it has like all the history which is
interesting to note so let's go in here
finally and go into Adam and we're just
going to say background lavender Patti
spelled lavender lavender my a are silly
pants I should have known it because
yeah the little little dot didn't show
up okay so go back to our Chrome update
now we have a lavender background what a
revolutionary idea it's so insane but I
like it I kind of like it so made the BG
Lavvy nder lavender then I've committed
this commit to crazy idea right so if I
go to crazy idea switch up here and
switch back to master and then refresh
my browser the background lavender is
gone because now the whole repo the
whole state of the repo the whole state
of the code on my system has been
changed to reflect you know how the how
the master branch looks and if I switch
this back to crazy idea branch and my
browser the background is lavender and
this is cool so I show my manager and or
or show my friend or show myself or
whatever and I like it it's good this
crazy idea worked out we maybe we tested
it with some people and it's fantastic
okay here's what we're going to do we're
going to take these changes and push
them back into master master is like the
master branch right so
that's where we want to make like we
want to keep the master branch as you
know like the official truth of what our
application or website is like so we go
off into our branches to do the weird
stuff and then if we like it we pull it
into to make it true so the way that we
do that is by creating a poll request
we're going to click this pull request
button here on the top right and see
it's got like this dotted line and the
pull request kind of icon right here go
away go away go away okay so the I've
always like thought this is really weird
and backwards but the the idea of how
they word it and how they like visually
describe it is that you you have the the
first item the first branch and then you
pull into it like be you would think it
would be like this goes into this but
it's like I don't know so right here you
can click down what is going to get the
new branch and we only have one option
master but like if you had a lot of
different branches like you don't need
to pull everything in a master you can
pull branches into branches whatever but
master branch is the only one that we
have other than crazy idea so it's the
only one that shows up here so the the
graphic tells us that crazy idea is
going to go into master and I'm going to
go to a mess a merge to master which is
like the most famous pull request
message ever and I'm going to send the
pull request and what's happening now
actually is it's creating the pull
requests on github so I don't know if I
can accept here pull requests created
you can view it at github okay so so you
can't accept pull requests here in the
application but you notice that I have a
pull request number one up here where it
said make pull requests so let's click
on that button here and notice that it
updates our browser it get it sends us
to the pull request now now remember
when I said that a pull request is a
list of everything that's changed right
so here's all the commits that are
inside the pour
quest and you can actually look at the
code and you can look at you know
everything that's been changed already
and they have this github has this
really great view you can look at it
like we saw before top and bottom or you
can split I like the split view because
you can see what's been removed in
what's come on split view you can see
what's been removed and what's been
added a lot easier there I think but it
doesn't really matter so here's the
conversation and I'm like like you know
I'm gonna write to my guy who who I
write to myself but you know the person
who created this poor request I'll be
like this code is sloppy and I'm just
I'll comment on it and then he'll be
like no it's not but I don't know anyway
in these in these em comments you can do
you know you can you can add files in
line like you can style your whatever
others say you can like make new commits
and every every new commit you make will
be added to this PR so like you've got
it all ready I don't know why I created
a little bit of problems there for for
the guy but you can see that like this
conversation is centered around make the
background louder in fact let's go in to
this code here and make a comment it's
pretty cool it's on a plus right here
and write a comment like ooh I like now
there's a comment on that line of code
which is kind of cool so if I if I like
as the code reviewer as the person who
is reviewing the pull request and I see
the problem I can be like here's the
problem it's right here or like this is
good code or you know or not even
comment nobody ever comments on those
things all right back to our pull
request here it's looking good
I'm gonna go merge the pull request so
ideally you want somebody else to merge
but I'm only one person today so I'm
going to merge this pull request and I
can make a note like yes looks good
locks good looks good and confirm the
merge now that this merge is done
I would like to delete the branch right
and it's really important to keep your
your repo tidy so let's just delete the
branch and github is like hey you should
delete it and so I'm just going to say
yeah let's do that
you can always restore it if you need to
go back I can see that there is only one
branch now if I go back to my github
application here and I see that I have
two branches and go to master and I'm
going to sync synchronize so oh look at
the cute little PR icon okay I'm going
to synchronize my application with
what's on what all the work that I did
on the website so sinking sinking
sinking
so now that I've synced it it's the same
as everything we did on the website so I
can see this this commit here which is a
merge commit pulling in the lavender
background and and that's kind of
reflected locally on my system but look
I still have that crazy idea branch well
the thing is this crazy idea branch is
local see I still need to publish it
again if I want it back on the website
so what I can do to remove a crazy idea
from my system because I want to keep I
want to keep my local system clean - all
right so I'm going to go into that crazy
idea of branch you move this over here
so you can see it and when I go to
branch and a delete delete crazy idea
yeah sure that's fine now the only
branch is master again and there's our
commit path everything looks pretty good
so this is this is like a basic overview
of the application and I've seen the
application go from version 1 1.0
there's a lot you can do now and use to
not be able to do much so it's a pretty
good alternative for people who are like
afraid of the command line or just like
starting out with git and don't really
know how to like initialize everything
to be honest I've been using a nearly my
whole career and I have
had any problems with it other than
maybe the engineers laughing at me and
thinking I'm kind of a noob but I think
that's okay that's a good trade-off for
having an easily understandable
interface versus you know like a just a
scary blank command-line next week we're
going to do all these same things but
only using the command-line and that's
when my new business will really shine
because I've kind of only ever used the
app before so it should be fun make sure
you tune in for that this video is made
possible by the patrons of the dev tips
Channel these people are the people who
believe in dev tips enough to donate a
buck or two for every tutorial video
that I make they get the benefit of
watching the videos early and getting
extra content and there's like the live
hangouts we've been doing and oh yeah
the chat the chat is really awesome to
learn more about the patreon community
visit patreon.com slash dev tips the
link is in the description of the video
and really guys any little bit helps if
you're thinking like oh I love to
contribute but I only you know I mean
just like one dollar of video is four
dollars a month it like it doesn't mean
a lot to you but it means a lot to me
when you when you add them up right and
if you're worried that I'm going to make
too many videos which I promise I won't
but if you're worried that's fine you
can you can set a monthly cap so if you
only want to donate one dollar a video
with a cap of two dollars a month that's
perfectly fine as well anyhow thanks for
watching this video I can't wait to make
the next one and I'll see you then keep
on hacking see that punch like a oh
that's a PewDiePie thing hey no no they
get the benefit of watching the
Wow my neck hurts it's an application
built by github and it's really cool so
come on come on noobs let's get started
come on noobs that's weird it's so weird
why are you doing that okay it's an
application built by github and what you
know I recorded 4:00 in the morning so I
don't have this problem but it still
happens people will be driving by people
be like just Park and burn something
like letting it idle with big diesel
trucks right outside my garage I can't
have these big gaps in my recording</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
