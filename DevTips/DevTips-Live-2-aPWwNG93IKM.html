the reason I do this show hey here we

me I can't hear you very well what does
again I can hear you very like a pinch
but not very well um I'm just going to
finish this introduction here I'm gonna
talk about talk about the show that
we're going to be doing so the show will
be in two parts the first part i'm going
to do a little coat demo and then yo
come here that just joined the chat he
will give a second demo and talk about
some of the cool ideas um and then after
we're done presenting i'm going to open
up the video chat for everyone so the
first 10 people that join the hangout
will do you know we'll chill for a
little bit and open it up to some q QA
some question and answers or whatever
else suits are fancy until we close the
show okay so let's start are you ready
to go you
yes can you let me know I can't hear you
very well stained my my you can do a
sound check I check on skype and a high
high 80 me very well wait a second
you're good with audio now but I can't
see your face you don't have any video
yeah this is important i can give it a
comma yeah if you're gonna present we're
gonna need to see your video a feed
their just you can show your screen in
the meantime while he sorts that out I'm
going to I'm going to present a little
ideas that we have oh there you are okay
no you got it you still can feel me all
I can I can hear you and I can see you
so that's great okay yep so when you're
ready to present I'll just need to be
able to see your screen and then and
we'll go we'll do it well so i'm gonna
i'm going to talk a little bit about
some something called CSS pseudo
elements and let me show you my screen
with everyone here okay all right now
i'll just make it bigger i'll zoom it in
here okay so we're gonna be talking
about sudo elements just for a few
minutes and then yo to will prove what's
called talk about his topic present the
Thord I looking for okay so pseudo
element pseudo elements are this is a
really great definition of ceuta
elements they're just like pseudo
classes you may have used a you know
like colon hover before on a link and
that would select whatever happens
during an action but a pseudo element
actually adds elements inside the Dom
mdn or Mozilla developer Network
described it like this just like pseudo
classes
is pseudo elements are added to
selectors but instead of instead of
describing a state like hover they allow
you to style certain parts of a document
and there are a few different types of
pseudo elements you can do first letter
or first line or last line boat right
now we're going to talk about the before
and the after a pseudo elements okay so
in my example here I'm going to start a
new example and h2 this is going to be
called next to the apple tree called
content we're gonna be looking at what
is content used for okay so if i have a
paragraph here and i'll call put the
class of paragraph content on it content
so that we can call it our CSS so this
paragraph here i'll just put some some
simple warm in here
want to put one word the word hello in
this in this content box and I want to
grab I'll say content I want to say
after and now that I've made that pseudo
selector this part right here will
select something that you don't see yet
and it will actually create it kind of
so the first thing I have to do is write
content this is the the property and
then the value can be whatever you want
and it's inside of this quotations so
i'll write goodbye then you see that it
just shows up right after hello and when
you inspect it in the inspector you can
see that it's actually inside of the
paragraph along with hello and and the
chrome developer tools will identify it
with this using this kind of thing in
the dumps you can see what we're talking
about and it has its own Dom element I
mean it has its own like you know
properties so you can you can give it
like let's say a color red you can make
that you can style it apart from the
rest of the paragraph that it's in so
you can literally inject elements into
the Dom using CSS let me do another one
content before content and then you can
write yo and I put a space in there just
and I'm at that little that little space
will show up right here between the two
of these guys at least it should and
then we'll color it orange this is the
the essence of a before and after pseudo
element not a pseudo selector the pseudo
selector is what we're doing in CSS the
pseudo element is what's happening in
the Dom the LM the actual element and
you know what's interesting you noticing
that you can't select it when i try to
select goodbye here just hello will
select with the text select
okay um what do I want to show next
about this
oh yes ok the next
part of this example 2 i'm going to show
you how to use it with icons okay so
let's say we have
you
let's say we have that paragraph and
and inside the paragraph we want to have
the last sentence you know like maybe
it's like a description here and we'll
say anchor tag download the PDF then the
ref is going to be a down loads / read
feed me dot PDF then when I go so I can
let's see here i can say the selector in
my CSS will be anchor and then all of
those anchors that have a her F that
contain a string equal to dot PDF oops a
PDF now the style that I can put air is
content actually what I want to do also
I set up this earlier I set this up that
we can use font awesome so I'm going to
put the the class of fa on this this
anchor although it's not necessary to
use this pseudo element get rid of this
hmm now if I take this a graphic PFC
what what see what this does right here
this this selector is saying look at all
the anchors that have an href that
contains the string of dot PDF so let me
just show you color red see how all of
the other anchors here like this this
link right here is orange i change this
one red because it contains that the
href of the string PDF so I'm going to
select the nmsa after that now it has
the fa i would say content equal to now
this is this is a string that will call
the specific icon from font awesome it's
f 1 c 1
and that's not rendering the correct way
hmm oh there it is okay you see that
little icon there it's a PDF icon and
I'll just put a padding left 10 pixels
here so now what would happen is every
PDF link that you put in the content of
this website will have the little cute
icon to the right of it and this this is
using a font off summer as the as like
the method of doing that let me comment
this out and I'll show you how to use
this with just a where's the extra okay
i just commented that out and now i'll
do the same thing using a little paint
and image so the content in this case
let's do a google search for a PDF it
pinged
this one's super huge you let's go to
visit page see if there's a smaller one
okay there's no smaller ones I'm going
to copy the image URL and then inside of
my code i'm going to say content equals
URL and then paste that link and then
alright so this is a huge huge image so
it's kind of like not looking great but
you would choose the right one and just
to do the quick little fix here we'll
say sighs you know 20 pixels I should
shrink it up a little foot oh and I'll
say display inline block
I working well I wasn't planning on
using this huge image that kind of broke
my example but the idea is still is
still valid it you can inject images
here you can inject icons there you can
inject text strings i will put the
comment on this one okay there you go so
the next one I want to do is talk about
how to make another example here example
h 2 boxes i want to talk about how you
can take these pseudo elements and turn
them into like little basically you
knowed it is like boxes that act like
dibs and things like that so in my
example i'll have a class of box and
they'll say a box we can see it will say
sighs 150 pixels background pink so this
is our box that we just made now we're
gonna say box
and after even if you're not going to
inject text or images you still need to
have the contents of property there and
you just leave it blank if you just want
to create another box and then you'll
say display block and size this this
size mix em that I'm using is from
bourbon and you can use it like this you
would say 20 pixels and then space 50
pixels and this is like an easy way to
say height and width it just outputs
heightened width and then background
okay there it is that's our that's our
pseudo element right there that red bit
let's make it bigger let's say 5050 if
you in this mixing if you just do one
property it goes both high and with is
that one value background red and then
you can do say I'm een you can just
treat it like it's a it's a block
element so i'll say position absolute a
top will be like the twenty percent know
for the left null for the right and
negative 30 pixels for the left and then
actually because that because it's a
absolute position i need to make this
one see how it just jumped off the
screen it's actually up here because
because this is if it as early as parent
is not defined position so i'll make
this one relative now i should jump back
come on buddy
there it is okay coach it just needed to
render it okay now inside of these uh
inside if I can see I have a background
red you can actually put background
images in there too i'll use phill
murray good old Bill Murray handsome
devil and I'll say a URL and here's the
string for Phil mary and i'll say i'm
back round size is a cover squeeze it in
there good ol Phil Mary alright and then
for the last example i want to show you
just how to do some interesting ideas of
using before and afters to make some
interesting style so here's an example
again and i'll call this 1 h 2 buttons
and it'll make a class a button and then
all right by me in the class let me buy
me okay so now here we have a text
string right here that we can rename to
a button so here's my class button will
do some quick but need kind of styles on
there will say back ground is going to
be like light blue not happen display
line block and oh I spotlight wrong
mmm lipo is not a color apparently i
thought it was Orange
oh it's spelled background wrong there
we go okay okay I have an orange button
it's a more more padding here okay to
border radius of five pixels and color
white cool look like a good button right
so what we want to do is make an
interesting we want to use the pseudo
elements to make an interesting style
I'm just putting a position relative on
this button so that i can use it as the
base for styling the the thing that we
do right now I'm going to make a cute
little shadow under the button and let's
say after and then content is empty
content and we'll say display block size
is going to be width is going to be
about eighty percent of its parent and
the height is going to be like four
pixels and I'll say a background is
going to be our GPA it's going to be a
shadow remember so we'll use black and
then like point three for the film there
we are so it's fifty to eighty percent
of its parent and it's dark that's what
this little line is there so we'll now
position it outside of its parent
absolutely positioned topped 100 percent
so it will go straight to the bottom and
then left null bottom null and a sorry
right null bottom no left fifty percent
and then we want to use the trans form
this is a way that we learned in the
last place last time I used a code kit
we learned this I learned this awesome
thing I shared with you guys so the way
to Center this would be too
put it absolutely positioned fifty
percent and then transform translate
translate X capital X negative fifty
percent and it goes in the center all
right now i'll put some margin on the
top to move it away from the parent a
little bit about maybe five pixels yeah
and then i'll do a border radius fifty
percent to make it kind of a an ellipse
will shadow and then i'll do a box
shadow on this and say it's zero percent
of zero pixels offset from the top 0
pixels offset from the left about a five
pixel blur and the color will be rgba 00
slips 000 0.3% black so it's got like a
more of a shadow there maybe this should
be like five there you go there you go
so this looks like a button with like a
little like floating button with a look
a little shadow under it right and let's
say 10 pixels remove that shadow up
further now it's kind of fun you could
animate that when you hover over it like
jump up and if the shadow gets smaller
or something like that but it anyway so
here's a one two three four four
interesting uses of the after and before
pseudo elements this is the this is the
presentation for now thank you so much
and I'm stopping the screen shares did I
just stop the broadcast no we're still
here haha alright I thank you so much
for watching that yo demure up man
okay and so I'm going to talk about the
typescript you already a sad at all I
miss I wasn't there for the first couple
minutes this is did you expend them what
if I didn't tell them what you're
talking about but but since then I've
lost your video i just see your
thumbnail now again oh yeah and now I
really share the best skin instead of
their color okay I'm just gonna turn it
all over to you go ahead present from
the beginning wanna say one second
mm-hmm I'll just dance in the corner
here you can see my skin now yep we can
see your screen okay so am right now
this is a little example of a type
script it shaped web play poster cell
and I think that how you view pond oh I
say that li likes us to CSS this is a
type skip to java skip it compile this
code a to JavaScript will be poisoning
with the preprocessor type skipped
typescript yes it's a Microsoft product
okay and the the main problem we type
skin we type skip that a because that
it's not follow forever everyone is that
you need an ID with sublime or Adam it's
just not gonna help you because I got
some a eville each it's only Devils this
is one of the main problem with a
JavaScript and for example if I miss
something it should I show me they're
all right in the corner so you need the
ID for example visual studio or what i'm
using right now this is a page pistol
and so let me let me show you some
features of type screen and i got a
model hey this is like a namespace and
now you can call the example em
here you can export and and all set a
private VAR better functions and it's a
pretty nice too two libraries if you
want a little to see the code later if
you you can see now that this is
compiled to a valuable of example and
there I export the print function but
the text is still m still private so
another big big problem with javascript
is that you don't get a type for four
variables and because of that a type
skip edit a simple van a valuable type
we got string a number and we got any if
you still want to use the variable for
anything and the first you need to set
an array if you want to use that this is
an optional and not am and not something
you have to to to do and also a if you
can see I got a class and something that
coming in akma skip six but already is
missing because a bozos like Internet
Explorer still cannot use that actually
every Bowser cannot do that and M this
is a cluster combined to a regular class
like this a it's a variable like a you
do it the old way and you and this is
the constructor with the function itself
so let me show you a little example
let's say I want to create a class
class of stairs on so I got to construct
Oh like every other language and then i
can do whatever i want if i do the
string go wish I not still be the same
with the second oh wait and so here I
can create like normal JavaScript the
class it's compiled to really readable a
JavaScript so if you want if you decide
you don't want the typescript and you
want to go back to to JavaScript it's
not gonna be a problem yeah i can say
new person hey i forgot to pass a string
so you see right now that I was missing
this to a string at the end it didn't
tell me anything but ill in the in the
types keep itself if i'm going to set
new person it's gonna show me in ll that
they pop out and and tell me i miss
something i can say i don't want the
string to be all the time with a
question mark and now in each an
optional so i have to do if s and so I
got a little a project build with it
right now
at this project use a typed script but
not only the future and one problem we
type script is that you have to declare
every function in every class and not
every a library support that for example
jquery i loaded Jake when cardinal TS
this is definition for the j equal you
see it's a lot of code so not that we
never use it it's a little odd to find
the library the do support but for
example for this library i created it
myself it's not where i have a big
problem this is one of the lines of code
took me soo me a few minutes me I don't
know how much exactly but and without
this and jquery and lots of other big
library supported so don't worry hey
maybe I will show some example if an you
have an idea do I have an idea what to
show can only know what I am I'm not
really i'm just listening in trying to
give an introduction right here I showed
a the language but I don't know what
exactly to show key because am a
JavaScript project is is big and they
can not create one so short oh of course
yeah let me see in certain we could open
it up for questions about typescript and
you could just answer those questions if
you like okay yeah that's right okay how
do i do the questions again
does anyone have any questions about
typescript just real quick there's a lot
of questions in here generally I don't
see any about typescript specific okay
so what we'll do then is will open up
the the chat to everybody and then and
then we'll ask some verbal questions the
ones talk about what typescript is so
let me invite the public sharing this
video oops try again
ok
I'm trying to invite people but it says
oops try again all right here's what
I'll do I'm going to go to Twitter and
under a dev tips account I'm just going
to post a link to the chat and everybody
who just go to at dev tips show Twitter
account I think if you click on this
link you can join the chat the the
invitation system on on google+ is
giving me an error for some reason so
the invitation okay so maybe it was that
i was invited inviting public so i also
sent invitations to everybody who is in
the dev tips live circle basically
everybody who reserved a spot or said
the click the button that said that they
were going to go watching the show i
sent you an invitation so i'm not
exactly sure Yatim how does the
invitations work you find it on your
Google+ page yeah you go to the tool
page and see a joint damn cult mm-hmm
and it's one it was on the page I didn't
see any notification oh you just join
the hang you just said join the hangout
yes I I see the button the bottom yo in
your account okay cool well we're we're
still looking at your screen can't see
your beautiful face never here here's a
question about typescript AB he says
what typescript is really is oh hey
there's loes and it's gone it was there
what does it mean really I go to the 30
page and see a dr m don't and it's one
it was on the page i didn't say hey if
you guys are listening to the podcast on
your joining the new one you need to

nice very cool cell great to meet you
welcome to the show glad to be here
bantam hell
again Iago are you here buddy hello you
have a sound okay and you autumn is here
how is everybody cool so I figured that
we just kind of like open it up to some
questions we have some questions on the
the right if you open the Q&amp;amp;A app on the
chat and then if you guys have any
questions about dev tips were what we're
doing this year or what's going on
lately or comments about we've done in
the past or if you guys have any
questions or comments about what we do
in general you can just open that up so
does anybody want to go shoot first or
should we oh we ask a question you're on
the right you guys hear me now yeah go
ahead man shameful oh I was gonna say
I'm from Chattanooga right I'm so behind
yes and we remember you from the the one
on one from after the show last time
that's right yeah see um you were saying
that you're gonna starting a spanish
channel is that right yeah I am how's
that going I got like three videos
recorded and building a website to to
push pose the videos too okay so you're
working on that currently huh you
haven't published them yet they're just
kind of in the queue yeah I haven't
that's great again it's great to see you
again I didn't know I was gonna be live
on this thing oh yeah that's Marshall
working I just want to watch it so might
step down let somebody else join in okay
that's fine that's your choice to of
cool these guys take care all right we
have a question from andreas and he says
are you one hundred percent code pin now
this was the aftereing but when I was
doing the code pin example I've been
toying around code pin I think that they
have some really interesting features
especially for um doing examples and
then letting you guys you know use the
code it's a little bit more accessible
than github is but there are a few
annoyances for example the auto refresh
always like reload my page up and I
always have to scroll down if i'm doing
like like the one I was doing a live
here so if i'm recording code pen it's
kind of I don't know it's a it's a
little difficult and then like um I
don't know but there's like some
presentation modes and
a stuffed really cool about us i'm
considering getting a code pin pro
account and i think i think that might
be nice but also but maybe like for
bigger projects all you still use github
to see you guys can download the whole
repo and go through the process of
hosting it on your own hey Finley what's
up man how are you hello how are you
super worried from buddy I'm some levels
in fall 2012 you guys all right um happy
you asked can you give a short tutorial
in radial gradients and how they work
yeah not right now I guess because we're
another question its I'm just reading
these questions without like knowing
what they are before something like oh
that should invest that but that would
be a good video actually absolutely a
really good one um will you start doing
some jQuery or JavaScript tutorials yes
I do have on the road map for this year
to do a javascript and jquery basics
series similar to the HTML and CSS
series that i started the channel with
so I've been looking forward to doing
those although jquery and javascript
which are out of the three probably my
weakest point so i expect a lot of you
guys to give me corrections as I'm going
through that series or what have you but
it should be a great learning experience
for me as well anymore any comments or
questions from everybody in the live
chat right now well I did this that's
had the pseudo select a pseudo selector
for the inputs you did a video on on mon
were supposed to channel the PHP Academy
and I had some discussion about that in
the comments I put there and if there
are any questions I'm willing to answer
them do you want to run through what you
did because it was really really cool
well basically I copied your code pan
and I started googling because I was
pretty sure that would be away with CSS
to check if
was a in the input has input in it a
value and I came out on CSS tricks i
believe and they said from they said use
this valid pseudo selector and that's
what I did I basically put that in the
SAS and removed the JavaScript and it's
mostly worked the only quirk was that
the the email absurd the selector
doesn't quite work when your input is of
the type email because and when you have
any input that is not a valid email yeah
construction it isn't a valid input so
the label doesn't move up so it will
wait until you have an at symbol and a
dot extension before it will move the
label because it's an email input is
that right yeah the dot is not really
required but the at the at symbol is ok
cool that's interesting do you think
it's worth it to just put a text field
in there and like you know because all
the the at symbol or sorry all of the
type email will really give you is on
mobile phones it'll change the keyboard
up a little bit if I understand it
correctly yes and the browsers like
Chrome on PC it will check if it is
actually valid email but for safety
reasons you always check your input in
PHP or yeah Ruby whatever server-side
script you're using so it doesn't really
matter i just don't use the type email
just type text and yeah validates my
inputs in the server side scripts great
great ok cool thanks for explaining that
was really cool when I saw that I was
like ah I love it when people take like
the weird examples that I make it just
totally improve them that's really
awesome for me to say it's super helpful
for me you know all right anybody else
want to say anything you're looking baby
bunnies what's that you're looking very
funny can you hear me yeah I can hear
you big
alright I'm saying you're looking very
funny I'm looking very funny I decided
to dress up today I wasn't sure what to
wear to the dev tips live party I don't
know I guess that this is actually the
tuxedo i got married in yes mr. fancy
pants and I didn't have the glasses when
I got married that was pretty funny
those guys is there killer these glasses
are actually a like you know like the
free ones you get like at a convention
they have like the logo of whatever
brand I scraped it off because I got
some red glasses these are cool red
raybans yeah yeah did you guys like the
the pseudo elements demo in the
beginning did you guys catch that um no
I mr. yeah oh well I recorded it for you
why now be going back and watching that
excellent okay here's a question is it
good to have high specificity or low
specificity in your style sheets
greetings from Venezuela that's from
Pedro what do you guys think high or low
specificity in your style sheets what
exactly do they mean with specific
specialty specificity is the basically
how specific is your selector in in
selecting the Dom element so for example
if you have a class of hello and then
it's a it's an anchor but it's inside of
a paragraph do you say p space helped
class hello or do you say class hell up
p space class hello is going to be a
little bit more specific though the
question is would you use a lot of
nesting to get a lil if you're using sex
would use a lot of nesting to get really
specific in your selectors or is it a
better idea to be as broad and kind of
low low level specificity as possible
what do you guys opinions on this well
it's just my idea but i use very
specific selectors for stuff I usually
don't want to reuse the styling I don't
want to reuse anywhere else on the page
but if I have a certain styling that
will give me more comment on the page
I'll simply use a more yeah less
specific selector which I did I didn't
use specifically selectors before but I
started using it when I started working
with sass and now i'm using it and i
love it way more because it gives you
way more if you weigh more it makes
cleaner code it looks neat it looks more
need mm-hmm I like personally I like to
nest down a lot but that's me I don't
know you like to Nashville I think about
that when I code I'm I tried to write
specific code as least as possible
mm-hmm that I can you know with a class
I can just use that several times and
then not to repeat my coat over and over
for different time dibs and whatever so
actually try to be at least specific as
possible to make my code more reusable
and I think if you're using also like a
like a CSS framework you want to find
one that is at least specific as
possible so that you can more easily
modify it so this that's my my how I see
it in the center absolutely any other
opinions on the topic well um my yeah uh
I don't scan I cannot find the word for
it my well never my tab I think you have
a you have to find your personal
preference in how specific you want to
be in your selectors okay I can't really
tell you for because do this or do that
you have to find for yourself what you
find yeah what you want to use okay
great so i have a video that i did in
the CSS basics series with like really
early on and i'll put a link to that in
in the description of this video after
we're done recording it but it'll be
more clear about what specificity is it
is a problem that some people run into
and they don't understand how one
selector can be more important or more
specific than others and understanding
that can really open up your eyes to
what's possible with CSS now you
mentioned frameworks that that's
actually really important aspect of this
whole question because when you're
writing Styles you want to make sure
that if later on you want to change them
or or like you know make variations of
that same style you want to overwrite
them with with more specific style so if
you incredibly specific styles up front
it's going to be hard to get run over
overwrite them with more specific styles
the general wisdom is use as nonspecific
selectors as possible every time because
later on there's going to be an
opportunity for you to be more specific
and what I find myself doing is you know
I'm like focused on this this little
button right here and so I'll style it
and I'll be like as specific as I need
to at that moment and then when I'm kind
of done with this idea this little kind
of nugget I will try to zoom out and say
okay where else does this need to go on
my page or in my website and try to try
to unspecified I'll try to like back
everything out and kind of clean it up
and optimize the code to be more modular
so that this button can show up on the
inside page it can show up on a landing
page wherever as long as I use a very
appropriate class name or whatever yeah
that's pretty much how I do it perfect
and the and just a word about
specificity I never ever use ID
selectors ID selectors are far too
specific and they'll throw everything
out the door yeah I mostly think our DS
you can use them in CSS definitely but I
simply use them for JavaScript
Oh sh t jquery they're very common in
javascript because of the hash is really
interesting way of doing you know the
way that the hash uses a URLs and stuff
like that so using name properties to
skip down a page and things like that
you do see that a lot in JavaScript also
a more more common JavaScript like get a
get element by ID is a lot more common
than get element by class name for some
reason I'm not sure why here's a
question again if i want to be a web
designer what is the most sure and
profitable method of learning studying
at an Internet technologies college and
IT college or maybe at home is
information around the internet in books
reliable and arranged and what are the
best sources for beginners okay so i'll
summarize that question make it little
bite-sized what is the best way to start
to start the path of becoming a
professional web designer go to youtube
/ diff tips hey all right well i'm
assuming that because this question is
on the channel he's done that uh what
what would you guys think should would
you did you guys go to school do you
prefer the the what is it called like
the structured learning of getting a
degree in web design or do you think
that it's sufficient to learn this stuff
on your own being self-taught um yeah
I'm going first again but i actually do
both in a way i am i am on schools for
RT programming specifically not
necessarily web design but i like it
very much so in my free time I also do a
lot of research and add ya trial and
error to find further development former
for my knowledge base I think you're
touching on an important part that even
if you do decide to go to school the the
the habit that the skill of self
learning is going to be more important
than anything that's if you're studying
on your own or even if you're studying
in college you can't rely on other
people to give you knowledge even if
you're paying
for you have to go out and search it and
supplement that knowledge yes I started
on my teaching teaching myself over the
internet and learning HTML and CSS and
that's great but you tend to get really
comfortable and what you know and you
don't tend to push outside of those
bounds so I was stuck for 15 years with
just plain ol HTML and CSS and I really
couldn't get outside of that box and I
went to a code school last year that
pushed me into frameworks and jquery and
javascript a little bit as much as i
could handle I got into bootstrap and
and get some of these things that I knew
was out there but khana was afraid and
didn't know where to begin how to start
so I do believe a supplemental formal
type of education in a classroom
definitely pushes you into those
uncomfortable places that will then
spark you to want to go find the
information what a great yes thanks for
sure I completely agree on that when I I
was in the first year i had an
upperclassmen who was really good at
coding and namely bhp and at that time
we had classes in PHP so I was kind of
interested kind yeah sounds a little bit
arrogant but I was kind of good and then
that guy showed me the stuff he made his
own PHP framework so I got really
inspired and learned a lot more from him
than from the teachers in the class so I
think going to closest is not only
you'll you get yeah nothing you get
stuff teach at school but it's also the
the people around you would teach you
mm-hmm that's really why we first have a
comment here from Robin oh geez there's
a guy here mowing my lawn or something
no even stopped okay there's a comment
here from Robin bosman who says
his advice on the on the topic is or
Robins advice is to start at college
because you can have a personal contact
with a pro you can get a diploma which
is really help you they just moved get a
job but you still need to study at home
a lot so basically diversifying the
approach right there I really like the
idea of having someone what catherine
was saying of having someone be there to
guide you and kind of forcibly push you
if needed into uncomfortable zones where
the where the growth can happen I really
like that and if you can't afford to go
to a university or something I think
finding a mentor might be able to maybe
a maybe a cheaper route than that but
you know there's well there's a lot that
goes into into having a relationship
with a mentor and treating that
relationship correct what is men
quarters Carlos do you have something to
say I hope that sign up again I made
your screen the primary one and you know
here is the right way mentor and self
learning that's his vote um Carlos on
self learning Carlos and I hope you guys
don't know this is my podcast companion
here and we have a podcast in one of the
first I think that was the first two
episodes we did correct ya self learner
yeah they were about self learning so
this is a great topic very close to
Carlos in my heart and I'm really glad
that you guys are all into it too I
think that self learning is going to be
the as i said before like be a critical
skill that you're going to have
throughout your entire career because
even if you do go to a formal education
that's going to end at one point you
know you're going to do your four years
or two years or your six months and then
you're going to be again on your own and
it's going to be that habit that
position that posture of self learning
that's going to carry you on afterwards
but but I really again want to underline
with catherine was saying about having
somebody to kind of push you in the
right direction that's going to be
really really important you can on other
reviews if stack overflow yes habit yeah
absolutely right how are you doing this
I go throws my Savior
yes I mean I think it is so so important
to take a ball and maybe you have an
idea of a project and I realized that
project maybe I know make your personal
portfolio side and with that a word with
the deck with that experience you would
become better better and better that's a
really good point I read a article
somewhere mmm where was it there was a
blog post in this guy was talking about
his kind of jump from one career
vertical into programming and he
explained it like he would like learn a
new technology and learn about a new
editor and learn about a new thing and
just jump all around like a
schizophrenic person and then when he
finally kind of got into his groove and
started seeing actual growth that's when
he learned to focus and I think that's
what you were kind of talking about
Roberto like choosing a project and
seeing that through is going to give you
greater gains than starting a whole
bunch of other you know random things
and never putting them together in it
yes yes yes because I think that way
when you are just jumping into that path
of a career which is a web design and or
web development you have to take a guy I
don't know first HTML then at CSS and
then also just but when you're taking
when you're learning HTML and CSS it's
good to focus on that first and then
take your time to knowing or get in
touch with the sublime text a good text
editor but the first goal is I loved
that thing to add CSS or HTML while is
fantastic is jump jump start and stop
coding
set your folk who said to your goal and
I don't know no you got a man that's
right awesome we have the portal for the
talking of my personal experience it's
also great to have a really good mentor
because I study in Italy after the
University and I get in touch with a
pitch these talents that I hey I look at
him as my mentor and whenever I have a
problem with I don't know something I I
I send a human male and he he he came
back to me with an answer and it's
fantastic awesome we have we have some
more comments here about the topic as
well here's from Eric Eric ellenbrook
says meetup com is also a great resource
to find like-minded people who can help
you push yourself further if you don't
have the means to get to a code school I
think I think Google+ is good at coding
and stuff you can join a community and
I'll help you like throw up and like
learn all the new stuff yeah you're
really big in what's your community
called the urine involved with web
developers designers and out of New
Mexico yeah yeah thanks thanks for
introducing my content to your community
that was a really big help for raising
awareness reductive by the way I
appreciate that yeah they're really
awesome like they're what was what was
the video it was the the inspiration
video like what what inspires you a
video and the comments string that you
get that your community you just kind of
took to is really really good really
inspirational so I'm really great
grateful that you shared that with them
we have another comment about the
question about
learning and becoming stepping into
professionalism from Thea go he says
what has really helped me is networking
getting involved with your community
start a workshop to help locals when you
make connections mentors will find you
that's my experience that that's good
one I went to a point to college and it
was a mixture of print and web design
the major there and when I graduated I
noticed my teachers i graduated
obviously a bit before me so they
weren't as up-to-date on certain things
and i learned a lot I learned a lot with
them I got started and then but
afterwards I signed up for Team
treehouse I don't know if anybody's
heard of King treehouse and with that I
learned probably twenty fold at the pace
that I was learning in school because I
could just eat it open my own pace you
know so there's definitely cheaper
alternatives out there that you could
actually learn a lot depending on what
school you have available to you so if
your local college will not have a
program that you think it's up to date
you know just jump online like don't be
limited or what's around you necessarily
there's a lot of resources under the bed
what's that they're like notepad is the
best editor no pad is the best editor
are you answering a question is that
what that is the local colleges like
they don't have it they're like oh oh
the OIC they'll recommend notepad which
is like yeah cool not that much you know
that man we're gonna we're gonna wrap it
up soon does anybody want to pick a
question over here in the column or the
if dude if you click the Q&amp;amp;A button on
the right but it shows up on there maybe
it's backwards because the cameras but
does anybody want to pick a question
that speaks to them and they want to
answer um before we before we wrap it up
is that a no well it's got a lesson SAS
questions go ahead take it I mean I
don't know the answer so primed for you
yep a little open it up what am I losing
out if I choose less over SAS do you
know the difference yourself I don't
know just I was interested by that I
don't think you're missing out on much
so the difference between lessons ass is
mostly that less if i'm not mistaken it
is like javascript-based compiling and
SAS is Ruby based compiling right is it
is that in my correct in saying this you
can use it tough with the a no no dear
so we'll see yeah awesome you don't know
that it's God notes us yeah clever um
okay so and then but the the difference
in the syntax a loss had a question am I
wearing pants the answer will not be
revealed the difference in the syntax
between sass and less I I used less
initially to introduce myself to
pre-processing a few years ago and when
I jumped to sass I was I was like okay
this makes a little bit more sense to me
everything I found this is my personal
opinion but it seemed that everything
was like the syntax was a little bit
more structured we're less was trying to
be a little bit clever like you could
take a class like like oh how you write
a class like dot hello and you could put
that class into the properties of
another class and it would that would be
like an extension in n Sasson and it was
like I don't underst I don't understand
why and like how does that kind of what
happens to the first time it was a
little bit more confusing to me and I
felt that that sass was a little bit
more um specific in what it was trying
to accomplish and then and then finally
when I switched to indented flavor of
sass what something Oh less doesn't have
the indented flavor of unfortunately so
if
you do want this indent indented lose
the brackets kind of posture when you're
coding you can use stylus or SAS hey
Travis I'd like to help out on the
question about editors other than
sublime think i've i've worked with
github atom which is it sits up there in
the comparable to sublime i've also used
brackets it kind of depends on what
project I'm working on I know brackets
has its own live in the browser reload
which is works really well and I use
brackets a lot because Adobe's Photoshop
has its built-in extract feature where
you can extract a PDF and pull in the
CSS at the same time click on items in
the PDF and be able to just pop in the
CSS code immediately which is pretty
awesome I've tinkered with it a little
bit but not not mastered that process
but for me sublime I started with
sublime text 2 there's some features
that sublime text 3 has it has image
preview in sublime text 3 which to does
not and it's kind of hit or miss when it
comes to the plug-in you want in sublime
sometimes it works for just two or just
three and sometimes it works for both
Adam also has a very big community of
plugins as well and then it's integrated
with get itself because github and get
produced that product which is Adam so
they're all very strong in the top three
or four that I would choose pick one and
stick with it and then master it I think
that's the key right there at the end it
doesn't really matter what you use it's
gonna be just how comfortable you are
with it in the end if you're looking for
opinions there's going to be a lot of
them and that's great that's kind of you
a lot yeah
in the end what you're what you're
comfortable with is going to be the best
for you and pushing that on other people
can get and get a little contentious
sometimes really am when I was in the
first year the teachers of my school
said you well basically use notepad plus
plus plus plus sorry and I used it I
pretty much started to dislike it and I
started to look around for myself and I
use sublime for a while but now i'm
basically set on a PHP store mostly
because when i use localhost servers
with X debug I can use I can debug PHP
in my at the in phpstorm and it's a big
help when you can use breakpoints in
your coat yes thiago in the comments
also recommends a phpstorm he says you
really all caps have to give it a go
isn't it yet I've used every single one
in my quest for perfection he gave ya go
um I i was using co2 the other day on a
project and then it crashed i thought i
should try something else now that so i
like using all the different ones i
don't think any one of them is the best
i like the differences between them so
i'm gonna try something new soon as you
in my next few videos you'll be seeing
me trying something i think im gonna try
brackets everybody everybody in the
comments is like trans do not try
raggedy i right you don't know you miss
now racket is cool yeah lebanon reason
why you used a text editor and not the
ID for example which also do page pistol
yes wait what's the question why do you
use text a little and not the ID oh I'm
not sure you don't really need an ide
for web development like I don't know
like maybe now for embassies yeah like I
de for MVC dotnet just being that kind
of stuff but not like normal HTML CSS
and JavaScript side and
wordpress kind of things that simple
lever is like on ide I'm like you don't
need an ID for web development yeah and
i find that when i'm using all these
different kinds of things like SAS and
jade and like different kind of things
that um all elected the handy little
tricks that the editors will give you a
kind of fly out the window anyway like
the little live refreshing and the uh
you know if you can see the brackets
does this thing where you can drop down
the CSS you can see the CSS right in the
HTML that kind of like doesn't work with
sass and everything anyway so yeah it's
cool if you're using straight CSS I
stopped doing that like a few years ago
right gotcha cute I shall go ahead but
if you like a big in area I think
vanilla CSS is like the best way to do
like this the start of things is you
have to learn all the stuff basically
like you have to learn all the base
first then you can go ahead and use any
framework or something like that but
first of all you have to take all your
basics down then you can go ahead I
completely agree alright the last
question that we're going to do before
we before we button this up is from I'm
sorry if I'm mess up your name mo mo hid
zaman okay sorry and he says what do you
think about the web development in 2020
well those trends be like so this is
right now we're in the beginning of 2015
he wants to know about twenty twenty
what do you guys project smooth
transitions and animations on everything
that'll never happen supported by
internet explorer yeah oh no no no
projects parts and the new internet
explorer oh yeah
whispers about that Evan I didn't like
watch the videos or anything yet on it
Internet Explorer is modern in 2020
assume that when the actual release of
like css3 is happening or something this
is our html5 i can remember which one
like not sure is not officially released
until then or something and as far as
I'm aware Jesus free is already released
only major browsers simply don't have
the complete support in its you need to
the defenders selectors like that but I
also read today there already CSS for
selectors being developed so and they
are pretty cool yeah I did see an
article about that it was interesting
one of them called has see that no but I
have this site for Mozilla that has a
big list of all those selectors and it's
pretty cool a possum all right we are
gonna close down I am so excited thanks
you guys for making this show a success
I was so nervous I couldn't sleep last
night I was like trying to I was tossing
and turning like what do I say it's live
I don't know what I can't even edit it
so anyway thanks for making that is a
really really enjoyable for me and less
stressful last time I was like sweating
bullets this was a like a lot better
than the last time the maybe is the
tuxedo I could promise you this much you
are not the only one was nervous I was
not aware I was participating in the
life episode is that right you didn't
realize it would be just like that but
now I've done it I I am okay with it's
pretty cool now you guys want to start
your own YouTube channel that's that's a
far way off losses having all these
riccardi faces on there wow I was a bit
like a very well I saw my youtube feet
there were the live stream so if I
didn't saw that a bra I didn't know her
choice and I saw you like oh there's
live stream let's watch and
and I didn't know I was going to join it
all is that right yes I tell you what
this a google plus thing is like the
weirdest the weirdest thing ever some
people can never join like how do i join
in i'm like i don't know it there's a
link right i don't know that i sent you
an invite i don't know what that means
and and then you guys are like oh oh i
just accidentally joined like it's the
first thank you posing next time you
should treat it like my new today and I
was like oh what is happening right now
one time I'm sorry she said that you
were about to post the link and I was
like oh yes let's click on that maybe
it's a it's a higher resolution stream
to watch and then I'm a participating
I'm okay okay somebody is not have
invested people to click on the link
will get in the life thing yep and then
if you join after that you're put as a
viewer and then you have to wreak lick
the link when someone leaves in order to
get in oh right that's why I like to
laugh and I click back in and I jump
back on cuz no one had clicked on it so
I'm one of the lucky temp accidentally
accidentally lucky yeah anyway guys
thanks everybody had a really good day
today um keep on hacking yes sir have a
good day thank you have a good day I
don't want good evening to the ones in
Europe thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
