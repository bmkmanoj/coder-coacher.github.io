you to everyone for your love and
support it's been really meaningful to
me over these past few months
ah let me ask you a question have you
ever been in an interview that you were
really really excited about it only to
have it just not work out well I have
and one time I interviewed at Adobe and
I was in the interview and I for some
reason started arguing with the
interviewer about what flat design
really is and and I walked away thinking
I think I nailed it I think I made some
valid points
I did not nail it I did not nail it
today I'm going to share with you a talk
that I gave to the Berkeley design
students and it's about my journey my
adventures in interviewing specifically
the things that I learned while I was
interviewing at Google and I think that
these things will be valuable to you
these these principles and tips will be
helpful to you on your own professional
journey so please enjoy better and
amazing than the day doctor long time
ago I thought is like use an image of a
billboard or something so that's what
I'm making the income to help me make
some
in the foot think about it and the
changes and then shows my buddy in that
big haunted either yeah
goodbye ji over to Google interactions
nighttime surgery and then by night I do
like like teaching and publishing so I
have that YouTube channel to deafness
where it's easy to describe a toad and
then you have a long beard and that's
where the world of the other comes from
I have our podcast with my best friend
coldly I just have enough he's a
designer as well and heart of actually
speaking of me a lap dance a major
enough and flossing is know that I write
every region since ten months what I'm
going through I'm thinking how come grew
it house with people who resist in that
so so part of the journey that I have
that you know making these videos a kind
of compounds or educational language
tutorial but sometimes they're like very
personal to broaden something I happen
to walk the process of getting a job at
Google is a very long and tiresome
process kind of like me right in the
middle of it like I don't know how this
is going guys like it was a very
dangerous thing for me to do this
publicly because like what is you know
everybody
like I designed now these bigger genera
but let pass didn't actually got the job
it was a really exciting thing and so
now I'll be sitting at my desk and
pretending that I'm good as I as
somebody who I am like hey I've hired
videos and they helped me get here too
and was extensively fulfilling to meet
somebody in the place that I was neat
and it's all part of helping them to
achieve really great feeling to help
each other share information stuff like
that so what I want to do is kind of
talk about the interview process
maybe me if there's something that I can
help you guys get and you know when that
time comes for you help you understand
like meet with what work and what I
learned going through the process to
Google so a little bit of information
about interviewing like every something
is different course and like I didn't
come to start a track or Google and that
was more like hey let's go you have a
drink and are you cool cool you're hired
it was like nothing but this is more
like organizational process and
Bloomie's it's moving in advance like
power lighting structures of wisdom and
stuff like that so this is how like what
I learned so here's how much of the
linear process that I've had mapped out
so initially there's gonna be some type
of contact name is a recruiter contact
you maybe you submit a resume or what
happens if there's no contact is made
and shortly after that they'll want to
keep them work and so they
and a few lanes and you don't like you
know whatever you've got and it is good
enough then you get into this section
where they start actually talking to you
and the pub interview who in then like
if your real business design challenge
it gives you the thing like you know you
got two days to complete a stone and
essentially one day and half has bigger
problems than ones we know the next six
our certainty is done in Turnitin so
that's what that means is that there's a
green website if they liked it and then
after is negotiated like how do I fit
into this organization who's we my
master and prophet there's the really
interesting inflection point in this
journey where they stop trying to weed
you out and they start trying to help
you man
and that's kind of for me it was right
around there so you know to move it so I
guess what it understand I'm saying if
you do appreciate little but accompany
go through to get you hired it's
actually a very expensive process not
only in terms of money but in terms of
in terms of time in terms of attention
and they kind of think through this up
quite long and hard was like committee I
mean make sure you the right person and
all this and so how much time and energy
and money goes into that you
quick service relay how much does a
recruiter make is though sometimes
depending on the situation between the
percentage or any income activity okay
so this is an expense that a company has
the paper to get you to come work for
that and like ever I would you know
their client contributors created were
like we want to do this when the
listening situation should happen but
it's actually a long expensive product
so there's this point where the company
has kind of like decided okay we're not
trying to get rid of it as fast as
possible just like this resume off my
deck I want to invest time into this
person make sure there's a right of it
and help them on right and that's kind
of like right after the design challenge
for me anyway that flexibility so I
thought in talking with you I did point
to one of the most critical moments that
happen before that inflection point and
kind of give you a little bit of hit for
that and for me that was over the phone
energy because as I challenge you guys
recommends the vine because you know I'm
pretending they're speaking to people
and kind of like figuring out in the
moment right it is most necklace part of
a flipping because you have to get on
the phone with someone you've never met
before and in like 10 seconds figure out
who they are what they're all about
these their language help them identify
with you and sell yourself if you like
raising part and I actually recorded my
phone conversations and it hit laughs so
the buzzer that time from from this like
accordion which Hackman wanted to know
about what I went through
so to give you a few points the first
thing is the quality of the actual phone
call is like pretty tactical stuff
you're not gonna come out of this like
learning you know the Golden Age I'm
telling you real anything up though it's
all quality of your phone call matters
oh right
can you imagine try to be on this is a
really pretty but I recommended to my
friends who each other I had an intimate
regarding the whole time and the
feedback I got like yeah it was really
cool but we're arguing the other room
and people like so like to get like not
only take care of make sure your phone
is charged make sure you have good
reception but make sure I know if your
neighbors are loud or the baby's crying
or whatever let's get yourself in a good
spot so weird
not only is the phone call not
distracting but where you are mentally
in the game right and here's a pro tip
make sure there's nobody to stop the
William all right second bit is to read
the Job Description okay this is funny
this may sound very very elementary got
to listen there is some some heavy
in it stuff inside of the description
they're telling you what they want right
it is like the road map to the
successful interview
read the descriptions what is I meant
that one description and I rewrote it in
my own language I wanted to internalize
how they thought but it would come out
naturally in my own speech looking for
key words looking for ideas to kind of
like you need to demonstrate that you're
on the same wavelength with them that
you're the thing that they're looking
for right within say a job description
and also take a look like if the company
has a yeah
what are those things called a mission
statement or values go in there and
learn to you know eat that that company
language and you go in there and you
think you have to leave
a third one no third one is have a
strong personal statement okay realizing
that is people speak to hundreds of
people just like you
what differentiate yourself from them is
actually who you are and you're going to
get this posture right let you sit down
and interview maybe if the phone call
which one hey tell me about yourself are
you prepared to answer that question
right now I would recommend writing it
out longhand memorizing that is there
should be a script when you need
somebody to play by yourself with your
story you prove you got it you know
exactly who you are you know what your
values are and what your goals are and
you can articulate them quickly
distinctly and clearly that's so
impressive and what you need to be doing
is making sure that as you walk away
from that energy that the person who's
on the other side of the feather table
has a very clear understanding of who
you are and what makes difference okay
anyhow some methods big failure on your
part last one because have your
questions ready doesn't you notice are
always towards the end of a go any other
questions right if your leg um what's
your vacation so we're losing him
like those like the wrong question to
think about so yeah you're going to get
all your questions answered over time
you may even start to John not having
all the naturalist eventually the longer
that's right so the idea here is not to
discover the idea here is to impress so
how can you turn this opportunity of
gaining information actually into a way
of impressing the energy order you could
ask them something that would relate
relate themselves back to you how has
company helps you achieve your goals
right what you want to do is give them
an opportunity to brag you want to give
them an opportunity to talk about
themselves and bring up looks really
great feeling you want to connect those
good feelings to yourself right there's
that Association that you're building
there and they hang up the phone and
then come on get it on
the best thing you can do on a day July
clip them talk and they'll have all
these great students that people love
talking about things up and so they hang
this on close it at all
I also dream proceeded to a few minutes
right okay so this weekend problem so
nervous about this happened once talked
about texting days and our luxury edit
OB max as well and I had the opportunity
to meet my call to my heroes and the
people that I look up to an inspired
inspired by it and so is I mean it's
really a haha
the great rhythm of the here and keep
focusing on the weird side project
appeared like ideas you have for things
because those tend to start not holding
into other projects and things you
really just want to do so I'm problem
all your guts and appeared bracelet
beard side national Robert generate the
third I'm an illustrator educator self
will play inspector art line so device
why because I know y'all scared right I
look scared right head need to be scared
right you need to be number one learn as
much you possibly can to be prepared to
move with the wind and three apply what
have you learned or whatever you're
currently doing and finally don't think
that things are separate everything is
linked to connect it together just like
we are now
do it my name is Sarah DG I am a adobe
creative president also a user and love
all things internet and something that I
have learned that is applicable to I
think all you know school creative
projects in general is when in doubt
keep creating you never know what the
next video with an executor you take
what's in the chronic we do is going to
be your big breakthrough so whenever
you're doubting yourself any Fastenal
eyes just keep creating keep making that
video you just don't want to you never
know is that next thing is going to be
your breakfast yeah my name's my
chromosomes I'm an illustrator and
spider at chop hi
advice is don't be intimidated by how
big the design community cancer it's
actually pretty quality ones kind of
friends bedroom pretty quickly and
you'll probably be friends with everyone
pretty quick thank you my name is Jay
Lewis I'm a creative director and
founder of nine o'clock my biggest
advice for creative trying to get the
industry is to continue to document
everything she needs a document all your
work you do so that people that are
looking to hire you can actually find
your work say was I know Mary Jane strap
143 years old a graphic designer
how will you youngsters little animals
enjoy your lives
enjoy your youth and don't be a too
eager to go out and with every job learn
to love graphic design first don't ever
sit up there so you'll figure it out but
love it playlists are just up your buddy
just will help throw that stuff that's
serious stuff look at their feelings for
you oh yeah yeah what's up a studio we
get the light the throwing and throwing
in a better I don't want to like be in
the situation where like hey guys but
and I have around me I want the lighting
to be good you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
