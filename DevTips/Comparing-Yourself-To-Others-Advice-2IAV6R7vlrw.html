about finding meaning in your work and I
argue the point that asking yourself why
are you doing what you're doing is so
much more motivating than asking
yourself what are you doing and what are
you trying to accomplish and it gave the
example of dev tips that I don't simply
make videos because that's the what or
at least it's one of them but the why of
dev tips why do I make these videos and
do these things gets to give others the
tools and experiences to change their
lives and to be in control of their own
future that is why dev tips exists now
for me that's really motivating and we
can talk more about that at another time
in fact I was interviewed recently on
the developer T podcast and we talked
about that we go into that a lot and I
recommend that you check out Jonathan's
podcast it's one of my favorite it was a
big inspiration actually when I was
generating the ideas for the patron
podcast anyhow I got an email yesterday
from dev tipper Hamza and it was in
response to the finding meaning in your
work email note he writes that is really
good and kind thinking I like it and I
sometimes Envy you I like it because I
would like to have that sort of thinking
and mindset I envy you also for the same
reason I would love it if I started
thinking like that I see people like you
or alex from PHP academy' or other
programmers or developers so successful
so excellent so great and I want to be
like you all great successful excellent
I guess that motivates me to continue to
do what I do Thank You Hamza I'd like to
respond publicly if that's okay I think
you bring up a lot of good points that
would help a lot of other people that
are in your same situation okay so
you know I'm glad that you're thinking
about these things and and thinking
about the kind of professional that you
want to be it's that kind of mindfulness
that will take you very far in the long
run and you will notice as time goes on
that this is one of the things that will
separate you from your peers there are a
lot of people that are here because they
think it's cool or fun or even easy but
it's going to be people like you who
really want it that are going to rise to
the top it takes years though I've been
doing this for over 10 years and I still
feel the same way you do like I want to
be good like I want to be a success I
look at the work of other creators and I
die of jealousy my work never seems to
be as good as theirs you see that
feeling never really goes away and I
don't think that it should let it drive
you let it motivate you to keep on
hacking don't let it discourage you that
will make all of the difference that
same feeling can either push you away or
you can drive you for good so when you
look at people like myself or Alex
people who put themselves out in the
public keep in mind that there's nothing
special or different about us we are
just as confused and scared and
conflicted and insecure is everyone else
maybe even more I don't know we've just
learned to live with it a little bit and
to use that feeling positively so all of
this is to say keep on hacking with the
emphasis on keeping on that will make
the difference thank you for your email
I hope this was helpful and to everyone
else who's watching these videos if you
enjoy this if you like these kind of
videos where we're not really coding
just kind of talking I like to know let
me know what you guys are struggling
with and if I'm able I would love to
lend a few words of advice so goodnight
everyone or good morning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
