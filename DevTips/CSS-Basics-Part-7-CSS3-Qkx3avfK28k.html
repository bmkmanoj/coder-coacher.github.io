you're watching dev tips this is the 4/7
seventh video in a series called CSS
basics and today is a special day
because we're talking about css3 if you
watch the other series I did called
html5 basics you may recall that I
described html's evolution and
progression as a series of innovations
followed by standardizations CSS follows
a very similar pattern now the first
version actually in CSS we called them
levels the first level of CSS was
released to recommendation status in
1996 CSS 2 was released in 1998 but it
was a tumultuous time for the web
there were many browsers who were vying
for market share dominance and not too
concerned with standards compliance or
an even enjoyable web as a result of all
that commotion CSS 2 is released and
then later redacted and then released
again and the truth is no web browser
has ever fully implemented the full spec
of CSS 2 even today but because of the
fast-paced nature of the web these
specifications are often out of date
even before they're published CSS 2.1
was introduced in 2004 but only received
full recommendation status in 2011 after
that the CSS working group outlined a
new roadmap for the development of CSS
or in other words began work on css3 one
of the most interesting things about
css3 is that it's not an enclosed full
spec like the previous versions or
levels were css3 is published in modules
the word modules threw me off for a
while in understanding what we're
actually talking about so to help you
guys you can think of it as like themes
or grouping of ideas or maybe like
chapters in a book publishing in modules
allows for fast paced reprioritization
based on the needs of the web parallel
development of different modules and the
ability to add new features or modules
as needed
so now CSS like HTML can never really
quite be done so let's take a look at
these modules there are many but here
are a few of the most important ones
selectors the box model backgrounds and
borders text effects transformations and
animations each of these modules could
be an entire video series on their own
so my goal is not really to talk about
every one but make you aware of them and
a little bit about what they do
selectors we've already had two videos
in this series about selectors selectors
are very important to CSS but we've only
touched pretty lightly on them there are
so many awesome bits out there for you
guys to discover I mean you can do
things like target a content that's in
French or target all of the elements
that are only children of their parents
or even target elements that do not meet
specific criteria CSS is just so big we
need to have an entire talk about this
but the box model is how elements define
their geometry on a page so for example
like you know the content boxes that
they're in or the the padding or the
borders or the margins around and how
they interact with each other you can
use new CSS properties to tell the
browser to change how they calculate how
big an element is like literally like
where they should start counting
backgrounds and borders new to CSS is
the opportunity to use multiple
backgrounds or gradients and backgrounds
or to change the size of a background
based on how big the container is or
proportions of how big the background
should be super handy awesome stuff
didn't duck the Berg's crap like tech
shadows whitespace wrapping line
breaking alignments justification I mean
you can even choose the font that you
want to use when I started building
internets you had to choose from like
five there was five fonts and if you
didn't choose one of those five fonts
you got it you got a Times New Roman
actually that was one of the five so
you're choosing it anyway dude webs are
so much more awesome now transformations
you can transform objects with CSS you
can rotate scale skew it's off the hook
for real you can even do all of these
things in 3d space CSS is amazing
transitions and anna anna animations you
can now set a timing to how things
change for example transition and
opacity from 0 to 1 over 500
milliseconds to make the appearance of
something fading in make crap fly all
about with predetermined multi-step
keyframes and loops and all kinds of
junk I mean there is so much here oh I'm
getting I'm getting so worked up here
halfway because CSS is so cool and also
because of the crushing realization that
even over seven videos I really taught
you very little about CSS there's just
it's just so large it's such a massive
scale the things it can do and the
interplay that each thing has to do with
another it's so big so I look at these
videos as not a tutorial or an in-depth
treatise on the subject but more for you
guys an eye-opener on what's out there
and what you should be looking at and
playing with so I really think the only
way that you guys are going to learn to
use HTML and CSS well is just to use it
like guys make something make something
today and tomorrow and if you can go
back in time and make something
yesterday because if you didn't you're
already a day behind these videos are
intended to give you context and help
you learn what else is out there and
show you what you should be learning
the best way to learn is really to make
stuff the only way to learn how to make
stuff is to make stuff next week we're
going to talk about something super
exciting to me it's called preprocessors
and then after that I think we're going
to close the CSS basics video series
thanks for watching guys and leave any
questions you have in the comments and
to get you started let me ask you guys a
question what was that one CSS aha
moment where you kind of just something
clicked for you and you got it and you
realize how big and powerful CSS is how
awesome it is I'm really interested in
your guy's experiences until next time
share this with your friends if you want
to I don't know I don't care whatever if
you haven't yet subscribe that's cool
too yeah we talked about coding websites
mocking up a document to wind down
styles to make a look awesome we don't
care
subscribe to tips it's right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
