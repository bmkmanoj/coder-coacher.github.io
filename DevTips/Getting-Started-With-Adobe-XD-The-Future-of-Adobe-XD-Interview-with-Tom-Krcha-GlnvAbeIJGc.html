episode in this series called getting
started with Adobe XD we've taken a tour
of all the design tools and last week
you looked at prototyping we looked at
what it's like for someone to switch
from the tools they're using today be it
a sketch or our Photoshop and today
we're gonna have a sit-down with one of
the original creators of the tool a
project manager Tom Kirk J and we're
gonna talk to him about what it's been
like to develop this tool and and and
what the future holds for Adobe XD ok I
hope you guys enjoy this thank you Tom
and thank you for Adobe for sponsoring
this entire series it's been a great way
to end the year hey what's up everybody
I'm Travis and I'm here with Tom Hurka
today tom is the product manager for
Adobe XD and I'm really excited to talk
to you today Tom about the future of XD
and how your how your products been
going so far and what we have coming up
hey everybody thank you so much for
having me Travis uh-huh yeah let's let's
begin - dad so first of all right now
our main focus was to ship beta which we
have done and basically beta is about
testing the performance testing the
basic tools the how do they work
together you know and testing all of
these modes the basic flow which is
design prototyping and sharing and how
long your beta build life so we
basically launched in March and then
every single month we've been sending
out updates and the folks getting all
the feedback on that and I think it's
been like eight months since - max it's
been a lot of fun to watch it evolve
what has been like the biggest challenge
in developing XT so far so the biggest
challenge of course was to make sure
that so we actually put those challenges
on ourselves in the beginning we were
like we want a tool that is really fast
and fluid battery smooth and also a tool
it is high quality and that of course
takes a lot of effort to make it happen
especially when you scale the team from
like few folks to dance and so on you
know okay and making sure that you don't
break things that you have built before
you know that's like the biggest chill
enjoy so I think we're doing pretty well
based on the feedback we're getting from
the community today hmm
and also based on on the tweeze we're
trying to reply to almost every single
to be that you guys send out so
definitely keep us in the loop a special
round of things that you want us to
build you know and everyone has to focus
on if something doesn't work let us know
we'll immediately start to looking into
that and so on ok so what's on the
roadmap and in your future what can we
expect soon so what can we expect soon
so first of all we'll keep iterating on
on XD of course with the design and for
diving features Windows is coming up
really soon it's gonna be the first beta
with Windows customers you're asking for
XD so it is kinda in the comments as
always s yeah and it's gonna be a big
deal and that's it it's one of the
differences in XD is that we are
building and natively for each platform
so that's a that's a big deal for us and
also for for customers because on Mac
it's a magnetic app on Windows Windows
native app on on iOS we have preview and
Android as well and those are also
native apps so they perform the best
mm-hmm and that's always what do we want
it you know so Windows is coming up next
we're also doing a few updates to the
mobile app so you'll be able to open up
the the project on your mobile app from
the cloud mm-hmm so if you want to save
your approaches in the cloud and then
have them traveled a few okay as well as
being able to cache the last project
that you have been pretty big on a
mobile device and few more weeks you
know but in a longer term what we're
looking at is of course the features
that we have announced that it'll be
Mac's one of them being real-time
collaboration so this is what we've been
hearing more and more from people
especially in teams you know were day
right now they have a single file but
its file is being accessed by multiple
people everybody serves their own
version and then somebody else has to
merge it together at the end of the day
right which is a growing pain of
hmmm or you have one set of components
in one sticker sheet you know everybody
accesses the sticker sheet and then it's
just complicated you know the workflow
gets really complicated we want
everybody to be able to access their
command end time of the day pretty much
like Google Docs you know and keep
working in it mm-hmm and that sticker
sheet will like if I update this sheet
it'll update it will propagate through
other documents is that exactly really
yeah that's really cool so I mean that's
actually something we're looking into
that
how did should exactly work so you know
that we have created of libraries mm-hmm
which is a similar concept where you
have one source of truth mm-hm and
you're using those components across
multiple documents and if you change the
source of truth you get notifications in
all of these documents and they you can
update those assets in those documents
very easily you know sort of basically
linked so a link workflow is definitely
something that's interesting for us in
relationship to XD as well right right
and how does that in how does it impact
like the feedback cycle and like
exporting elements for developers or
giving absolutely so that's when we you
look at a basic workflow where we store
it which is the one I described in the
beginning which is design prototype
share that share component you know
spans first of all across these both
major components the design and pro
titles live collaboration but also you
work with other stakeholders on the team
you work with developers and you want to
be in constant loop with those people
and for that we were planning developer
handoff so you'll be able to send out
specs and style guides and keep folks in
the loop ok will generate red lines and
things like that you'll be able to
generate red lines you'll be able to
extract a specific asset or maybe CSS
code and and so on so that's what we're
looking at right now well I saw one time
Talan who's the the designer of XP he
was showing me that anytime you make a
color of anything or a font size or any
something like that it would be like in
this library that was per document and
then if you changed that thing like
changed all the blues we change that one
thing you change all of the blues to
green or something
like that of course so basically when
he's the resigning you have just few
screens huh
as a sir design grows you have 10 15 20
50 screams yeah and now we want to play
with variations you can try different
colors you can try different fonts you
know mm-hmm and at that point the
problem is a much larger scale mm-hm how
can you manage that so for that we're
planning an assets panel on the side
where you will be able to manage your
colors and character styles as well as
symbols it'll be an extension of the
symbol spell okay and from from that
point if you have a swatch colors
fortunate panel and you change it the
change will propagate to whatever that
color is used so you can play it with
things yeah foster that's cool I'm just
like I just want those one of those
tools right now I see like the the
preview is that you guys are doing the
demos you guys are doing it max and
stuff and I'm like so ever since the
beginning it's been about design at a
speed of thought yeah and all of these
things playing - dad no life
collaboration yeah I don't have to have
like underscore final final final final
version you know where every single file
you know like five different versions
and so on hmm you have one file you go
into that file and that's where you work
with other people you know they make
changes you make changes and it just
works the same thing with this assets
panel where you can make a change a core
is the board and it just works cited you
don't have to switch between the tools
when you're just trying a flow you can
design and prototype and a single two
lines and so on you know like the design
is speed of thought is in and out in the
tool right now and also in our vision
going forward right so personally what's
your favorite thing about working on XD
so of course I used to be an evangelist
in the past and for me being able to
talk to designers all day long and
getting their feedback and just tweaking
Fink's you know and I mean it's just
like it's like building a Lego or
something it's just fun to build things
you know and and especially building a
thing that is the creation tool for
other people to build other things
little bit of meta you know doodad yeah
and I figured that's what excites me
that's awesome
well XE has gotten a lot of attention
lately especially at when I was at Max
it seemed like XD was everywhere so
congratulations on that and thanks for
thanks max we're having this
conversation everybody check out XD it's
so great check out the other videos have
been making a bad XD and we'll see you I
will see you next week
