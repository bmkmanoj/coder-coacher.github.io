bass Travis anything ah ash Kay asks
you've mentioned once before that we
should provide case studies instead of
traditional portfolio pages can you
suggest a more detailed way of how our
professional web designer or developer
should maintain their web presence ash
Kade there are a million answers to this
question because everybody kind of does
it their own way but I can talk about my
current strategy so my current strategy
is to identify the high traffic areas
the high searchable areas the places
where people will find me and optimize
those to display the things that I want
people to see to get the kind of work
that I want to do you follow me
okay so there's Travis Nielsen comm is
this a high-traffic property it's
probably not it's my personal website if
you know my name you might go there if I
tell you about the website you might go
there but it's it's not a very high
traffic I don't look at the I don't look
at the analytics I don't really care
about who goes to Travis Nelson calm but
what you'll find on Travis Nelson calm
is more or less a directory to other
things other things that I do keep
updated and you know publish things that
I want people to find on for example if
I were a designer looking for work I
would I would keep up a dribble and a
behance account and keep those up to
date with fresh work and you know I
think that dribble and Behance are
interesting because they do provide
opportunities for you to have a showcase
of your work in other words what do we
say a case study right behan says this
long page they let you show beginning
ideas process results you can put videos
there you put animations you can have
long images snapshots of work
a lot of stuff dribble also not not to
the degree but dribble also you have
that kind of cover image but you can
attach things if you have a pro account
so there's a lot of opportunity to to
use those tools as portfolio pages and
why would you do that you might think
well a professional designer needs to
have his own domain sure I totally agree
with that I mean I have my own because I
need my home right but these are
branches that you're placing out into
the world and these are findable
branches right you do a search for
Travis let me think why would you do a
search for chefs you probably wouldn't
but if you do a search for like designer
San Francisco you you know Google
tubular I don't I don't know like I
don't know I don't know what you would
search for but the point is my my
Behance
is much more likely to show up than my
personal website if you're not
describing me directly I've gotten more
more job offers through LinkedIn than
any other platform
second only to behance and it's funny
because the quality of job offers a lot
lower LinkedIn I've taken a lot more job
offers from baganz but but the volume
comes from LinkedIn and then there's
like the things that I do like YouTube
and and Twitter and stuff those are
pretty visible so I put so I put
creative work out here like I want to
teach potential collaborators sponsors
patrons clients the kind of work that I
want to do which is this which is
talking with you guys teaching you know
people elevating the craft and if
there's a way that I can make money
doing that and this is a great place to
kind of broadcast that
so in summary have a bait home base but
make it kind of a directory this is like
my strategy it's not the only way to do
it but have a base and make it a
directory now from that directory use
those branches out there that are
available that are high traffic high
search like networking kind of oriented
places
you put your work in front of people
that's where they're gonna see it
they're not going to see it at your own
domain so and when you're out there you
know you tried to tell the story as much
as possible don't think that just
because you're showing somebody a pretty
picture that they understand it all
right okay thank you for your question
and that's it for this video you just
watched ask Travis anything if you have
a question for me then send it to week
two at dev tips show and hashtag Travis
