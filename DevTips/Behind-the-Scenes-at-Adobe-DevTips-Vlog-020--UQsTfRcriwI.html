into the Adobe offices right there
this is Adobe in San Francisco and I'm
going to do a live stream for two hours
about design thinking and UX sketching
and then tomorrow we'll be using Adobe
comment and then after that maybe doing
some coding depending on how it goes so
it's a big day I'm really nervous which
should be like we're in the recording
studio these guys are about to do their
show you see that I want to do their
show in about one minute and then
recording right now
we are done with the broadcast Michael
you did an amazing job thanks my same
way that was awesome we had so much fun
and and we got a few more broadcasters
up the rest of the day I'm gonna go take
a nap
that was a guy one they have a bunch of
sketches from the from the stream we're
gonna hopefully go and sketch more
tonight and get ready for tomorrow to
create new visual designs in front of
everybody I think today went really well
and I'm really excited by everybody from
you guys who showed force showing up in
the comment stream showing up and just
being so supportive and awesome that
makes me really happy it makes me really
excited to be a part of this
it's been like a long day kids are in
bed I've been here for the past thing
two hours or so just working on more
sketches for this show tomorrow let me
show you what I got here's all the
research and discovery we did and turn
that off and here's all the sketches
I've got kind of like a map here that'll
tell us like the flow and like basically
a listing of all of the pages that I
needed to create and here's you know an
outline of what I think the menu should
be and then here's here's just kind of
all the pages exploring different kind
of layouts exploring different kind of
ways to get around here the old ones
there's one that Michael drew on the on
the stream that's it for the sketches or
those are all done and I feel pretty
confident we're gonna have a pretty cool
app the thing I need to do now is to
collect assets like pictures of houses
pictures of avatars things that I can
just drop in into place during the live
stream because I don't want to be
fussing with gathering assets right
that's not necessarily a design it's
more of like a organizational chore so
yeah so I'm just gonna be going and
gathering assets and then I'm just gonna
go to bed it's almost midnight right now
and I have to get up early and walk
to the train so I can get to the studio
on time and so forth it's morning and
I'm almost at the train station and
walking again well I was walking to the
train this morning I was thinking to
myself I don't remember walking
yesterday to the train although I know
for a fact that I did it I mean I
remember riding the train I remember
traveling on foot to the train I was
thinking why can't I remember it was it
this dark you know I'm surprised at how
dark it was when I woke up this morning
pitch-black
then I realized why I couldn't remember
and the reason is because yesterday I
was so wrapped up in the presentation
that I was about to give it a dhobi and
I was reciting it going over in my mind
playing out the scenarios that I didn't
that it didn't even realize that I was
traveling right so that's where my my
mind was yesterday just like that he'd
go on a 40-minute walk and not even
realize it
back at the Adobe offices okay I'm
there's a truck here I wonder if you're
gonna go
yeah Chuck's gonna go you're gonna go
okay
